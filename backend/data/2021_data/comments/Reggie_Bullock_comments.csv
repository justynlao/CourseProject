"**u/dynamo3g Knicks Post-Game Thread #3**  Elfrid needs to never start ever again. Ever. I'm so sick of Quickley coming into games down by 10 and then having to fight back.   Randle had a bad turnover at the end but he's an all star for us and everyone makes mistakes.   Austin Rivers is fucking GARBAGE. Please get him out of the rotation until he proves he's hot again. He cost us so many points.   Get Reggie Bullock out of the starting lineup too, man... 3 and D players that don't hit 3s and don't play defense are useless. I'd rather have Burks there.   We really needed that win man, fuck. Hornets win so we're out of the playoffs by a bit. Hopefully Thibs finally decides to shake up the rotations."
"Last season? Hell we still aren't doing him any favors. Our starting lineup has 3 other non-shooters in it. Hopefully IQ can develop consistency and earn Thib's trust, because just having Reggie Bullock or Alec Burks out there with Randle, Mitch, and Elf is the worst possible situation for RJ."
Knicks aren't getting much production from the 3.  Reggie bullock was supposed to be that guy but TBH he has like 5 bad shooting games for every one. Burks was out best in the begging but missed a bunch of gamed because of the ankle. Hopefully he shakes off the rust and can help us out. Our PG payton has one of the worst shots in the league. We are literally just 4 3points made a game away from being competitive every night.  It might seem like a alot until you see our shooting % üòÖ
"Imagine letting Reggie Bullock drop 12 points in 11 mins, he do be the second coming of Jordan though"
"If Reggie Bullock and Knox find their stroke (which definitely doesn't seem like too much to ask for, Knox looks like he's beginning to figure things out), the offense could definitely find its groove. Especially since every defense just seems to double Randle and crowd the paint against you guys."
"I love a lotta the random guys Idk  Tolly from his half a season as a Warrior was my dude, my first ""favorite player"" from when I first started learning rosters in more depth. I was a huge Monta fan so the first few years of Steph I spent pouting until it became impossible to doubt or dislike him. Love Steph and obviously Klay too now  JJ Barea and Reggie Bullock are probably my other favorites. Just always been drawn to players who seemed fun and somewhat unique - the MVP halos around guys like KD just aren't that fun for me, id much rather pull for a 7th man who once shut down LeBron in the finals or a bench wing with really cool LGBT outreach"
"Julius Randle, Elfrid Payton, Austin rivers and Reggie Bullock"
Reggie bullock and Dennis smith
Laughs in Reggie bullock and Elfrid Payton
Meanwhile Reggie Bullock is proving that Elfrid Payton Hair is contagious even when asymptomatic
REGGIE BASQUIAT BULLOCK
Reggie the jester bullock
trade us Donovan Mitchell and we‚Äôll consider giving y‚Äôall Reggie Bullock
My roomate swears to god Reggie Bullock is what Redd would be in todays league and that Justin Holiday is a current day KMart...
"We‚Äôre 7 games in where most guys have crazy inflated stats and he‚Äôs still averaging almost identical PPG all of the last 3 years, including when he played alongside Anthony Davis and averaged 21 a game in the same lineup as Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. He‚Äôs now averaging 22 with RJ Barrett and Reggie Bullock. This is who he is and why the Knicks paid him. Miles different is when DLo jumped 6 PPG including a few 40 point showings. I know Knicks fans are dying to make that leap and become attractive again, but if it‚Äôs going to happen it has to be RJ and not Randle who does that, plain and simple."
Bold words from the dudes who lost to Reggie Bullock
Reggie Bullock starts for us and I don‚Äôt even know how he‚Äôs in the league
Reggie Bullock haha
the full reggie bullock experience
Reggie Bullock what the fuck is wrong with you
This is how I feel about Reggie Bullock  Like yes hes a volume shooter with acceptable percentages but even when Damny Green is hated by the entire Lakers fanbase you can‚Äôt leave him open while Bullock its really a if hes feeling a 3 or not
"Reggie bullock has started for the Knicks all season, and I feel like you said he was a deep bench guy"
"Not necessarily, but in some ways yeah.  Trading guarantees you a guy, with buyouts you can get left with nothing and no way to fill the spot if the deadline passes. Also, buyout guys typically aren‚Äôt notable contributors most years (Drummond will be a notable exception if he gets bought out, not sure if Griffin is gonna move any needles at this point in his career).  If anything, I think they make trades for deep bench guys way less likely. Why trade a 2nd for a Glenn Robinson / Reggie Bullock type when you might be able to grab Wayne Ellington for free? It also does lead to some contenders not spending their MLE in the offseason so they can offer it to the best of the buyout candidates."
"OH MY GOD ITS LEON ROSE AND TOM THIBODEAU! WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING HERE???? THEY WNAT LONZO TOO, ITS REGGIE BULLOCK AND KEVIN KNOX ALONG WITH THEM !"
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
Refs redrew the baseline to prevent the GOAT Reggie Bullock from getting the three
Brogdon is better than literally everyone on our team that isn‚Äôt Randle. Turner holds out Centers dead to rights. I‚Äôd kill for one of the Holidays over Reggie fucking Bullock.
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday‚Äôs game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it‚Äôs been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks ‚Äî Reggie Bullock ‚Äî RJ Barrett ‚Äî Julius Randle ‚Äî Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
"It would help but our bench lineup would be the worst offensive unit ever. 4 players that can‚Äôt shoot, one average shooter, a center who can‚Äôt score inside, shoot threes or even hit free throws (taj Gibson is our backup cuz Mitch is out) I think what we would benifit most from pulling together a trade that gets us a nice catch and shooter for our team to replace reggie bullock"
"Legit our whole starting 5 got hit with bad injuries. Also trading for Muscala was a terrible move, and Reggie Bullock got hit with the Lakers curse of missing 3‚Äôs"
reggie bullock
"Are we going to act like a guy playing with Elfrid Payton, Rj Barrett  and Reggie Bullock is playing with stars? Not  sure Randle‚Äôs healthy is that much better than bam‚Äôs injured if it even is. Dude  is surrounded by inefficient non shooters. There are like 2 guys on the team besides him capable of hitting a 3 consistently."
"Reggie Bullock is out there because he can shoot and doesn't need the ball. The Knicks are already dead last in 3PA, largely because Payton/RJ/Mitch aren't good shooters. Obi is a mediocre shooter and needs the ball a lot, and it doesn't make sense to hamstring RJ/Randle by taking the ball out of their hands. On top of all that, he'd get eaten alive at the 3; he doesn't nearly have the speed or quickness to get separation against those guys on offense or hang with them on defense."
Can he not play 3 and move RJ to two? Wouldn‚Äôt the organization rather see what Obi has as opposed to fucking Reggie Bullock?
Say how would Reggie bullock fit on this team? He‚Äôs a solid defender and a streaky shooter.  He wouldn‚Äôt fix all the problems but he could be a stop gap IMO
"Reggie Bullock not that bad, but I get your point"
"First off, Wilson Chandler wasn‚Äôt on the Nets when they made their 2019 playoff run. He signed the next season. And DeMarre Carroll was acquired by trade, not FA signing. But I‚Äôm sure that Carroll‚Äôs playing 25 minutes a night and putting up 11 and 5 was the key to the Nets making the playoffs. Good to see you doing your own research.  You‚Äôre the type of Knicks fan that will eagerly lap up whatever bullshit song-and-dance that MSG will feed you and beg for seconds. You think Wally is cool because he has nice suits and ‚Äútells it like it is.‚Äù Keep dreaming.  You don‚Äôt have the independent thought capability to consider why Quickley has to ‚Äúearn‚Äù all his minutes but Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock get a clean slate every night. You puff out your chest like you‚Äôre a Real Fan Who Watches All the Games but if you paid attention to the latest MSG postgame show, you‚Äôd have heard Alan Hahn say that the Knicks were only mathematically 6th for a few hours because there were still two evening games left to play in the East. And you have the temerity to tell me this team is a real 6 seed.  Derrick Rose is averaging 4.2 assists a game and has a 2:1 AST:TO. His facilitation won‚Äôt add much. And he‚Äôs a career 30.5% free throw shooter so he won‚Äôt help the spacing that makes the offense 30th in the league. But maybe if you actually rubbed together a brain cell or two and looked up basketball reference once in a while you‚Äôd know that.  Now give me my medal, kid."
But I wanted to see Reggie Bullock get revenge on the Lakers
Flashback of Reggie Bullock still haunts me to this day
The joke is that some dudes lose their shot when they go to the Lakers.  Markeiff Morris and Reggie Bullock were like 40% 3pt shooters with us and then dropped to 33% for them.
"you can't argue with these people, if the guy genuinely believes the timberwolves wouldn't have been comfortable with reggie bullock or alec burks taking the same contested stepback from 20ft then idk"
"Honestly he‚Äôs a value on his contract, idk how we could replace him unless we got a useful player + pick and hit on the pick.  If we can move Juancho and somehow get a player similar Duncan Robinson or Reggie Bullock instead we‚Äôd be doing well IMO"
Nets barely beat Reggie Bullock and the big five
"I'm sure no names like Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are beside themselves that all eyes are on Reggie fucking Bullock and Julius Randle."
Pressure on Harden and Kyrie to prove Reggie Bullock wrong? LOL!
"Indeed but I‚Äôd actually hate losing to the Small Dicks even more since we‚Äôre battling for playoff seeding with them, which is absolutely hilarious. We‚Äôre almost 3/4s through the season and Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown are looking up in the standings at Tommy Thibodeau, Julius Randle, and Reggie Bullock.   #BUCK FOSTON"
Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock
Well for *my team* is what the question is centered around. He have an all star power forward and we start Reggie bullock at the 3. It‚Äôs more of a fit thing.
"We didn‚Äôt deserve This win, duck Reggie bullock"
The real travesty here is that 2K has had Reggie Bullock with like D+ perimeter defense for like the last 5 years.
"&gt;It is, which is why he is lower in RAPTOR.  And lower in the others? RAPTOR seems to be about as effective at predicting value as all of those other stats I listed. Why are you just picking RAPTOR? I included RAPTOR even though Randle is higher because I didn't want to be dishonest, why did you ignore the others?  &gt; You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others   &gt;That the biggest part of his value? It's exactly what he brings to the table that Zion doesn't. Zion can't do that despite dominating the ball.   I meant to say Zion here not Randle. All of those things listed are things that Zion does   &gt;Wait so when you bring up advanced metrics to highlight Zions value that is all good, but the metrics lie when they highlight Randles value. That's pretty convenient.  Defensice metrics are one thing, overall impact metrics are another. The biggest downside of impact metrics are the defensive aspect, often with the defensive part just being overall impact minus estimated offensive impact   &gt;Basically all of the players can play defense, or rebound extremely well, or stretch the floor. Zion can do none of those things.   There are players in the league right now that can literally do just one of those things you listed. Zion is a multifaceted attacked and creator and he does so in a unique way    &gt;You are literally contradicting yourself here. Like you said Randle runs the offense, Zion absolutely doesn't, Zion receives the ball and then attacks, that is basically all he does. Which is why Randle has almost twice as many assists as Zion.   You don't watch the Pelicans very often do you? Do you think ""attacking"" and creating aren't running thr offence? Zion doesn't just wait for the ball then take a dribble and shoot? He's not Deandre Jordan   &gt;They win more games than the Pelicans so by that logic is worse.     What? I know they win more games, I'm saying the end of the court that Randle primarily brings value on, his team isn't actually that effective  &gt;Hypotheticals, hypotheticals, hypotheticals.  Yeah, and measurement of team quality. After 10 games do we say the team with the best record is the best team in the league? No, we can look and see that clearly there is a bigger picture to come    &gt;Randle isn't the winner because the Knicks won a handful more games. He is the winner because he is the more complete player who has taken a much worse team to a better record, while playing better in every area besides scoring. Pelicans is stock full of talent. Their entire starting lineup is full of young stars or capable NBA players like Adams, and yet they lose. The second best player on the knicks is an inefficient sophomore guard, the third best player is who? Some rookie? Reggie Bullock?  What has Randle actually taken them to? You're right, they have a deficit of talent, that's part of why they are 25th on offence. But you're giving him a lot of credit for wins that are won by his 4th ranked defence, a defence that's primarily produced by his teammates  There are countless examples of people doing this, giving credit for a defensice teams success to the teams best offensive player. The team looks like it lacks talent because it lacks offensive talent, so it looks like the best offensive player is carrying them, when in fact the other side of the court is doing the heavy liftkn"
"&gt; Why isn't this reflected in the advanced stats?   It is, which is why he is lower in RAPTOR.  &gt; You know that Randle doesn't just isolate and score or stand next to the rim or something? If that's what it was, then why wouldn't everyone do it? He is playing as a point-forward, where he initiates a lot of offence and makes plays for others   That the biggest part of his value? It's exactly what he brings to the table that Zion doesn't. Zion can't do that despite dominating the ball.   &gt; Defensive catch-all metrics are really poor at judging individual defensive impact, do you actually think that Randle is a top 40 defensive player in the NBA this year? That same metric also has Christian Wood as the 6th best defender in the league, Andre Drummond 16th, all ahead of players Adebayo and Giannis at 50th, and Simmons 53rd   Wait so when you bring up advanced metrics to highlight Zions value that is all good, but the metrics lie when they highlight Randles value. That's pretty convenient.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; This is just silly. There are players in the NBA who's entire job is to catch lobs or do a specific thing on defence. You think Zion, who is a playmaking freak athlete, with elite body control, and finishing who is capable of attacking in a variety of situations over or around a variety of defences is the most one dimensional player in the league   Basically all of the players can play defense, or rebound extremely well, or stretch the floor. Zion can do none of those things.   &gt; He also does so much less efficiently, I also don't believe he is such a better distributor. Zion initiates offence from the other baseline and creates off the dribble from beyond the arc more frequently and I believe with more ability than Randle   You are literally contradicting yourself here. Like you said Randle runs the offense, Zion absolutely doesn't, Zion receives the ball and then attacks, that is basically all he does. Which is why Randle has almost twice as many assists as Zion.   &gt; But it seems like the Knicks don't actually win many games because of the offence that he primarily runs   They win more games than the Pelicans so by that logic is worse.      &gt; This is also why 538 thinks that the Pelicans will actually win 1 more game than the Knicks by the end of the season. But yeah, Randle is a winner while Zion isn't because one of them has a handful more wins than the other   Hypotheticals, hypotheticals, hypotheticals.      Randle isn't the winner because the Knicks won a handful more games. He is the winner because he is the more complete player who has taken a much worse team to a better record, while playing better in every area besides scoring. Pelicans is stock full of talent. Their entire starting lineup is full of young stars or capable NBA players like Adams, and yet they lose. The second best player on the knicks is an inefficient sophomore guard, the third best player is who? Some rookie? Reggie Bullock?"
PG - RJ Barrett 6‚Äô6 SG - Reggie Bullock 6‚Äô6 SF - Julius Randle 6‚Äô8 PF - Nerlens Noel 6‚Äô10 C - Mitchell Robinson 7‚Äô0
Reggie Bullock was an NBA player. Doc just didn't know it.
"Per Knicks: Reggie Bullock and Julius Randle are available for tonight‚Äôs game against Miami.  Heat  no Oadipo (illness), Nunn (ankle), Haslem (protocols) or Okpala (protocols)."
"Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Bruce Brown, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Reggie Bullock are all in NY now"
"You‚Äôre really comparing Giannis, Middleton and Holiday to Randle, Robinson and Reggie fucking Bullock? Lol"
"Ingram, UNC legend PJ hairston, Reggie Bullock"
It was just a really weirdly officiated game. Super physical and they let them play which I appreciated but Randle absolutely should have been at the line on that Reggie Bullock OOB turnover.
Reggie bullock is only 30 and already has all kinds of old man strength
"This town of 20,000 people town yielded Brandon Ingram, Jerry Stackhouse, Mitchell Wiggins, Reggie Bullock, Cedrick Maxwell, and Dwight Clark (49er who made The Catch). That‚Äôs insane."
"Thibbs: ‚ÄúQuickley, we need you in the starting lineup!‚Äù  Reggie Bullock: ‚ÄúWho, me?‚Äù  Thibbs: ‚ÄúQuickley!‚Äù  Reggie: ‚ÄúOkay, okay! Let me get my sho-‚Äú  Thibbs: ‚ÄúI SAID QUICKLEY!‚Äù  Reggie: ‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù  Thibbs: ‚ÄúI MEANT EMMANUEL QUICKLEY!‚Äù  Quickley: ‚ÄúUm... what am I supposed to be doing quickly, Coach?‚Äù"
Why is Reggie Bullock turning into Steph Curry? I'll take it though
Reggie bullock has got to have the most challenged haircut in the history of sports
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
Yeah we're starting Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina.
"Ideal trade deadline is we ship off Elfrid Payton, Frank, and Reggie Bullock for picks/players and trade for Lonzo. No Oladipo plz"
LeBron would not have regained playoff mode without the 5 minute appearance of Reggie Bullock so I tend to agree.
"I mean, I thought we were gonna go off of NBA finals wins because who really cares if you lost (which the Celtics rarely have if you were wondering), but yeah, the IT for Kyrie was almost as bad as when the Pistons gave the Lakers Reggie Bullock for Svi which directly led to the Lakers winning the championship.   Wonder what the NBA would look like today if that never happened, the Pistons might have been contenders."
&gt;end reg   Pls don‚Äôt end Reggie bullock
"Just call him Reggie ""Klay Thompson"" Bullock please"
Scared of Reggie Bullock
Reggie bullock.
He's shooting 39.4% from 3 this season which is good but not great. That's not worth 16m a year when he provides little else. Reggie Bullock shoots 41% from 3 on similar volume to Bertans this season and is getting paid 4m.
Reggie Bullock for 8 million or Duncan for 20 million?
Favorite player : Clyde Frazier  My actual game: Reggie bullock 3 and D / Troy Williams   I‚Äôm a constant motion and at times out of control sniper which is good on basketball court. Would not be good during war.
"Cuz, they‚Äôre doing the best with what they got. They weren‚Äôt given superstars like Reggie Bullock and Elfrid Payton. They had to work hard and play for what they got. True underdog story if you ask me"
I would die for Reggie Bullock
Reggie Bullock revenge game!
The east runs through Reggie Bullock
YERRRRRRRRRR DERRICK ROSE AND REGGIE BULLOCK DELIVER WITH BURKS AND QUICKLEY OUT  Wizards please beat the Hawks we need some Bestbrook
Reggie Bullock revenge game!!
YERRRRRRRRRR DERRICK ROSE AND REGGIE BULLOCK DELIVER WITH BURKS AND QUICKLEY OUT   Wizards please beat the Hawks we need some Bestbrook
Reggie Bullock going for 45 minutes lol
Reggie bullock revenge game
"Thibs with the ""if he dies, he dies"" - approach to minutes played for Reggie Bullock. On pace for 43 minutes played. LMAO"
Reggie bullock jump stop is deadly and fundamental.
Reggie bullock riding the bench during lob city is a top 5 inexplicable thing doc has done
"reggie bullock took elfrid paytons hair, like when you swap the hair pieces on lego minifigures"
If Reggie Bullock and Nerlens Noel put their heads togther they could create one complete haircut
Reggie Bullock owns Bogi gimme the Knicks in 6
"How though.   When KG was making that much it was by far the best stretch in Timberwolves history.   That‚Äôs just the costs of having a dominant MVP at the time. Shaq was making just as much and coming off a 3 peat. The only difference is Shaq played in a location people wanted to go to, KG played in a place no one wanted to go to, while also losing 5 first round picks.   Imagine if Lebron went to LA and then they found out that LA was cap circumventing to sign Reggie Bullock causing them to lose all the picks they needed to get AD."
People will say Bullock and if his price tag is affordable that‚Äôs fine....but I‚Äôd be careful. Contract year guy who was not this at all his previous two seasons your goal is always to find the next Reggie Bullock not overpay to keep that role player once he exceeds expectations
Lol did you just quickly is in core ? He is not . He not even playin better then Reggie bullock drose or noel.
Rose is our sixth-man. Starting shooting guard is mostly RJ Barrett with Reggie Bullock starting at small forward. Burks and Quickley are our SGs off the bench.
Led by notorious snipers RJ Barrett and Julius Randle haha  Jk Reggie Bullock is the greatest shooter who ever lived
It was so good that Dapper has already crossed it off a list of potential moments. They've instead chosen to go with a Reggie Bullock rebound.
Pretty sure Reggie Bullock said it
"Can‚Äôt decide who has the worst hairstyle in the league, Reggie Bullock or Kyle Kuzma.   What y‚Äôall think? Lmao"
The problem is people are either good at the 3 and not good enough at the d or vice versa.  You also have scheme 3 and d players which honestly is half that list.  Those are players who are great shooters in a system that sets them up with wide open jumpers from favorable positions and guys who defensively only are good in a team scheme.  Reggie Bullock comes to mind.  I know that dude sucks on defense but you wouldn't know it this year with the Knicks who has him executing their scheme to perfection.
Lavine isn‚Äôt a FA but I imagine the spacing he brings would greatly help this Knicks team who‚Äôs only significant shooter in the starting lineup is Reggie Bullock outside of RJ who is inconsistent  Also Lavine and Randle are the same age so that‚Äôs nice
"I really like him still and have watched him a ton. I think of him as a good, young, prospect.  He's had 3 head coaches in 3 years as a Knick.  Literally everyone that played under Fizdale regressed and Knox was a 19 year old rookie 'project' that for some reason started every game and was featured in our offense.  His 2nd year was a nightmare wash with the KP trade fallout, Fiz firing, FO firing etc.  Under Thibs, he showed a lot of promise early as a perimeter shooter... he will be a career 40% 3pt shooter imo, but he couldn't stay on the floor as his defensive motor isn't great and we are in full win now mode.  Positionally he's competing with Reggie Bullock, our best perimeter defender, RJ, our franchise savior, and Randle, the league MVP.  If he was on a team like Thunder where winning wasn't the primary goal I think he'd see the court a lot and people would be more excited about him."
"Tbf Nerlens is only logging these minutes because Robinson is out, and Payton has been a burden more than anything. Fair call with Rose and Bullock but Rose was mainly brought in as a mentor to develop guards like IQ, who has started to become incredibly important to the team's performance. Not sure if Reggie will be here next year but to kind of add to your point, Burks has been enormous for this team and I'm certain we'll get him back next year"
Reggie Bullock
EJ was going in on Reggie Bullock today for absolutely no reason and it was hilarious
Give us Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram and then we‚Äôll give u Reggie Bullock and RJ Barrett for a season and let‚Äôs see who comes out on top
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they‚Äôd rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I‚Äôm not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion‚Äôs efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
2 triples in a row for Reggie Bullock
Where would y‚Äôall rank Reggie Bullock? He‚Äôs been great on ball as well this season
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
Don‚Äôt forget Reggie Bullock mans been balling this season looking like a textbook 3&amp;D player
"Fuck the process baby. Results are all that matter. Reality is that trades are always graded with hindsight. Go look at the reaction to the Nets getting Garnett/Pierce/Terry. People thought that was a good trade for them at the time and it is now considered the worst trade in NBA history.   The Knicks signed Randle, Bullock, and Marcus Morris with the cap space created by trading KP + THJ and Courtney Lee. Morris was flipped for the Clippers pick  which turned into Quickely who will make 1st team all rookie if the voters have a clue. Knicks also got Detroit‚Äôs 2nd rounder this year in that trade which will be a very early 2nd rounder. DSJ and Charlotte‚Äôs 2nd rounder (which will be in the mid 40s) was flipped for Derrick Rose who has improved the team substantially.  Gave up: KP + THJ contract + Courtney Lee contract + Trey Burke + 2021 2nd via Charlotte   Received: Julius Randle + Reggie Bullock + Immanuel Quickley + Derrick Rose + unprotected 2021 Dallas 1st + top 10 protected 2023 Dallas 1st + 2021 2nd via Detroit.  That‚Äôs what the trade ended up being for the Knicks. Massive, massive, W.  Fuck KP and more importantly fuck Mavs fans. Luka deserves better than KP but those shitheads don‚Äôt. Getting exactly what they deserved after how absurdly arrogant, condescending, and obnoxious they were about that trade."
Reggie Bullock ruined this man's career
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
He just had a drive and kick to Reggie bullock to send it to OT against the Pelicans. Only reason why he didn‚Äôt close last night is because he fouled out lmao
Julius ‚ÄúReggie Bullock‚Äù Randle

"&gt;a guy who a spotty handle, can‚Äôt finish inside, and has a knack for getting injured. No thanks.  &gt;Thad Young, Markannen, Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks."
&gt; possibly Lonzo for   &gt;a couple of 3&amp;D guys.  So just keep Lonzo...  &gt;I love the idea of Zo to Chicago for Thad Young and Markannen or to New York for Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks.  Jesus none of them play defense.
"What? No he‚Äôs not lol  If Zion and Ingram refuse to buckle in on the defensive end of the floor, then it won‚Äôt matter who builds the team or coaches it cause we‚Äôll never go anywhere. Zion‚Äôs improved a lot, Ingram though....  I expect Griff to be super aggressive this offseason. I don‚Äôt think he envisioned Zion being THIS good THIS fast.   I think we‚Äôll move Bledsoe and possibly Lonzo for a couple of 3&amp;D guys.   I love the idea of Zo to Chicago for Thad Young and Markannen or to New York for Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks."
"Attach pick to Bledsoe or if we can‚Äôt move him, relegate him strictly to come off the bench.   Personally I am a fan of S&amp;Ting Zo to Chicago for something around Thad Young, Markannen and Arcidiacano (not all three just a combination of them) or to New York for Alex Burks and Reggie Bullock.   If Portland changes a lot up this offseason then Lonzo maybe for Powell in a double S&amp;T and/or DJJ."
"Probably Nerlens Noel, Reggie Bullock, and Derrick Rose. KEEP THIS SQUAD"
"Shout out to Reggie Bullock and Taj Gibson. No headlines, no ego, just really solid players I'm proud to have on my team.   For the first time as a Knick fan we are good and it seems sustainable. There are obvious areas for improvement, but my god the base we're improving from has been raised exponentially.   As a Brit living in Australia, I'm proud to YERRRRRR today."
"Tbh if Tatum gets all NBA and not randle , we should fucking riot , the Knicks literally got 31-27 with Reggie bullock as their 3rd best player"

"It's so nice to see past Detroit players doing so well. Bullock, Bruce Brown, Reggie Jackson, The Nard Dog, Blake Superior, Morris Bros, D Rose, KCP, Bobi, Svi, etc etc"
"KAT is way more talented there‚Äôs no doubt. But the fact that you say ‚Äúworse surrounding cast‚Äù gives you away. The Knicks roster is a joke. They start Elf Payton, Reggie Bullock, Nerlons Noel, and RJ Barrett. But Randle‚Äôs playmaking makes them better. KAT hasn‚Äôt shown he can make crappy teams better yet"
"&gt; Eric Bledsoe admits in postgame that he was supposed to foul Derrick Rose on Knicks final offensive possession in regulation -- before Lonzo Ball whiffed on his assignment in staying adhered to Reggie Bullock.  This probably implies that Bledsoe was told by SVG to foul, so they didn‚Äôt foul and they closed out on a layup to let up an open 3 to the Knicks best shooter"
Reggie Bullock in the clutch
Reggie Bullock and Nerlens Noel have been very solid for us and they are on cheap deals
Shout to Reggie Bullock too he's been great recently
Lmfao reggie bullock was stanning sixers on twitter all game
Reggie Bullock is more valuable to a team than Drummond
Throw Reggie bullock in there as well
"It's a little different when you're not seeing Reggie Bullock and 2019-20 Julius Randle, isn't it Hawks?"
"Well.   As it turns out, much to the surprise of everyone on r/NBA, there are like five players on the Sixers‚Äô bench more effective than playing Reggie Bullock, Rose and Alec Burks 35+ minutes a game."
Lmaoo. You right tho. Simmons is quite the level up from Reggie Bullock.
"This is over. Kwahi got everyone open looks.   Trade idea:  PG13 for Immanuel Quickly, Obi Toppin, a pick, Reggie Bullock.  Clips ditch pg13, get more shooters and a top pick."
Now they're saying it was Reggie Bullock
"Ima hawks fan too, I‚Äôm convinced Danny green is just light skin Reggie bullock"
"Obviously not. The roster would've been Lebron, Rondo, and Kuzma with no bench depth, missing 2-3 starters and Reggie Bullock failing to hit the side of the barn. Missing the playoffs was a blessing, but the Zubac trade was still shit"
"In 2017-18, the Pistons were 27-18 when Reggie was healthy and 12-25 during a rather long stretch when he was injured. They were 4-12 in the games between Reggie getting injured and trading for Blake.  Drummond was putting up 16 rebounds per game. Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver were 2nd and 7th in the league in 3 point percentage, respectively. Luke Kennard looked like a promising role player as a rookie.  Ish Smith was good off the bench but far from ideal as a starter. And Dwight Buycks always had good energy off the bench but he just wasn't that good - he hadn't played in the NBA for nearly three years when he became our primary backup PG and he hasn't played in the NBA since. That gap at point hurt us A LOT.  I still think that team would've been good had they been able to stay healthy. Nothing spectacular but at least win a playoff series. That was my sixth straight season going to at least 10 games and definitely the most fun that I had. Blake did outstanding the next year but I also felt like they focused on going iso with him way too much and made Jackson's role almost feel irrelevant. I think a lot of it though had to do with a relatively new owner in Gores (total douche, for the record), who had just moved the team from Auburn Hills to Detroit, being more focused on the image and appeal of getting a superstar like Blake on the team.  Overly long response, but once I got going it just flowed."
"Who outperformed expectations more though? Knicks were ranked as the worst team in the league, Suns were still being ranked as a playoff team. On paper, Suns are unbelievably better than the Knicks, it's not even close. Our third most played player this year was Reggie Bullock.   I'm not saying Monty isn't a good coach or didn't also deserve the award, but I would take Thibs and I don't understand why people in this thread are pretending like that's a robbery. I think it could go either way"
That's 41% 3pt shooter reggie bullock to you sir!
Yeah you swap Thibs for a league average coach and New York is a 12 seed.  You swap out Monty or Quin and their teams might only drop marginally down the standings.  Knicks are absolute ass their third player in minutes this year was Reggie Bullock lol.
"The Knicks were also a good team defense kind of team but they lacked the ball stopping defenders that you can leave one on one versus the opposing teams best guy. They tried to leave Reggie Bullock one on one vs Trae and let's just say that didn't go too well. Philly at least has 2 true lockdown defenders.  I'm interested to watch Ben this series on offense because it seemed like when he was playing aggressive in the second half, he could get to the bucket at will. Although DeAndre Hunter didn't play, but still. Ben seems to get very passive on offense for stretches, but when he's aggressively looking for his own shots at the rim, he seems pretty unstoppable."
theres a bit of a difference between being guarded by Reggie Bullock and Kawhi Leonard imo
"Are the Sixers going to be relying on Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks and Rose to play and defend 30-40 minutes per game each?"
"Yeah. The Hawks are going to realize pretty quickly the Sixers aren‚Äôt relying on Reggie Bullock, Rose and Alec Burks to play 30-40 minutes each."
Reggie Bullock was a different man before he met Trae Young
Trae gonna learn that Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle is a lot different than Reggie Bullock
No bias. The 6ers are much better suited to stop the trae young high pnr than the knicks. Trae goes from getting guarded by reggie bullock or whoever on the switch to defenders like George Hill Danny Green Matise Thybulle Ben Simmons and Tobias harris.   Hawks have the size to match the 6ers but not the talent on defense to out play the 6ers offense.
They also don‚Äôt have the level of offense the clippers do. Asking Reggie Bullock or Elfrid Peyton to get through the screen is different than asking Kawhi and PG to do it. You don‚Äôt need Bullock or Peyton to do anything on offense when the team runs through Randle but you do need Kawhi and PG to have energy in the tank to still be effective on offense
Dang that was hard to hear. I am a huge Bullock fan and never knew about this. Condolences to Reggie and what a mountain to have to climb daily
I thought someone wanted to mention their sisters‚Äô names near Reggie Bullock
"&gt;I will never forget the look on Mia‚Äôs face when they called my name. I‚Äôll never forget it. Reggie Bullock. Just knowing what I was going to be able to do for our family now, I just looked at her, and I could see on her face that pride.   &gt;She had a big smile.  &gt;A big smile.  &gt;Memories like that, you can‚Äôt take them away. They live forever.  :( this is so sad"
I misread the title and thought his sisters‚Äô names were also Reggie Bullock
Giannis and Reggie Bullock  I thought Reggie was the same batch as Steph
"I agree with you entirely. I‚Äôm just saying people always overvalue the bottom seeds.   The Knicks were the benefactors of not getting hurt. They were a fake 4 seed. The Hornets died. You died. Toronto didn‚Äôt care. Pacers died.   Their roster kind of sucks. They‚Äôre starting Reggie Bullock and relying on Burks for fucks sake lol. They just stayed healthy.   But the reality is Embiid is day to day, and even if he does miss a game or two, we were the 1 seed for a reason despite Embiid missing significant time and others due to Covid.  Sixers in 5-6 with or without Embiid."
aight well in that case reggie bullock got thicc squat logs on his head. julius randle is neckless. *checks your team* heat got a team full of nickalodeon rejects and trae young is handsome
"If Reggie Bullock can have that hairdo where he has 3 foot long glizzys hanging off his head, free the turbans"
Reggie bullock is the new jrue holiday
"Trae was doubled by Julius and Reggie Bullock for most of the series, so it's not like he was beating Rose off the dribble every game or something. The Knicks have good defenders up and down the lineup and off the bench. You'd be right to say that Ben Simmons is a better guard defender than anybody on the Knicks though.  I wish there weren't so many injuries both ways during their regular season matchups, but in the one game Trae played against Simmons he put up 32 so we'll see. It doesn't matter how good Ben Simmons is, if they think they can stop Trae with Ben alone, they're going to get unpleasantly surprised."
Michael Jordan did it against Ewing and Starks. Trae Young did it against Julius Randle and Reggie Bullock lmao
Idk why Reggie bullock being there matters either. Shouldn‚Äôt have gave him so much space
@ Reggie Bullock
We literally had Bullock guarding him all series. Not that Reggie is a bad defender but obviously a matchup I would be looking to exploit if I were the Hawks &amp; we saw it. Couldn‚Äôt stay in front of him &amp; was killing us with his floaters.
"King of the lower seeds!   He beat a starting lineup of Taj Gibson, 2011 MVP Rose, &amp; Reggie Bullock. How this Knicks team got top 4 seed after the betting over/under was 22 wins, I still don't know. I believe that's more an impediment to everyone in the East not the Nets, Philly &amp; Bucks but I'm prob just salty"
Reggie Bullock joining every fracas after it got broken up is an example of ‚Äúfake tough guy‚Äù.
I thought the title said Reggie Bullock lmao  Still wouldn‚Äôt be that shocking if it were true
reggie bullock is a fraud
"Reggie bullock, taj Gibson"
Be careful talking trash Trae . Reggie bullock might do a light jog right at you
reggie bullock looks like he has 3 dicks on top of his head LMAO
Sandy Bullock &gt; Reggie Bullock
You can‚Äôt win with Reggie bullock being your second best scorer
Reggie Bullock and Trae need to have a hairstyle battle. One on one. I'd pay to watch
How do people take Reggie Bullock seriously with that hair
The idea of making fun of Trae's hair when Reggie Bullock is on your team is wild to me.
nice to see that a large reason this isn't a larger lead for us is because we're allowing the definition of average reggie bullock to go insane
Reggie Bullock is single handedly keeping the Knick in this game
"Reggie Bullock is the ultimate ""we'll be fine he's not going to keep shooting like this"" player"
**Trae Young Vs. Reggie Bullock** : *The battle of the questionable haircuts*
Lakers legend Reggie Bullock is poppin off
Reggie Bullock has hands down the worst hair in the league right?
"Reggie ""Damian Lillard"" Bullock"
"Reggie ""We've got a big 5"" Bullock"
Reggie Bullock plays on the Knicks...
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"Lol I‚Äôm old enough to understand that you don‚Äôt understand what whataboutism is.   &gt; Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position **by charging them with hypocrisy** without directly refuting or disproving their argument.  My comment lacked an assertion of hypocrisy and I wasn‚Äôt avoiding the point. The objective was to illustrate that this wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident.   With respect to your ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù not being a justification, that‚Äôs a bullshit cop out. Your ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù is literally [a copy/paste of the excuse Randle gave to justify his foul on Gallo in his postgame presser](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2021/05/julius-randle-flagrant-danilo-gallinari-hawks-reggie-bullock-knicks-game-4/amp).  [Gallo barely shoved Bullock in the paint](https://twitter.com/MikeVorkunov/status/1399117123516088327?s=20). That shit was soft as fuck and literally happens every possession."
"Obviously Reggie Bullock would murder me without breaking a sweat, but it's hard to take a guy seriously when he's squaring up with that hair flopping around lmao"
"Randle has done a lot more than just that flagrant though. Outside of all the yapping he has been doing, he [punched Bogi in the face](https://streamable.com/mzb46i) and gave Collins a dirty elbow in game 4 [(unfortunately, I can't find a clip of the elbow, but I saw the replay live and it was clearly intentional).](https://twitter.com/espn/status/1399076655742603265)   Randle has a history of doing this, [even to Collins during his rookie season while Randle was with the Lakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OmMU2g9T0o). Randle has been frustrated, talking a lot of shit, and been playing really dirty [along with Noel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM_jts8RmnY) and Reggie Bullock.   None of the Hawks players have reputations for getting into it with the other teams. Trae Young might showboat after a 3, but that's about as far as it goes. The Knicks are clearly the ones who brought it to this level, and that's fine. It's fun basketball."
"It was a really weak foul, I don't know why Reggie Bullock got so upset. Chuck was saying the same thing, it didn't even look like a hard foul, he was just boxing out. It probably has something to do with his 34 minute, 0 point performance, it was just frustrations boiling over.   Reggie and Randle have been dumb and dumber all series long with the trash talk, flagrant fouls, and poor play. They're mentally boomed, Rose is fed up with it too"
"Capela definitely wasn't talking about Rose. I think everyone has nothing but respect for Rose. But Reggie Bullock, Randle, and Taj have been talking shit and flagrant fouling people the entire series, and it has only gotten worse the more the Hawks pull ahead.   When Randle flagrant fouled Gallinari down something like 20 points with 3 minutes left in the game, and then Randle came back to the bench and gave Reggie Bullock the hi-five and a pat, Rose was looking like he was trying to burn a hole through the back of their heads. He has no patience for trash talk and petty shit on either side and I don't blame him."
You have absolutely no chance against Reggie Bullock lmfao. Stop lying to yourself
"Not comfortable but I legitimately don't think this series is over yet. Knicks in 7 still  Our weak link is Reggie Bullock, Randle has to step up but he's not a true weakness like Bullock has been"
"All of that trash talk from a franchise just because they beat a lottery projected team that starts 35 years old Taj Gibson and reggie bullock in the playoffs while you are paying Gallo 20M per year to come off the bench  Your team is not a conteding team, and if anything hawks are one of the very few franchises that has been as trash as the knicks the last 20 years.   Hawks fans gotta be some of the most toxic shits ive encoutered on here"
"This man said Randle was at least ""big and scary"" but not Bullock. He must be talking about Sandra cause Reggie is listed as 6'7."
"I'm a knicks fan, but they are trash right now. They are getting absolutely dominated in ever facet, including coaching. They should be embarrassed for how badly theyve played..but i have no problem with reggie talking shit on twitter, it wasnt even a big deal. none of  this is, even the gallo shit. It's just funny that randle and bullock are talking the most, and have done nothing. Rose hasnt said a word and is just trying to play ball."
"Unless prime rose makes Reggie Bullock and Julius Randle shoot better than 14/57 on open shots, I will still take the Hawks."
He's an extremely low usage role-player. Was anyone expecting Reggie Bullock to light it up in this series regardless of who guards him?
You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the knicks game.  That goes to Reggie Bullock
Anyone else remember the Reggie Jackson Reggie Bullock backcourt? God the Pistons have not gotten any easier to watch
Reggie Bullock can‚Äôt drive for fuck that‚Äôs why
Bullock really played like bullocks.   Reggie ‚ÄúBullocks‚Äù Bullock.
Philly actually has the pieces to defend them well on paper.  Trae would go from Reggie Bullock to Simmons and Thybulle.
They will. Knicks are not a bad team I never once said that. I only made a joke about Reggie Bullock and yes I think he's not worthy of being on the Knicks. That's all.
Yeah besides all that I just really think Reggie Bullock could be a solid role player for the Shanghai Sharks next season

Reggie Bullock was an afterthought role player at the end of the disappointing 2018 Lakers season why is this man talking like he has swag?
REGGIE BULLOCK HAS THREE FLOPPY DICKS ON TOP OF HIS HEAD
I always saw NYK as pretenders. You're starting Reggie Bullock and Taj Gibson or Noel &amp; you're relying on DRose to be your best player? Recipe for a FRE
Lmao Reggie Bullock immediately gets up from the bench to give Randle a high-five.
I love that Reggie bullock is the guy who is responding the most to Trae. Glad it‚Äôs not someone who is good at basketball lol
Future Rwanda Patriot Reggie Bullock needs to get ejected.
"Hawks have just a lot more talent its that simple. Trae Young is a future superstar. They are a deep squad. The Knicks are starting Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Reggie Bullock."
Trae is fucking filthy.   And Hawks have done a great job surrounding him with shooters and rim runners so you can't even really double which means guys like Reggie Bullock and Randle get left on an island with him which is....not good.
"Knicks got here by outhustling and overachieving with guys like Elfrid Payton starting, with our main center out, and with little to no depth. A carry job by RJ and Randle this season, then Rose helping out on that final run to close the season. The lack of depth is just a killer, but with the massive cap space this season it'd be nice to make some similar moves to the Hawks and grab good players the caliber of Bogi, Gallo, Capela, etc. We started Reggie Bullock, Elfrid Payton and Noel this season and those guys have a combined ZERO POINTS right now. We overachieved into a spot we're pretty much not ready for at all from a team building perspective, but I like the future outlook with more pieces and some actual depth."
"Reggie Bullock is straight up the problem with this team. Doesn't defend, doesn't attack Trae (who just guards him and watches him sit in the fucking corner and miss wide open 3s), doesn't rebound... ass fucking player"
Playing Reggie Bullock 25 of the first 32 minutes on purpose is certainly a strategy
Imagine your defensive strategy to stop Trae Young is putting Reggie Bullock on him lmao
Reggie Bullock you idiot.
Reggie Bullock fucking sucks man holy shit
Why does Reggie Bullock have corn dogs sticking out of his head?
I don‚Äôt get that though . Taj and Reggie bullock at the point in their career where they just play basketball and do very little talking . Trae young literally talking shit to them is lame af
Toppin is so thin he looks smaller than Reggie Bullock
What's the point of Reggie Bullock if he's not spamming 3's?
Trae is absolutely the wrong guy to piss off.  Reggie Bullock should have learned better by now.
"Knicks were like 29th on the power rankings before the season started . Yeah ppl are upset when their losing games in the playoffs but who the hell would be upset that their team which starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and nerlens noel would be in the playoffs yet alone host a series . Knicks fans are ecstatic about how this season went ."
So ... Reggie Bullock?  We could do a smaller portion of the MLE on Kris Dunn
We should just use some portion of our MLE on Reggie Bullock in Free Agency
get my boy Reggie Bullock on the team
"Since the Pels have the right to match any offer, say Chicago or New York really wanted Lonzo and they sign him to an offer sheet.   The Pels could match the offer, and make a deal with Chicago/New York that would send Lonzo to either team and get something in return (could be Colby White and/or Thad Young, Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks, etc.)"
By definition a point guard is someone who can handle the ball and pass. The difference between one or another is their scoring ability. In that regard he‚Äôs a Reggie Bullock
He‚Äôs the point guard version of a Reggie Bullock. Knicks should look elsewhere
"It wouldn‚Äôt be everything. It‚Äôd be all the young guys.   I used tradeNBA quick, and the Knicks would still have plenty of money to sign a guy like DeMar DeRozen and a bench big like Daniel Theis, before they re-sign their RFA‚Äôs (Rose, Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, and Alec Burks).   A starting lineup of:   Dame, Reggie Bullock, DeRozen, Randle, and Noel.   With a bench of:  Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Daniel Theis  Isn‚Äôt horrible. Dame, DeRozen, Randle, and Rose can all score and the rest of guys can create a pretty strong defense. Of course, the Knicks would have to have a good free agency, but getting Dame would probably help convince guys like DeRozen to sign."
"Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel"
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn‚Äôt be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That‚Äôd leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I‚Äôd rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E‚ÄôTwaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"Should bring in someone who can defend and they'll honestly be better for it. Go see what KCP is doing or something, maybe Reggie Bullock."
That's a nice thought but completely dismisses how good Klay is when he's hot.  What you said accurately describes every 3P shooter in the league from Reggie Bullock to Joe Harris.  The level Klay plays at in some games is unreachable by any of those guys.
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
One of the few pelicans games I caught this year was when he left Reggie Bullock in the corner to stop D Rose‚Äôs drive when we were down 3 with 5 seconds left lmao
"Kidd: Ja Morant (Obviously J Kidd didn't have the athleticism, but pace and poor shooting) Kmart: Jon Collins Van Horn: Kelly O Kittles: Reggie Bullock RJ: Mikal Bridges MaCCullough: Alex Len"
"This sub and its revisionist history. Tell me how many dudes Thibs was playing 40 MPG, or close to it. You'll find Randle at 37.6 and Barrett at 35. And then you have Reggie Bullock next highest at 30. Reggie Bullock received the third most minutes on that team and they got the 4th seed in the East. Tell me how many coaches could manage to do what Thibs did with that roster, even in the weaker East.  Monty would have been a definitely worthy selection as well, but it's absurd to say the Knicks sucked and Thibs didn't deserve it."
"It's crazy because at times Middleton looks like Durant-lite with his in-your-face threes, turnaround fades, and iso play that can carry the team for a quarter or so...and other times he looks like a bench player who you're begging to stop shooting. It's got to be so frustrating to not know what you're getting game to game.  Jrue has been really good with Giannis in the PnR and is a disruptive defender, but he's never been a reliable scorer. They just need a Monte Morris/Satoranksy type playmaker and one more Danny Green/Reggie Bullock/Duncan Robinson shooter to kick out to, but idk if they can get it the next season or two."

"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
"Caron Butler, Matt Barnes, Luc Mba Moute, Danny Granger, Reggie Bullock, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson. Who was their missing piece in my opinion? Joe Ingles who they had and cut from the team without even touching the floor."
"I am worried about the Knicks ruining their new team culture by trading guys away to try to get a star, especially one that doesn't fit perfectly, but a big sore spot for the Knicks was having only 2 guys trusted to guard small forwards (RJ and Reggie Bullock), and they were 2 of the only guys who would be trusted in the clutch to guard shooting guards. I don't want RJ to play 46+ minutes in back to back games ever again unless its conference finals or finals and overtime both times. I would be ok with the Knicks trading for Ben Simmons if they don't have to give up Randle, RJ, Reggie Bullock, or Immanuel Quickley. I think losing Derrick Rose would be unavoidable, he seems like the only one outside of those players the Sixers would actually want. If we get Alec Burks back, RJ keeps improving his 3pt shot, and Randle keeps shooting like a god, it might not be terrible spacing, at least not worse than with Frank Ntilikina (yes I know he shot like 40% from 3 this year but a lot of them were uncontested corner 3s in garbage time) or Elfrid Payton (as long as we forget the first 5 games of the season where he looked like discount MVP Westbrook)."
"Trae‚Äôs a better defender this season than last season but he still isn‚Äôt good at it nor will he ever be due to his size. He has good defensive metrics vs the Knicks, and was a slight negative vs the 76ers because we could hide him on players who couldn‚Äôt create.   I think definite scheme and team defense is normally more important than 1 on 1 defense, 1 on 1 defense will only cost a team if there are multiple players who are bad at it. Unfortunately, the hawks roster is a collection of bad defenders and Clint capela. (Hunter, reddish and Huerter are good defenders but 2 of them are hurt).   The hawks hide trae on Reggie bullock, Kortmaz, and PJ Tucker. It works for the most part. The problem is that Bogi, Collins, Lou, and Gallo are all god awful defenders and Middleton hunted Bogi in the 4th while McMillan had Huerter or best perimeter defender available on the sideline."
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
"Our team wasn‚Äôt even supposed to make the playoffs, we had Elfrid Payton and Reggie bullock starting for us. We overachieved. You guys had 3 Hof in their prime"
I‚Äôd like him on the Knicks but in all honest I‚Äôm just not sure if he‚Äôs better than Reggie Bullock at this stage of his career
Reggie Bullock must have Michael Jordan potential if he's managed to survive that doghouse and still carve out a role in the NBA
Didn‚Äôt the lakers have Reggie bullock like 2 years ago?
Nah Ben and thybulle are gonna put him in a box with handcuffs.   Also Reggie bullock
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
Hoping we can land Otto Porter/Reggie Bullock/Mo Harkless alongside Nic Batum in free agency. Should be able to land a good wing like Duarte or Boston Jr. with our draft pick.
"Mitch Robinson, who was our starting center and anchored our defense, missed almost the entire year. Since when has fucking Nerlens Noel guaranteed a top 10 defense? Dude could barely find a contract before Thibs made him look great in our system. Also for as much as Randle has improved as a player himself, his ability to pass and make smart plays out of double teams to truly be the #1 this year needs to be credited to coaching too  Thibs took a roster whose best defenders were like Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock maybe and made them a top 3 defense"
"Yep.  Doc was an incredibly poor scout for talent in FA and terrible at drafting players.  We sorely needed a good wing and we proceeded to use MLE on Spencer Hawes then draft CJ Wilcox, Brice Johnson, and Reggie Bullock (who would have been solid, but was poorly developed until he became a piston).  Dudley played through injury and then was scapegoated and salary dumped for literally nothing.  For all of his failures and shortcomings as the Clippers coach, he was substantially worse as a GM."
"Honestly makes you wonder how many potentially promising careers Doc has ruined throughout his coaching tenure. Another good example is Reggie Bullock, dude was almost out of the league because Doc didn‚Äôt use him and now he‚Äôs a solid role player"
Reggie Bullock.  Shoots off screens and puts in effort on D.
"You‚Äôre not Lying. Right now. Luka and THJ are the only consistent ones. Until KP stays healthy,  he‚Äôs just a name. But I do like the signing of Reggie Bullock."
"We got Reggie Bullock, Sterling brown and re signed Timmy to four years. It ain‚Äôt much but I think we‚Äôll be about as good as last year unless KP can show up for real"
"Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Robinson are top defenders at their position. Reggie Bullock was a solid defender last year, Elfrid payton (despite being garbage) is a decent defender, RJ is coming to his own on defense. Miles McBride looks like he has the tools to be a great defender."
QDot's distinguishing quality is his defense  I kinda like the better Reggie Bullock comp
"Trae shoots 35% from 3. Whenever Trae got past Simmons in the PnR [(Simmons was literally useless at defending the PnR, Trae abused him)](https://youtu.be/hfueWbkNMV8) it was a floater or pass to the roller and Embiid was stuck defending both. NBA keeps match up stats, [Simmons did nothing special compared to anyone other than Reggie Bullock.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629027/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Matchup=Offense&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*). 192 pts on 140 possessions is gross, Trae and the Hawks had a 137 ORTG when Simmons was guarding...."
"Defensively he would easily improve us for sure, I mean he and Reggie Bullock together would be the best perimeter defense we‚Äôve had since the championship team by a mile   Not being able to shoot wouldn‚Äôt be great, but he could be that secondary creator we need all the same.   He wouldn‚Äôt really improve any of our strengths, but he would counter a LOT of our weaknesses basically. Not like we have assets for that though anyways"
"Sleeping on that Reggie Bullock addition, I see"
"Idk if Reggie Bullock is too good for what you‚Äôre looking for, but he should get all the open looks he can handle next to Luka."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Lool Mavs aren‚Äôt making a jump like that 2018 Rockets team lol.  Adding CP3 and Tucker helped that Rockets team. Mavs added Reggie Bullock
"The Mavs don‚Äôt have a CP3 to run their offense when Luka is on the bench. Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown are good signings, but that doesn‚Äôt move the needle enough for them to get anywhere close to the 2018 Rockets."
I think you are severely underrating the addition of those two players especially when you consider who they are replacing. Kemba Walker is replacing Elfrid fucking Payton who was easily the worst starter on a playoff team last year. Drose coming on to the starting lineup ended up scrambling our second unit and making them really ineffective. Trae Young was able to hide and rest on defense because Reggie Bullock can‚Äôt dribble. You saw what he did on a 2-1 fast break in that series smfh. Replacing him with Fournier means the Trae has no where to hide. I would agree with you that our rookies aren‚Äôt going to have a big impact unless one of them really break out and Thibs gives them big mins. RJ is really the swing factor. If he has the 3rd year star wing leap then we would be in great shape. And finally we have Mitchell Robinson. He is the biggest defensive and even offensive piece we missed last year. He is one of the best if not the best lob catcher in the league which would force Capela to not shade Randle whenever he has the ball. Mitch is also one of the best rebounders in the league. His overall rebounding numbers don‚Äôt show it on the surface but he led the league in box outs and the Knicks were the best rebounding team in the league when he was healthy. All this to say that it will be a far more interesting series if we play next year and I hope it happens.
"Yeah! That's pretty much my recollection of it as well, it made for some nice images with the sunset and whatnot but no much of a basketball game.  What I had forgotten however, looking back at the box score for the game after posting my comment, is how many talented dudes this UNC team had. Harrison Barnes, Tyler Zeller, John Henson, Reggie Bullock, Kendall Marshall and J.M McDoo all have had some time in the NBA."
"What does this mean exactly? Most players? Like a decent rotation guy, like say, Reggie Bullock?"
&gt; counting on reggie bullock to be consistent  &gt; counting on krismickeytaps porzinmickey to not be made of glass in the playoffs
but is this enough to beat a mavericks team with reggie bullock and krismickeytaps porzingmickey actually showing up?
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."
"They started with a record of 17-20 and after the Derrick Rose trade went 24-11 which is equivalent to 56 wins over an 82 game season. Their final record of 41-31 is equivalent to 47-35, the swapping of Elfrid Payton (who I cannot stress enough as a complete negative on the court) and Reggie Bullock for Kemba and Fournier as well as the improvement in the young players and hopefully healthy Mitchell Robinson means 50 wins is a realistic expectation. Kemba may not perform like he used to but is a GINORMOUS upgrade over Elfrid Payton"
RJ Barrett will have the best career out of anyone from the 2019 draft.   He was the second best payer as a sophomore on a 4th seeded team that this offseason got significantly better by replacing Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. RJ himself has shown an incredible amount of progress and commitment to keeping that progress going.   Ja Morant‚Äôs Grizzlies will continue to be too good to get another high pick while also not being good enough to compete for a title. The Pelicans failed to make the play-in tournament twice and Zion will ultimately have his talents wasted there like AD and CP3
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"What I‚Äôm saying is that they were not terribly impressive in the regular season, Luka balling the fuck out wasn‚Äôt enough to drag them out of the first round, and there are so many questions about the talent surrounding him.   They‚Äôve done a whole bunch of ‚Äòalmost‚Äô but I don‚Äôt see the avenue for them to do any better than they have at this point.  KP is a huge question mark and you‚Äôre right, if he plays like the player everyone wants him to be but he never has been able to become then it looks good but this dude has averaged 42 games for the past 5 YEARS. He‚Äôs gonna be 26 and he hasn‚Äôt shown he can consistently get on the court beyond a coin flip, let alone produce once he‚Äôs out there.  You‚Äôre right they won 3 games in the first round when LAC didn‚Äôt know what to do with a gimmick offense with Boban, that was a great move by Carlisle. And like I said, Luka balls the fuck out. But we‚Äôve seen this roster‚Äôs ceiling and the only way they win is when Luka wins it for them, and that hasn‚Äôt been enough to get them out of the first round. You gotta win 3 more playoff series after that and I don‚Äôt think a team that hasn‚Äôt won a single series deserves this type of benefit of the doubt.   They don‚Äôt have a defense and their second best player on the other end is THJ. Reggie Bullock are you kidding me? These guys are the 10-15 range ‚Äúthanks for coming to the party, sorry you had to leave so early.‚Äù Most of these teams have shown much more, in addition to being more talented on paper. This is disrespectful."
"The Knicks were 4th worst in 3 point attempts. Reggie Bullock, attempted 6 3‚Äôs per game, was their leader in attempts and was a FA. They replaced him with Fournier who attempts the same number a game. They also signed Walker who attempts 8 per game. If they signed derozan they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten either of those 2 guys. They would be dead last by a mile in 3 point attempts with derozan and their offense was already bottom 8. Volume matters as much if not more than efficiency, it‚Äôs great that RJ and Randle shoot 40% but they combine for 4 makes a game, which is decent if the other 3 guys give you something too, but they play a traditional center so they desperately need shooting from the guard spots."
"Ok, then mediocre.   Don't Luka and KP still hate each other? What moves have the Mavs made other than 2 bench players Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown?  They are running out of decent FA's and only have a limited number of tradeable assets."
...how? All they added was Reggie Bullock
"He clearly is saying ‚ÄúWe signed Reggie Bullock, we already elite‚Äù."
So they added Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown and ‚Äúimproved considerably‚Äù?
"Re-signing THJ was our biggest move this offseason that people are just glossing over. I would say signing reggie bullock is exactly what you would call incremental improvement. We expect Brunson to get better, we're still a young team, and we still have tradeable contracts to get more play making. If we faced anyone but the clippers in the playoffs the lack of playmaking wouldnt have looked as bad, they are absolutely loaded on wing defenders. I like where we're at."
For real everyone kept saying the Pels had this disastrous offseason while letting the Mavs off the hook. They got 0 playmaking help for Luka and are basically running the same team back plus Reggie Bullock. That's probably a 1st/2nd round exit again unless they move Porzingis for something decent.
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
We got Reggie Bullock who is also a great defender and a much more consistent 3 point shooter. There's only so many 3 and D we need as we saw. We need someone who can score/playmake in different ways and legitimate defensive anchor type players.
"I think we should, unless the hangup is that he and Kidd don‚Äôt get along or something. We would have to do a sign and trade to make it work though.   He would give us that secondary ballhander though and him and Reggie Bullock as our perimeter defenders would be SO much better than what we‚Äôve been rolling out defensively in years."
That‚Äôs definetly not true about the Knicks lol what are you smoking? They have the same roster as last year but replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier
"We replaced Reggie bullock with Evan Fournier and we added kemba walker instead of Elfrid Payton and we didn‚Äôt improve? ü§£ you‚Äôre too much. Refer to the last line of my previous comment   Also, no one was signing with the Lakers when they were shit in the 2010s. Were they a small market during that time?"
Reggie Bullock was lowkey a lot of the reason we lost to the Hawks lol. I would not pay him. He doesn't fit well as a starter on the Knicks and he wasn't taking a bench role with us  Burks was really good for us all year. 10 mill is not a lot esp with a team option on it
He's been on 6 teams the past 2 yrs and fallen either to the bottom of the rotation or out of the rotation on several teams for a reason. Just buying super high on a guy who just isnt that good. Would much rather have Reggie Bullock if I had to pay 3 yrs $30 mil to someone. I agree the Noel deal isnt good yes.
He was doing a ton of DHO with Reggie bullock this year. Hope he keeps the same mentality next year.
"Idk if you look at the market value for a wing player (going off 2019 stats) like that‚Äôs within range of guy like Lonzo/Duncan/Fournier/Trent while it‚Äôs unfortunate that it did not work it‚Äôs one of the rare cases where playing with lebron caused a significant dip in production especially for a guy who‚Äôs job was to hit open shots on the perimeter. This also seems like a Mexican standoff around the league since the frenzy began a lot of teams are now strapped for cash. You look at the deal dimwiddie signed in Washington.. surely he‚Äôs worth similar AAV + years. But now that teams are low on cap space, of course everyone is trying to plummet his value. I think this is a severe overreaction. He‚Äôs not hurt, he was simply a poor fit in that offense and played poorly in the playoffs. I could see a team like the Celtics getting a steal on a player like this. If Reggie bullock/burkes/Noel are getting 12 mil a year‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre out of your mind if you think Schroeder is a 15 mil AAV guy."
"I said the same thing above, but Dragic fits our needs more than Schroder. We need a floor general that can start at point but is OK with being mostly in the 2nd unit. Our starting backcourt will be Luka and THJ, with Bullock moving to the 2 at some specific matchups. We need basically a floor general to spell Luka on occasion and lead the 2nd unit. Schroder isn't exactly a creator for others, although he can do that.  His fit clashes big time with Brunson, both being aggressive drivers and able to create for themselves. I know he is miles better than Brunson, but Brunson is acceptable of his backup role and do his job happily. I don't think Schroder will be humble enough to do the same, specially since the one starting ahead of him will be THJ and not Lebron. Schroder would be a ceiling-raiser signing, and it could become of need if we use Brunson in a trade, but what we need on our backcourt is a CP3-lite, that is OK with either role. Schroder is behind Dragic and Reggie on my list, I must confess."
Damn I know the offseason is for over hyping new players but you act like reggie bullock is a all defensive level talent
Don‚Äôt you insult the GOAT Reggie Bullock
"Not sure how any Knick fan can be disappointed with this offseason. We essentially traded Ntilikina, Elfrid Payon, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker.  And didn't give up ANY assets or sign any long term high dollar deals."
"Knicks were a top 2-3 defensive team last season and the 4 seed. We took the same roster and traded Elfrid Payton, Frank Ntilikina, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker. I'm not sure where your logic is?"
"Okay, so you‚Äôre trolling?   The guy who can‚Äôt dribble, and doesn‚Äôt fit on the Kings anymore, and despite being one of the best 3-pt shooters has an uncertain future?  That guy will run an offense for a team starved of a floor-general, offense-running, ball handling, Point Guard?   The catch and shoot guy, whose FG% drops drastically with one dribble, let alone two, that‚Äôs never run an offense, and at 28 y/o, is simultaneously marketed at too high a price and also has too low a ceiling to bet on to become an all-star? That guy?  He‚Äôll be great on a lakers/bucks/hawks, who can afford to make the cap room for a guy at that price, because he can help them take that extra step.   The Knicks would pay almost twice as much for a guy who would basically be a better Reggie Bullock on our offense, and prolly a little worse on D. Best case, we win an extra game against the Hawks because that dude can get hot from 3 like no-one but Randle can for us.   Also, not a PG. If youre not trolling, there ya go, now we all learn something."
"We replaced Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we have gotten significantly better while keeping our chemistry from last season. Will we finish higher than the 4th seed? I don‚Äôt know, but we will be a better team than last year."
Respect Reggie Bullock?
Reggie Bullock got 3 years 30 mil. That's a shooter's value. And he actually is a solid defender. Alec Burks is getting 31 mil for 3 years. That's ballpark fair range for a shooter in today's NBA 10-13 mil a year
"Hey now, Reggie Bullock is a king. Solid catch and shoot, and solid defense"
Clearly the Mavs. We got Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. ::sobs into pillow::
"Nerlens noel anchored a top 5 defense last season. Yes he has his flaws (brick hands, susceptibility to being bodied for rebounds) but his rim protection is something NOBODY on the mavs has. Not even KP.    &gt; If Nerlen Noels is an answer to the question ‚Äúhow does a team upgrade at Center‚Äù, then the team has problems   My fellow redditor not being able to see the flaws of the mavs offseason has me feeling like I'm taking crazy pills. When they lost in the playoffs, we were all in here saying that cuban NEEDS to get Luka some help - their biggest needs being a secondary playmaker, someone who can take some of the scoring load, and a quality starting center that pairs next to KP... now I still think there's time to get that playmaker but so far the answer to all these questions is Reggie bullock and everyone is happy with that? Bullock is nice but what? He can't dribble either. He's timmy if timmy gave up just a hint of shooting in exchange for defense."
"If Murray is healthy Nuggets r tier 1 Celtics r also tier 2 imo   Hawks are tier 2.5, they had a nice run, but beating a Knicks team that had Reggie bullock/Derrick rose as their 2nd option is whatever. Also that sixers roster continues to be flawed along as embiid and simmons r together."
"The contracts we signed Noel, Burks and Rose to aren't even 3 year deals like they were reported initially, they're 2+1 deals, and we replaced Reggie Bullock with Fournier, someone who fits this team so much better"
"Because everyone thought we wanted to overpay for Kelly Oubre/Dennis Schroeder/Lonzo/any FAs  God forbid they just make the boring transactions and stay competitive  Swapped out Reggie Bullock for Fournier instead, Reggie was always the most expendable out of Noel/Burks/Bullock"
"For a recent mavs acquisition, Reggie Bullock has some pretty intresting metrics during his time in NY. Could have to do to the shooting he brought to a team that really needed it; but still, he‚Äôs an underrated player imo"
"I typed up a whole response and then realized you probably meant Jackson and not bullock lol. I also think they could use another ball handler but I think thats their number 2 need, and that they have options between a possible trade for dragic, Schroder, or Reggie Jackson.    Still I dont think there's any centers left that could either rim run or rim protect all that well (at least not anywhere close to Holmes or noel who didn't really cost that much)"
"We still need to add a pg so he might be our plan b. I think we are kicking the can on Brunson first to see if he's available. Begley mentioned that he is a trade target for us, Dragic said he wants to go to the mavs, and seems like Reggie Bullock may end up being a sign and trade so it could be worked out if we throw a bit more in. He also becomes a free agent next year so mavs have to sign him or trade him within the year."

Reggie Bullock tho
"I know I been kind of hating on the mavs lately but imo its really bad they couldn't secure neither richaun Holmes, nerlens noel, or another solid center. The mavs are so thin at that spot they can't afford to lose Willie cauley stein but they got both Reggie bullock and Hardaway Jr."
I remember them getting on Reggie Bullock for not shooting 45% from 3 lol
Reggie Bullock
Mavs gonna call this summer success after signing Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown. I'm having a meltdown
Reggie Bullock
"DeAnthony Melton, Thad Young(he's probably too good for this title), Cameron Johnson, Jaden McDaniels, Reggie Bullock"
"Wow, very kind of you to include Reggie bullock"
It's probably over how many years. He probably wants the Reggie Bullock type deal.
"I said ‚Äúoverpaid‚Äù. We didnt overpay for Rose, who balled the fk out, and is literally one of the best players to communicate Thibs‚Äô coaching to the rest of the players.   Having him for guards and Taj for the bigs is great.  If you mean Fournier, it‚Äôs not overpaying, and he‚Äôs a wing to replace Reggie Bullock.   So‚Ä¶????"
"There are a near infinite number of digits between 1 and 2 but none of them are 3.    There are a near infinite number of possible timelines, and none where Bryn forbes is as good as Reggie bullock on defense."
Caruso will back up Ball Zach. Noel will back up Mitch Rob. TJ McConnell is Brogdon‚Äôs backup. I‚Äôm pretty sure Theis will back up Wood and even Sengun sooner or later. Reggie Bullock and McDermott would also probably come off the Mavs and Spurs benches respectively. I think the going rate for any solid rotational player this offseason has been around 10M per year.
"This might seem a lot, but Reggie Bullock is shooting 41.1% from 3's on 2.5/6.1   He's a solid defender who's perfectly capable of switching to big man, like James Ennis, although not ideal ofc.  Bullock is a good vet, and has been known as a good locker room presence.  Luka would be able to feed him the easiest looks with THJ and hopefully a new renviorgated KP instilled in their offense to give Luka more shooters.  I still think they desperately need one more serious ball handler. I would've liked Dimwiddie considering all of the recent acquisitions of snipers/wings."
10 Mil a year for Reggie bullock?
Is Reggie Bullock playing?
"Again, we‚Äôre only an hour into the process. Timmy was not one of the two guys I‚Äôm talking about, guess you didn‚Äôt notice we got Reggie bullock lol"
We got Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock! Let's go MAVS!
Y'ALL BETTER TAKE CARE OF KNICKS LEGEND REGGIE BULLOCK
"I think Lonzo is going to Charlotte because I really want him to. As for my Cavs, I think Reggie Bullock is better than people give him credit for and he‚Äôd be perfect to be our SF this season."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
Yep I am thinking Schroeder is going to NY in a ST deal for Reggie Bullock and/or maybe Rose as well.
"Additionally, idk if LAL offer him the mini-MLE when they desperately need shooting on the team. I‚Äôd much rather pay Reggie Bullock or Danny Green with that money if I was them."
"In theory, Reggie Bullock was gonna be so good for us. And then Laker curse happened."
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
Reggie Bullock super flat but it goes in
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
"Lakers should try to get Rose, Tucker and Milsap to come over for vet min deals to win a ring and offer Reggie Bullock or Doug McDermott the MLE. Then try to S&amp;T Schroeder for Lauri Markkanen or Jarrett Allen."
Reggie Bullock or Wayne Ellington would be great additions as well
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
Reggie bullock hello
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."
"Reggie Bullock, Patty Mills, Wayne Ellington? Hell even Danny Green could be in contention if he really wants. We resign Caruso and Wes. Solid 3&amp;D players in that list"
Vet min shooters like Reggie bullock
"What‚Äôs his value to my Knicks? I‚Äôll offer Reggie Bullock, James Dolan and three 2nd rounders."
"Weird story actually, Stanley Johnson literally took my phone out of my hands cuz I was trying to sneak a pic at 5th Ave like 20 feet away, but I think that was because he was underage at the time, I didn't have a chance to take a pic because I was a couple drinks in and fumbling with my phone. He took my phone and said if he finds a pic of him on it he's gonna chuck my phone to the other side of the street, if he doesn't he'll give me $100 and pulled out like $10K wadded in a rubber band. Was legit a Steve Blake-esque story.    Also Reggie Bullock is super chill, was just playing pool upstairs at 5th ave lol."
Reggie Bullock was a small sample also. Bullock played 19 games for the Lakers. McLemore played 21.  Rondo shot 32% his last year in NO. Then 35% in LAL. The discussion is about shooters % after they join the Lakers not their % when they joined the championship Lakers.
* Reggie Bullock (34% vs 41% his 3 seasons in Detroit)  * Jason Kapono(29.6% despite shooting 43.4 for his career otherwise   * Jose Calderon (35.3% vs 40.7% for his career and shooting 42% his previous 4 seasons)  There are a few others but they more went from kinda above average to like 31%.
Reggie Bullock
Reggie Bullock is another name that comes to mind.
"&gt;Schroder decreased his three point percentage.  Nope, he‚Äôs a career 34% shooter. He had one outlier season in OKC.  &gt;Danny Green decreased his three point percentage  In the regular season, but not in the playoffs.   &gt;Reggie Bullock decreased his three point percentage  This is because he was taking more threes and had a bigger role.  And KCP is shooting better than ever from 3"
Schroder decreased his three point percentage.  Wes decreased his three point percentage   Danny Green decreased his three point percentage   Reggie Bullock decreased his three point percentage
"&gt; He just isn't good enough to be the best player on a playoff team.  But that's exactly what he was tho  What you mean is he's not good enough to carry them by himself in the playoffs, which is fair, he needs more shot creators to take some of the pressure off him. We didn't have that and now we do with Kemba and Fournier replacing Eflrid and Reggie Bullock"
"i think his percentages will hold or go up, but his ppg will stay the same because of a lot more options on the knicks offense. fournier and kemba are a lot better than elfrid payton and reggie bullock."
"The Knicks thing also only happened because Reggie Bullock had something come up during his medical exam prior to signing. Knicks didn‚Äôt have the money to pay Morris, then came to him late in FA to offer him a bigger role on the team and a bigger salary. Paul told him to not reneg on the deal with Spurs but he did it anyway to hit FA again sooner"
"I think the reggie bullock signing is under rated. All things considered I think they'll be a 4-6 seed. I think Kidd is going to force them to see what we have in Porzingis and actually make him the robin to Lukas batman. Whether that results in wins or not, who knows, but we'll know by the end of this season whether he has a future here or not."
"Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown and Moses Brown were all good signings, and Ntilikina could pan out with the right guidance too. Mavs had an under the radar offseason but really improved their depth and outside shooting."
Giannis Steph Butler Booker PJ Tucker Cam Johnson Ja Morant Joe Ingles Alex Caruso Reggie Bullock Nerlens Noel OG Anounby idk defense
"&gt; Dallas will likely use him sparingly in defensive situations but that's probably it.  That's it. End of the bench guy that will be asked to lock a guy in another team's 2nd unit whenever, Idk, a goddamn Reggie Jackson comes off the bench deciding he is Steph Curry and throws 4 3s in a row to lead a comeback.  Purely hypothetical on the latter. But, being real, we only acquired defenders. Ntilikina differs from Sterling and Bullock when he isn't a catch and shoot guy on offense, but a defensive specialist, but Sterling will have double digit minutes and Bullock will be a starter, while Ntilikina will be the 12-13th man. Different expectations."
"for sure, with my flair I don't have a ton of credibility as a non-homer, but Dallas just finished 5th, Denver and the Clippers will be without their 2nd best and best players and Dallas upgraded slightly (Josh Richardson to Reggie Bullock) and Porzi≈Üƒ£is is getting his first healthy off season in years. I've got us in the 3-6 range, but a lot of folks have us in the 8-10 range.   I guess Kidd and Porzi≈Üƒ£is' recent playoff series have a lot of folks down on us."
"Damn, yall are really low on the Mavs.  Luka is a year older and building off of back to back All NBA first team seasons, KP is having his first healthy off season since his sophomore year and is going to build off of back to back 20 &amp; 9 seasons, THJ is in his prime, we upgraded Josh Richardson who was unplayable for Reggie Bullock and DFS is a great glue guy, as is Kleber. It wasn't a home run offseason by any means, but I don't see how we go from 5th to 8th. Last season we missed the most minutes due to COVID. 6 of our 8 rotation guys missed weeks with COVID and KP missed time recovering from surgery. We were 1 seed behind the Clippers last year and they had a healthy Kawhi and two behind Denver, I don't see how we fall to two/three seeds below them and Denver respectively, when both will be missing star players for the entire season and we are starting off healthy.   IMO:  1. Utah 2. Lakers 3. Phoenix 4. Dallas 5. Denver 6. Golden State 7. Blazers 8. Clippers  I think Utah will gun in the regular season, while the Lakers rest more games and prep for the playoffs, I don't think they care about the #1 seed."
"Our Defense. Replacing Elfrid Payton, and a Reggie Bullock with Kemba and Fournier are certainly upgrades but it makes men worry about how our perimeter defense will be. Last year Reggie Bullock was our primary wing defender and now RJ is gonna have to step into that role."
Kinda puts it into perspective how bad it is when your biggest offseason acquisition is Reggie Bullock
What does Svi have to do with anything? He was traded months earlier for Reggie Bullock.
"Russell Westbrook, RJ Barrett, Reggie Bullock, Rui Hachimura, Rudy Gobert"
"THE move of the offseason? C‚Äômon. He was the second-4thbest bench piece (depends how you view Reggie Bullock and PJ Tucker) in FA with Batum at 1 but he‚Äôs not above Derozan, Lowry, Ball, Fournier, Schroeder, Olynyk or even Devonte Graham in key additions. It‚Äôs a good get but it doesn‚Äôt put them over the Bulls and Heat with their star level additions or the Lakers with the Russ trade in offseasons."
If Reggie bullock is your starting three things have gotten bad for Dallas real quick. Man is not w the shits
"PG - Luka SG - THJ SF - Reggie Bullock PF - DFS C- KP  Bench:  Guards: Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke  Wings: Sterling Brown, Josh Green  Bigs: Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Boban, Moses Brown"
Reggie Bullock is probably a better example. If his catch and shoot isn't going down he doesn't have really anything else in his arsenal.
"Which of the top 4 teams in the west are you going to beat to get past the 1st round?  Nobody believes we're the same, but functionally a first round exit is a first round exit. You guys will surely do it with more pizazz though, gotta give you that. Especially with the addition of free agent giant Reggie Bullock."
"Jake Fischer is one of the most plugged in guys in Dallas. Not saying it‚Äôs 100% true, but his track record is very very solid. He was the first to break the signings on both sterling brown and Reggie bullock this summer. Point is, he‚Äôs credible."
"DBPM has its limitation, just look at some of the top dudes on the list, you really gonna tell me Joe Harris, reggie bullock, Duncan Robinson, etc ar elite defenders?"
"I'd say another top 40ish player and then a bunch of good, competent role players who can make open shots and not embarrass themselves on D.  Jamal Murray  Reggie Bullock  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  Derrick Favors"
"Personally, I think he could get it done if you swap Rodney Hood for last season‚Äôs Reggie Bullock and Frank Kaminsky for Zubac"
And something we did by getting Reggie Bullock. He‚Äôll arguably be the best 3&amp;D guy on the roster now since he‚Äôs a better defender than Hardaway jr. and a better shooter than Finney-Smith and a better everything than Josh Richardson
"There are two main reasons I can think of. Last season the team got hit worse by covid that any other team outside of the Celtics, after getting half their rotation back they finished the season 33-16, climbing from 13th to the 5th seed. Also Mavs lineup data would suggest that Josh Richardson was causing issues on both ends of the floor. He was their only rotation player with a negative net rating, and our lineups with him off the court were much better. We replaced him with Reggie Bullock, who's a better defender and waaaaay better shooter, so that could have a big impact."
"I explained it in another comment on this post, but here goes again.  I think MPJ makes another jump this season for Denver, and their overall team is still very good even with missing Murray for most of the year. Dallas has Luka getting better, KP finally having a healthy off-season, and Josh Richardson being replaced by Reggie Bullock. Bullock is a huge upgrade in terms of fit, and imo will help improve Luma and KP by providng much more spacing than Richardson ever did. He himself isn't going to pop off, but I think his vakue is going to vastly increase the productivity of the other 2 stars. Utah imo is very similar to last year with a couple exceptions: Conley is even older, he'll regress some, Gay replacing Niang is better for short spurts, but he's older too and Niang would probably be better for linger stretches needed to fill, and lastly I feel as if Whiteside is not going to mesh with yall and end up causing issues since he usually does.  It's really yall barely dropping and more of the teams I have above you progressing enough. I see 3-5 probably Bmbeing within 2-3 games of each other."
"Why is Tim Hardaway Jr in that photo in the OP, like he's a new signing? I know he just signed an extension with the Mavs, but he's already been there for 2 1/2 seasons, and isn't a newcomer like Sterling Brown, Moses Brown, and Reggie Bullock."
"I think that one was on Magic, not LeBron. The Lakers traded Svi and a 2nd to Detroit for Reggie Bullock on the same day they made that awful trade of Zubac for Muscala. They were both ""all in for the playoffs"" trades, and the Lakers missed the playoffs and both Muscala and Bullock left in the off-season. Of course, so did Magic..."
Dude can‚Äôt even shoot better than Reggie Bullock and Steve Novak.
Reggie bullock??? Justin holiday? Wtf
Reggie Bullock is 30. He's not breaking out.  Justin Holiday is 32.
get mad before you start losing in embarrassing fashion. It's a punk move. I was so pissed when Elfrid Payton pushed someone (i think Jae Crowder?) when the knicks were getting blown out 2 years ago. Or during the playoffs when Reggie Bullock was trying to do that fake tough guy shit in game 5. Trae weighs 78 pounds and he whooped your ass for 5 games straight after you talked shit. Man up on the basketball court or go into MMA if you wanna do that tough guy shit.
"Literally everything we've done since getting Luka has turned to shit. It's really incredible. KP trade. Signing Delon Wright. Trading Barnes. Trading Curry. 2020 draft. All complete disasters. Reggie Bullock looks good so that's nice I guess, but he's a role player. We really have to turn it around before we lose Luka."
Trading for Reggie Bullock is one that comes to memory.
"hopefully they start reggie bullock now, he was their 3rd best player"
He has a players tribune article about it that is really good.  https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/reggie-bullock-national-gun-violence-awareness
"The calls for Reggie Bullock were not exaggerated. Also, more Moses Brown"
THANK YOU KNICKS FOR REGGIE BULLOCK  We‚Äôre taking more of your playersüòà‚Ä¶
friendly reminder that Reggie Bullock  is more likely to get a free drink in New York than Kd
They definitely have enough talent man c‚Äômon. Y‚Äôall were starting Reggie Bullock last year and got the 4th seed
"I think Kidd forgot we have Reggie Bullock or something lol, barely seen him on the floor"
Mavs need someone other than Luka that can be ball dominant and create. Lakers would love Reggie Bullock
"Some of those concerns are realistic, but you are missing the major reason why we overrate DFS and brought in Bullock (and it was a legit discussion if he should start): defense. We have **zero** decent defenders out of DFS and Maxi. There's a reason we trade for J-Rich, there's a reason why Donnie thought Iwundu would be a thing, and there's a reason why bringing in Bullock was celebrated.   Last series much of the reason that the Clippers could do whatever they pleased was because Maxi was banged up and DFS was gassed. We couldn't switch to save our lives. Both Donnie and Nico had the same line of thought: we won't go anywhere if only 1 player can consistently guard 1-3 in a playoff game, and only DFS could guard anything other than a bus sign against the Clippers.   I think we blew up things by not bringing a proper point (aka Dragic) to allow Brunson to run the 2 and, considering Kidd envisioned KP as PF, it was a sin not to sign Holmes, but signing Bullock wasn't bad. It was a *good* sign for our woes. Hell, Ntilikina will bring what we expect to see from Green last year, a guy that can come off the bench and not allow Reggie Fucking Jackson to go 40/40 from the 3 in 1 quarter.   Our wing defense is good, we have decent backcourt defense personnel, but, honestly, even the majority of us lost sense to the hole at rim defense. This exacerbates due to Kidd wanting to run a fast pace, transition offense, that basically obliges us to start Powell or WCS, one undersized and another with a hustle level that makes Simmons look like Kobe.   If they insist on this gameplan, I definitely can see they using the TPE to trade for a C that can protect the rim and is athletic enough to survive in a transition offense."
"I know in general nobody should be panicking after one game, but I think in this case the mavs should be panicking  yeah the hawks are good, but they looked totally outclassed as a team  they have the same roster as last year basically.  their big acquisitions were spot-shooter reggie bullock and frank ntilikina who is not a NBA caliber player.   they already have THJ to fill the spot shooter role so why go for bullock  dwight powell is not a NBA starting caliber player anymore and yet they don't have anyone else to start over him.   he gives them almost nothing on either end of the floor.  dorian finney smith is a total crapshoot from night to night what you will get.     KP is actually one of their least concerns because while he's a fundamentally flawed player at least he and luka have really nice PNR chemistry which will probably be their main scoring engine this season  they are not moving in the right direction and they probably don't have any chance to win the championship with this roster.  they don't have enough assets to get a game-changing wing player that they need to replace powell  they have the same issues as last year except with worse coaching, what are their options to improve as a team?   at least the cowboys are good I guess"
"Reggie Bullock was a decent signing, he was underrated for the Knicks although based on how they were opening night they probably aren‚Äôt going to miss him.   Otherwise it‚Äôs literally the same roster again"
"Idk. You guys needed a rim protector and secondary ball handler and you went out and signed Reggie bullock. Great player but idk how you're going to exceed last year because 3,&amp;D didn't seem like what you needed and yet thats what you got.    Shoutour frank ntilikina. Watch him do this again 81 times"
"Don't worry guys KP may still be stagnant, but we made the major off-season additions of Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown.  What a fucking joke of a franchise"
"mavs took THJ, KP, reggie bullock, trey burke and frank ntilikina from us  its only fair they send us luka, 1 for 5 thats more than fair"
instead of getting luka's slovenian teammates he was tearing it up with in the olympics they decided to get frank ntilikina and reggie bullock
Wow turns out Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown don't move the needle at all  Luka isn't finishing his supermax on this team
I‚Äôm pretty sure Reggie bullock is going to get a standing ovation for his 3‚Äôs in game 2
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker‚Äôs roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
Reggie bullock could never
"I think you're looking at adding reggie bullock and Ntilikina in a vaccuum rather than who we replaced. We got rid of Richardson for Bullock, which is a massive improvement from a player who was just there for free throws in the playoffs for a starting forward, and iwundu who didn't get any minutes at all for a potentially rotation guard. Considering we took the clippers to seven games last year, I think those additions may just be enough to put us over the edge.  &amp;#x200B;  You're looking at it as if we're trying to go from an 8 seed to a 1 seed but we're just trying to get from 5 to top 3."
"There also haven't been any preseason games since Friday, and there is still one more day before there will be any regular season games.  I don't know what else there would be to talk about.  I mean, from the perspective of my own team, we could talk about how the transition from an Elfrid Payton/Reggie Bullock to Kemba Walker/Evan Fournier backcourt should change the Knicks offense but opens up concerns for what it will do for their defense - but we've already talked about that ad nauseum since Walker agreed to sign in July.  We're focused on the drama right now because that's what is going on and there are literally no Xs and Os to focus on."
"yes we subtracted elfrid payton and reggie bullock, Id say we are in good shape for the coming season and teams success is largely dependent on how well rj plays this season."
"Mavs. Luka will be outstanding as usual but getting Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina as their big off season moves? I appreciate them for their service, but those aren't what I'd consider the kinda moves that'll get them far in the West."
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
"Take that and add those minor moves that DO have a huge impact to our roster.  We are a seriously deeper team now with a lot more defense.  We basically replaced Nico Melli, Wes Iwundu, and the corpse of Jason Richardson, for Reggie Bullock - a solid 3 &amp; D starter for a playoff team, Sterling Brown who plays above average D and hit 42% from deep last year, and a flyer on Frank Ntilikina who hopefully can be a matchup based defender on some more elite wings when needed.  Even if KP doesn't improve, our regular season record should be much better simply because we are deeper.  KP is going to be the ceiling raiser in the playoffs."
"Same, people clowning the rankings for having the Mavs above clippers and Nuggets but the Clips are missing their MVP caliber leading scorer and the Nuggets are missing an all star caliber wing, the clippers are potentially looking at the play in and the Nuggets may be just 48-50 wins.   When healthy the Mavs last year went 33-16 and Reggie bullock and sterling brown are better than Josh richardson and James Johnson"
"They didn't make any huge additions but did get a couple of guys who should make them a better team, if only slightly (Reggie Bullock is probably the main one). I think they're mostly hoping that KP bounces back from last season"
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
"Covid problems. KP injuried for 15 games or more.  Plus we added Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown. Brunson seems to be still developing. Josh Green looks more confident. Omoruyi and Carlik are good grabs in the draft. Kidd bringed our chemestry from 40% to 90% etc."
"We swapped out Josh Richardson, JJ Redick, and Melli for Moses Brown, Reggie Bullock, and Sterling Brown. We‚Äôre also utilizing KP far more effectively from what we‚Äôve seen thus far."
But sterling brown and Reggie Bullock&gt;Josh richardson and James Johnson
No no no no and Hell NO I‚Äôm not letting this shit slide lol  He was brought in to bring in championship culture  and a hard working mindset to the team. Let‚Äôs get the first thing out the win that Doc Rivers as a head coach only had 1 more regular season win in his tenure with lob city (57-25) 2013-14 Vinny Del Negro who at the previous season went (56-26)2012-13. The team already showed it could win regular season games the goal was to get over the hump to the WCF at minimum.  Reggie Bullock was hit with injuries so playing him was going to be difficult but Doc never went out of his way to play him.  Some ways through year two and Reggie is gone and thankfully found a lane in the league.  The Eric Bledsoe trade was botched in a few ways considering the hype and trade value Bledsoe had at the time. In hindsight the clippers never deal with Phoenix  and use Caron Butler to get JJ who was a S&amp;T and Butler ended up going to Bucks anyway  weeks later to return home. In the moment I‚Äôm still confused why Jared Dudley was a core piece in a Bledsoe trade.   Trading Dudley after 1 Year in a salary dump basically made no since at all. This move began the habit of wasting first round picks to just remove players from the team Doc didn‚Äôt like rather that using 1st to create stability on rookie contracts or add legitimate upgrades to the roster.  Jeff Green DID NOT play a big role for the team. Doc hated Lance Stephenson and wanted to play Austin Rivers more minutes (the one young player that was almost out of the league). Jeff Green joined the team and this was peak Mr. Inconsistent but he was a former Celtic so Doc loved him. By the playoffs Jeff Green went from starting 10 of 27 games to being benched and only saw his minutes kick up because Blake and Chris went down. You know what Jeff Green did after the season that we spent a 2019 first own? He left in free agency and another wasted clippers pick.  2018 was about a retool but likely rebuild. Chris Paul we going to leave and was fed up with Doc and issues with Blake. Doc did his best work with a rebuilding situation but even then let egos get in the way of the championship situation HARRELL
"Doc Rivers was brought into compete for a title with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. He wasn't brought in to draft well and develop late first rounders and second rounders. Clippers had a legit shot at winning it all from 2012-2017 including 2 division titles, 57, 56, 56, 53 and 51 win seasons.  As an executive, he drafted Reggie Bullock at #25 (great pick), and then traded a late second rounder and Bledsoe for a package including JJ Redick who was instrumental in their 50 win seasons.  In 2014, he traded a dissapointing Dudley and a late first rounder to Milwaukee for a second rounder, Carlos Delfino an expiring was waived for cap space and Miroslav Raduljica.  Later, he selected CJ Wilcox at #28, hard to blame him for a #28 pick not panning out.Traded a late first rounder for Jeff Green, who was only 29 and played a big role on their 2016 team. Drafted Brice Johnson at #25 who didn't pan out, again, late first rounders hardly ever do.  In 2018 he traded a late first rounder for Danilo Gallinari who was coming off an all star esque season and would go on to be their best player the following season.  So in the what 8 years that your stat encompases they were competing for a title and werent focusing on developing late first rounders or second rounders, or going through a quick rebuild and contending again with Kawhi/PG, this isn't that surprising IMO."
"Yea, the pundits have been saying this 'defense will suffer' line but our defense was always a team effort anchored by our big man cleaning up the mess inside and I think our big rotation is better than it was last year..  Bullock is a good 3 and D guy who can knock down the open shot and use his length to bother defenders, but I dont think our defensive rating will go down all that much bc we lost Elf and Reggie."
"They replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with someone who attempted even more 3s per game than he did last year, believe it"
"Reggie Bullock is not an amazing defender, slightly above league average maybe but nothing extraordinary. His lack of an offensive game hurt the Knicks more than his defense could help it. Evan Fournier is much more of an overall better player just because of the pressure he creates on offense. Also defense is a team effort, guys can outplay their abilities on defense with pure effort."
We had spacing issues last post-season because none of our wings or PGs could create their own shots. So Atlanta just had to protect the paint and they were golden. Reggie Bullock was great for us but he couldn‚Äôt dribble at all. we replaced Reg and Payton with Fournier and Kemba who are both solid shooters and can take people off the dribble.
"Poole averaged 12ppg in 20mpg last season and he didnt even get any momentum for first half of the season bcs of Wanamaker. No reason to not believe he cant average 18ppg in 30+mins.  Nemanja has always been a solid stretch big just that he didnt get any playing time on the Heat. Iggy is old but his perimeter defense was still good last season with the heat. Agree with the OPJ injury issue which is why I said assuming everyone is healthy bcs if you want to take into account injury theres a high chance Porzingis will be out this season as well. Reggie Bullock is the only good addition. Isnt Bruce Brown with the Nets lol? And Moses Brown is only good if you look at the box score, hes basically Andre Drummond Jr, if you watched enough Thunder games last season you will understand, or maybe you can ask any Thunder fans"
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
Reggie Bullock? That‚Äôs the first example of a guy?
Dude Luka dragged you to the 5 seed.  TH jr was your second one best player.  Outside of Luka the Dallas roster is not that good.  KP wasn‚Äôt traded because no one wanted him.  TH jr is probably best suited as a 3-D player not the 2nd best player on a team.    I will also leave it at this if Dallas could trade either TH jr or KP for BI straight up they would do it in a heartbeat and be considered a top 4 team in the west.  Dallas might have played as a team under Carlisle and gotten to the 5 seed but that does not meant they have a talented team.    As far as upgrades go seriously Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina?  Seriously they were not good enough for the Knicks so they upgraded from them.  Dallas kept everything the same
We saw a team with Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock as starters make the 4th seed. I don‚Äôt think 5th seed is their absolute cap and we should stop saying that so much
"Ehh. Like Kevin Durant said, generally, shoes add an inch. And they don‚Äôt on play bare feet. They play in shoes. Just makes sense to measure with the shoe you mostly play in. Like, for example, Reggie Bullock has said he mostly plays in Kobe 6s. So he would measure with them on."
"2011 - Chris Singleton (vs. Iman Shumpert)  2012 - Kyle O'Quinn (vs. Kostas Papanikolaou, no 1st rounder)  2013 - Reggie Bullock (vs. Tim Hardaway)  2014 - Jarnell Stoke (vs. Cleanthony Early, no 1st rounder)  2015 - Mario Hezonja (vs. Kristaps Porzingis)  So, not great Bob."
Us Mavs fans sure are lucky having players like Reggie Bullock being keen on playing in Dallas
Interested to see how Sterling Brown and Reggie bullock do for my Mavs
"Was a fantastic offseason  We upgraded from Elfrid and Reggie Bullock to Kemba and Fournier, along with bringing back important players, kept our core intact  Also re-signed Julius to a great extension"
"Well we need some people on our roster to put the ball on the floor. He also really isn't too bad at it. You cannot have only one guy pressuring the rim and expect to succeed. It's not gonna be Maxi Kleber/Dorian Finney Smith/Reggie Bullock/Dwight Powell/Willie Cauley Stein/Josh Green putting the ball on the floor. Luka, Brunson, Hardaway, and Porzingis need to be able to attack the rim."
"I'm reaching just for the sake of this thought exercise, but all I've got is:  Reggie Bullock  *MAYBE* Tristan Thompson?  *MAYBE* Schroeder?  And I don't have the confidence to die on any of these mole hills. Not the least of reasons being that he's not helping any of these teams enough to suddenly get out of the first round."
meanwhile  Luka got Reggie Bullock
"As a person who watch Mavs basketball, Reggie Bullock is awful"
"Yea our big issue is that we have two starting caliber players on a team that has 'deep playoff' hopes, and unfortunately one of them is unreliable health wise. Brunson and THJ are great 6/7th man combos and Maxi and DFS would be a dream 3/4 coming off the bench. We have no starting talent at the wing though, and with the kind of offense we run that's never going to work. We're fucked basically unless we luck out in the draft(if cuban would stop giving our picks out for nothing). We have nothing to trade that won't leave our depth absolutely gutted and FA's don't come here. Also Reggie Bullock has been absolute garbage and I don't even want to see him on the floor"
i‚Äôd literally rather watch him play with your supporting cast any day instead of watching dfs and reggie bullock clang wide open three after wide open three
"Part of the reason is the difference is bigger this season is because the Mavs have added better defensive pieces to their bench in Frank Ntilikina, Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. (Not big names, but great defenders statistically over their careers)  As a result the drop-off when he is on the court is much bigger, because the bench is better than it was. To give a similarish example, Cole Anthony has one of the absolute best on-offs in the entire league right now, not because he is a superstar in disguise (although he is very good) but because our bench is horrendously bad and lacks a true PG.  On-offs tell you as much about the replacement players as they do about the player themselves."
"i'm really glad the knicks kept him over Reggie Bullock (even though I really like Reggie too). But Burks can actually dribble, shot-create and shoot. He's been great for us after a slow start this season."
"Sir, I ordered one Reggie Bullock, why have I received Ragland Block, obviously a Walmart waiter that doesn't know how to shoot? I want a refund."
Reggie Bullock is ass
What on earth has happened to Reggie Bullock. He's a good enough defender but 0 points in 22 min??
"Honestly what can we do when for some reason everyone on the squad starts shooting 20% on open looks. Like what the fuck is Reggie Bullock? No 3, no D, zero confidence. At least Tim will yeet just about any look he can get. This feels like last years slide to 14th but we're healthy lol. Luka also hitting all his threes and missing all his FT's, time is a flat circle."
"Reggie Bullock, but i have genuine reasoning. he‚Äôs a Tar Heel, my fave cbb team, and bc i feel sorry for him that his trans sister was murdered - i‚Äôll always root for him"
Reggie bullock
"I'd probably still favor the Hawks in a playoff series especially if Randle can't play a good game against them, but the fact that they can't hide Trae on Reggie Bullock on defense this year is huge. Burks and Fournier are much more adept off the dribble and Burks was going after him in the Third Quarter."
Guess we need to boo bogdan for wanting to murder Reggie bullock last year
"Yeah you can scrap together a contender if 10 ppg or less with Prime Lebron. You got the lineups already included on the thread but other players can be prime Trevor Ariza, Danny Green, Harkless, Larry Nance Jr., PJ Tucker, Marcus Smart is towing the line, Reggie Bullock and the like and scrounge up a decent core of prime 3 and d core around prime Lebron to contend. You can also look at old players that declined and had a couple bad season that dragged their career below 10ppg but they are actually better then that."
"Assuming ""Reggie"" is the only name in the NBA that rhymes with ""Wedgie"" (I can't think of another one):  There are two Reggies currently in the NBA (Jackson and Bullock) and roughly 500 players in the NBA, so the probability of a wedgie being by a Reggie is about 1/250.  And the probability of a Double Wedgie Reggie is roughly 1 in 7 billion."
"AKA ""please forgive Dorian Finney-Smith, KP, and Reggie Bullock for any bad shooting."" Those dudes' shots all look like line-drives."
"As someone who is rooting for the Mavs success, Reggie Bullock is very frustrating to have on the court  getting as many minutes of playing time as he does."
Translation: Reggie Bullock responded to Nick DePaula after DePaula called him out for writing ‚ÄòSniper ALERT‚Äô on his Kobe‚Äôs and the going 0-2 (he missed two shots) in 31 minutes. ‚ÄúWho want smoke wit me? Do ya job and take pics of shoes sucka‚Äù
"reggie bullock go the bag and dipped dude is playing like shit, even his defense is fucking sus"
"What's weird is you guys had a lot of good role player shooters just a few seasons ago (Luke Kennard, Tony Snell, Reggie Bullock, Wayne Ellington) and now all of them are gone"
"Reggie bullock, that 3rd string guy from the wiz who torched us twice last year (I think it was last year) etc"
even reggie bullock is like welp didn‚Äôt expect that
"Well we lost but I was impressed with Frank Ntilikina once again. Picking him up was an absolute steal.   Really hope Bullock steps it up and starts hitting more shots (AND LAYUPS) though, he‚Äôs been disappointing so far compared to how he played for the Knicks last year. I like Reggie and have faith he will, but it‚Äôs frustrating right now. Never would have imagined I‚Äôd be saying Frank was the better Knicks acquisition at this point lol"
"I'm not sure what Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock are good for : / what a frustrating lost, ye fuck those refs too."
Reggie bullock has been ass for us
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
"Is Wayne Ellington's game any different from Reggie Bullock or Troy Daniels? I dont pay super close attention but they seem basically identical. No shade, just asking"
"Yeah, idk where this guy is coming from saying our bench is awful. Hell, I would go ahead and say it's a strength of our team. Brunson/Frank/Reggie/Maxi are a very solid unit, along with Sterling Brown rotating in. I know plus-minus isn't the end all, but every single one of our bench players outside of Bullock has a plus differential for the season.  Not only are they solid as a unit, but they fit extremely well with our starters. We've closed multiple games running Luka/Brunson/THJ-DFS/Reggie/KP. I would bet we end up sliding Maxi in and close most games with Luka/Brunson/Reggie/Maxi/KP come playoff time.  Additionally, we still have the $10m trade exception, so even if our bench starts to underperform we have a simple answer to bolster it come the trade deadline. Yeah our center rotation is bad, but we have pieces that can matchup to get us through the regular season. Come playoffs, KP at the 5 with Maxi at the 4 solves most of our problems."
"Our bench is very solid rn, its our starting lineup that lacks versatile players outside of Luka/KP. Frank Ntilikina has played very well, Reggie Bullock was a key starter for the Knicks last year, and we still have Maxi Kleber who was injured tonight.   But I'm convinced Dwight Powell is not even a 9th or 10th man in other teams rotations. Like you guys are 4-8 and both Poeltl and Eubanks are better than Powell. Even on non-playoff teams, I don't think Powell would deserve minutes. Our center rotation is BAD."
"Reggie Bullock under, and Robin Lopez over were my last season picks. Ofcourse depending on teams they play if they play against good defending Bullock under if not i skip him, for Robin Lopez he was more less safe pick since he had a lot of touches in post and line was something like 6.5 or 7.5 for more than half of the season."
"I‚Äôd rather Trey not see the court, but we could legitimately run an all ex-Knicks lineup of Trey Burke, Reggie Bullock, Tim Hardaway Jr, Frank Nkilatina, and Kristaps and it wouldn‚Äôt be half bad"
"Yeah idk who else we could offer for him, maybe add in Josh Green if they want a young player idk, Sterling Brown or Reggie Bullock maybe idk."
They miss Reggie Bullock
"Reggie Bullock was by no means the second option on last years Knicks team. That being said, I definitely think we're better off having traded Porzingis and not having to pay him that much money."
We've had max cap space twice since signing KP and all we have to show for it is Reggie Bullock. Cap space means nothing if players don't want to live in Dallas. KP has been playing well despite his shot not falling though
when did he play with reggie bullock?
having Reggie Bullock instead of Josh Richardson makes life so much easier
Yea this year defending the 3 has been an issue. We almost lost the celtics game because we didnt guard Grant Williams at all. Then we lost the Pacers game because we let Myles Turner do whatever he wanted from 3. I think its because Fournier and Kemba arent as good of defenders as Reggie Bullock and Payton were last year  We have 2 rookies who are  good defenders in Grimes and Deuce but  they get no time to play
Where is Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock
"Yeah, Bullock, Finney-Smith, and Luka have been missing a ton of their threes to start the year.   Minus that one game Reggie dropped 16"
"While his slump is the most drastic, it's not the only major one on the team. Luka's shooting 23.8% from 3 (35.0% last year), KP's shooting 23.5% (37.6% last year), Reggie Bullock at 31.0% (41.0% last year), and Sterling Brown at 15.4% (42.3% last year)."
The novelty of seeing Reggie Bullock start at C will dull the pain brought on by the opponents' endless parade of easy layups.
"I don't think they did that bad this off-season. They got a bench which is more than they could say last season. I'd probably taken a PG instead of Al Horford but the roster is much better than last year. Whereas the Mavs got Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown and that's about it."
"Svi been in the league for ages. He was drafted by the Lakers in 2018. Played some good games and showed promise, was well liked by the fans but was traded to the Pistons for Reggie Bullock which didn‚Äôt really work out. Lotta people would have kept Svi. Pistons traded him to OKC and then he signed with the Raptors. Kinda hard to say Masai ‚Äúfound‚Äù him."
"Svi was solid, honestly kinda wish he was back on the Lakers. Traded him for Reggie Bullock, who basically did nothing for the team and just left right after the season."
We did make a big move. We forced our HOF coach to resign.   And added future HoFer Reggie Bullock
Reggie Bullock was arguably your best shooter. Kemba Walker is currently shooting over 58% from  3. D Rose us currently shooting over 54% from 3.    I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready to expect the 40%+ 3 point shooting from last season of Julius Randle and Barrett as an expectation. Seemed flukey to me‚Äîespecially Randle
We were top 10 in 3P% last season with Reggie Bullock and Elfrid Payton as our starting guards. What makes you think these numbers aren‚Äôt sustainable when Kemba and Fournier are their replacements?
"we have different defensive schemes than those bad Orlando teams. he's definitely a downgrade on defense from Reggie Bullock, but his offense is so much better that it really outweighs it. Fournier has been more than serviceable so far on the defensive side."
Year one he didn‚Äôt play w/ another ‚ÄúSuperstar‚Äù  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
Not true. Reggie Bullock was trying to hack Trae a bunch (obviously it wasn't going to work out) although he did get called for those.
"m‚Äôclassy knicks featuring reggie ‚Äòflagrant‚Äô bullock, Taj ‚ÄòOffensive Tackle‚Äô Gibson and Nerlens ‚ÄòSlewfoot‚Äô Noel can‚Äôt catch a. break against this foul merchant"
trae been taunting reggie bullock. Bullock is a professional...
Man where was this Reggie Bullock when he was on the Lakers
I don‚Äôt think we knicks fans have the right to make fun of Trae Young‚Äôs hair when we cheer for Reggie Bullock
I don‚Äôt think we knicks fans have the right to make fun of Trae Young‚Äôs hair when we cheer for Reggie Bullock
Trae Young and Reggie Bullock fighting over who has the worst hair on the floor.
"Oh absolutely, he's been a beast. Though shooters that come to the Lakers typically lose their powers (Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wes Matthews, Schroder kinda) so maybe he would have fallen victim to that as well lol"
Game Sunday was a 2 point game and Julius Randle shot 6-23 and Reggie Bullock didn‚Äôt hit a 3
When I mentioned this about Julius and Reggie Bullock after game 1 I was told that it‚Äôs different because it‚Äôs the playoffs
Why do the Knicks let Trae Young rest on defense?  So many possessions where he would just be standing in the corner guarding Reggie Bullock. Basically resting up and playing half a game.  Remember when LeBron attacked Lou Williams over and over again. He had KCP setting screens to get the mismatch. Randle/Rose and Bullock can do the same. Except Atlanta can't afford to sub out Trae.
You just lost to Reggie Bullock
Switching up Reggie Bullock to defend Young was a much smarter decision
"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
"Randle looks like siakam 2.0 right there , at least drosew , burks and Reggie bullock are carrying"
"This game is the answer why players will always say they love playing at the garden, they're going bonkers when Reggie Bullock makes a 3. Imagine if a superstar is making clutch playoff shots"
REGGIE BULL BULLOCK!!
Knicks legend Reggie Bullock
KNICKS LEGEND REGGIE BULLOCK
Knicks only offense in the fourth is reggie bullock and it‚Äôs working
LAKER LEGEND REGGIE BULLOCK
Taj Gibson has played dirty for most of the game. So has Noel and obviously Reggie Bullock who got a flagrant for his dirty play
Reggie Bullock out here trying to get jumped when he goes to Atlanta
Reggie Bullock got bored because he wasnt doing anything
Reggie bullock leading the Knicks in assists with 1 lol.
"There‚Äôs such a huge difference in talent and it‚Äôs apparent in the playoffs. Knicks should‚Äôve never been a 4 seed.. the fact that they are is insane . No playoff team starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and Nerlens Noel . They are solid bench pieces ."
I need Reggie Bullock to have 25
So is Reggie bullock. The fuck is the point of this comment?
I mean Reggie Bullock is actually a good player. No reason to joke about him like Payton and pinson
"Life on the line, who do you want taking the shot: Reggie Bullock or KCP?"
All this just to stop Reggie Bullock
Sending some Pistons energy your way. I love D-Rose and Reggie Bullock and fuuuuuck Trae Young.
Reggie Bullock
"I get the feeling we aren't going to be able to afford Bullock next year and Frank will be groomed to become his replacement. I mean, if I had to choose I'd keep Reggie, but literally every team in the league can use someone like him and that man is gonna catch a bag in the off season. Particularly if he shows out in the playoffs like he has been lately."
"Luke's never had a stretch as bad as Fizdale at the Knicks though.   Fizdale went 21-83 with the Knicks and had the worst spacing in the league despite having Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Reggie Bullock who would all go on to shoot over 40% from deep the year after he left. He's not only a shit coach but he makes players significantly worse"
"Ya.  I have. And when you are starting Elfriid Payton Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock alongside your star that is a more impressive coaching feat than whenyou have Ayton, Bridges and and a hall of fame point guard to play."
For the HOTY award? I think Reggie Bullock took over from Elf this year.
We need another 3 &amp; D guy like Reggie Bullock for the SF position. If we had two Reggie Bullock‚Äôs we‚Äôd be set.
think it was Reggie Bullock actually
When you're playing offense through Reggie Bullock it shouldn't be a surprise that you barely score lol
Reggie bullock is thirty years old.
"Okay, so who do you buy low on?   DeMar DeRozan? - Alright that's something I guess  I don't really see Oubre or Fournier moving the needle for either of those guys - not a lot of defense going around there.  Reggie Bullock? Honestly I might like him more than the former two but not a needle mover.  A welcome-home show for Nic Batum or Will Barton? Both decent players but may end up commanding a bag bigger than Portland could offer. Also have a hunch Batum wants to end up on a stronger contender.  I like the upside of Otto Porter Jr a lot and that's why I'd ""buy low"" on him. The other guys sans DeRozan don't have a huge ceiling in my opinion or may just not be available for Portland.  I'm also a huge stan of Harrison Barnes to Portland if they can pull off a CJ trade - not a star obviously but makes for a cohesive lineup."
Reggie Bullock is severely limited in anything but catch and shoot threes  And I‚Äôm not a huge fan of this potential signing but a wing that can drive and dribble the ball is an improvement to Bullock (who the Hawks are happy to hide Trae Young on defense with)
RJ starts as a 2 mostly and plays 3 when he‚Äôs with the bench crew   He would start over Reggie Bullock
"And that justifies taking Reggie Bullock over him? Also, you realize he played like 6 years mostly healthy before the big injury"
