I’ve been saying it but ibaka is just living off reputation at this point defensively can’t move better offensive player than defensive now days. You saw Ty Lue close the game with Mook at the 5 was interesting to see harden chose Morris as the guy to hunt over Reggie Jackson.   Nets hit a lot of shots but this clippers defense has been very average all year even as opponent shooting luck has evened out some. Transition defense isn’t as good as last year they are another team falling into this general trend of allowing lots of 3s and fewer shots at the rim hasn’t been working the same this year with teams shooting better as a whole
One of those rare games where you can see your team lose and still walk away thinking it was an absolute joy to watch.  It was a contest of fine margins and I don't think it exposed any massive flaws in the Clippers strategy.  The biggest negatives were Zubac having an off night and being very slow to react + Lou providing no offensive upside to compensate for his non-existent defense.  You have to wonder how much Ty will be playing Lou with a healthy Pat Bev and an in-form Reggie Jackson both available.  The Nets aren't bringing any surprises.  They have all time great offensive potential and opposition teams have to pick their poison against their Big 3.  Can't wait until February 21.
nah we could put reggie jackson on him and he wont have a game like t his ever again
"The difference defensively between fucking Reggie Jackson and Bev is easily at least an extra 3 missed buckets by Kyrie, if not Kyrie playing totally differently because he is actually being challenged on O instead of having a easy match-up every time down the floor  Bev easily would've made up that 4 pt difference, easily"
"I think if the clippers have pat beg tonight they might be able to do a decent enough job. Reggie Jackson was not good so they had to put kawhi and PG on kyrie a lot in the 4th. You throw Kawhi, PG, Pat Bev, Morris, Batum at their big three and hope to burn them more against their defence."
Best part of this is that it was right after Reggie Jackson threw up a gross attempt at a reverse and he was just showing him how it’s done
I meant on Kyrie. He’d definitely do a better job than Reggie Jackson (no hate to Reg tho he’s been playing well)
I can't stop watching Reggie Jackson in this clip. it gets funnier every time.
imagine getting a stop in the last minute and Reggie Jackson jacks up a pull up three on fast break lmao
"Batum and Reggie Jackson down the stretch. They played great the whole game, but just some untimely plays"
Reggie Jackson what are you doing
Reggie jackson is garbage lol
Hahahahahhahahah Reggie Jackson wtf
Reggie Jackson is getting jumped in the locker room for that dumbass shot
"Kawhi, PG and Batum who's on fire... but it's Reggie Jackson who takes the pull up 3 LOL"
Why in the hell is reggie jackson out there? Is that really their best option?
LOL What the fuck kind of shot was that by Reggie Jackson?  Just throwing the possession away.
Reggie Jackson is gonna be the death of me
KD and Kyrie vs Reggie Jackson and a Morris
Reggie Jackson Wtfff u doin
Classic Reggie Jackson play lmao
"Who's the worst defender out of Shamet, Lou, Kennard and Reggie Jackson?"
This game is a lot of attack Reggie Jackson and attack Kyrie Irving going on by each team
This was especially cool because Reggie Jackson badly missed a simple reverse right before this...Shows the difficulty of this shot
Reggie Jackson is horrible
"Reggie Jackson is tough to watch. Morris Sr is on fire, pass the ball to the open man"
reggie jackson has been a god damn revelation this year
Reggie Jackson is a straight up better player than Luke Kennard
Dw Reggie Jackson got this
I really like the clippers with pat bev instead of reggie jackson but they still really good without him
Reggie Jackson with the end of quarter business decision
reggie jackson has been so good since pat bev went down
Reggie Jackson really cares about his FG% lol
Ok let Reggie jackson stay as a spot up shooter
reggie jackson c&amp;s is the good reggie jackson
Again bench Reggie jackson
"Harden, KD, Ibaka, Jeff Green, Paul George, Patrick Patterson, and Reggie Jackson all played for OKC at some point. Am I missing anyone?"
Reggie Jackson is ass
Bench Reggie jackson now
Reggie jackson sucks
"At no point in the last five years did I think I'd watch Reggie Jackson, Paul George, Ibaka, Harden, Durant and Jeff Green all on the court at the same time I hate it"
5 guys that will finish with less points than Reggie Jackson.
He hit that game winning shot over Reggie Jackson actually. I hope the Mavs manage to get 7th or 8th seed so we can play in playoffs again.
well who was his best teammate in 2016?  Did he had any star help at all throughout his time in Detroit besides an inefficient Reggie Jackson?
Imagine thinking Luka Dončić has the clutch gene. Couldn’t be me. One game winner against Reggie Jackson was supposed to mean something?   DELUSION.
"Reggie ain't terrible, he was just being misused in a 3 guard lineup, that's what was killing the Clippers in general.  Last year Doc ran Sham-Lou-Jackson &amp; it got absolutely decimated, this year Lue started out with Luke-Lou-Jackson but saw how bad it was &amp; stopped after 10 games, since then Jackson is back in his old role &amp; balling."
"Batum and Reggie Jackson for the minimum is crazy. They looking like the ones that should be getting the 64 mil contracts, not kennard or morris lol"
"I wonder if Clippers fans get tired of watching Pat Beverley shit the bed game after game as a starter when they have a far superior overall player in Reggie Jackson coming off the bench. Beverley should be playing 15-18 minutes a game off the bench, not doing his best to drag down what would otherwise be an elite starting core."
They made up a call right after when Mitchell Robinson bear hugged Reggie Jackson on a drive. Refs going to miss obvious.
Reggie Jackson is a walking stick of lit dynamite
reggie jackson holy shit lol
Reggie jackson just licked his fingertips then whiped the back of both his shoes. This guys a super spreader
"Kinda relevant: Some players have the most insanely ineffective pump fakes, it just cracks me up. They can be good shooters and yet their fakes look the same as refs tossing up a jump ball.  Reggie Jackson came to my mind, and ironically the only vid i could find is this [awkward vid of him explaining how to do an effective pump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSlXikfNdXA) fake lol"
"This specific sequence, yes, but there are other options.  You can have a 5 second violation on the inbound. Reggie Jackson just took a timeout when they didn't have one late in the 4th and thr other team got a technical.Last Brooklyn game they had a weird inbound that sailed to the other side of the court and yet a really dumb call by the ref called a foul on Kyrie who was far away.. There are a number of ways for things to fuck up even up 5 twenty seconds to finish."
"You’re telling me CJ McCollum isn’t starting ahead of KCP, DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, or Reggie Jackson. Only team I’ll give you is the Nets for obvious reasons"
"This is what I've been checking the queue for. Best Clipper and Best Jackson and quite easily best sportsman named Reggie Jackson, of all time."
Moon Rocks Jackson. He’s not some reggie anymore.
Reggie Jackson running a high pnr I love it
Reggie “Do a 180” Jackson
REGGIE JACKSON
"Honestly, their absence really made the team come together against the Heat. I mean, you hate to see them out of the lineup, but Reggie Jackson hasn't played this good in years."
"The reigning champs still exist. Clippers are probably currently their biggest threat in my opinion though.  As to weaknesses, I disagree. The Clippers lack defensive guard help. Beverley is still good but that’s only him. Kennard and Lou both have been atrocious defensively. Reggie Jackson is not it either. A playmaker would help a lot for them but I think their offense isn’t their main ""problem"", it is their defense."
"Reggie Jackson really said ""What up, big fella?"""
You honestly think Reggie Jackson purposely went for his nipple? Whats wrong with you? These guys are teamates and have known each other for years. Ibaka was consoling him. Outside of the nba they may be friends. And im not a kid you douchebag fuck outta here.

"This all gained traction when that classless Heat announcer was mouthing off, but you can tell who hasn't been watching Pistons basketball (And I cannot fault you for that) by how much they think Blake has ""suddenly fallen off"".   His role changed considerably since his Clippers days, he went from teammates like CP3 to Reggie Jackson &amp; he gutted his way through injuries that I think have affected his long term health. So it's been a change in what's required of him &amp; what his body can physically offer that we're seeing now.   He's a consummate professional, never complains about his situation &amp; I hope he ends up getting to play on a contending team in some capacity before his time in the league ."
"They call him reggie ""nipple action"" Jackson ...."
"Sports teams with Reggie Jackson on them and impeccable team chemistry, name a better duo"
"yes I will die on the Reggie Jackson hill, I love this man more than my own family"
Well i mean. of course. When you have Reggie Jackson playing big minutes you can't lose!
Reggie did it he was able to beat Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is one of my favorite players of the past 10 years.
That felt like a very Reggie Jackson ending to this game.
"Wait, what happened with Reggie Jackson? I tuned in just as he was being held back or something?"
nuclear physicist reggie jackson
2012 OKC roster had:   KD  Westbrook  Harden  Serge Ibaka  Derek Fisher  Reggie Jackson  Thabo Sefolosha   Kendrick Perkins  Nick Collision   Nazr Mohammad
doris is right up there with reggie/cwebb/mark jackson for worst commentators
"Tell me when a team waived or bought out one of its best contributors with an expiring contract. You buy out terrible contracts so you’re not handicapped salary-cap-wise going forward (Deron—Nets), players that are playing like absolute garbage and hurting team development/chemistry (Reggie Jackson), or disgruntled old guys trying to chase rings (David West)."
"While I think Trae young is certainly above average as a shooter, LA had Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard as their starting back court last night. That's a defensive tragedy right there."
"It's unlikely to happen, but I really want to see a Clippers - Nets finals.   First off, the offense in that series would be absolutely ridiculous, they are 1 and 2 in eFG% by a lot.   Then, we'd finally get the battle of Kawhi vs. KD, which we've not really had since 2016 and Kawhi wasn't Kawhi yet then, and 2017 was ruined by Zaza, and 2019 was ruined by KD's Achilles.   Pat Bev trying to lock up Kyrie and them going at each other would be funny.   Also so many former OKC players in that series, by my count, at least 5 with KD, Harden, Serge, Jeff Green, and Reggie Jackson."
"Chris Webber, Marc Jackson, JVG (At times), Reggie and Marv Albert can all ruin a broadcast."
"Still tho  The clippers guys career averages are   38%, 41%, 38%, 37%, 38%, 36%  Kawhi, Kennard, Pat Bev, Morris, PG 13, batum  They also have lou will - a career 35% shooter, serge ibaka a career 36% shooter, reggie jackson a career 34% shooter that has shot over 37% since the start of the 2018/19 season.   And Patrick Patterson is still a solid stretch Big in limited minutes"
Yeah guard is your biggest problem tbh. Zubac is decent enough but a second center would probably be nice. I also think reggie jackson should play like 0 seconds i swear he got worse when he went to you guys lol.
Let me know how kd was in the playoffs from 2013 to 2016 before going to warriors. Yea you musta forgotten grizz and gsw series. How convenient you forget reggie jackson saved kd multiple times. Lmao
Pistons were cutting out contracts. Reggie Jackson also went to the clippers
I don't mind Webber tbh. He's not great but I don't understand why this sub hates him so much. Better than Reggie Miller or Mark Jackson
"My favorites are Breen, JVG, and Doris Burke. Mark Jackson is fine when he’s with JVG but not usually a fan when he’s on his own. Probably controversial but I’m not a fan of Mark Jones, I feel like he talks way too much, either it’s unnecessary vocabulary or anecdotes I’ve heard a million times.   As far as TNT, I like Harlan and Ian Eagle when he’s not doing the Nets. Brian Anderson and Reggie are solid. Marv and Webber are unquestionably the worst pair."
"Thats Marv ""I'm senile and falling asleep while watching and commentating an NBA game"" Albert to you sir. For real though fuck him, Mark Jackson, and Reggie there's great reasons to complain about them. I guess people look for different things from commentary as I'm gleaning from these comments but I want an announcer who's going to hype me the hell up when LeBron hits a LeFuckYou 3 in Brook Lopez's face to ice the game and not a call that puts me to sleep like I got from Albert. I want to hear that the commentator is just as excited and hyped to see the amazing play I just watched rather than a reaction more akin to drooling into your arm while you sleep"
"You prefer Mark Jackson, Marv, or Reggie? Because imo those guys are all clearly worse and harder to listen to"
Reggie is like by far the best analysis guy of the regular guys from tnt now lol.  The alternate guys like grant hill Steve smith Jim Jackson are very good tbf
I’d trade back up back up point guard Reggie Jackson for Lonzo sure
Looking at you reggie jackson
He's a lot better than CWebb and Mark Jackson definitely and some of the other ex-player color commentators.  Reggie Miller is also okay as long as you don't partner him with any ex-player.
"I'm from Colorado and I can tell you that in the early 90's Billups was all over the news here. He won Mr. Colorado Basketball 3 years in a row and just was in totally different league then everyone else.   However, there is an argument to be made that Michael Sugar Ray Richardson was the most talented player to ever come out of Colorado. He got kicked out of the NBA 4 years into his career for drugs though.   Derrick White was hardly recruited out of high school and went to D2 UCCS. I played some pick up with him at the gym his freshmen year and he was really good, but I don't think anyone suspected that he would get to the NBA. He worked his way up to play at CU though and I use to hear stories about his legendary work ethic at UCCS.   Some other notables:  Tom Chambers- Had [this wild dunk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDyBSTQDwH8&amp;ab_channel=TC24)  Joe Barry Carroll- Drafted #1 overall in 1980.  Dave Logan- Drafted by the NBA, NFL and MLB, I don't think he ever played in the NBA.  Pat Garrity- Was traded for the draft rights to Dirk  Justinian Jessup- Was drafted this year by Golden State  Jason Smith- Nothing really, but he went to CSU. (Go Rams!)   Michael Ruffin- [Threw the ball in the air that one time](https://youtu.be/gRBF3JpbnOI?t=80)  Reggie Jackson- Looks like [Bobby Shmurda](https://twitter.com/i/status/1222900051158061058)"
Derrick white shouldn't be the only active player from Colorado. Reggie Jackson graduated high school in Colorado Springs.
The idea of lonzo is prob better for us than Reggie Jackson or Lou williams tho! Heheh
KD got OKC to 59 wins the year Westbrook missed almost half of the season. They had a great backup in Reggie Jackson though so Westbrook being out hurt them less than it would've been if KD got hurt so that definitely wasn't a bad team but it was probably his worst outside of the beginning of his career.
"Im tired of people saying the Nets have no depth after the trade as if their own team has All Stars down to the 15th man. *Here's the Clippers top 9*  Kawhi/PG/Ibaka/Lou/Beverly/Kennard/Morris/Batum/Zubac   Very impressive top nine. Id say better than the Nets. Now here's the rest of their roster. Amir Coffey/Reggie Jackson/Kabengale/Terrance Man,/Daniel OToru/Patt Patterson/Jay Scrubb Im sorry if im the only one who doesn't think any of those guys are above Average NBA players. That looks like a pretty shite back of rotation.    *Now here's the Nets top 9* KD/Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Green/Deandre/Shamet/Bruce Brown/TLC  And the rest of the roster  Dinwddie/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton/Reggie Perry/3 open roster spots The Nets have the bi annual exception and a disabled player exception to use to fill those open spots. As i said imo the Clippers top 9 is better than the Nets top 9 even though its close. But the Clippers ""depth"" doesn't seem better than the Nets at all. And the Nets have money to improve their depth and all their 2nd round picks to trade."
"Notice how you said in his playoff career when I specifically mentioned outside of when he was on the Dubs superteam  Even on a really good OKC team (with another borderline superstar and a couple other top tier role players), KD was inconsistent in the playoffs vs his career in key moments.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01/gamelog-playoffs/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01/gamelog-playoffs/)  He bricked it up in 2013 vs Memphis, woulda lost in the 1st round in 2014 vs Memphis if not for Reggie Jackson droppin 32 in Game 4 (KD shot 5-21), shot inconsistently vs the Spurs every time they played and choked big time vs the Dubs (10-31 in Game 6).  Now he's playing on a superteam with players around him to help when he takes himself out of games in the crunch, **but to act as if KD has ever been the same player in the playoffs is ridiculous when the whole reason he has to build superteams is because he isn't the same player in the playoffs.**"
This Clipper team reminds me of the 2014 spurs. More chip on on shoulder and team ball minus Reggie jackson
&gt;	What evidence is there to that? The year Westbrook was injured KD won MVP leading his team to 59 wins on .63 TS.  Any of his post seasons in 2014-2016. WB played half the year and then Durant almost *lost to the grizzlies in the first round* if Reggie jackson didn’t bail him out.   &gt;	But KD was leading a bunch of star 22 year olds and LeBron the Heatles.  Nah that was James harden creating and being the focal point of the Heat’s defense.   &gt;	I think KD’s relative value has gone down because its a lot more common now for players to have high efficiency and combine that with playmaking.  Ya unfortunately he does not have the playmaking the other greats do. And it shows: he’s never had team success really as the primary ball handler and creator
"This blows my mind. I know I've Reggie and the mark Jackson/van Gundy duo are all polarising personalities and teams. But I have never seen anyone say they like Chris Webber's *commentary*. He was awesome on half time shows. To me the only one worse than him is senile Marv.  Chris Webber brings everything back to his playing days, often when it has no relevance,  he's the walking talking ""back in my day..."". He has little understanding of multiple rules (watches replays and incorrectly disputes the calls). He yells and acts like it's a game of pick up hoops on the block. GET HIM YOUNG FELLA!"
"Oh damn you got me. The clippers definitely have nobody else on their roster to add to the trade and match salaries. Their roster is only PG, Kawhi and Ibaka. Nobody else on there. No way to match salaries. Lou will, Reggie Jackson, Fi, oturu, 2pat... Those guys aren't on the roster.   Come on.   I'm not saying they should trade him to the clippers.  I don't see a better trade package than Philly could offer.  But saying it's **guaranteed not to happen** because they don't have assets or can't match salaries is just flat out incorrect and naive. We have no idea what our FO is thinking."
"That wasn’t really the issue. He literally just misses put backs all the time. Over and over. Until they take it. And then he sulks on defense and gets roasted. Sure, he may be more willing to be a screen and roll guy like he was with Reggie Jackson when he was most effective, but still... he’s really hard to watch and not as effective as you probably think."
"I'll take Marv over him. At least I get some laughs with senile Marv, but Reggie is on the same level of insufferable as Mark Jackson."
"I just took ""real"" to mean good, as opposed to washed/injured/near retirement. Ibaka, Zubac and Morris fit, but yeah, they're not exactly All-Star level.  About the PGs, that to me is a matter of skillset. This Clippers team would really benefit from having an actual, classical point guard, someone who can be trusted to be the ballhandler if necessary, because Reggie Jackson, Lou Will and Patrick Beverley definitely aren't that."
"For me, it's reggie jackson, bobby portis and dennis schroder. something about the dudes with the crazy eyes"
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
I dont understand why they got Reggie Jackson when Lou Will is already on the lineup. Get a pure PG.
"I mean that's a matter of personal preference, but Romo certainly gives more insight into the actual game than any of those other color guys you mentioned.    The NBA still has a lot of great play by play guys, it's the color guys where they struggle.  Reggie, Webber, JVG and Mark Jackson, these guys are the cream of the crop calling all the nationally televised games and they provide little insight nor are they that entertaining.  I think it's an underrated aspect of why NBA ratings are tanking."
"I don’t really understand the hate for Reggie, but I’ve never once listened to Mark Jackson and not had a bad time"

"Some things not necessarily related to the box score that I enjoyed/noticed from this game:   The refs actually did a pretty good job. Of course there's a few questionable calls but overall the game was played pretty smoothly and it was much more enjoyable because they let both teams play through some contact. This is also partially the result of the clippers taking a lot of jump shots.   Both teams helped players of the other team up after committing fouls every now and then. I noticed Reggie Jackson do it a couple times most notably.   The amount of pick &amp; pop the clippers run lets defenders hedge with very little consequence. I haven't watched a lot of their games, maybe a clippers fan could comment on if this is something that defences exploit or if it just works too well to run more rolls.   Semi Ojeleye can jump really fuckin high if he wants to."
reggie jackson not being shit huh
"We have Reggie Jackson, Lou will and Luke kennard playing defense though."
I forgot about Reggie Jackson
Boston College legend Reggie Jackson. And by legend I mean shocked he made the league.
Reggie Jackson just shot the ball at the wrong rim during a dead ball.  Remember when Nate Robinson did that and it was apparently the worst thing in the world
Im dying at that Jaylen Brown screen at reggie jackson away from the ball and just leveled right into him for absolutely no reason lol
Reggie Jackson is ass
Finally they realized they need to bench Kawhi and unleash Reggie Jackson
"Always played well, just never well enough to be a star. He is basically Reggie Jackson but good."
"damn man, what did Reggie Jackson do to you?"
I think because dame never reached the heights that curry or harden achieved. Curry and harden were MVPs and on championship contenders.    People will always criticize players proportionally to their success. That's why one criticizes reggie jackson. Cuz no one cares.
"Also predictable when Lou Williams, Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson are playing that much. They're trying to play Terrance Mann more because he's the only bench guard who can defend."
That first video is the funniest shit I've heard.  *Reggie Jackson!*  *OOUUGGHHH*
Why bold Reggie Jackson of all players?
"The problem is that he had to go to China (lack of offers in NBA) to continue hooping when guards like JR, IT, Trey Burke, **Reggie Jackson**, Ish Smith etc etc etc were still getting contracts. In the best-case scenario its a little sus and he is bad for locker rooms or some other intangible we don't know of, the worst-case scenario it's blatant racism.

It’s all on context. Look at how much his usage and ISO’s spiked since he went to Cleveland. They’ve given him free reign to post up and ISO which he cannot do whatsoever. You take out the fluff from his game and he’s a great lob finisher. He’s one of the better lob threats in the league and he’s never played with anyone that draws as many defenders as Luka (he’s played with Reggie Jackson and Collin Sexton most of his career). I think he’d kill it with Luka
Reggie Jackson is trash as a PG
"Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, and reggie Jackson are great for running point in the regular season for running point, but yall need a point gaurd in the playoffs"
"Really don't want to lose beverly.  I wonder if raps would take a package of: Luke (5.2M), Morris Sr. (14.8M), Lou Will (8M), 2Pat (3M), Mann (1.5M), and Kabengele (2M).  Total is 34.5M vs Lowry at 33.3M.  We can also give up Reggie Jackson (1.6M)   I bet raptors want Zubac though and we can't afford to lose him unless we can get another big in return.  Don't see clips getting Lowry unfortunately"
"Pbev or Reggie Jackson, Zubac, and some picks down the road? It’d be uninspiring."
Yeah I agree it’s definitely a failure they didn’t get one contributor. It’s actually kind of incredible they didn’t get someone even just through buyout. I’m no Reggie Jackson Stan but Clippers got him in a buyout last year and he’s probably be their 7th man on the warriors.
I might have to delete some Reggie Jackson posts.  He’s had a nice few games recently.
Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson playing kennard out of the rotation.
"Yeah right now its tough to watch him, I have real debates between him and Reggie Jackson getting minutes. I watch them both make so many mistakes I wince when I see them enter the game now."
Reggie Jackson finna get the cold sweats when he sees this
Wasnt that reggie jackson constesting that shot?
Reggie Jackson going to trigger PTSD when he sees this
Never forget that Reggie Jackson puked on the sidelines of his debut with Detroit cause he pumped himself up too much lol
Reggie Jackson being a bitch  Plus he deadass threw possessions for us as a way to throw a temper tantrum on the court bc he couldn't start over Russ
"What's funny is that Reggie Jackson has talent when he plays within himself, but when he tries to force it, it's really, really maddening."
Reggie Jackson thinking he deserved to start over Russ so he became a locker room cancer and we had to trade him
Reggie Jackson probably did 😂
"Nobody ever outright says they don't like Russ because it's fuel for him and he will never let it go, but plenty of former teammates have slyly commented on them. Reggie Jackson / Dennis Schroeder are probably the two most outspoken. Kevin Martin had some things to say too IIRC."
Watching Reggie Jackson play basketball for 15 minutes is frustrating enough. Imagine how frustrating *being* Reggie Jackson 24 hours a day must be.
Reggie Jackson was just frustrated that westbrook was better than him lol
Are Reggie and Mark Jackson related? They both tried to initiate a locker room coup against a superior starting PG.
Cause reggie jackson thought he was better than him for some reason lol
Reggie Jackson gets frustrated with everybody.
Reggie Jackson was frustrated with him
Russ gets a lot of (often deserved) criticism but his leadership is unimpeachable. I think literally every single teammate that has played with him as sung his praises. Except Reggie Jackson lol
"I like cam Payne a lot ever since he came into the league. First year he looked like the first good backup Russ had since Reggie Jackson, second year it looked like he had never played basketball before. Now it’s cool to see him putting in quality minutes for a good team"
"He's not better than the entirety of Kawhi's help, which is the point.   Harden only had CP3 and a bunch of role players he made much better while Kawhi had Parker, Manu, Duncan and Aldridge for years at one point, then Lowry, Siakam, Ibaka and Gasol, then Paul George, Pat Bev and a bunch of other role players who were hailed as 'the deepest bench in the league'... and that was before they added guys like Morris, Reggie Jackson, Batum and Ibaka.   Everyone considered the Clippers to be fucking stacked the moment they got Kawhi &amp; PG alone, adding all those guys in trades and buyouts made em even more stacked than any team Harden has had until now."
"No he doesn't. Mamba mentality is about more than just working out in the offseason.  Some of it is being kind of a dick, like publicly calling out teammates for being out of shape (Shaq) or just being bad at basketball (Smush Parker). Jordan did that too.   But I don't recall LeBron ever doing that to his teammates. Even after JR Smith's infamous blunder in Game 1, LeBron still defended him.  For all the ""LeGM"" memes, we've never seen LeBron calling his team's front office trash for not making a trade he wanted, like Kobe talking about the Lakers not trading Bynum for Kidd. And LeBron never demanded a trade either, as far as I can remember.  The closest there is to Mamba mentality in the NBA today is Chris Paul, not LeBron. CP3 is a perfectionist who calls out teammates on fitness (Harden manboobs) and for making low-IQ plays (DeAndre Jordan holding the ball as the clock expires in a tie game), which has led to some interpersonal conflict on teams he's been on - just like Kobe.  Lebron is more Duncan-like than Kobe-like. I can't recall Duncan or LeBron ever really having a problem with any teammate, even though they both played with some guys of questionable maturity (eg, Stephen Jackson, JR).   Lebron certainly never sucker-punched a teammate, like Kobe did to Samaki Walker. Kobe also got into fights with Reggie Miller and Chris Childs - similar to how CP3 has gotten into a few altercations (Rondo, Julius Hodge). The closest thing to a LeBron fight was him getting shoved by Nazr Mohammed."
Reggie Jackson type beat
Pippen shut down the Pacers offense once he switched onto Mark Jackson. God bless Reggie but he couldn't bring the ball up himself and Jackson just got locked up by Pippens D.  Duncan somehow won 60 games with that squad.
"I’m sick of people complaining about JVG, Mark Jackson and Mike Breen, but I know it’s the good for farming karma. It’s the “popular” thing to do on this sub. Trash Mark Jackson/JVG and you get upvoted to heaven.   Yes, I agree having a nice broadcasting crew makes a very big difference and honestly, and in my own personal opinion, I only like this trio.  I don’t like any others.. especially any with Richard Jefferson. I find Chris Webber and Reggie Miller to be boring as well."
"Lmao Luka was gettin guarded by Reggie Jackson by beggin for screens to switch all series, stop it"
im pretty sure Mark Jackson requested a trade to the Pacers in the 90s to play with Reggie
"lol during the run where the Clippers pulled away in this game, it was from scoring by Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, and Lou Williams.   But sure, let's be lazy and pretend the only guys who hit buckets in the 4th were Paul George and Kawhi."
Wtf reggie jackson. All flashy low BBIQ player
So much has changed in the world that it’s scary.  But the fact that Reggie Jackson is still rubbish is very comforting
They need a point guard. They not doing shit with Reggie Jackson at the one in the playoffs.

Counterpoint:  Luka was lowkey getting clamped for stretches when he couldn't switch onto Reggie Jackson
"What if it was just the inevitable result of a team with Jokic playing a team whose best big man was Zubac?     And the 3-1 lead was gained because of exhaustion in Game 1(coming off a brutal Game 7 series) and horrible coaching from Mike Malone that nearly cost them the series?     That Nuggets team is flat out better than that Clippers team. Jokic is an MVP level player with an absurd mismatch, Murray will smoke Lou Will/Reggie Jackson 100 times out of 100 and and Jokic/Murray/Grant/MPJ is better than any 4 man lineup the Clippers had."
"NBA has the worst announcers of any sport I've watched, both in terms of play by play and color commentators. Terrible product. I can't believe I used to complain about Joe Buck, at least he's knowledgeable about the game and doesn't shit all over modern players or sound like he's on ketamine like Chris Webber.   Let's do a breakdown of the league's major figures:  * Mike Breen: awesome announcer, singlehandedly carrying ABC's broadcast product * Mark Jackson: a guy who literally never says anything interesting. He exists to pick fights with JVG, say catchphrases, and be salty. If they replaced him with a soundboard, nothing of value would be lost.  * Jeff Van Gundy: a guy who I think can sometimes be fairly entertaining but is widely disliked. Also complains non-stop. Tbh I like JVG, but I know a lot of people really hate him. If you listen to him without Mark Jackson he gets much better because all Mark Jackson does is disagree with him and diss him for no reason. * Marv Albert: literally going senile in front of a national audience. Sexual assaulter who got away with it because he was rich and famous. He used to be fairly talented but now he just serves as a constant reminder of how hard it is to change the status quo, to our detriment. * Reggie Miller: really annoying commentator, at times he can provide some background information but really, is not close to the top in terms of broadcasting. Only reason he's on the mic is because he's famous. Some people may like that, but it doesn't matter if he used to be really good at basketball if it doesn't really improve the broadcast very much. * Chris Webber: one of the worst offenders IMHO. Clearly doesn't watch many games, makes baffling statements that expose his lack of knowledge. Then you get to the really bad stuff. He might be the least hype announcer in the league. He sounds like he's on ketamine all the time. What's worse, is he just starts sentences and has no idea where they're going, so he rambles until his broadcast partner cuts him off. It's infuriating. * Kevin Harlan: he's fine, I have no real problem with him. Not Vin Scully but not bad either. * Doris Burke: she's probably the best ex-player national commentator but to be honest, she's also just an average announcer. She's much better as an interviewer and presenter than she is in the booth.   Probably leaving a ton of people out but there's literally one guy on that list who I'm ever excited to listen to. Local announcing for the Warriors is barely better. Now, people might say that I'm unfairly shitting on ex-players and coaches for not having broadcast skills, but just like the NBA, broadcast journalism is a highly competitive environment. Unless you're calling national NBA games, then it's just a collection of mediocre talents. There's got to be thousands of people throughout the country that could do a better job than some of these clowns, and the fact that they never change it up is equally infuriating. Another argument would be that big-time names draw big-time audiences. I would ask you, how many people are tuning into a game because Reggie Miller is commentating? The average person doesn't know who's calling the game until they turn it on. Ex-players are cool to see for a moment but ultimately, most people would much, much rather have an improved broadcast experience than have to listen to Chris Webber drone on and on like he forgot what a period is. I refuse to believe that this product is anywhere close to the cream of the crop."
Steve Nash is about as South African as Dominique Wilkins is French and Reggie Jackson is Italian.  He would self identify as Canadian then British/English/Welsh.
Trade Kyrie for ~~Russ~~ Reggie Jackson you cowards
"&gt; Plus, Iverson was their starting shooting guard and leading scorer, but he was pretty much the worst shooter on the team.   You're assuming that other players on the team could have shot better, if given the same workload Iverson had.   DeAndre Jordan (76% TS) is a significantly more efficient shooter than Kevin Durant (65% TS). Does that mean KD is a worse shooter? Or does it reflect more on the fact that KD has to carry an offensive burden that DJ doesn't? Is Kevon Looney (66% TS) an equally good shooter as Steph (66% TS)? Or does Looney get much easier shots, because Steph draws all the defensive attention?   Iverson carrying the offensive workload allowed his teammates to focus on what their respective strengths were, just like KD and Steph allow their teammates to focus on other things besides creating their own offense.   If you watched the 2001 Sixers, a lot of times what would happen is Iverson would drive, draw multiple defenders, and basically just flip it up towards the rim for his teammates to get an easy offensive rebound and putback. On the stat sheet, that's a negative play for Iverson (0/1 FG). In reality, Iverson created that score by drawing the interior defenders to himself, which created the scoring opportunity for his teammates - it's as much as ""assist"" as Rudy Gobert setting a good screen, or Mark Jackson dribbling in place at the top of the key while Reggie Miller runs off 3 different screens.    In 2000-01, the Sixers were 5th in Offensive Rebounds, despite being only 19th in FGA. They were 2nd in OffReb%. That's in part due to defending bigs having to leave their man to help against Iverson.   In the 2001 Eastern playoffs, the Sixers were 7-2 when Iverson shot 30+ FGA. They were 4-5 when he shot fewer than 30 FGA. If Iverson were hurting his team by shooting, those W-L records should be reversed."

Reggie jackson is going to have a career game against the jazz    ofc
LMFAO   reggie jackson scoring against gobert   score a 3 pointer too    what the actual fuck am i watching
Clippers have some real old school sounding names. Lou Williams. Reggie Jackson. Patrick Beverly.
Are we sure the best player on the Clippers isn’t Reggie Jackson?
&gt; Trade Kyrie for ~~Russ~~ Reggie Jackson you cowards
"I expect more than Walmart Reggie Jackson, that's for sure"
Yes. Durant’s second leading scorer was Kevin Martin. His starting point guard was a young Reggie Jackson. He would’ve thrived with Lowry
"Only caught the tail end of the game, am I smoking crack or does that say really say Reggie Jackson started at SF?"
Reggie Jackson
He did pretty okay under SVG until Reggie Jackson got injured.
I don't get why reggie jackson doesn't just sit. he can barely lift his right arm
"Former hardcore now super casual pistons fan, at some point I believe in his 2-3 year he transitioned from literally only catching lobs and tip backs for 100% of his offense( with the odd fast break were his speed and ok handle for a center at the time  caught defense off guard), to trying to play like Hakeem Olajuwon on half of our offensive possessions. I don’t remember if this coincided with the start of the SVG era, but it got worse the because the offense had no flow and Drummond (and Reggie Jackson) seemed to forget how to run a pick and roll. I gave up on him because of his horrible attitude, knew he wasn’t going to change."
Terance Mann Marcus Morris Sr.  Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Lou Williams  Jimmy Butler Kelly Olynyk Bam Adebayo Duncan Robinson Kendrick Nunn   Starting lineups   Lmao
Thanks chief.  Lol yea that sounds like reggie jackson
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavaliersnation.com/2020/05/19/andre-drummond-says-he-used-punch-former-teammate-who-kept-coming-take-his-rebounds/amp/  That’s all there is in regards to what I referenced. Not Sekou, but a guard, and probably Reggie Jackson."
"Context matters here. He’s playing like he’s Joel Embiid. He’s more like Deandre Jordan. Except instead of having Chris Paul he’s had Reggie Jackson and Sexton who have objectively been two of the worst passing starting PGs in recent history. At the peak in Detroit he shot 65% around the rim. I think if he’s paired with a good passing PG and sticks to screening/cutting/crashing the glass he’ll be a way more efficient ~15 PPG scorer than what he is now. He can’t finish post ups, layups, ISO’s (anything that requires touch) but he’s a fantastic lob finished when he just needs to dunk and not finish off the dribble. I think he’d be a great pairing for a PG like Lamelo who would flourish as a lob passer with an athletic freak at the 5.   The Cavs started the season pretty well when Drummond was engaged. He’s been a centerpiece of (crappy) playoff teams. He’s just an average center getting paid as an all nba one, but average would be an upgrade for a few teams."
And the impact this stat stuffer has on the team. He's gunning for a fat contract and will play like it. Dude used to elbow Reggie Jackson until he stopped going for rebounds.
"Tbf to us, we let go of Spencer in his first couple years as a second round pick who was very inconsistent on offense. But everyone else who had big roles as starters for the Pistons all left to go play smaller roles for winning teams (kcp, Morris, Luke, Brown, Reggie Jackson). Wish I could say the same for Drummond though lol."
Another Pistons fan checking in. I hope for Blake's sake this is true. It's been hard watching him deal with the Pistons' bullshit. (that video when he's talking about how the team needs to take things seriously and reggie was making faces and interrupting???? https://uproxx.com/dimemag/blake-griffin-reggie-jackson-video-bomb-walk-off-interview-pistons/)  I remain hopeful that a few years from now the Pistons will be worth watching again. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. I wish Blake well in the rest of his career.
Reggie Jackson after OKC. Thought he was gonna become a top 15 player lmfao
"This will sound laughable, but I swear there was this moment in time around 2015 and 2016 where Stan Van Gundy's system was kind of humming in Detroit. It was the ""Form a Wall"" era, and Brandon Jennings, D.J. Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all had their own moments where they looked like point gods.   In the 15 games prior to blowing out his Achilles, Brandon Jennings was averaging 20 and 7 (including a 24-point, 21-assist performance). Then D.J. Augustin slipped into the lineup and averaged 20 and 8 until he was dealt for Reggie Jackson. Then Jackson came out and played like a borderline all-star in 2016.   During that time, you'd catch a lot of moments where you could see what Drummond could be, when he was just dining on alley-oop setups from Jennings, Augustin, and Jackson (aka, the DeAndre Jordan approach). Then again, he was still making bonehead mistakes, still playing outside himself, and as a capper, he was shooting 35 percent from the line.  His Pistons career largely consisted of easing him along, getting him reps as a means of developing and broadening his game, then finally you had Drummond deciding he was going to be whatever he wanted to be (aka 3-point shooting, playmaking Andre). He's a DeAndre who wants to be more than DeAndre."
Wasnt that with Reggie Jackson like in 2016?
"yeah, no more reggie jackson"
hope reggie jackson scores 20 tonight
"Sorry if we are going into pure drafting, and nothing in regards to fit or retaining players OKC blows everyone out of the water, even the Spurs. OKC has drafted 3 MVPs in 3 consecutive seasons. Not only that, look at some guys like Ibaka, Sabonis (trade on draft night), Brandon Clarke, Adams, Reggie Jackson, Eric Bledsoe, Big baby Davis, Luke Ridnor, Carl Landry, Corey Maggete, Nick Collison"
"Yeah this is some real sanctimonious shit.  The Clippers are like the poster child for a team that does childish on-court antics while having won nothing.   They've got the dirtier of the two Morris bros, Pat Beverly is a first ballot asshole HOFer, and Reggie Jackson has a long history of being a bitch ass teammate who puts himself above team success."
"Lol he plants the arm to boost himself towards the ball. Pat bev got ejected for being jumped into by cp3 and Marcus Morris for complaining. Reggie Jackson legit took a blow to the eye, and didn’t get a call.   The clippers, as a team, had less ft than Devin Booker."
reggie Jackson played the role of krillen to PG’s goku today
"Probably good to see Reggie Jackson get hunted by Booker like this, every team is gonna do it in the playoffs"
Reggie Jackson is the Jekyll / Hide of basketball
"&gt;Not like he already had great teams around him, good enough to be up 3-1 on the warriors  They still traded their 3rd scorer and never replaced him with anything close to the level they needed. KD was always mad that it was just him and Russ doing everything, and I'm sure that shit got tiring.  After trading James Harden they tried to replace his production with Sefolosha, Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Reggie Jackson, Dion Waiters, Roberson, DJ Augistin etc."
"Reggie had a playoff true shooting efficiency of 60% in the least efficient eras for perimeter scoring since the 60s while having for secondary scoring options Rik Smits, Mark Jackson, and a pretty washed Mullin.  &amp;#x200B;  Not saying Steph isn't amazing but he's not the only shooter to have pulled shit like this off."
"I’ll call it how it is: Blake Griffin defrauded the pistons. They  paid him huge money because they signed a deal for BLAKE GRIFFIN. Not some freakish sized Kelly Olynk, but what did they get? They got a sorry low effort Blake Griffin playing at the level of my man Kelly Buckets (don’t y’all disrespect him either-KO gets fucking *buckets*).   Blake literally conned the detroit pistons for that money and I’d be salty if I was a fan. Y’all coulda been paying that to Reggie Jackson (lol) but for real though, Blake is a bitch for this."
"Reggie Jackson, Patrick Beverly, KD"
"Schroeder isn’t worth all that money that he is demanding. Dude plays like Detroit Reggie jackson(he has actually been playing well with the clippers, recently. Harrell has been playing great! Mistakes here and there but has been getting it done"
"Small sample size but Reggie Jackson has been killing it since all star break.  They can go with pat bev, Reggie, rondo, kennard or Mann depending on matchups"
Reggie Jackson was like you ain't taking my mins away... glad to see Boogie out there hope we sign him for the rest of the season.
"The +/-'s of our big 3, Reggie Jackson, Patrick Patterson, and Nicolas Batum."
Reggie Jackson gets clowned on a lot but the man has over 2500 hits.
Don’t tell me the Blazers are getting cooked by Reggie Jackson 💀
Reggie jackson is gonna get paid if he wants to this off season. He's been so good
Unsung hero of the night for the Clippers is... Reggie Jackson?
Reggie Jackson would screw up our perfect fg% with a 3 on 1 attempt :(
but the defensive strategy they each faced wasnt the same at all  luka got switches onto reggie jackson and lou williams and feasted. giannis was goin against a wall lol
"This just isn’t even true you’re just trying to white knight. Stephen a, Chris Broussard, Skip Bayless, Shannon sharpe, Charles Barkley, mark Jackson, Reggie miller all always catch shit on here."
KD made the playoffs in 2014 with Russ out for the majority of the season and no other All Stars. Hell they won 59 games as the #2 seed with Reggie Jackson being KDs best teammate most games.
"That’ll happen when you have PG, Kawhi, Kennard, Beverley, Mann, Morris, Batum, and Reggie Jackson being great shooters this year"
"The Pistons were at the top of the NBA - six straight trips to the ECF, back to back Finals appearance and one quarter away from repeating as champions in 2005 against the Spurs  After that the owner died, his wife took over, Dumars ran the team into the ground, did not rebuild properly, gave away big contracts to terrible players, drafted decently but due to the coaching carousel never developed these players and watched as players like Middleton, Dinwiddie, and others thrived once they left.  Then Davidson's wife sold the team to Tom Gores, a coke addict billionaire who despite much success in other areas of life - can not run a basketball team.  The coaching carousel continued with Ron Jeremy aka Jeff's lil bro aka Stan Van Build a fucking a Wall being hired as a Coach/GM combo. He proceeded to put the keys of the franchise in the hands of one of the best point guards of probably the last thirty years, Reggie Jackson. Then on the eve of being fired, and supposedly at the behest of said coke addict, SVG mortgaged the entire future (or whatever was left of it) in order to get Blake Griffin.  Once Blake Griffin recovered from the shock of his premature jersey retirement and traded to the D, he actually put together a really great string of games. The Pistons had a chance to do right by him and trade him to a team and get big assets, possibly more than what they traded away. But instead they chose to keep him, he got injured (again), and was just bought out.  Now we have hired Weaver, a new GM from Presti's tree in OKC, who so far has been swindled on various trades, drafted big men only to pay Plumlee 8M to start, let Christian Wood walk for nothing (when it was all but confirmed he wanted to stay in Detroit), drafted Killian Hayes (a reach).  On the bright side, we bought out Blake Griffin, the only player besides Sekou (who you really cant call an NBA player maybe G league) left over from last year.  Something to keep in mind, since 1980 the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 only THREE times - 1981 - Isiah Thomas, 1994 - Grant Hill, 2003 - Darko Milicic.  In the past 40 years, the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 - 3 times.  Not bad enough to be in the top of the draft, but not good enough to actually make some noise.  In that 40 year period only 10 franchises won a championship - Celtics, Lakers, Bulls, Sixers, Spurs, Heat, Mavericks, Cavs, Warriors, Raptors.  I know it's a grim outlook but we did have the Bad Boys Pistons two chips and the Going to Work Pistons that forced the league to change the rules and brought home a chip in 2004. And despite the hard times im still proud to be a Pistons fan and will be till the end! GO PISTONS!"
Have you seen Christian Woods ankle?  What about Reggie Jackson a couple years ago?
"Missing KD, Russ, Harden, Serge, Nick Collison, Derek Fisher, Reggie Jackson..."
Lebron still played 55 games. And their record in those 55 games was well below what was needed to make the playoffs.  KD won 59 games in the West when Russ missed more than half the season and Reggie Jackson was the #2 option with Russ out.
"Why is it that every time I see this guy have a highlight on r/NBA, it's always some dumb alien-like shit? He's so acrobatic he legit flies through the air when he jumps. Remember his dunk during the Summer League? His poster on Reggie Jackson? Now this shit? He's easily one of the best big leapers since DeAndre Jordan in his Lob City days."
"It's true - if you remove his outlier performances and regress his stats to Reggie Jackson's averages, he's basically Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson has a chance at a ring.
He’ll go the way of Reggie Jackson soon enough...
"Why does it have to be title teams?  Derek Fischer 2012.  Birdman 2013.  Boris Diaw 2012.  Joe Johnson 2016.  Enes Kanter 2019.  And in 2020 we have a ton of guys who made contributions including Marvin Williams, Jeff Green, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson."
Cuz Reggie Jackson isn't good.
"They're obviously good, LA is way better at full strength.  Do you think Patrick Patterson is anywhere as good as Serge Ibaka or Reggie Jackson as good as Rondo-Beverly?"
reggie jackson is really bad... what does lue see in him?
Reggie Jackson travels
There was a play in the first quarter when Jokic had Reggie Jackson on him and Murray took a 20 footer.  He made it though.
"I know this dude isn't a star, but definitely falls under ugly and that will be Reggie Jackson 🤢"
KD won 59 games with Reggie Jackson being the 2nd scoring option in 2014
The only way to stop this clippers small ball lineup from getting at least a wide open 3 is Marcus Morris or Reggie Jackson going rogue and doing something dumb
"Sure I can? If they were in the east, that’s another easy conference finals appearance even without Russ, but that’s just not happening with the competitive West’s depth. Who else was going to score with the Grizz’s defensive attention all on KD? Kevin Martin? Lol it’s like MJ trying to beat the Boston Celtics by himself in his sophomore season  You want a great example of KD carrying? 2014 regular season, overachieved to a 2nd seed in the brutal west. The 2nd best scorer was a 23 year old Reggie Jackson with Russ out over half the season. Most of the team is now either retired or cut from the league"
"[Dunno what u rememberin then](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lnsqkd/in_light_of_the_recent_dameluka_comparisonswhich/go2al5b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)  &gt; Luka shot 1/7 for 2 points against anyone not named Lou Williams or Reggie Jackson in the final like 11 minutes of the game. He shot 4/4 for 11 points against Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson.  Again, superb job forcing those switches though! Great result at the end."
"He hasnt been that dominant against good defenders tbh  He feasted on Kemba off of switches tonight  And his iconic 40 smth point game against the clippers in the first round with the game winner? Like every field goal he made in the last ten minutes or so were while guarded by reggie jackson or lou williams. Struggled far more vs kawhi/pg/morris  Point is, you need a team without a small liability like kemba or lou. Because he’ll attack them relentlessly. he’s lebron esque in that regard"
"Today, I am a Detroit fan. Pistons got the GOAT ABBA song.  Bey for ROY  Grant for MIP  Casey for COY  uhhhhhhh  Josh Jackson for 6th man?  And  DPOY obviously goes to... Reggie Jackson? Is he still there?   I promise I’ll learn Pistons fans. Just tell me where to shout and when and I will. All while blasting Take a Chance on Me"
Nets have much better passing though with Harden over Reggie Jackson.
"&gt;It's revisionist to act like that had anything to do with their supporting cast and not just Russ and KD and a little bit from Ibaka.  Just keep moving that goalpost.  First it was, 'the team was not competitive'.  'OK, it was competitive, but not because of the supporting cast.'  You're grasping at straws to try to act like OKC didn't have a competitive team when it clearly was.  You can argue that they were top heavy, but they had enough firepower to be a contender, they just didn't make the best use of it.  &gt; I'm arguing they would be playing ISO ball no matter who the coach was.   Ok, so when the Mavericks won in 2011, did they win by just handing Dirk the ball and having the other 4 guys standing around?  Brooks is a terrible coach, with terrible offensive that didn't make the best use of 2 of the best players in the league.  Someone like Rick Carlisle or Spoelstra or Popovich would not have done the same.  &gt; They didn't have talent to use for anything but ISO ball. They had no shot creators and no shooting. How is this so hard for you to understand? Team composition MATTERS.   Maybe you just don't understand what you're watching and have no ability to conceive of an OKC that made better use of their assets.  Most of those years OKC had a viable secondary playmaker to come off the bench, whether it was Reggie Jackson before he forced his way out or DJ Agustin.  OKC didn't have any high level shooters other than Morrow, but there were a couple of serviceable shooters.  Either way you're out here wildly swinging at arguments that ain't there.  Nowhere did I say team composition doesn't matter.  I'm saying their offensive system was weak, too ISO-heavy, and that's why they didn't have as much success as they could have had.      &gt;Who's discrediting?   &gt;   &gt;You, dumbass.  Maybe you're having trouble with reading comprehension and ability to mount a cogent argument, but if all you have is shitty insults it means you don't have the facts or a compelling argument on your side."
"Kawhi and PG playing like superstars doesn't solve the malpractice of coaching that led to us blowing Games 5 and 6. And you can bet your ass that would've been exposed against LeBron if we'd advanced. Remember Doc deciding Reggie Jackson was the best guy to defend Luka in OT of Game 4? Or sticking with Lou against the Lakers last March? When LBJ relentlessly targeted him on defense in the 4th? Imagine that on repeat lol and the second Zu got into foul trouble we'd have been destroyed inside because Trezz didn't have his mind right from the stuff with his grandma. And I firmly believe we'd have kept Doc and his horrible playoff coaching if we got to the WCF.   Regardless though, if y'all want to paint ""getting rid of our worst playoff performers for better players"" as scapegoating, go right ahead. I really don't mind lol"
It’s a logical fallacy to say that an All Star caliber player like Westbrook would help KD get to the WCF? What’s even better was that Russ was replaced by Reggie Jackson and Derek Fisher. Two average ass PGs and you saw the results.
Lol why Reggie Jackson take that shot? Funny cause I was today years old when I found out he thinks/thought he was better then WestBrook (OKC days and now)
Hot take but Jimmy Jackson may be the best NBA color commentator for national games right now (which is a low bar to clear considering his competition is the likes of Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson)  My dream TNT pairing is Kevin Harlan for play-by-play with Jimmy as the commentator. Hope they make that the A-crew next season and beyond.
"&gt;Historically though, when you think of the greats how many of them are above 6'3?  It's not just about height, it's about total size.  Almost all the great heavyweights other than Tyson and Frazier are his height or taller, and all of them are much more stoutly built.   Russ has like a 30-32"" waist, he is slight even for a nba player.   He is 2 inches taller and ~15# lighter than guys like Donovan Mitchell, Eric Bledsoe and Reggie Jackson, and none of those guys are particularly built or chubby.     You may notice that the all-time great heavyweights all have relatively wide hips and waists (like Ali, Holmes, Tyson, Foreman and so forth who are all at about 36"" waist in their prime).  It provides a leverage advantage and allows them to pack on additional mass to protect themselves from blows.  Westbrook may have the height and reach to be one, but he isn't built like someone who is meant to fight at heavyweight.    &gt;As for the other stuff, its not that he doesnt have those, its more that basketball doesnt present the opportunities for it  Right, that's my point.  We don't have anywhere near enough evidence to indicate that he has the potential to be an all time great like OP was claiming.  Being an elite athlete alone isn't close to being enough, and the particular natural talent variables that make for a good boxer don't share much overlap with those that make for a good basketball player."
"Reggie Miller, Chris Webber, Mark Jackson."
"Well... a lot of great players don't have rings. Barkely. Stockon. K. Malone. George Gervin. Elgin Baylor. Nique. Reggie Lewis. Chris Paul. Mutumbo.   And some truly great players only have one: Garnett, Dirk, Paul Pierce.   A player's greatness isn't about how many rings they got; it's about what they do on the court.   It's guys like Stephen A. Smith that drive players to chase rings.    And then those same guys complain when players move around to win a title.   &amp;#x200B;  That said, I don't think teams could build a champion around Westbrook or Carmelo.  The guy you build your team around has to have a core drive that's going to put their team in a position to win.   &amp;#x200B;  Melo's core drive was scoring. He's said it before. If his team won and he didn't score 30, he felt like he wasn't doing his job.   Westbrook's drive is filling the box scores.   But as a team, the core drive needs to be something outside of personal stats.   &amp;#x200B;  Jordan's core drive was to score and defend and fill the stat sheet, but he changed it to winning. It wasn't enough to win the match up and be the best player on the court. He needed to be on the best team. His drive changed. People might piss on the or down vote it, but I watched Jordan before he won a title and he was a different player before Phil Jackson. That first year with Phil, Jordan changed his game. It wasn't enough that year because they needed to fill the roster first, but there was a change.   Other guys, like LeBron: his core drive is to lead and win. He puts guys on the court and moves them around and calls out defensive assignments and switches. But it's all toward the ring, not the personal stats.   Curry's drive is to get the best shot for the team. He shares the ball even though he's the best shooter in the history of the game.   Teams gotta build around a guy whose core drive is the team, not personal stats.   Do Westbrook and Melo want to win. Of course. But they also want to get their stats.   Melo has humbled himself now, and doing well by it, but the Blazers aren't built around him: They are built around Dame.   &amp;#x200B;  So if you get guys like Melo, or Westbrook, or McGrady, or Nique, as AMAZING as all of them are (First ballot HOF), then have a certain drive that is more individual than collective. You can build a champion around that."
Reggie Jackson???
Exactly. The only teammate he ever had that didn’t get along with him was Reggie Jackson and that should speak for itself.

Reggie Jackson was also trying to draw a charge. It’s more impressive imo when they try to contest like this one and the Edwards dunk.
Also over Reggie Jackson who is like a foot shorter
\&gt; He just listed all the great teammates Russ has played   I know. But he included Reggie Jackson. which is a joke.
Letting Reggie Jackson take 18 shots does not seem ideal.
And steven adams dedicated a chapter of his book to basically shit on Reggie so you know that Reggie's opinion is nothing to go off of.  Also  Fuck reggie jackson
I aspire to have Reggie Jackson type confidence
Here's a list of Prestis first round picks   Player | Pick # ---|--- kevin Durant| 2nd Russell westbrook | 4th serge ibaka | 24th James Harden | 3rd rodrigue beaubois | 25th eric bledsoe | 18th craig brackins | 21st quincy pondexter | 26th reggie Jackson | 24th perry jones | 28th Steven Adams | 12th archie goodwin | 29th alex abrines | 32nd mitch mcgary | 21st josh huestis | 29th Cameron Payne | 14th Terrence ferguson | 21st Brandon Clark | 21st Immanuel Quickley | 25th
"Sabonis, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, Darius Bazley, Lu Dort too but I guess that doesn't really fit the narrative."
"He is also credited for the spurs picking Tony Parker, selected Ibaka/Reggie Jackson/Steven Adams all with mid/late first round picks and in more recent times he drafted Sabonis, Darius Bazley(solid contributor for the last few years) and he scouted Dort and got him to sign a super cheap contract."
Plenty of failed super teams exist. Just look at the Clippers last year with Kawhi Paul George Marcus Morris Montrezz Harrell Patrick Beverly Lou Williams Jaymycal Green Reggie Jackson
this is why you watch games instead of blindly sucking off players based on stats  that mr. unreliable stuff came out after okc was down in the 1st round to memphis 2-3. They would've been down 3-1 if reggie jackson hadn't bailed out horrible performances by KD/russ and stole a game.   KD had just won MVP and was having a horrible playoffs.
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder_draft_history  I mean really since James Harden they really haven't drafted anyone noteworthy. Eric Bledsoe, Reggie Jackson and Steven Adams. Then in 2020 they drafted Immanuel Quickley but traded him for the 23rd pick."
"&gt; lol i mean you can be like that i guess, then add adams at 12, ibaka at 24, reggie jackson at 24  I mean...yeah?  It's more likely that a good chunk of those picks end up being players of that caliber, which isn't bad, but it's not what the OP is representing either.   Harden, Durant, and Russ weren't just ""first round picks.""  They were high lottery first round picks.  There's a difference.  There's a much higher chance that a high end draft pick ends up being a very valuable player compared to a mid-tier first round pick.  &gt; nephews are just out of control on this site, in 10 years im going to be reading posts about how lebron wasnt actually that good and steph curry was just an overrated chucker  Easy on the strawmen."
"lol i mean you can be like that i guess, then add adams at 12, ibaka at 24, reggie jackson at 24  imo it's kind of missing the point to mention how early the durant/westbrook/harden picks are because literally every year multiple top 10 picks flop so it's not actually that easy to hit on them and presti has drafted well even beyond those players  nephews are just out of control on this site, in 10 years im going to be reading posts about how lebron wasnt actually that good and steph curry was just an overrated chucker"
Ha I think it kinda was like that? I remember watching OKC games before he got traded and you could just tell the team did not like him. So awkward and obvious.  There were games where Perk and Ibaka purposely wouldn't pass him the ball: https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kendrick-perkins-serge-ibaka-froze-out-reggie-jackson/246648  Reggie OKC era was wild
He also cried [“tears of joy”](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/2/19/8072609/reggie-jackson-praises-god-for-leaving-the-thunder)when he forced a trade to Detroit lmao. We were competing for a title that year and he was so good for us up until he decided he needed to start
What does “withdrew from the locker room” mean? Now I’m just picturing Reggie Jackson slowly backing towards the door in the background while the rest of the team watches film lol
"Unless it's discovered that Westbrook threatens his coworkers, to this day I've only heard Reggie Jackson badmouth him as an overall feeling. Everyone else - from superstars to scrubs - has fawn over Russell Westbrook, the man.   I wonder if he has the urge to coach as dead ass he would be that ultimate players coach."
Reggie Jackson has low key been playing insane like the last 5 games or so
fuck him and reggie jackson
What in the goddamn fuck have we done to Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard to deserve this?
Pat pat and Reggie Jackson for Giannis and three firsts
"I never ever thought I'd say this, but Reggie Jackson has taken over this game."
Reggie Jackson on the minimum is robbery
REGGIE JACKSON IS JOINING THE MANN AND KENNARD CLUB
Reggie Jackson crying lmao
Reggie jackson if he wants to is gonna get paid
"his offense is terrible because he was getting touches he didnt deserve both in Detroit and even in Cleveland  LeBron/AD and the way the Lakers offense moves is good for at least 6-10 pts off easy double teams/lobs from those two guys.  Drummond should get at least another 6-10 points off misses considering the Lakers do take their fair share of 3 pointers.  That means with no plays ran for him Drummond should be good for 10-12 pts and at least 10 rebounds - while actually being able to run up and down the court unlike Gasol.  People on this subreddit claiming that those hyping Drummond up dont watch the game and only read the box score when in reality they are doing just that.  Drummond's best PG was Reggie Jackson. Let that sink for a second.  His best teammate was Blake Griffin when he had that stretch of good games for half a season on Detroit.  He has played for losing teams, with losing cultures, no quality veteran presence that demanded respect like AD/LeBron  When he was on Detroit, I hated the dude. He definitely has a overvalued sense of self worth but what multi-millionaire 20+ something year old doesnt. But he has talent, he is deceptively fast and has decent handles for a big man. People are gonna be shocked once he gets going with the Lakers"
"I concur. Technically, as odd as this will sound, the Pistons also had players that could make Andre look legit. There was a stretch in 2017 (I swear there’s statistical evidence to back this up) where Brandon Jennings, DJ Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all almost went 20-20 at different points that year and Andre was just feasting on lobs.   The flip side though, has always been Andre’s insistence on trying to do more. The threes, the iso crosses, the dribble into defenders for a contested leaner, etc. If you can imagine DeAndre Jordan spotting up for threes during the Lob City era, you start to get a better idea of what Andre’s been up to the past couple years.  That said, like Blake in Brooklyn, I think Andre in LA can serve as a new beginning where dudes with way more clout than he’s ever encountered won’t put up with much garbage."
Ah someone did reply that it was Reggie Jackson and that does make sense.
For some reason. I think thst player was Reggie Jackson.
This has to be Reggie Jackson lol
I haven’t read this article but he told basically the same story on camera and named Reggie Jackson specifically.
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
reggie jackson got one of those. big men of everything era and every level do this kinds of stuff.
"For whatever it's worth, even with Blake out, Andre was not the Pistons' first option, nor has he ever been. Pistons coaches have been variably open to trying to give Andre some touches in hopes of developing any semblance of a post game but they've all known better than to try to pretend he'd be a first or second option under any circumstances.  Injured Blake was still the first option for half of that series. Then it was pretty much anyone but Andre for the rest of the series. Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Wayne Ellington.   Andre's numbers can look deceiving; folks will interpret him as a certain option based off his scoring average. But his points are often a result of tip-ins or pick &amp; roll dunks. The times where he actually touched the ball as an option of sorts usually resulted in disaster on account of his incredibly low offensive skill (except for the few times where it works out, which then end up on a mixtape that makes him look like he's great).  Frankly, his TS%, for the type of skills he has, should probably be hovering around 65 percent or higher, because he has no business doing anything but dunking and tipping on offense."
"This. Drummond’s PGs the majority of his career were Reggie Jackson and Collin Sexton, quite possibly the worst passing starting PGs the league has seen in a long time. Deandre Jordan’s numbers fell off a cliff the year Chris Paul got traded and Beverley was the PG. did he magically get washed up that year or could possibly - now bear with me here - the playmakers you play with actually have an impact on a lob catching center?"
He talkin bout reggie jackson :D
"Buyouts happen every year and have been for a long, long time. This is not some new phenomenon, nor have the quality of the players getting bought out changed. People are being distracted by the names of these players, rather than looking at who they are currently. These players were untradable because they're not very good, which is why they were bought out. But people see that they're former All Stars and think they're still those same players. I mean, DeMarcus Cousins is still out there, but just because he's a former All Star doesn't mean he's the same guy now that he was in Sacramento. But if he suddenly signed with the Nets or Lakers people would probably be acting like ""it's the rich getting richer.""  IMO the only reason people are upset about buyouts this year is because this time they're benefitting the Lakers and Nets, two teams that are extremely disliked by most non-fans of those teams. There wasn't this same outcry last year when Marvin Williams was bought out and went to the Bucks or when Reggie Jackson was bought out and went to the Clippers. If anything it seemed like people were mostly happy those guys didn't instead go to the Lakers. This year the buyout guys are going where people don't want them to go, so now everyone is pissed."
This quote is about Reggie Jackson and pops up a few times a year here. Honestly this is pretty basic old school center logic.
"Do you even hear yourself? Clippers not being an actual real favorites? You do realize that you have two top 10 players, one of them being arguable for the best in the world? What more do you want? Nets and Lakers are comparable and everyone else is a major underdog. Just because they ""froze"" in one series doesn't take away who they are. Also you have a solid ten man rotation for the playoffs with the weakest link being someone like Reggie Jackson ..."
"I just had a thought? Who’s even the best player Drummond has ever played with?  Old and broken Klove? “Prime” Greg Monroe? Josh Smith? Corpse of Brandon Jennings? Reggie Jackson before we knew he sucked?  I mean legit it’s a really fucking ugly list, idk how people can hold not winning against this guy when the list of the best players he’s played with might not make a g league roster"
"Reggie Jackson, Drummond, Marcus Morris, KCP are all in LA now lmao"
1. Kawhi Leonard             2. Paul George            3. Patrick Beverley              4. Serge Ibaka          5. Marcus Morris         6. Ivica Zubac          7. Nicolas Batum         8. Reggie Jackson         9. Terance Mann         10. Luke Kennard
You guys are looking awesome but I have zero belief in Reggie Jackson when it matters :(      Also pray that Ty Lue doesn't play Cousins too much in the playoffs.
"wingspan and standing reach are far more important than mere height, but if we can say that most of great defenders have elite wingspan, not all players with elite wingspan are elite defenders. Reggie Jackson, standing 6'2, has 7'0"" wingspan and yet never been close to be a decent defender.  Considering how Matisse play and how he's able to anticipate opponent movements and intentions, I can see him being elite even with normal length, same as it happens with Jimmy Butler and his t-rex arms."
"He really left right before the playoffs feel like the most C-Webb thing. But seriously it was obvious he wasn't good at that job, but Jim Jackson is. Even annoying Reggie Miller makes more sense."
" No way, Reggie says the most cringey, dumb shit all time.  Cwebb is just a bit boring. Reggie actively makes me say ""Shut the fuck up Reggie""  Only Mark Jackson does that for me, otherwise. Reggie and Mjax are the worst colour commentators all time."
Reggie Jackson is something I tell you that
"Stephen Jackson was not what that team needed, and their results with him going forward made that pretty clear.  Dude was a terrible decision maker on offense.  What put a ceiling on that team was Reggie finally falling off a cliff.  Obviously Artest started out the year amazing, which is why everyone thinks they may have finally gotten over the top, but it was a seven game pace that he never would have sustained.  They weren’t favored over the Pistons coming into the year for a reason."
Clipperton Island is where Bobby Shmurda will seek asylum under the name Reggie Jackson
"Okay let's do this! Hahah  First of all, this stat has nothing to do with how many passes he receives. Literally nothing to do with it.   Secondly, let's use Westbrook to compare.   Russ has passed the ball 4,053 times this season. DeMar has passed 1964 times.   Now let's look at potential assists. Russ has 1340. DeMar has 731.  Do the math there and you can see the potential assist ratios. Russ is 33%. DeMar is 37%.  Looking at these numbers, Russell Westbrook who is one of the most ball dominant players in the league makes more passes that are not potential assists than DeRozan.  Think about that. Westbrook passes more without expecting a shot than DeRozan..  Last point, Reggie Jackson has more hockey assists this season than DeMar and he's only thrown 1500 passes total..  EDIT: TJ McConnell has more hockey assists than DeRozan"
"lmao where did the lakers get the assets for AD. building through the draft, if not the final step, is definitely the first and a major step for any team to want to be great in the near future.  case in point: you look at how the pistons were stuck in the mediocrity for so long, with blake and drummond and reggie jackson and that team wasn't going anywhere, nor was it allowing detroit to be bad enough to get a number one pick to boost their team. this year, with a new gm, theyve done amazingly well, to sign a young Free agent in jerami grant, draft guys like hayes, stewart and bey (the former has bbeen a little injury prone, but shown his potential, and the latter 2 have been beasts) and now they're gonna have the slight opportunity to maybe even add cade cunningham to that core. just seeing how bad they were and where they might be soon is proof that getting young players, and hitting on draft picks is huge."
"Yes, Ibaka was terrible. Steven Adams was obviously terrible. Reggie Jackson as a backup PG, garbage. The problem was Scott Brooks playing dumb ass rotations with Derek Fisher playing 20 more minutes a game over Reggie in the playoffs, or Beverley purposely injuring Westbrook the year they were clearly the best team in the league. Roberson was doing well with PG and Westbrook before he got hurt. He had improved his 3 point shooting and the Thunder were the best defensive team in the league before the injury.  You had Hami Diallo that the Thunder developed. They flipped Sabonis and Oladipo for PG13. This is just off the top of my head, but the ""Thunder Way"" has develop quite a few players in the past few years and you're discrediting all of them because you didn't pay attention to the Thunder."
"I think folks are beginning to see the light with Andre Drummond but generally speaking, yes, he's been an overrated rebounder for much of his career, particularly over the past few years.  For one, rebounding totals are inflated for certain players these days in comparison to previous generations. The paint is emptier than it's ever been and the few bigs still hanging around inside can generally have their pick of defensive boards with little competition. For better or worse, you're not really running into Patrick Ewing-Charles Oakley-Charles Smith front lines these days where all three are chilling in the paint bodying dudes up all night and divvying up rebounds along the way.  Drummond's also not a big ball pursuit type of guy. The defensive boards he cleared in Detroit were generally in the vicinity of the paint and often uncontested (as alluded above). If he didn't grab them, Marcus Morris or Aron Baynes or Christian Wood seemingly would have just as well in many cases.   Drummond's inflated offensive boards situation is well documented by now. He *does* miss a lot of gimmies that he then tips back in (at which point he'll sometimes miss again). However, I also think this is where he's been the biggest asset. There was a time when the Pistons had a semblance of an offense (healthy Reggie Jackson era) and they hummed best when Detroit could push tempo knowing Andre would be running the floor to convert a back-breaking tip-in off a teammate's miss in transition. *That's* why he was named an all-star in 2016; he was mostly staying in his lane and filling in his team's gaps.   By and large though, having lived through the Dennis Rodman Pistons era and the Ben Wallace Pistons era, Drummond's true rebounding instincts and skills cannot hold a candle to either of those two."
"And if Reggie Jackson didn't pull some 4th quarter magic out of his ass, Clippers would have like 3 more recent losses as well. Their record is simultaneously impressive and deceptive"
"And it’s not like OKC screws over all their vets in the process of rebuilding. We don’t just send them to where there is most value for the organization, they communicate with the players about the future.   Sam Presti has been known to treat his star players pretty well and sends them to good situations if they ever want to be traded. He managed to get Paul George to sign a long term deal (even if he eventually wanted to leave). I don’t think there are many players, outside of KD and Reggie Jackson, who has talked down on the organization. It’s just that it’s Oklahoma City unfortunately."
"Because threes back then were a fad, only reserved for the ones who risked getting benched by their coaches for taking that shot. Then came the players who were 'specialists', with the likes of Hersey Hawkins, Chris Jackson, Reggie Miller, Chris Mullin, etc. Heck, even Larry Bird as a deadly shooter didn't take as many shots compared to players nowadays."
"This! Yes Dre is a giant child who’s immature and not the brightest.  Playing with LeBron will be huge for him. He was a pick and roll force with Reggie Jackson, imagine that with LeBron."
100% thought he would be Reggie Jackson Jr and I'm happy he's become a great player.
Reggie Jackson should be replaced by Rondo.
REGGIE JACKSON OMG
Our Lord and Savior Reggie Jackson shall deliver us the W.
"Oh no I agree with you completely that the Warriors were great for KD. I just got on a soapbox about a different topic I think. My point was just that taking KD out of the picture is less consiquential than taking Steph out because that offense needs Steph to work. And using that point to show that KD just needs someone to be an initiating PG on his team for it to work whether they're MVPs like Steph and Russ or not, like Reggie Jackson when Russ was injured in 2014.       As a side note: I'm sure you know it already but usage rate just takes into account shot attempts and turnovers and with the core of their offense being DHOs with Steph and Draymond, so as a result-oriented measure of offensive share rather than a process-oriented one, it misses value in describing an offensive system in favor of showing endpoints"
"They really didn't do typical half-court offense though is the thing       Because the Warriors ran motion so much, in their default offense, Steph and Draymond had the ball the most. Everyone else made quick decision type stuff, like spot-up then up to 2 dribbles then pass/shoot/cut.       And if you take Steph out of the picture, Draymond as a playmaker loses a lot of value in PnRs and DHOs. And at this point in their careers, Livingston and Iguodala weren't initiators of offense, really just good connectors.       Players like KD, Kawhi, PG, a lot of wings that can't just run 40 PnRs every game need someone else to start half-court offense, otherwise it can get super iso-heavy. Even someone like Kyrie falls into this group. He's only really tried to be a proper PG once in his career, in Boston, and was way more natural alongside LeBron and Harden because he can't really be a ball-pounding PG.       Nets without Harden AND Dinwiddie have been relying on a replacement level player in Mike James. Clippers last year looked way worse than the players they had, but this year look so much better with Reggie Jackson and Rondo instead of Beverly       This is also part of why the 1 ball stuff for the Nets is nonsense. With Harden, all 3 can play their ideal roles in an offense. And why Harden + 1 works better than Kyrie + KD. But I would argue that if Dinwiddie was healthy, this absence of Harden would not be felt as hard"
Harden is better since 2017. Kd was great 2012 playoffs. 2012 was his best okc performance. Kd wasnt good the 2014 playoffs vs grizz and spurs. Reggie jackson saved okc that 1st round. Kd wasnt good vs gsw 2016. Gsw kd years tons of guys will do amazing in that unfair position. Harden ran into gsw 4 times with a bad cast esch time except 2018 when cp3 got hurt anyways. Hardens better especially impactwise as he elevates his team
Reggie Jackson would have made that 3 Reggie&gt;Kuz
"Yes but you have Reggie Jackson, who is arguably as dumb as Kuzma."
I like when a color commenter provides analysis though. Hubie does that and I find it super interesting. Same with Romo in the NFL. It's better than Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson shouting useless nonsense.
"They're having a historical shooting season. I couldn't believe it until I looked it up. [As a team they're shooting **41.7%** and on pace to outshoot the 2015-16 73-9 Warriors in 3 pt %.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/team_fg3_pct.html) They have **6** 40%+ three point shooters (regular contributors)+ Kawhi who's just as good.  - Marcus Morris - 47.5%  - Luke Kennard - 46.1%  - Reggie Jackson - 43.8%  - PatBev - 42.3%  - PG - 42.1%  - Nicolas Batum - 40.2%  - Kawhi - 39.6%   (To put that into perspective, the Warriors only had Curry (45.4%), Klay (42.5%) and Brandon Rush (41.4%) over 40% that season.)  They're also on pace to shoot the [highest team free throw percentage in NBA history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/team_ft_pct.html)  [Every one of the Clippers I listed is attempting more than 3 shots a game.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2021.html)  Morris (5.2), Kennard (3.5), Jackson (4.1), Beverley (3.9), PG (7.5), Batum (4.1), Kawhi (4.9)  As a team they're attempting 34.4 a game which is more than the [Warriors did \(31.6\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2016.html)   Curry attempted 11.2, Klay 8.1, and then the rest of their sharpshooters were basically around the 2-3 range."
"This has to be higher up. WB had what, 1 elite scorer teammate on each variation of the roster (PG, KD, Harden) and the rest were pretty much okay role players (at the time) that didn't really compliment WB's playstyle at all. E.g. non-shooters like Roberson, or during the Rockets tenure, who probably had the most complimentary players next to Russ, but they had no true big after Capella left even tho one of Russ's main weapons on the offensive end is the PnR into the lob. Other examples are Kyle Singler, Reggie Jackson, Jeremy Lamb, etc.  What WB needed next to him to get maximum efficiency from him were lots of shooters (for his kick-out drives), and an athletic big who can be a defensive anchor in the paint and is a huge lob threat for the PnR action. Not people like Schroeder, who also needed the ball to be effective, or Terrance Ferguson who is an inconsistent 3pt shooter at best. He needed 3pt specialists like Kyle Korver to make up for his lack of pressure on the perimeter."
Reggie '[Universal Technical Institute](https://www.uti.edu/images/default-source/global/global-heros/campus-safety-pages/campus_safety_core_page.jpg?sfvrsn=4e90ce06_6)' Jackson
"J.O'neal,  Ron Artest,  Stephen Jackson and Reggie from bench, they were torching other teams"
"Ibaka has been injured for a bunch of the season and Kennard is a 3rd stringer for us given the play by Reggie Jackson.  Rondo has looked fantastic for us, tho"
Then what against the grizzlies? Durant played like shit and almost played worse than Dirk against the We believe warriors in 2007  He got bailed out by **reggie jackson**
"Outside of Westbrook and Ibaka, go on in telling me why the 2014 Thunder were so great.   Was it the greatness of Reggie Jackson? Barely in the rotation Steven Adams who was 20 at the time? Washed up Thabo? Washed up Perkins?  Some of you guys make claims with absolutely zero backing and honestly expect it to stick. The best argument is the fact that Westbrook played half the season, but outside of those two it wasn't a good offensive team at all, it was an awful one."
Reggie Jackson
Big Government Reggie Jackson with another bailout
Where would the clippers be his season without Reggie Jackson
"if you consider that we've largely been running our offense through reggie jackson, a 3-point deficit isn't so bad"
how come Kawhi's only got 3 FGA? wtf is Reggie Jackson with 7 attempts are you guys trying to not win?
"So am I lol. Sounds like you didnt watch 2014. KD was bad in 2014 playoffs and 2016. 2014 he shot 5-22 in game 4 vs grizz. He was generally bad that series. Reggie Jackson saved OKC from a first round exit by dropping 30 pt games as KD shit the bed. Similar thing happened later on vs spurs. He shit the bed in 4ths vs spurs, grizz and gsw over those 2 years. Unfortunately okc inj 2013 and 2015 hence KDs performances 2014 and 2016 more indicative of who is actually is in the clutch without a superteam. I wont even go in depth about KDs turnover issues in 2014 and 2016. He was a wreck in 4th qs when it mattered most until he got to GSW.  KDs OKC playoff peak was 2012 but he followed 2014 and 2016 poorly."
reggie jackson trying to iso yuta only to take a bad 3 was not optimal for the clips i am not complaining however
"Gospel. Preach!  When I first moved to L.A. during his MVP year it was basically Kobe and Rose jerseys everywhere. I probably noticed all of the Rose jerseys because I'm from Chicago, but this was before Kyrie and Steph were even All-Stars. Before Golden State was thought of being next. This was when Blake Griffin was jumping over KIAs. This was Rose hitting the game winning floater over Pau on Christmas Day game at Staples. This was when KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka were on the the Thunder. Shit, I think Reggie Jackson was still with the Thunder. This was still somewhat old Kanye.   Youngest MVP Ever. D. 🌹   Never Forget."
"So rewatching it, who's fault was this, was this Reggie Jackson's fault?  Jackson should've been more towards his right to slow the cut, Kawhi had to stop AG fully committing and Reggie Jackson could've switched to Facu immediately.  But I don't know defensive sets well."
Reggie Jackson
"Fucking yes. Drummond is such a bad screen and roller for how big he is. He has 0 IQ for doing it.  He would barely make contact on the screen, and then roll in a straight line to the basket, basically running into Reggie Jackson or at least dragging his defender into Jackson.  Dude, you roll to the back of the rim."
How does Reggie Jackson keep finessing himself into playoff teams
"Ibaka is an upgrade over Harrell but he hasn't played in like 25 games, and Zubac hasn't made some great leap since last year. They'll both struggle mightily against the elite big men in the league.    At the PG position they have Reggie Jackson, Beverly, Rondo, Kennard and maybe Mann. Of those players, only Beverly/Rondo/Mann might be able to stay on the floor without getting hunted by offenses. Of those three, only Beverly can be considered a reliable shooter and he can't play 3 games in a row without pulling his hamstring. The other two are unreliable at best and defenses will sag way off of them which will really clog the lane for an offense that already struggles to get shots at the rim."
"Our best player was Andre Drummond, followed by Reggie Jackson. As shown by their play on other teams, they are high end role players. Too good to tank, too bad to carry"
Reggie Jackson = Bobby Shmurda
Well that was a pretty fucking ugly quarter. Reggie Jackson ugly.
"Entire league loves him, everyone he’s ever played with loves him (except reggie jackson lol) and KD wouldn’t even slander him when he thought he was on a burner but people still had the audacity to question him as a teammate until this year glad the narratives are finally being corrected"
"Can someone tell me why Ty Lue is still following the shitty Doc Rivers coaching playbook?   Take Rondo out, the guy who got you back into the game after making a layup, and put in Reggie Jackson to star in Shaqtin a Fool. Then take out Zu for no reason what so ever and go small and get no defensive rebounds for the last 4 minutes.   Horrendous coaching by Lue, literally gave the game away."
Reggie Jackson is so embarrassing
reggie jackson turns from a d-leaguer into steph curry at the drop of a hat and back again. one of the weirdest players i've ever seen
Big government Reggie Jackson
this kid is actually Reggie Jackson who was wished by the dragon balls to become a kid again.
No Jaxson Hayes on Reggie Jackson or PJ Dozier?
Jaxson Hayes on Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson! But no Forreal he’s the best current player born in Denver :(    Maybe ya’ll can time it right and see if Giannis’ next kid can be born while playing Denver in the finals or something.
"I mean, you don’t usually stop counting at 3. I agree that AD ranks above pg but the gap isn’t so vast you just stop counting.  Real question is who’s gonna be the 5th best player in that series. Because that’s a question with a lot of interesting answers.  Trez, mook, rondo,  Schroeder, Drummond, Reggie Jackson, boogie, zubac, kcp, orMotherfucker Jones(aka Alex Caruso)."
Replace Curry with Reggie Jackson and everybody should root for the Clippers.  People are gonna take this as being for the sake of argument but I am formally suggesting we do this.

"This is the kind of insightful basketball commentary I have been waiting for. Move over Kenny Smith, Charles, Shaq, Reggie Miller, Marv Albert, Kevin Harlan, Mark Jackson."
"Reggie Jackson was a very solid point guard at that time. Perry Jones isn’t even in the league anymore. Kanter’s minutes didn’t eat up KD’s portion of the rotation either lmfao.  And hey, you’re totally right! KD did very well in 2013 against the Grizzlies without Westbrook, didn’t he?   Plus you’re making an egregious fallacy by using Westbrook’s performance after KD’s departure to reenforce your argument which pertains only to when the two played together. Maybe sharpen up your debating skills."
"Between PG13, Kawhi and Batum I really have no idea how they label that. They’re all SF’s at about 6’8 and most of Paul George’s minutes are on the floor with those 2.  Then in his second most common lineup it’s Reggie Jackson, PG13, Kawhi, Morris and Zubac.  Somebody’s gotta be considered the Shooting Guard."
Reggie Jackson with Westbrook and KD that year averaged 12/4. When Russ went out it went up to a whopping 14/5 in an extra 5 mins per game. Yeah that aint it.
"It’s actually kind of nuts how the roster we had that got   so much credit for when kawhi and pg first got here is now almost entirely gone, and been replaced by an even more depth.   Rondo, ibaka, boogie, Reggie Jackson, lord thiccolas batum, and Marcus Morris to go with kawhi and pg.   We’ve built a pretty damn special team this year."
"If Russ could win 55% on his own he was hardly getting carried. And you’re missing absolutely crucial context: when Russ was out, he was replaced by Reggie Jackson who played extremely well during that stretch. When KD went out, who replaced him? If I recall it was Perry Jones III. Not much more that needs to be said.   Neither KD or Russ carried each other on OKC, it was simply a fantastic duo."
I’m glad we didn’t have Rondo the first half of the season. Let Reggie Jackson rediscover himself this year.
"I see your Reggie Jackson and raise you Josh Smith.   Jackson at least had some hero moments. Smith, meanwhile, [had this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZhrwS5W2Xk&amp;ab_channel=BadBoysRewind)."
Reggie Jackson and his hero ball.
Lonzo Ball and Reggie Jackson
"They are crazy close tho, Luka isn't way better just because you decided to say he leads a lot of advanced stats, which you're not wrong about however I said they're close which is also true, he barely leads him in advanced stats, Doncic is better obviously but he also has a lot more experience so we'll probably see the gap close as the years go on but you clowns act like it's comparing LeBron and Reggie Jackson"
Fake. Reggie Jackson doesn't have HoF Floor general.
This didn't get much attention because Noone likes Reggie Jackson lmao
"I mean, breaking 20 assists in a game is really fuckin hard. Of all the currently active players in the NBA today, only a small handful have hit that mark from what I can tell - Rondo, Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, and Chris Paul. LeBron hasn't hit 20 ever in his career despite being one of the best playmakers in the NBA for basically his entire career. Same goes for Harden, Lillard, Steph, etc."

"\*Reggie ""GIF god"" Jackson."
I’ve never seen Reggie Jackson play hoop in my life.  But this exactly what I imagined seeing him do every time I see this guys player photo.
It's not just 2016. He was bad in 2014 against the Spurs and the Grizzlies in 2014. He would have gone down 3-1 against the 2014 Grizzlies in his MVP year if Reggie Jackson didn't score 30 points in game 4. He wasn't good either in 2013. His numbers in OKC is basically the same as James Harden on the Rockets in the playoffs and yet KD is treated like he's unguardable in the playoffs and Harden is a choke artist. This idea of Kevin Durant being unguardable is completely false. Kevin Durant being able to shoot over anyone is something that people romanticize about.
"REGGIE FUCKING JACKSON. Down 7 early in the 4th, Mr. Shmurda rolls up and hits three 3s in 48 seconds. Boom. Momentum flipped.  Honestly love this team this year. We're so much better to watch, even in grind-it-out games like tonight's."
"what do you call a trap game where you fall in the trap and your leg is all fucked up by the trap spikes but then Reggie Jackson comes and shoots the trap a couple times and you manage to limp away, technically avoiding the trap"
Big Government Reggie Jackson with the bailout again
imagine what it's like to be reggie jackson. he sees the world in 6.34 dimensions
Reggie Jackson is gonna get paid
Reggie Jackson is big government cause he keeps bailing the clippers out
Turns out Reggie Jackson is still on this team.
Reggie Jackson doing the shmoney always makes me laugh
"Who's ready for some hardcore analysis to dispel this myth? For purposes of this exercise, I'm going to define the Knicks ""winning"" as reaching the second round of the playoffs. Seems like a fair benchmark that I'm sure Chris Paul would agree with.  From 1946 to 1953 the Knicks were fire! Six at least second round appearances (which were the conference finals in those days), and three finals losses to those pesky Rochester Royals and two against the Minneapolis Lakers (where there were actually lakes), led by ARGUABLY (as in, you are free to argue it) the best big man in Lakers history, George Mikan!  Were the 1940s and early 50s they glory days of the NBA? Probably not! But I'm sure it was great returning after kicking the Krauts' asses in WW2!  The Knicks then suck through most of the 50s and 60s, likely because they don't have Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, or like the three other guys that mattered or knew how to dribble a basketball at that point in history.  Then in 68-69, those Knickerbockers blow up and start kicking some ass, behind Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, and Dave DeBusschere! Even Phil Jackson was on the bench reading On the Road. Over the next six years, they go to the conference finals every year, and go 2-1 in the finals. The true golden era of Knicks basketball, but how about the rest of the NBA? Kareem got here, the 60s guys were old and broken, but still chugging along, and then everyone did cocaine and no one cared about basketball until Magic and Bird arrived. What are the defining moments of this era? The Lakers winning 33 in a row? Willis Reed or Clyde Frazier (I don't even remember which one!) hobbling out to participate in a final's game? Someone on the Celtics driving a cab? I think the general U.S. populace was either fighting in the jungle or too stoned to give a shit about this era of NBA ball.  Then the Knicks suck or are sporadically (sup Ty) decent over the next 13 years. They're swept in the second round in 78 and 83 and they go 7 with Boston in 84.  So from 1974 to 1988 the highlight of Knicks basketball was one good 47-win season when 1980s Melo (Bernard King) scored a bunch of points. Seriously though, Bernard King BALLED in that Celtics series, averaging 29 on 54.5% from the field. This also happened to coincide with the era of the Showtime Lakers, Celtics, Bad Boy Pistons, and fo-fo-fo 76ers, so actually this great era of ball was in a world when no one cared about the Knicks.  Literally, we still have to endure everyone giving a shit about the Knicks because some guy hobbled out on a bum leg in 1973 and Bernard King gave Bird the business in one series.  88 until 2000 was the second most memorable time in Knicks history, when Ewing came to prominence, Riley came over, they brought in Oak and Mason, and they had a Heisman trophy winner for a point guard. Over the next 12 years, the Knicks make the second round 11 times, the conference finals 4 times, and lose in the finals during an MJ-sabbatical and in the lockout year when the rest of the east was old Reggie Miller and Alonzo Mourning. The NBA in the 90s was great for one reason - Michael fucking Jordan. Sorry if I don't pine for Ewing hitting 12-footers with bad knees and Oak and Mason beating the shit out of Rik Smits and Rony Seikaly en route to a 72-67 win.  And.... the Knicks have sucked since, except for one year when they lost to baby Paul George and Roy Hibbert in the second round. Melo had like 1.5 fun seasons in New York, Amare's knees lasted about 18 games, and Jeremy Lin was good for two weeks.  And the NBA has fucking ruled since basically the 2008 finals, so no, no one gives a shit when the Knicks are good. I hope Julius Randle goes to Phoenix or something."
"Marcus Morris comes off the bench and is very good, lord thiccolas has been great, rondo has been a revelation since he got here, Reggie Jackson is more than solid, and luke kennard and Terrence Mann have been very good.  We’re a very deep team who’s bench just won a game against a good team down 6 people."
"If Reggie Jackson and nic batum are the best players on your bench your bench is weak. Statistically they’ve been bad all season until, to their credit, just recently. They have a bunch of old dudes and a bunch of unprovens. Not saying they’re the worst in the league or anything but they’re certainly not good"
"I second D Rose, also Curry and I randomly love watching Reggie Jackson"
"Yea but the Clippers upgraded by getting rid of the extreme liabilities on defense (Lou and Trez), got a really good defense veteran in Ibaka who can stretch, a new coach who knows how to adjust game plans and lineups when one isn’t working, one of the highest iq players in the league, PG has had more time to adjust after that two shoulder surgery he had back a couple years ago, they got Kennard, Reggie Jackson is playing really good, and Mann has become elite as well in his role.   Only the Lakers come close to those upgrades since last year. And the only reason I put them slightly above the Clippers is that they won the championship last year.   Clippers are better than the Jazz and Suns fully healthy"
&gt;best players  &gt;Reggie jackson
"They didn't have pg, kawahi, rondo, pat bev, serge, or reggie Jackson.  That is 6 players and 5 of which are really important to the team  I think it's far to say a team lead by like kennard wouldn't cut it in the nba generally speaking"
"Nor Ibaka, nor Reggie Jackson"
"Yogi Ferrell, Reggie Jackson, Rondo and Pat Bev. Decent depth at the pg position"
"With this being J3’s first game back, and us having both pg rondo, Reggie Jackson, and kawhi, this kinda feels like a scheduled L? But fuck it, I’m all about nic batum Terrence Mann and Luke kennard combining for 80."
Out for the Clips   Patrick Beverley (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture)   Paul George (rest)   Serge Ibaka (lower back tightness)   Reggie Jackson (rest)   Kawhi Leonard (right foot soreness)   Rajon Rondo  (right wrist inflammation)\]
"What the hell are you talking about? Since when does Durants efficiency plummet when no one creates for him? He averaged 33pts per 75 on 64 TS in 2014 MVP season without Westbrook in the lineup and won 60 games. Who the hell was creating for him? Reggie Jackson?   And Durants efficiency whenever Curry was out of the lineup was like 63 TS lol......  Stop watching too much Ben Taylor  that cherry pick stats to make their fav players look better lol. Kd is absolutely minimum like 63TS with any iteration of teammates on any team. He’s a 6’11 shot creator lol.    Also, you realize that Playmaking without harden isn’t that much of a problem. Kd and kyrie aren’t Jokic/lebron but they create a lot of advantages for their team, the offensive rating with harden in the lineup is 119, without him it’s....guess what....122. You just don’t know what you are talking about.   The reason they won’t win without harden is they sold their entire team for him, not because of playmaking. You’re also wrong about why clippers lost, it was defense/kawhis knee flaring up late in the series. u/MotoMkali"
Reggie “Italian Stallion” Jackson
Y’all really trying your best to make a narrative out of nothing. I haven’t seen one pistons fan talk shit about Blake dunking or anything. We all know he fucked his body up in that playoff run for us and we had no pieces for him. Reggie Jackson? Bum ass Drummond? FOH. I’m from detroit area and I know nobody talkin smack bout Blake. Matter of fact I’ve only seen it on this subreddit with peoples flairs from other teams. This is why I stay off social media n Twitter especially. Making fake narratives for likes. Stfu
Both Reggie Jackson and Paul George did deliver interestingly enough without Kawhi they had rly good defense on Mitchel and he shot only 4-14 from 3p Clippers might just go to the finals without their best man and suns might not have CP3 thats going to be interesting
"What you want is Gobert to render small-ball a wash by dominating the paint on the other end, forcing Lue to put Zubac in and taking out Mann or Batum, but Gobert, outside of a few good possessins in the 3rd quarter, couldn't do that at all.   As the Clippers, if your tallest player on the court is a 6'9 wing and you, the Jazz, have a 7'2 All-star Center, there should be no reason Gobert can't get 20 rebounds in a game and many more put-backs. With Conley out, the Jazz can't seem to throw him enough lobs so I can't blame him for that, but the point is the Clippers shouldn't be able to run a 5-out offense in the first place.  Batum is the biggest 3-point liability right now who gets big minutes I don't think he's shooting great on open shots, and doesn't really shoot at all if he's contested. But even so the Jazz are risking a lot by leaving him open, a risk that only pays off if you can get scoring inside on the other end. For a man making $200 million, Gobert needs to have that 3rd quarter performance for 4 quarters every night, yet he can't do it for more than 5-10 minutes.   I mean at that point, just match their 5-out and play straight up. Replace Gobert with Clarkson and play man-on-man. The only guy that could consistently penetrate past the 3 point line was PG. Reggie Jackson mostly hit big threes and Morris hits threes and fadeaway mid ranges but I'll live with that if it means a guy like Batum with his old legs gets roasted on a mismatch with Clarkson or gets switched onto Mitchell or Bogdanovic."
Finding guys like that can do what reggie jackson has done this playoffs is nearly impossible. you can’t just “get one”. the clippers got really lucky that he has elevated his game so much.
Big Government Reggie Jackson.
"I disagree with that line of thinking about your defense. In the playoffs, you are only as good as your weakest defensive link, and a competent team would be able to attack Trae and Lou on defense, just like how the Nets just murdered Brook Lopez and Connaughton with KD over and over again, or how the Jazz attack Reggie Jackson and Kennard every single time that they are in. The issue is that the Sixers have no one who can hunt those defensive vulnerabilities down the stretch. Best bet is Tobias Harris but he fucking sucked today."
"Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, and Paul George might be the best big 3 in NBA history."
Idk who wins but its gonna be decided by Reggie Jackson vs Cam Payne
Reggie Jackson got more bag than Giannis
Forget brown I’d take Reggie Jackson over Simmons
"Ty Lue has won me over playing chess with Rondo, Beverly and Kennards minutes.    I also like how much trust he has in Terrence Mann and Reggie Jackson.    He's good."
Side note - Reggie Jackson is the most underrated player in the NBA.
He also got cooked by Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann in crunch time lol. Your point?
Logic.. 2 points scored on a nice finish vs the dozens of times per game clippers players refuse to even take a shot in his presence. Reggie Jackson has been shooting incredible this entire playoffs. Sorry that Gobert isn't checking him 94 feet away...   Gobert gets paid 200m+ because he's the best defender in the league. Sets the best screens. I guess catch and shoot players are all frauds too..oh man you needed someone to pass you the ball for to make a shot?! What a fraud!!..jazz offense is setup through motions and moving the ball around the perimeter and screening and rescreening. Jazz can't do what they do without Gobert screening and rolling and having that gravity.   Difference in this series is no one can actually get him the damn ball when Don gets blitzed there's not that other playmaker capable of getting him easy looks. And also your whole small market crap; probably don't try to pin it on a team that just finished with the best record in the entire league. Maybe a thought
They are but gobert was being guarded by Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson in the post  If they can’t get the post entry on those it’s a big miss
That and Mr. June for Reggie Jackson were both awesome calls
"Gobert can't guard Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann, they could each drop 30 on him by isoing if they had to, ain't never happening to PG. And yes, one on one is much more important if Giannis could do that, KD isn't scoring 49 and bucks win by double digits"
Lol mans got roasted by Reggie Jackson
Not to mention getting driven on by Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann!
Reggie Jackson is a fucking stud. The balls on this guy is adamantium.
"He was a beast on the pistons , he sprained his ankle and sucked for a bit but then got healthy again as was pretty good. What we are seeing right now is a healthy Reggie Jackson"
Bro Reggie Jackson hates the state of Utah
Reggie fucking Jackson
Reggie Jackson is the heart of the Clippers
"The Clippers came out ready to fight without Kawhi and the Jazz looked like they were expecting an easy win. I would really like to see Conley back or this might be over next game. Paul George was really good, as much as I hate say it, and Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann have earned my respect for stepping up big time in this series. Here's hoping it goes game 7"
"Was only able to catch the end of the game, and the Jazz weren't shooting well at all at that point. Although I think it was Reggie Jackson (sorry idk Clipper players) who kinda abused Gobert on consecutive or near consecutive possessions. Brought him out to the 3 point line and drained the shot the first time when Gobert didn't contest since he lurks by the paint so much, and the second time he got Gobert to come further out so he drove in and hit a clutch layup. Great stuff, didn't expect them to get the win with Kawhi out."
reggie jackson feasting on french bread all game
Reggie Jackson is.
Reggie Jackson is what laker fans thought Dennis Schroder would be
You can't stop Reggie Jackson! You can't even hope to contain him you scrub! You have to let him get his and stop the lesser players around him! Wait what?
"Idk, I felt like PG was playing a bit of hero ball, which is what he kinda does. Reggie Jackson def helped out at the end"
If by star you means Israel asesanya then it’s a hard maybe   EDIT: I mean Reggie Jackson
"Schroder was phenomenal last year for OKC, I thought he was robbed of 6MOY. It's insane how hard he fell off in one season.  On the other hand, Reggie Jackson was an afterthought for years after leaving OKC and best known for looking like Bobby Shmurda. Now he's lighting cats up in the playoffs.   Shit makes no sense."
Imagine Glasses Reggie Jackson on the Bubble Suns
And Reggie  Jackson
Reggie “Steph Curry” Jackson
Everybody talks about how Paul George had 35 and put the team on his back without Kawhi. But nobody talks about the other players who stepped up like Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson. Also shout out to Terance Mann for putting a DPOY Gobert on a poster.
I'm convinced Reggie Jackson and Bobby Shmurda switched places that's why he's playing so well lately
Reggie Jackson was clutch playing against Gobert
"Friendship with Kawhi Leonard ended, Reggie Jackson is my new best friend"

ya man. reggie jackson and pg were so disciplined in clutch moments while jazz just took the first shot they had
reggie jackson is just wtf
Reggie Jackson was something else today
Who would’ve thought that Reggie Jackson would be a key playoff piece in 2021?
Reggie Jackson so inspirational man
Reggie Jackson is a killer
who is Reggie Jackson?🙄🤭🤔🥱  in math: my solution ➗☺️  in history: my king👑😣  in art: my canvas 🎨🥳  in science: my oxygen 💨😝  in geography: my world 🌎🤯
The defining fact of the game: One team had Reggie Jackson and the other one didn't
I want to know when Reggie Jackson became the best player in the league  Also Jazz want to complain about respect then pull this stinker. If they lose this series lol...
"Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schroeder was supposed to be, and he’s doing this shit on the minimum. I never wanna hear PG slander again y’all jus gotta appreciate how fucking smooth his game is"
Glasses Reggie Jackson is a top 10 NBA player of all time

The legend of Reggie Jackson
Who Donovan think he is?! Reggie Jackson!!!
Every time the crowd got into it Reggie Jackson shut them up. He's cold blooded...
"Role players and bench stepped up on the clips, that’s the difference. Bron didn’t have a Reggie Jackson this year or anyone that decided they wanted to play. Bad comparison."
We can't forget Reggie Jackson saved the Day
When Reggie Jackson wants switches onto him you know it's bad
Bucks lost to God mode KD on the road. Jazz losing to Reggie Jackson at home
Give the clippers their credit. Knicks legend Morris and OG gunman Reggie Jackson showed up. Playoff P too
Reggie Jackson is the truth   Dennis Schroeder bum ass wants to be paid 30 million + and didn’t even perform 1/10th of the way that Reggie has this post season
I want to see Reggie Jackson with the ball. Screw PG.
"Give the ball to the best player on the team, Reggie Jackson"
Reggie Jackson is a God. Simmons is not even a good human player
"If ***anyone*** had told me that the key to the Clippers being successful in the playoffs were Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum, I surely would've been hospitalized from laughing so hard"
bruh the fuck is a dpoy getting cooked by reggie jackson and bum ass Mann
Reggie Jackson is what? Chopped liver?
Is Ty Lue going to run some actual offense or just let PG and Reggie Jackson go iso and pray they stay hot the entire quarter?
Reggie Jackson is healthy though.
Reminder that Reggie Jackson is making 8% of what Ben Simmons is making this year.
Reggie Jackson and Paul George are the underrated bromance in the league
I'm so happy for Reggie Jackson
"OKC was so good at drafting, and that team could have been so scary. Reggie Jackson was Westbrook back up. Their bench backcourt was Reggie Jackson and James Harden…"
"If the Clippers win because of Reggie Jackson, he deserves his toes sucked by an escort tonight. Fr"
"of all the former pistons on the clippers, very very surprising that Reggie Jackson is the only hitting clutch 3s and Kennard can barely get off the bench"
reggie jackson making everyone tAkE nOtE
Reggie Jackson had been off the charts this playoffs
I'll be fucking honest before the playoffs started I don't even fucking know who Reggie Jackson is. God damn that man is balling hard.

Reggie Jackson is legit bum hunting Gobert LMFAO
"Donovan, you are not Reggie Jackson"

Reggie Jackson is who the Lakers thought they got with Schroder
Reggie mother fucking Jackson
"Oh look, it's the Reggie Jackson redemption arc that nobody wanted or asked for."
"Paul George's greatest contribution to the clippers might be recruiting Reggie ""Michael Jordan"" Jackson"
"Its one thing to get closed out in a quarter by Kawhi or PG, but they're being closed out by Reggie Jackson like he's Kobe.  Wow."
Reggie was off the bench and Stephen Jackson was starting 2 guard at that point
My Jazz just got slapped by Reggie Jackson because we had no guard defense.
"Someone had him in their top 5 for MVP voting. It was a guest on the Lowe Post podcast, and he may have had him higher I'm not sure, but I bet he was eating crow when they got eliminated by Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann."
Really bad comparison.  Statically Mitchell have 2 of the best 3 point shooting series ever. That's like if Reggie Jackson is averaging 40 points on 50% shooting in the playoff.
Reggie Jackson with the bailouts
Reggie Jackson
reggie jackson an up and coming phenom
Nic Batum and Reggie Jackson on a vet min was highway robbery for the Clippers
"No, because Reggie Jackson looked like he could handle a bigger load than what he had with OKC before he went to Detroit.  Schroder did not look like he was capable of playing the limited role he had with the Lakers."
"Schroeder and Reggie Jackson are perfect examples of what a single playoff run can do for a role player. They got hot at the right time, and have had there reputations with fans/contracts affected because of it.   If Schroeder was an FA after the bubble last year, someone would’ve beaten the 4/84 deal he turned down. After the Suns series he’ll be lucky to get half that. If Reggie Jackson was an FA *next* year, and didn’t perform in the playoffs, he’d be getting another minimum contract. He’s not though, and I expect he’ll get a contract much closer to that 4/84 number than Schroeder will.    It’s just weird when guys coast for years off one good playoff run. Can’t believe how many teams consistently get fooled off these performances."
"Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Jackson, Keif Morris"
"Reggie ""Michael 'Reggie “Michael Jordan” Jackson' Jordan"" Jackson"
"If we evaluated over a series, Reggie Jackson would have to be the GOAT this season right?"
"Reggie ""Michael 'Reggie Jackson' Jordan"" Jackson"
Yeah Luka and a worse team took the Clips to 7 games while Mitchell and the Jazz lost in 6 with Kawhi missing games. He had a way more heavy offensive load and had twice the rebounds and assists while his second best player was a 7’2” dude who can’t even post up Reggie Jackson.
Last postseason the Clippers roleplayers didn't show up but the Lakers did. This postseason it was just the opposite. Clippers depth came from Batum and Reggie Jackson way outplaying their contracts.
"That's not true though. Next season, guys like Cam Payne, Reggie Jackson, etc. might come back to earth, and guys like Joe Harris and all of the Bucks shooters might remember how to shoot again.  Or Paul George makes his FTs... or reverts back to his playoff/pandemic P days and never plays good enough to get them into a situation where those FTs matter.   Or Chris Paul might have a healed shoulder, or left wrist, or right hand, or whatever is bugging him... or he's a year older and loses just enough of a step to lose effectiveness.  There are so many hypotheticals you can imagine, but none of them matter. Even less so if we start talking about next year as if it would be an indicator for how things could have gone this year (e.g., if the Lakers are able to shore up their terribly constructed roster, or the Nets are able to get more than a dozen games to work on their chemistry... then clearly one would expect next year's team to be better than this year's)"
"It still doesn't work like that. Kawhi playing means that Reggie Jackson, PG, Mann, etc have fewer shots -- shots they made against the Suns by and large.  By your logic, since the Suns were up 2-0 with CP3 in that series, they should have won in 4. Yet, they didn't, They added a great player, and actually did *worse* with him.  This isn't to say that Kawhi wouldn't have pushed the Clippers over the top, but it is to say that every game would have been completely different, and it's all a matter of probabilities, not certainties of ""oh if you just add player X they win that game for sure."""
"Kawhi wasn't the only star player the Suns avoided though. I'll be curious to see how the Suns hold up next season, given the age of Chris Paul, the fact that Booker is playing in the Olympics, that this will be Crowder's second straight short off-season, and of course because Saric will miss next season as well (plus Cam Payne may leave in free agency, just like Reggie Jackson). Everyone in these Finals will have less than 70 days in between the last game and when training camps open. That's almost exactly the same amount the Nuggets and Celtics got last off-season, just for comparison's sake."
"even if they were healthy, none of them were gonna play like Reggie Jackson, Morris, Mann, zubac, or batum did. also clips didn't even have ibaka.  They're just a much better put together team."
"So Mavs would beat the Suns then by that logic since they took Kawhi + PG to 7?   Basketball just doesn't work like that. The other guys for teh Clippers really stepped up, Reggie Jackson probably doesn't average 20 if Kawhi is in/"
You’re shitting on him now but that seems to be because of hurt feelings. Objectively he’s shown he can defend better than Clarkson. At his best shoots the same and facilitates the same. Overall he’s a 15-20 mil guy not the 25 he wants. He should’ve taken the Lakers offer. Maybe Lakers fans are glad he didn’t. I’d compare him with Reggie Jackson. Slightly worse scorer slightly better defender when both are fully engaged. Also he’s only 27 which is beneficial because you know he won’t drop off from reduced athleticism.   Again 18 mil is the target. More is an overpay less is a good deal. Assuming you get him to play at 100% in a good system fit (which isn’t hard because combo guards fit most teams)
"We'll never know how either team would have done against other/healthier opponents, but I always think it's a lazy and naive take to assume the outcomes would have been different (or at least, to assume so strongly.. maybe it goes from a 60/40 chance to a 30/70 chance, but people acting like Suns/Bucks had 0% chance).  It's the classic trap that NFL fans fall into coming into a new season. They focus on where they improved from last year without accounting for where they'll naturally get worse (either from age, injury, regression to the mean, lost players in FA). It's like ""our secondary was our only hole, and we drafted 2 corners early in the draft, so our team is complete!"" while ignoring new holes that will form. Or in the NBA, it's like ""Kawhi is good for 30 points and we lost by way less than that, so clearly we'd win if we add his 30 points""  Kawhi may have tipped the series, but his shots would have to come from somewhere. Reggie Jackson was going nuclear on this playoff run, so would he have had the same opportunity if Kawhi's taking a steady diet of shots? Who knows, but that's the point.. so why argue over hypotheticals."
Does this not remind you of Reggie Jackson going to Detroit?
Jaxson Hayes tapping his head after that dunk on reggie Jackson
"And that's coming from a guy who would take Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson or John wall over Kyle Lowry. Absolutely garbage take. Basketball is more than regular season offence. What other PG in the last 50 years can be switched onto an all star 7 foot centre and make them pass the ball out instead of posting up? What other PG of this generation can take a charge, get a steal, hit a long range pull up 3, and run a pick and roll alley oop to perfection all in a 3 min span - and that's a normal night for him? Have you ever actually watched an NBA game before? My god."
"Steph, Westbrook, CP3, Kyrie, Lillard and Conley, I'll give you those. Rose, Kemba, John Wall and Reggie Jackson are not better. Put some more respect on Lowry's name. He's ringed up, he's getting a statue and his ass is much fatter. He has more career playoff wins, none of the other four have even made the finals (Jackson didn't play during the Thunder Finals run, I checked) and his career regular season stats crushes them too. If you want to ask what he's done lately, the Raptors had the second best record in the league in 2020, and his last game of 2021 had him put up 37 against the full strength Lakers. He's the greatest Raptors player ever."
"Rose is even better than him. Steph Westbrook cp3, Kyrie, Lillard, Conley, kemba and johnwall Reggie Jackson,"
Kuzma will keep his hair the same color all season  Embiid wins Most Improved and has a stat line 40 10 and 8 for the season but doesnt get MVP  Reggie Jackson wins his first MVP averaging 44ppg 10reb 9 assists on 70% from the field and 55% from 3  Thybulle wins DPOY  6th Mann of the year   Kawhi will be available at some point during the season  Yeah it is fun to say crazy stuff bordering on lunacy
"Yea I know that’s the case for a majority of fans, it just seems like the media hasn’t covered it very much, which I can’t say I blame them for given that they probably don’t want people to feel like the finals are diminished in any way. For me as a basketball fan in general it’s been a great series, but for casual fans who are more inclined to watch big market teams/stars they probably don’t want to remind people that both teams are here largely owing to major injuries to other teams.   Just like us beating the heat last year, you can only play who’s in front of you, and people usually forget the context after awhile. But I think some people got a little over their skis crowning the suns after the first two games of this series when they played a very even series against a Clippers team with Reggie Jackson as their second best player lol. They could still very easily come back from the 3-2 deficit and earn the title, and if they do I’m sure CP3 won’t give two shits about how it came about lol. But they were still extremely fortunate to play 3 straight series + the early part of this Finals with the other team’s best  and/or second best player missing or very limited."
"Reggie Jackson 2020-2021  * 10.7 PPG * 3.1 AST * 2.9 TRB * .554 EFG * 3.7 WS in 67 games  Kyle Lowry 2020-2021  * 17.3 PPG * 7.3 AST * 5.4 TRB * .546 EFG * 4.1 WS in 47 games  Even if you switch to per 36 numbers Kyle is comfortably ahead. If you're arguing that you'd rather sign Reggie for the next 5 years, fine.  Reggie had a good playoffs, but Kyle Lowry is comfortably several notches better than Reggie Jackson. [Expert opinion and upcoming contract value](https://theathletic.com/2713807/2021/07/19/2021-nba-free-agency-point-guard-rankings-by-bord-chris-paul-kyle-lowry-top-a-deep-field/) will bear that out."
Yeah that's what I'm saying.  Reggie Jackson stepped up his game this year to the level that he's better than Kyle Lowry.
"Lowry isn't as good as Reggie Jackson.  Kyle Lowry, is not as good as Reggie Jackson.  KYLE LOWRY, is less GOOD than REGGIE. JACKSON. is what you're saying."
Look at Reggie Jackson on a minimum contract compared to his contract before.  Any team would like a hard-screening big like Adams...teams just (fairly) hate the price tag
"Clippers are far better.  I don't think it is even close frankly.  Siakam was not even close to Paul George, Lowry isn't as good as Reggie Jackson, and neither is the rest of the supporting cast of the Raptors.  Kawhi carried the Raptors team far more than he did the Clippers."
"Completely wrong.  Siakam was nowhere near as good as Paul George.  The rest of the Toronto supporting cast isn't as good as what the Clippers have.  And Ty Lue is a far better coach than Nick Nurse.   Yes Patrick Beverly isn't as good as Jrue, but Reggie Jackson is."
He wasn’t used well but he also has majors flaws in his game. He could never take advantage of mismatches in the paint. He couldn’t post up Reggie Jackson
"Kawhi is way too strong for Porzingis to try and back down, he's got bad handles so it's cookies everytime if he tries to dribble near those klaws as well, so his only option is to try and shoot over him tbh. I could see why he'd struggle there.   Not torching Reggie Jackson is another story though."
"Nobody is doubling KP in the post lmao, even Reggie Jackson can defend him"
He couldn’t back down Reggie Jackson or Rondo. That’s some weak ass Kleenex bullshit for a guy who is a foot taller than both of them.
"Reggie "" goggles"" Jackson and bobby ""POTUS"" portis"
If we sign Schröder even for a cheap contract I'll riot.  I'm not too high on other names either but at least they'd solve our playmaking problem for a while.   And I don't see the name of Reggie Jackson here. I'd love to see him on a team friendly contract. He showed he'd be excellent as a secondary playmaker. Is he that worse than Dinwiddie for example??
Reggie Jackson
Jrue “Federal” Holiday   Reggie “Big Government” Jackson    John “Bicameral Legislature” Collins
"Meh, I don’t think people should have a problem with that.   It’s like the Porzingis Reggie Jackson thing. Reggie didn’t actually lock up Porzingis but one possession of him not backing him down was a microcosm of the series."
Yep he just passed reggie jackson (58) yesterday with 59 threes.
"Yes, Reggie Jackson I think? Weren't they divided because he wanted to start over Russ and I'm sure he had a dude or two on his side. Other than that I don't think so"
He's been a liability on that end the whole playoffs minus the Denver series  Reggie Jackson was fucking him up too
Pat Connaughton has turned into Playoff Reggie Jackson
That’s Reggie jackson
lmaoo reggie jackson catching strays
"Didn't ""go off"" like I was expecting. The biggest thing is people just watching the ball. That's not the main part of defence for most players. You're usually off ball on defense, you have to make an impact there.  Watch Reggie Jackson against Phoenix, particularly games 2/3 I think. He's not someone known for their defense, but he's doing so much off ball to execute the scheme."
Well it ain't the Clippers (though I do like the odds of Kawhi + PG's non-shooting abilities + Reggie Jackson being all hot at once) and it ain't the Kawhi Raptors. I think the whole reason to have a big 3 is that you don't want to bank on any 2nd star's consistency.
Where does playoff Reggie Jackson fall between these two for you?
Can you ever overpay Reggie JackSon?
It’s Reggie Jackson SZN
"Because the 2 wings taking turns on offense doesn't produce as good of an offense as everybody thinks it should. Yeah the Jays put up stats, but their O-Rating isn't THAT great. Neither of them is a natural playmaker who knows how to create for others (though Tatum has made tremendous strides in this department), and neither of them understands how to approach a game from the standpoint of picking your spots of *when* to score.  You need some player who can provide a threat at the rim and getting downhill, and it's unlikely to be either of the Jays because Tatum struggles to gain separation and Jaylen's handle is too loose.   Everybody likes to compare us with the Clippers, well look how important Reggie Jackson turned out to be for them this year. They don't get to the WCF without him."
And then we end up overpaying Reggie Jackson.
How come PG did more with Reggie Jackson than Dame could do with CJ
"Reggie Jackson, your team, your family, and your country needs you now more then ever. God speed soldier."
"nice try basketball gods, but no way i’m falling for this. the knicks are clearly going to just overpay reggie jackson in free agency."
What about when he was guarded by Rondo and Reggie fuckin Jackson? Was high post fadeaway the plan?
"Disagreed. Dallas would be my pick for the finals if they had gotten past the Clippers. You replay those last two games against the Clippers and most of the time Dallas win 1.  Utah had no answer for Reggie Jackson driving. Luka would have done some very bad things to their perimeter defense. And Porzingis is far better against another big than against small ball due to his high center of gravity. He would have been a serious factor against Rudy and Ayton.  Suns could best them, but after playing both I definitely felt Dallas was better.  All of this is because of how special Luka is. Prime Dirk wasn't doing this."
"Mark was also insufferable during the ESPN 30 for 30: Winning Time episode on the Pacers-Knicks rivalry.  During game 1 of the 95’ ECSF, Reggie Miller famously hit those two 3 pointers within a couple seconds, and then John Starks missed 2 clutch free throws.  Reggie Miller promptly made two clutch free throws right after that and Indiana won.   Mark actually said “the difference between Reggie and John was that I was in his ear,  hyping him up, like Bundini Brown used to do for Muhammad Ali”.  That’s right, Reggie fucking Miller, a 90% career FT shooter and famed clutch shooter, made those free throws because of him.  And he of course says it with that smug voice and tone that epitomizes him.  I’m so glad the [Warriors fired him](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/mark-jackson-fired-golden-state-warriors/) my team might be ringless since 75’ if they kept him and his utter distaste for ball movement and team unity."
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"Reggie Jackson,  Your country needs you."
Reggie Jackson if they actually want to win.

"That's what you get for advancing to the finals. If you hadn't, we would still be talking about (read: dealing with idiots asking) whether or not Reggie Jackson is better than Paul George."
Middleton isn’t slightly better than Paul George. Paul George finished the one seed with Reggie Jackson as his sidekick and challenged this suns team as the obvious focal point of their defense.
"Oh god so much worse. No Kawhi and Reggie Jackson &amp; Batum are free agents. Unless we get OKC Paul George (which is still totally possible) or we figure out a trade for someone like Kyle Lowry, we will be fighting just to not be in the play-in next year"
I feel goggle Reggie Jackson is better
Reggie”Michael ‘Reggie Jackson’ Jordan” Jackson
What's wrong with Reggie Jackson he was great in the playoffs
PG13. bro went crazy that game with his best guy out(excluding reggie “michael jordan” jackson)
The goat Reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson would like a word
"Reggie Jackson isn’t a shit guard. Trust me, I wish he was that series."
Unfortunately they’ll be using whatever money they have on Reggie Jackson. They can’t afford to bring back everyone when other teams around the league can offer more $
"I have a totally crazy idea, which almost surely won't happen, but I'd totally be curious to hear what people think about it: some kind of trade centered around Paul George for Ben Simmons. The Sixers 100% would need to include a lot more to make this happen (Maxey and Thybulle and probably some unprotected 1sts), and the reason why Philly would do it should be obvious, but here's my thinking on why the Clippers should consider it:  The Clippers are very much at a crossroads right now, with a team short on assets and cap space and a closing championship window. A lot of the key players from their rotation this year may not be there by the time Kawhi is healthy again (presumably by the start of the 2022-23 season), or may be greatly diminished by age. Reggie Jackson and Batum are both free agents whom the Clippers don't have Bird rights to, so they could be gone this summer. Pat Beverley and Rondo will both be free agents next summer, and both are getting up there in age (Beverley will be 34 by then, Rondo will be 36). Marcus Morris will also be 33 by the time that season starts. Would PG and Kawhi still be a championship contender with much of this same roster 15 months from now? Maybe, but it's definitely not a guarantee.   Now imagine what the Clippers roster might look like at the start of the 2022-23 season if they traded PG for Simmons, Maxey and Thybulle along with a couple picks. For one thing they would have a really good young core, with Simmons, Mann, Maxey, Thybulle, Kennard and Zubac, with Kawhi as the superstar and Morris as a solid vet. Additionally they'd have picks to either use in trades or to replenish their roster with. In short, their window would be opened again with some kind of a bright future going forward.   Like I said, it's probably crazy and doubtful it would even get explored, but just something I thought about."
"Ibaka just had back surgery so it's possible he too could miss all of next season (MPJ missed his whole first year in the NBA after getting back surgery), and Reggie Jackson and Batum are probably going to leave in free agency. It won't be the same team that was playing against the Suns next year."
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
"Nah, we have options to still be competitive. Title aspirations are out the window this year though.  We have early bird rights on Reggie Jackson and I think there actually is a nonzero chance he signs the early bird offer sheet, or if he walks we could put together a package of one of Kennard/Rondo with Ibaka in a sign and trade close to the figure Dinwiddie is gonna want in free agency this summer. Kennard is a higher number but Brooklyn might want a pure distributor to mix in more than they want another defensively limited jumpshooter.  Aside from that Batum and Cousins probably come back because they're vet min guys in the league at this point and I think they both really enjoyed Lue's locker room this season. So our rotation would tentatively (if things go out way)  Starters: Dinwiddie/Reggie, PG, Morris, Batum, Zubac  Bench: Bev, Mann, whoever we keep between Rondo or Kennard, Boogie, our FRP this year (hoping we grab a guy who immediately contributes), and then into the bargain bin for a taxpayer MLE guy and vet mins to fill in the spaces.  Our bench looks a little wonky, I'd like to see Mann in the starting 5 for one of Batum or Morris so the second unit steadies out a little more, and you could argue we should maybe pursue a more mobile big (Ive seen whispers on twitter about Myles Turner being available) but as long as we get an average year of PG's prime we should be at least a 6-8 seed imo. MVPG would be a bonus and I think we could sneak into the top 4 if that happens"
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
Yeah I mean are we sure that Fox isn't just Colin Sexton or Reggie Jackson with better pr.
"Yeah other promises have been made by the Thunder before and they’ve usually been true: Josh Huestis, Reggie Jackson, and Cam Payne. Look for Cam Thomas on the Thunder in that case."
So reggie jackson mvp szn??
"To trade for Wall the Clippers would have to send Kennard, Beverley, Rondo and Yogi Ferrell just to make the salaries match. And with Reggie Jackson likely to leave in free agency that would leave Wall as the only point guard on the Clippers roster. With Kawhi and Ibaka both likely to miss all of next season and with Batum also likely to leave in free agency, that also would mean that the only players the Clippers would have for next year would be PG, Wall, Morris, Mann and Zubac, with Daniel Oturu being the only guy off the bench. They'd still be over the cap, so no way to sign any free agents (other than with the taxpayer MLE of $5 million and vet minimums). They do own their own pick this year (25th), but that's the only pick they have in the draft.   TL;DR - I think it's highly unlikely they trade for John Wall."
Why would they need to tank? They got a squad.  Reggie Jackson is going to be an all star.
"With Kawhi likely out for next year and Reggie Jackson likely gone, I wonder what happens next for us. I don't think we'll be within the contenders, but at the same times I can't see the front office pulling a GSW and just tanking during off-years."
Reggie Jackson too.
Reggie Jackson would like a word
"Can they secure a top 4 seed though? They'll likely lose Reggie Jackson, and I don't see PG alone getting past a top 4 seed in the west. Also have to consider that they had Kawhi for more games in the playoffs than they didn't, and PG was still absolutely gassed by the end. If he is having to do that carry job from game 1? Very low odds they make it past round 1, pretty much none they'd make it past round 2."
"&gt;Why would he leave LA?  When he left Toronto part of the reporting was that he apparently felt like they didn't have a realistic chance to win again. If Kawhi is going to miss this season, as looks likely, it's possible he may not feel like he'll have a realistic chance of winning as a Clipper, considering Ibaka's back surgery, the age of Morris, Beverley and Rondo, the likelihood that Reggie Jackson and Batum leave in free agency, and the fact that the Clippers have no tradeable picks or cap space to help improve the team.   Kawhi may just opt in this summer to that last year of his deal, see what the Clippers do without him and then check the landscape next summer and see if there's a better situation for him. We don't know for sure if just being in LA is his only concern, especially if the Clippers aren't ever going to be contenders."
"Sure about that, especially before any moves are done? GSW gets back Klay w/o any moves. Pelicans will improve. TWolves may add Simmons. Pop always has something up his sleeve. Kings have a shot at 8 with improvements. The only 2 western teams you can write off are the Rockets and the Thunder (if neither makes trades). I don't see the Clips making it unless Mann makes a major leap. PG isn't good enough to carry scraps to a berth. Reggie Jackson ain't sticking around for cheap again."
"Guess this means they need to keep Reggie Jackson now, right?"
Is it a coincidence Reggie Jackson played like a star the year Shmurda was released from prison??
Reggie jackson. Called Bobby because he looks like the rapper Bobby shmurda
Honestly I could see a Sign and Trade happening. With the Clippers -  Reggie Jackson sign and trade for Lonzo
"Gobert is still protecting the rim, what? Ingles/Bogdanovic should rotate off of their man to closeout the open corner, while Clarkson recovers and Gobert is still under the basket.   &gt;Clippers shoot 80% at the rim and probably get FT's too  I mean, Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann went straight at Gobert at still bitched on him.   &gt;Clarkson should learn to stay in front of Reggie fucking Jackson  You're acting like Reggie Jackson wasn't one of the hottest players in the playoffs this season. Gobert isn't at fault, but if he's not versatile enough to closeout and recover on his own, he's not the best defensive player in the NBA. And he can't even punish the Clippers 5 out rotation on offense unless he's being spoon fed easy lobs that Andre Drummond could catch lol"
So rotate to the corner and let the clippers shoot 80% at the rim and probably get fts too  Clarkson should learn to stay in front of Reggie fucking Jackson instead of expecting gobert to cover 2 people who are 20ft apart
"When your perimeter players get beat off the dribble and are funneling them into your 3x DPOY Gobert, they shouldn't be waiting under the basket acting like they're going to help protect the rim more than Gobert. Rotate and cover the open man. Look how many times Clarkson gets beat by Reggie Jackson then does absolutely nothing except stare at the open man."
"I was sooo pissed I don't watch this live. I had a feeling Terence Mann was gonna go off one of the next few games. I saw the Jazz have a huge lead by halftime, said to myself ""Okay it's getting late I'll stay up for game 7 though"" and turned off the TV.   Wake up next morning to check the box score, Terence Mann has 39 points, and apparently along with Paul George, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Beverley they 3-pt barraged the Clippers to victory and abused Rudy Gobert"
"They need to have either the charisma to pull it off, or have earned the right to be cocky.  Kobe and MJ being cocky?  Cool.  Reggie Jackson thinking he should be the starting point guard as a rookie?  It’s a no from me dawg"
Watching Reggie Jackson torch the Jazz 2021 was something special
Reggie Jackson.
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
i was being cheeky but i agree with that. his defence is fairly passable now though he’s not gonna become amazing on that end.  the most important thing is to play next to a borderline star (like reggie jackson level) and have teammates that can convert his dishes
"Terrence Mann, Reggie Jackson, Batum. clippers guys stepped up big   Cameron Payne, PJ Tucker, Gallonari, Kevin Huerter"
Reggie Jackson went from role player to key player due to injury.   For me it’s Galo
Can’t wait to see batum and Reggie Jackson . What a dynamic duo
"the early 00s Indiana Pacers were FIERCE.  Pre-Malice they were the title favorites and had a squad of dudes you would not want to mess with.  Prime Jermaine O'Neal was a monster, Ron Artest was right there with Ben Wallace, KG &amp; Duncan as the best defender in the NBA &amp; was clearly the best perimeter defender, Stephen Jackson was extremely gritty and they still had Reggie Miller.  They were tough MF'ers that you always hated to see your team play against."
"About to have a career year with the Clips.   Ty Lue is great for scoring guards, revitalized Reggie Jackson, turned around Jordan Clarkson’s career in Cleveland according to him.   Thing is Clips have so much 3-point shooting even without Kawhi that as long as Bled can still beat his man off the dribble, it’s gonna be easy pickings for him."
"Honestly when Bledsoe was on the Pels I was clamoring for a Bledsoe/PatBev swap - it's a low margin move that made sense for both parties.  Bledsoe is a flawed player but two things he does pretty well are make plays and play defense. Ideally, he's a lateral move defensively compared to PatBev. He also averaged 6 assists a game during his final playoff run with the Bucks and I imagine on a contender he'd put in the same amount of effort.  He's great at driving to the rim too, which will be easier to do in the regular season if he's surrounded by shooters (which isn't a lot to ask with a healthy Ibaka).  As shown by last seasons playoffs - Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann made PatBev expendable especially when you consider PatBev's injury issues. I imagine that with a healthy Kawhi that the Clips will still go with their small-ball 5-out lineup and Bledsoe will not be a part of that, but he's a solid guy to soak up regular season minutes and I really like the move for them."
"For some reason I felt really bad and actually pretty sad for Artest. It’s so clear that he’s just wired *differently*, and he obviously needed (still needs? Idk) **a lot** of help with his mental health issues.   I definitely felt bad for O’Neal and Reggie - Reggie especially, because this team was stacked and could’ve won it all, and nobody on that team deserved it more than him.   This also made me love Stephen Jackson. My boy takeaway was that he’s a real one for sure.   And finally:  -	fuck David Stern, who was basically a dictator with how he ran the NBA and should never have been allowed to dole out those insane punishments.  -	Fuck the clearly racist media/pundits/talking heads that threw fuel into the fire.  -	And, fuck a majority of the fans in that stadium for being the pieces of shit that allowed this entire event to snowball out of control."
Two of those possessions they were able to get the switch and it was Duncan on Reggie Jackson lol.
"Reggie ""Bobby Shmurda"" Jackson"
"The Thunder had Reggie Jackson, Kevin Martin and Serge Ibaka. We had Parsons and Patrick Beverley. The Thunder were significantly better than us even without Westbrook, especially accounting for the fact that Harden was just a lower tier all-NBA guy at the time."
"Sure, but are you *really* going to say that ankle was the main reason you lost the series when all of the following happened **post-Kawhi injury**?

Y’all didn’t lose because of that - **y’all lost because the team played like shit**."
"ok series is 2-2. no conley for Utah, no Kawhi for the Clippers. I think we know which team is missing a much better player.  The last game, the Jazz are up a bunch. Utah gets cooked by Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson.   I'd go for the whole ""Mitchell was dealing with an injury"" thing if dude didn't average 35 that series"
"I’m pretty sure that Rozier could have signed more next off-season. It’s the same reason that Zach LaVine hasn’t signed a contract extension with the Bulls yet. If LaVine and Rozier wait till free agency, then they can sign a new contract using bird rights. A new contract would not have the same limits as a contract extension (I think it’s current salary * 1.25 or something), because Bird Rights basically means a team can re-sign a player to any contract, no matter their salary cap situation.   You may be thinking of the situation that Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne were just in this off-season. They had to negotiate a contract extension, instead of a new contract, because the Clippers and Suns didn’t have Bird Rights for the players. If Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne had played for those teams for at least 3 seasons, then those teams could have offered as much money as they wanted (up to the Max of course).   The NBA Cap Rules are confusing as shit."

"&gt; And even without Kawhi the Clips played well in the postseason. So I expect them, the Lakers, the Suns, the Warriors, the Jazz, and the Mavs to make it, barring any further injuries  So basically you’re expecting PG to average 30/11/6 and Reggie Jackson to average 21/4/4?"
"Only people who watch the team would know, a big reason for our drop off is that Kemba could no longer get to and finish at the rim like he used to, and those rim attacks were a big part of our offense. Jays as great as they are are more shooters than slashers. We need a guard that can get to the rim and facilitate drive/kick, not dissimilar from what Reggie Jackson just did for the Clippers.   And as good as Kyrie was, IT was more effective for us because of his insane pressure on the rim. He was a much more natural partner for Horford, whom we brought back and should facilitate Schroder having a career year.   I really hope Udoka finds a way to pair the 3 of Schroder/Richardson/Horford together, think Horford can really help those 2 get their games on track with the space he opens up for them to do what they do best, drive."
"Not saying they would've won the chip, but they could've been serious contenders. 04-05 Pacers had two players scoring 24+ ppg (Artest &amp; O'Neal) and three players scoring at least 15 ppg (Jackson, Tinsley &amp; Reggie Miller).  Just for comparison sake, 04-05 Spurs only had one player that made even 20ppg (Duncan - 20.3), and two players make more than 15ppg (Manu and Tony Parker), and their next highest scorer Glenn Robinson (10ppg) only played nine games.  If that doesn't indicate to you that the Pacers would have been a serious threat then I don't know what your criteria is..."
"This is the perfect list. Especially that Pacers team that had Reggie, Artest, Jackson, Jermaine, Tinsley, and Foster. Their team was so talented and deep that season that they still made the 2nd round of the playoffs even with the suspensions. The Pacers were ahead of the Detroit Pistons who reached the ECF that year before the Ben Wallace and Artest event."
"LA is way better than OKC, they're a historically great 3pt shooting team and are coached much better.  Reggie Jackson also pretty much carried the team, whereas WB dragged them down."
Nah. People are overrating how much PG13 carried them over 1 series and how much of a fluke Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann were.  Play In game at best
He looks fine to me. His teeth was what made him ugly. Now that he has them fixed he looks like a normal dude.  Ugly to me is Reggie Jackson.
He ain't no Reggie Jackson or Kobe Bryant
Really?  Half of it was them hyping themselves up for the 2005 season saying how good JO/Artesr were and how Jackson was the perfect addition to the team and how hungry Reggie was to win.  I still don't understand what was untold about it lol everything in that documentary we knew about.
"I watch more basketball games than most on this sub because I have nothing better to do.   Eric Bledsoe is walking into the best situation he’s ever been in his career. He’s an extremely gifted slasher who gets to play on what was statistically the greatest 3-point shooting team of all-time. There is going to be so much space for him to operate, and he can still blow by his man at ease. Look at what Reggie Jackson has done since he got to the Clips, Ty Lue is really good at getting the most out of score first guards."
2014 first round was a sad series on his part but he got bailed out multiple times. That’s a forgotten one especially considering he was a Reggie Jackson career game away from winning MVP and losing to the 7th seed grizzlies
Reggie Jackson isn’t well known for being overly intelligent.
"He have a quality pg in Reggie Jackson, I also don’t mind having Bledsoe as a backup with limited minutes also"
"Honestly it's the Clippers solely in terms of players on the court. I know both of them get some sort of cap benefits but I'm not privvy to that at the moment.   Back when Bledsoe was on the Pelicans I was hardcore advocating for a Bledsoe-PatBev swap.   The Clippers have plenty of shooting already but what they need is playmaking. Bledsoe is a flawed, overpaid player but two things he can do pretty well are give you guard defense and playmaking (he averaged 6 assists a game during his final playoff run with Milwaukee).   With the re-emergence of Reggie Jackson, PatBev was redundant on the Clippers especially considering how injury prone he is. In the interim, a hopefully-healthy Ibaka can compensate for Eric Bledsoe's lack of shooting and when Kawhi is healthy they can go 5-out without Bledsoe anyways.  As for Memphis, I imagine they'll be able to flip both PatBev and Rondo without any issues."
there’s a pretty fine line between a star and a solid starter imo. like if the clippers won this year would people be saying reggie jackson was a star years down the line?
"Lol what bumb ass take is this. OKC KD's problem was lack of shooters and he took OKC further with a co-star on volume shooting who had 40/28/91 splits. If KD had spacing KD would have done even better. His next best scorer was baby Reggie Jackson who made 7 3s in 6 games.   Give KD Shane battier, Ray Allen, and Mike Miller and they winning all day because not only does KD get spacing from those shooters, he also creates space out to the 3 for them. Deadly spacing. Not LeBrons maybe he'll make an open 3 maybe he won't, we're talking, if you leave KD that's an auto 3 on high volume."
"I never really knew what happened but man, I somehow like Metta more now than I did before, Jermaine more now than before, Jackson more now than I did before and I HATE the fans so much more.   I feel so bad for Reggie man..."
Not exactly the same though. Reggie Jackson is a average player. That’s like getting excited for Lue matching up against AI after the step over.
If you trade away both of CP3's nemesises... does that mean you're trying to trade for him?   (Would that even be a possibility? Reggie Jackson might sit well on the Suns.)
Reggie Jackson &gt; Ben Simmons
"&gt; CP3, Blake, Kawhi, PG, DJ, Elton Brand, Maggette, Kaman, Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Norm Nixon, Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman, Lamar Odom, Lou Will. Shit… you might be right.  That's 16, add Jamal Crawford, Eric Piatkowski, Montrezl Harrell, JJ Reddick and that's 20. He might have a case for top 20-25 with Miles, Richardson, Bledsoe, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, etc. But then again, Reggie Jackson, Batum, Mann, and Zubac might make top 20 now."
"Odds are Bledsoe is going to be the backup to Reggie Jackson. Might not be good as a starter, but if he's motivated then he could be a good second unit piece."
It was just probably the clippers tbh just a year ago he had an amazing postseason. Reggie Jackson was playing amazing as well so I dont blame the clippers for not using him right
Maybe thinking that Reggie Jackson can take over the starting PG spot while shedding some salary. Beverley is a good player but pretty injury prone.
pg Luka sg reggie jackson sf patrick williams pf nic batum c jaren jackson jr
"Was it? Arrest and JO defensively woulda given fits. These 2 combined with Jackson, Reggie, and Tinsley give u a lot of offensive firepower. They had some solid role players too"
"Neither of them rule Cali. Reggie Jackson does, lmao. Warriors will be lucky to see anything past the 2nd round while Curry is still there"
"I think before this year's playoffs it was, without a doubt, Reggie Jackson. Called a bum left and right for years, then reminds everybody what he does in the playoffs"
Reggie Jackson will make the All-Star team
"&gt;	Me saying KD hasn’t peaked higher than a number of superstars in the last 5 years doesn’t mean i hate KD.  Your comment history does.   &gt;	No empirical data out there rates KD as the best player in the league or anything close to that.  What is this empirical data you speak so much of ? Who’s the best player in the league according to this empirical data? Is basketball just numbers to you ?   He ranks #2 in TPA(Total points added) above everyone you mentioned for the postseason, and is not too far off from Ben Simmons, Kawhi, PJ Tucker, Jrue in DPS(Defensive points saved).  All elite defenders but somehow Durant isn’t because he’s only a scorer who doesn’t bring anything else to the game yet ranks higher than everyone you mentioned in overall impact analysis.    &gt;	Durant can’t run an offense to an elite level. Old CP3 held together by duct tape is a better offensive engine than Durant. Problem is CP3 doesn’t have the explosiveness and stamina to put up 22ppg anymore, which is why he’s not better than Durant despite being a much better facilitator.  Time and time again the same question has been put, yeah let’s see Durant without another playmaker yeah he’s gonna be so bad his percentages are gonna drop off so much yet, you all keep being proven wrong, the call was answered and you morons still use the same dumb arguments as if we were in 2012.   2018 no Curry, will Durant win as the main  with no Curry guy ? Record 5-1.   2019 after taking a passive game and blowing 30 pt lead to the clips in G2 puts up 39/5/5 on 66TS% until he gets injured again in G5 vs Houston, got Curry to call him the best player in the world and straight up say that he’s carrying them btw.   2021 no Kyrie, Injured Harden, can Durant carry the offense of this Brooklyn team and keep the nets championship hopes high ?   Last 3 games puts up 43/12/6/1/1 on 54/36/80.  Needless for me to keep banging on the same thing though so allow me to move on.    &gt;	Durant’s ATG level iso scoring covers up for weaknesses in his game compared to other ATG talent  Multiple players defender coaches have came up forward saying he has no weaknesses in his game yet you tell me the fact that he’s a ATG scorer covers up for his lack of defense and playmaking ability which both have been disproven by me in this same comment.   &gt;	30 ppg on over 60%TS but do this as the primary faciltator on their respective teams (LeBron, Harden, Curry, Jokic, Luka all fit that bill.   Durant has a literal mvp with Reggie Jackson as his second best teammat, he has done this what was it  35/8/6/2/1 64TS% or something in 36 games ?   Please note that I’m not saying he’s on the same level as a playmaker as of Harden LeBron Jokic or Luka, but you will not stand here and tell me that he’s so bad at it that it’s to the point where he’s not better than them as a overall player."
"2016-17 PGs were loaded  MVP Russ, Curry, Harden (played PG that year), IT, CP3, Wall, Dame, Lowry, Kyrie, Kemba, Conley, Dragic, D’Angelo, even guys like Reggie Jackson, Bledsoe, playoff Rondo"
"Jackson still comes off as an immature clown, especially with recent comments he has made  I did kinda feel bad for O’Neal and Reggie after watching this, mostly Reggie. For o Neal it only cause he ended up not winning anything, while the other 2 players did."
"Yes, the Jazz drafted him out of Louisville and gave him the keys to the offense. Since his rookie year he’s led the team in field goals attempted and usage rate. They drafted him expecting him to lead their offense in the regular season as well as the playoffs and he hasn’t done enough to take the Jazz to the WCF and beyond. He’s shown minor improvements in his playmaking over the years, but he’ll sometimes force a bad shot or pass when the defense traps him. An example would be the series against the clippers this past season when the guards (Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann, &amp; Paul George) were trapping him in the corner or defenders would go over on screens and having tunnel vision which would lead to a contested shot at the rim or a contested elbow jumper or didn’t know how to pass out of the double team and instead tries to force the bad shot or bait the ref by jumping into the defender."
"Agree on KD/Harden, those were no brainers. But I don't think Westbrook was universally regarded as the call at 4, let alone transitioning him to a full time PG. Don't really remember though, so I could definitely be wrong.  Outside of that, yeah his track record hasn't been the greatest. Adams (12), Sabonis (11), Ibaka (24), and Dort (UDFA) are some bright spots, Reggie Jackson (24) has been alright. Definitely has his misses, but it's been a lot of late 1sts and 2nds, and that shit is always a crapshoot (...Myers hasn't had the best track record in that regard either, though Looney and Poole are looking like some great rotational pieces, and PMac and Bell contributed to two chips).  Still think he's one of the better GMs out there, and now he's drafting for a rebuild (like when he drafted KD/Westbrook/Harden) instead of for fringe rotational players on a current contender."
Yes. they have Reggie Jackson
"Yes barring injuries, LA transformed into a much better team by the time they exited the playoffs.     Reggie Jackson for example went from okay role player to a bonafide #2 option in the playoffs.  Mann got more mins &amp; LA plays great with him.  Pat Bev struggled starting but found his rhythm off the bench etc.   LA started to utilize their small ball unit in the playoffs as well which brought out the best in their team that's why in the playoffs they beat Utah &amp; then were going to beat Phoenix if not for fatigue."
"Doesn't matter. The Masais, the RC Buffords, the Moreys, etc. have all hit on at least a couple of non-lottery picks during this time.     Presti has been pretty good in the lottery (Sabonis at 11), but the top-tier GMs convert some of those late first rounders. Presti hasn't hit on one since Reggie Jackson in 2011, or Roberson in 2013 if we want to pretend like his bad offense didn't pretty much completely cancel out his good defense. (also, Gobert was the pick after Roberson)"

"KD deferred to Westbrook in clutch moments  Curry deferred to KD   Giannis defers to Middleton   Paul George deferred to Reggie Jackson against the Jazz this year  Jokic defers to Murray all the time  This literally happens in every single healthy superstar pair. And more honestly, in any decent team that values unselfishness."
"&gt;*He's not right.  The Pelicans clearly want a PG to run the offense, or they wouldn't have gone balls out to get Lowry.  We can argue about whether that's the best use of resources, but its clearly what the Pelicans want to happen, and they let the perfect fit for that walk.*  ***Not why we wanted Lowry.***  We were interested in Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry because we don't have any lockerroom leadership. We're still a very young team and every time we've brought a vet along (Adams, Jrue, JJ Redick, Bledsoe,) they've been well-received/friendly in the lockerroom but don't hold people accountable, or act like 'leaders.'  BI and Zion haven't really taken leadership over the team or point out when guys aren't giving their all or motivate their teammates + pick up the energy on the court when it's needed. And they can't close out games.  So FO was trying to get vet leaders in to teach them.  Once Dinwiddie, Lowry, and Paul said 'no,' they moved on to grabbing shooters like Reggie Jackson, Danny Green, THJ, etc. Guys who could play off of our two main guys. We didn't really get a locker room leader into the mix like we wanted.  Kyle and Chris can change *the culture* of a team.  That's why we wanted them."
"Pacers with Ron Artest, Stephen Jackson , Reggie and Jermaine O’Neal"
"I mean we offered contracts to Lowry, Chris Paul, Dinwiddie, THJ, and more (Danny Green/Reggie Jackson.)   I don't think Pels did any leaks about tampering, I think the 'one minute after the trade happened' leak to Woj by Klutch is how shit got inspected.  NBA can't ignore a deal made four seconds into deadline."
&gt;But Griffin did a lot to clear space for Lowry  i mean we cleared space because adams/bledsoe are bad basketball players as well. lol.   we wanted free agents but we also were interested in like Reggie Jackson and Tim Hardaway Jr. too. Not just Lowry.
Stephen Jackson was right - how do you live in Indiana at the time and not know who Reggie Miller is?
"I agree with Stephen Jackson, auburn hills cops at a pistons game. I'm SURE they are fans. They 100% know who Reggie Miller is."
"I mean both Wade and Karl Malone have a somewhat decent argument, even if I wouldn't choose either over KD (Wade's peak was insane, possibly even higher than KDs, and Malone destroyed Shaq in Shaq's prime on the Lakers pre-Phil Jackson).  Reggie Miller has no argument lol"
Care to elaborate on #4? Not a Dlo fan really but I think at worst he’s still an average PG. I’d put him in the Reggie Jackson tier of PGs in the league.  I kinda agree with #3 but with opposite reasoning. Imo Klay is so much better than Green that they’re not even close to being on the same level.
"Maybe, though I think Reggie Jackson is a better player than Lonzo"
"He badly needs to fire his agent. Even if he only wanted to stay in Phoenix, he still left a ton of money on the table and signed an unfavorable contract for himself. He was eligible to get the same thing Richaun Holmes got in Sacramento, or if he wanted a shorter contract then he could have gotten what Reggie Jackson got with the Clippers. Just like Payne, these were players who were re-signed by their teams using early Bird rights.   Payne could have gotten a bigger contract elsewhere, so he should have used that as leverage to get the Suns to up their offer. It's very cool that he wanted to stay with the Suns, but it's stupid that he would feel like Robert Sarver deserves that money more than he does. At the very least that 3rd year should have been a player option rather than partially guaranteed. It's really like he just accepted whatever the Suns initial offer was without negotiating at all."
&gt;	Steve Nash has never been a better player than KD  Because you say so?  Nash has led some of the best offenses in league history and is a back to back MVP. Durant almost choked his 2014 MVP season against the grizzlies and got bailed out by reggie fucking jackson.    Durant had to **join** the league MVP in his physical prime that just came off a 73 win season in order win **at all**
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."
I envy you I wish I could have my time back watching the Ben Gordon Charlie villaNueva Brandon Jennings Josh Smith Greg Monroe Reggie Jackson Drummond Pistons
"You know they weren't playing the same teams right? Luka had to play the Clippers defense with his Mavs teammates while Kawhi got to play the Mavs defense with his Clippers teammates.  Luka obviously shot shit from the line, but offense is a total package and his is better than Kawhi's. The fact that Kawhi went to game 7 and almost lost to the Mavs proves by itself that he got outplayed. Paul George, Morris, Reggie Jackson playing insane, Zubac. The roster is better than the Mavs by far 2-10. So when we're comparing 1s, how can the series be that close if the Clippers 1 is also better than the Mavs 1?"
"The doc was good. It would have benefited a lot from being longer or maybe having a handful of episodes like the one with the Celtics and Lakers. My heart breaks for Jermaine. Seeing Ron win in 2010 must have felt like a kick to the gut. Same for Reggie who is *still* fine somehow. Stephen Jackson is a real one and funny as hell.   I kind of feel sorry for Ron as well. He's remorseful and self aware. And it's hard to dislike someone who is (was, I guess) so clearly trying their best to do better."
Reggie Jackson has done more for the clippers than cp has ever done
"So much of this is hilarious. Ron artest probably sheepishly asking “are we gonna get in trouble”. Stephen Jackson just entire being killed me. Fuckin Tim Donahugh or whatever making a cameo. Also, shoutout the cop who almost maced Reggie Miller for no fuckin reason cause of course that happened"
"JO, Stephen Jackson and Ron Artest basically said the same thing. How they all felt bad for not winning one for Reggie. They were the best team at the time.   So idk what you're trying to say."
Love: Stephen Jackson - He aint kissing ass.  Hate: Reggie Miller - This was about me not winning the title I definitely would have won in spite of the previous 17 years of not winning one. Be sad for me.
The edit cutting from the cop to Stephen Jackson asking “How the hell do you not know Reggie Miller plays for the Indiana Pacers!?!” killed me
I like Stephen Jackson and Reggie Miller more now.  Reggie Miller saving Artest from getting pepper sprayed... and Stephen Jackson's memeable response to police not knowing who Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers was.
I’m more scared of reggie Jackson &amp; Markus Morris than pg &amp; Kawhi lol literally not joking
"i just see it  * i cant never blame Stephen Jackson and JO, but Ron?now thats really different * if Ron have anxiety and depression problem, can their teamates saw the sign?i mean, watching the documentary still indicates he still have it * hurtful to see JO and Reggie like this, i think he really wants to win it  * and NBA should know from football / soccer, YOU CAN ALSO BLAME THE FANS TOO! remember the Heysel tragedy? * Stern is really the worst"
Does anyone think that his last season was peak Reggie Jackson and he'll have a lot tougher time now (Esp teams are more aware and actually need to spend a little more defending him)? A lot of his playoff performance was just him taking contested pull up 3s and nailing them. I don't think that's replicable unless he magically transformed into an all star level player in one season.  Good deal for the Clippers anyways.
"This may be a hot take but Schroder is a way better basketball player now compared to Oladipo.   Schroder had bad timing with Covid last year but if you watch the 2020 playoffs, I thought he was the engine that made the Thunder go (CP3 would obviously close games). He's a great sixth man. I could easily see Schroder doing what Reggie Jackson did this season.  &amp;#x200B;  Oladipo was absolutely terrible all season long. I'm so glad he didn't take the Rockets extension (I think it was a faux extension which they knew he would reject anyway)."
"Nope, IT would've provided shots, free throws, and assists. Simmons didn't provide much, in the 4th quarter he was a negative for his team. With Trae out there limping and being slow, IT's defense should've been fine. If Philly had any decent PG they would've won the series - Reggie Jackson, Lonzo, or Schroder. I don't dislike Simmons, but he should be playing PF."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"As a Pistons fan, this was the scenario we faced when SVG traded for Reggie Jackson. He believed he was good enough to be a franchise point guard and so did our front office. He came off as cocky (and boy does Russell Westbrook still hate his fucking guts) but bet on himself to be more. Injuries and the general dysfunction of our team (hmm maybe we should let Andre Drummond shoot threes) derailed his trajectory.  The major difference is that other than his exuberance and swagger coming off as lack of drive, he showed actual potential to be something (on a better team with better players and coaching and front office) whereas Dennis has always been just an overrated asshole by all accounts.   The cool black German skateboarding point guard seemed like a fun character idea but they've run out of plots and he needs to be written off the show."
Reggie Jackson did the same thing there
I always forget that reggie was on that team still. Was kind of sad when all 3 had regrets not getting Reggie a ring. Actually it got real sad on O'Neal end with Jackson and Artest eventually getting a ring. Damn this documentary was real good.  Also fuck John Green
"Im still pretty willing to laugh at him. The initial lakers contract was more than he was worth and he passed on it. I genuinely believe that he still would have been able to barter a bit more than that 84mil like he wanted if he was a better teammate and locker room guy, especially if the weird cap thing where they couldnt replace his value if they lost him.   He will be a great deal though, but this offseason had a ton potentially- Oladipo and Porter for dirt cheap can both be massive if they get healthy. Reggie Jackson was huge in the playoffs and is only taking 11m/yr. Drummonds double double is more valuable than the vet min. Its that kind of offseason market and he lead himself into playing it"
"Simple. He seems to have a coach who will give credit where due like Ty Lue, so all he has to do is play like Reggie Jackson."
"Even with physicality, a player shouldn't get  rammed off the block by a PG more than a foot shorter in the first place this regularly. It'd be understandable if we saw Reggie Jackson type players do this consistently against other 7 footers, but KP is the only one who gets absolutely abused with no post-up or back down game in response. Comparing KP to his peers, its clear is more a KP problem than a rule problem. The man just doesn't have the muscle or mass to outwrestle even smaller guys."
"It wasn't just those two, there were a bunch of point guards who were available ahead of him: Lowry, Lonzo, Dinwiddie, and even Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne if they'd been willing to move. Schroder tried to play hard ball in a market that was already going to be saturated with players at his position even before Westbrook and Kemba were in play."
"Neither are Nic Batum (33), Marcus Morris (32) and Reggie Jackson (31). The Clippers need some of their young guys to really pop soon cause their vets aren't exactly young and spry."
"Off the dome? Well, Schreoder, monte morris, Reggie Jackson, fultz, Hayes, kemba, Graham (it might be naw idk who'd starting) Dinwiddie, Conley, vanvleet. And thats not bottom 1/3"
"The Lakers *could* have offered Markieff the same contract that Richaun Holmes got from Sacramento, or even what Reggie Jackson got from the Clippers (they had early Bird rights on him, just like with those other guys and their teams), but instead they just passed on him. He seems like he has the same bitterness that Josh Hart had when the Lakers traded him. Some of these guys must really hate it when the chance to be a Laker is taken away from them. I mean, [just look how happy he was to be a part of the team.](https://youtu.be/EdSRV0D-yiE)"
Goggles Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson bailed both of them out with a 30 point game   They would’ve been down 1-3 in the first round
Idk why but my gut says reggie jackson.
"&gt;Bad read by Doc  Nah, that's just how Doc is. He shit on PG and Lue last offseason, blaming Lue when PG criticized Doc's lack of adjustments vs DEN.  &gt; George found fault with the way that Rivers used him offensively, and he also criticized Rivers lack of adjustments over the course of the series against the Nuggets.   &gt; ""The way I was being used, I felt Doc was trying to play me as like a Ray Allen or like a JJ Redick, all pin-downs. I can do it, but that ain't my game,"" George said. ""I need some flow, I need some mixes of pick-and-rolls, I need some post-ups, just different touches, you know what I mean? That last season was just hard overall.  &gt; ""We went up 3-1. We felt like, we gonna win the next one. We lost. We like, 'Cool, we up 3-2, we gonna win the next one.' We lost. But during that whole process, we never worked on adjustments,"" George added. ""We never worked on what to do differently. We were just literally having the same s--- happen over and over again. It started to play a trick on you, like, man what's going on? We talking amongst each other, the conversations like, 'We gonna be alright.' The conversations should have been like, 'Nah, we need to change this. We need to switch this up.'   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/doc-rivers-responds-to-criticism-from-paul-george-i-think-everybody-needs-to-take-ownership/amp/  To which Doc responded:  &gt; “Hey, listen, I enjoyed coaching him,” Rivers said of George. “So not a lot to say there. Ty Lue was sitting right next to me. So he better hope it’s not adjustments. It ain’t going to be much different.”  https://sports.yahoo.com/doc-rivers-paul-george-adjustments-170037073.html  Now look at how Lue used PG in the 2021 playoffs. PnRs, isos, etc. Not to mention major adjustments like going 5-out, playing Reggie Jackson over Beverley and Rondo, and giving big minutes to Terrance Mann. But yeah - ""not much different,"" according to Glenn.  All Glenn does is choke in the playoffs, blame everyone else, and discredit other teams (eg, ""Celtics are the real 2010 champs"", ""2015 Warriors are lucky they didn't play the Clippers"")."
"I worked in a restaurant for years that had a lot of pro players/celebrities coming in.    I was a huge Pacer fan and Reggie Miller used to come in all the time but so did a lot of other players.  Phil Jackson ate there when he was in town, Bill Walton came in couple of times.  But the one that sticks in my mind the most (actually a different restaurant but same owners) was Larry Bird.  He came in and I didn’t wait on him but I was constantly walking by his table and he was smoking.  It blew my mind that Bird smoked."
"The Pelicans weren’t even bad with CP3, yet everyone acts like we missed the playoffs every year with him just because he requested a trade, and he requested the trad ebecause of how our past owner ran things. We were bad with AD with a bad FO, but we still almost made things right with the Boogie trade, until he tore his Achilles.   Now we have a new owner (old one died) and a totally new FO except for Fred Vinson who is a great assistant.  I know everyone wants to act like we massively failed this off-season because we lost the next great star PG in Lonzo Ball apparently, but if you watched the Pelicans and know that Lonzo was just a good role player for us, you’d know that the Pelicans were in a good position. Even if they only made the play-in tournament this year, we have no bad contracts, and a ton of good young players and picks, not to mention a top 10 center in Jonas Valunciounas, and a solid PG in Graham, and a All star in Brandon Ingram.  Everyone thinks the clippers will be fine with Paul George and role players like Reggie Jackson, Batum, Morris etc. this year, so shouldn’t the generational talent people are claiming we are wasting be able to be just as good with Valunciounas, Brandon Ingram, Graham, and good young pieces around them?  I know since your a Lakers fan your used to teams being able to make themselves better immediately by signing a difference maker that wanted to play for them. The Pelicans tried to do that, but no one wanted to play here from free agency. And you may want to say that small market teams can be successful because of the Bucks, but it took the Bucks a few years to get there too. It’s crazy that y’all already decided we’ve failed Zion when he’s played basically only 1 year with us.  And we are going in the right direction considering we’ve gotten better every year, and our core consist of young players who will continue to get better, and a veteran who won’t fall off soon. Not to mention all the picks and lack of bad contracts we have for flexibility in the future."
"You can't just check the box score and write things man,  If you watched the series you would have realized that every time porzingis got the ball it was a disaster, they just put pat bev or reggie jackson on him and he couldn't score on them."
No he didn’t he did it against Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverly
I wouldn’t call Reggie Jackson a great defender and Patrick Beverly is far too small to guard Luka  His numbers when he didn’t get the switch and had to go against Kawhi are pretty terrible
Reggie Jackson was amazing for many stretches.  great player
"Definitely something wrong with it. The fuck is the point of supporting your team if you know it’s going nowhere with no plan. Being in sports mediocrity is probably the worst thing for a fan - believe me, Ive had way more fun seeing my team tank than seeing them claw their way to the 8 seed every year with Drummond and Reggie Jackson."
"I can tell you didn't watch that season. 2014 Heat weren't a superteam. They were worse support than the Thunder, who at least had a great defense behind KD and Westbrook, and Reggie Jackson who was a solid backup after Westbrook went down.  They were completely washed. Wade sat out 30 games and fell to below all star level that year, Battier and Ray Allen retired right after they lost to the Spurs, and basically all of their important role players were out of the league after a couple more seasons."
"Dawg if Paul George and Reggie Jackson could take us to 6, we definitely wouldn have lost with Kawhi."
"All these clips are post grit n grind era. Wish there were some full games from our playoff series against the thunder, clippers and spurs from '11-17. 2014 we took the Thunder to 7 games and 4 straight OTs. Reggie Jackson saved the series for the thunder (along with ZBO shoving young and skinny Steven Adams hard enough to be considered a ""punch"" and wrongly being suspended for game 7)."
"Lol I'll respectfully disagree. If prime Shaq entered now, he would have made teams play inside out catered to him. Yes Steph is a god in its own right. But the league would realize that a big scoring easy buckets inside is way more reliable than betting on percentages of shooters that are not curry hitting more 3s. If this was the case, the 90s woulda been changed already with shooters like drazen, Reggie, Chris Jackson and etc. The only reason why it didn't is because Hakeem, Shaq and Ewing all showed that playing inside out was efficient too. The only team that replicate the efficient and success from 3 is the warriors cuz they are unique with curry."
"Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Danny Granger, Paul George, Jermaine O'Neal         Bench: Monte Ellis, George McGinnis, Rik Smits"
"Horford had to get benched because he was producing too much and OKC wanted to tank. We traded back for him because Kemba requested a trade, and we wanted his leadership.  K-Love has had a panic attack mid game and still is less afraid of playing basketball than Ben Simmons. He might not be able to play at an all star level, but he's never going to be the reason that you lose a series.  Saying ""Porzingis got punked by Reggie Jackson"" is the same as sayign you've never posted up someone shorter than you in your life. Tingis is getting misused in the Mavs system, but he will still do more to contribute to winning than Simmons. He's also never had a healthy offseason until now, whereas Simmons has been babied since day 0, including skipping out on a third of a season just so he could get the ROY."
"Oh boy lmao. You might need to get a refresher on the NBA bud.   Horford got paid to go home. K-Love inbounded the ball to the other team, Porzingis got punked by Reggie Jackson, and Wall was actually ok I guess.   But I would take Simmons over all of those guys not named Porzingis."
"Look at all the players that have gone into the booth or become talking heads.  Do you think those players would make good coaches?  Barkley, Shaq, Kenny Smith, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Chauncey Billups, TMac, Paul Pierce, Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Scottie Pippen, Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Jalen Rose.  Out of all those dudes the only people I would for sure want coaching a team would be Chauncey and Kenny, Chauncey is getting his chance and Kenny is currently looking iirc.  Others that I think could coach if they wanted would maybe be Jalen, Channing, and RJ mayyyybe TMac.  But there's also the question of are they even interested in coaching?  There's ~500 players in the League right now, I'd be willing to bet that a huge majority aren't even interested in coaching.   &gt;While the players who are black who remain involved in the sport are talking heads or in the booth almost exclusively.  Complete bullshit ""almost exclusively""  Out of all the big talking heads I named one is currently going to be a coach, and another has been interviewed.  Mark Jackson became a coach and sucked, Tyronn Lue and Doc Rivers have been out there for a good minute.  Jason Kidd is out running around even though he has a very questionable domestic + coaching past.  Nate McMillan, David Fizdale, Dwane Casey also.    If we look farther back we have Larry Drew, Lenny Wilkens, KC Jones, etc. etc. probably quite a few others I don't know"
Totally exposed /s   You’re not writing anything because you have nothing to write. Sorry the wing span of reggie Jackson isn’t actually a good counter to other teams killing batum in the post
"last playoffs AD shot the ball from outside like he never has in his life so that’s not really the best example. plus our “small ball” isn’t actually that small. reggie jackson is a 6’3” pg with a 7’0” wingspan, pg is like a 6’8” 2 guard, kawhi is 6’7” with a massive wingspan and is extremely strong (and has shown he can guard giannis and ad in some capacity), batum is another 6’8” wing with a huge wingspan and is pretty strong, and finally marcus morris who is nothing better than an average defender but is still 6’9” and has strength and some mobility. no doubt giannis and ad would feast on offense, but you’re ignoring our offense as well. the jazz were still scoring a shit ton against us even with rudy’s offensive shortcomings, we just scored more."
"Not as good as anyone else who's an NBA TV personality probably. Good rotation player but not the same level on the court as the rest, but he has a pretty excellent TV personality.   Shaq, Chuck, Mchale, Garnett, Magic, Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Chris Webber, Isaiah Thomas, Mark Jackson, Bill Walton, Richard Jefferson, honestly I can't think of any (national) NBA TV personality he was better than. Maybe Scalabrine and Kendrick Perkins lol"
"I'll choose ""*b.)take The High Road*"" instead of joining you in Ad Hom and personal attacks. I'm sticking to my argument here *---which is supported by what we just saw in the 2021 playoffs*. The Bucks made analytics and advanced stat guys look wrong ---once Giannis got injured. Thats when they won the chip mainly due to their defense and midrange games of Giannis and Middleton and Jrue.  PHX nearly won a chip due to the midrange games of CP3 and Book. Reggie Jackson hit a few 3s, but for the most part, the LACs surprised everybody \[after Kawhi got hurt\] via PG13's and some other players' midrange games.   Not 3pt shooting, but midrange games."

"Are you trying to say Durant, with ibaka, Westbrook, harden until 2012, Roberson, Adams, waiters, Reggie Jackson(till he asked to get traded), etc. etc. didn't have teams on the level of Currys before 2017? Curry had a team that could actually compete for literally two years before kd arrived, because of an injury that forced the front office to start Draymond. And before the warriors ""surrounded him with a great coach"", they were employing mark Jackson, who is probably the opposite of that. Curry was winning and inspiring his teammates before the front office got their shit together. The difference between his time in Oakland and LeBron and kds time in their original teams, is that he stayed loyal and built a winning culture and a team atmosphere, rather than making it into ""LeBron and the other guys"", or leaving for greener pastures like KD.  Curry built that winning atmosphere in spite of his FO, not because of them. After 2014? Sure, draymond, klay, Kerr, etc. all contributed to that, but curry was a star before 2015. The front office gets credit for their drafting and trading the right guys, but curry was winning them games for people like iguodala and kd to want to come there and create those fantastic teams."
"Ain’t no probably chief. They needed Mike Conley desperately, Reggie Jackson looked like an all NBA player against them."
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
Kobe was drafted out of highschool and was dropping 20 ppg at 20 years old. Pippen was the 5th pick in the draft ahead of Kenny Smith/Horace Grant/Reggie Miller/Mark Jackson and Kevin Johnson. What are you talking about? Those guys are not late bloomers at all. Steve Nash was tho.
"They've got John Wall at home, Reggie Jackson who shoots 40% from three now too. I'm not sure where else they should use the aggregated salaries, but i don't think the answer is John Wall."
Major label bands... that's not Reggie Jackson?!
"&gt; Dallas will likely use him sparingly in defensive situations but that's probably it.  That's it. End of the bench guy that will be asked to lock a guy in another team's 2nd unit whenever, Idk, a goddamn Reggie Jackson comes off the bench deciding he is Steph Curry and throws 4 3s in a row to lead a comeback.  Purely hypothetical on the latter. But, being real, we only acquired defenders. Ntilikina differs from Sterling and Bullock when he isn't a catch and shoot guy on offense, but a defensive specialist, but Sterling will have double digit minutes and Bullock will be a starter, while Ntilikina will be the 12-13th man. Different expectations."
"&gt; So Kp really just is a giant shooter  Pretty much. I mean, there was games where you could see the Unicorn. The Spurs series, Indy, Bucks, Hornets, Pels, there was some games where he would own the paint and stretch the court in an elite way. A 70+ games of KP playing like he played the Spurs and the Pelicans would be a 3rd All-NBA nod and a ticket to home court advantage. His perimeter shot is legit elite for a big, I have a hard time naming 5 PF/C guys that shoots better than him, his only issue is shot selection, and there were rumors that he was chucking random shots doe to spite of Luka's heavy usage.   He started the season saying he wasn't comfortable playing C, but, on the last third of the reg season, he came on the mic to say he wasn't comfortable playing PF and felt his best was at C, so, yeah, no fucking clue about his ideal position in his head. But he wants to be used more, he was adamant he needed long stretches to heat up and get it going. He would check out some games where Luka wasn't feeding him enough (personal opinion, but Luka did refuse to give him mid-range and paint looks here and there. He was probably as frustrated as the fans with KP's random looking shots). His main issue is that he is a streaky shooter that needs volume to not rent an apartment in his own head and check out of games, and Luka is like an elite QB in the NFL, he won't trust feeding you if you are not being efficient (except Boban. I seriously think Luka is in a mission to pad Boban's stats, because whenever Boban plays, every possession ends with Luka throwing a lob to Boban with 10s on the shot clock). Kidd said he envisions KP as a 5, but we do have 3 options that are good rebounders at the 4 in Maxi, Powell and DFS (more of a small ball 4), and Luka is elite at rebounding for a backcourt guy, so what we truly need from KP is just regular paint defense and a focus on his mid-range and paint game. On mindset, he was clearly bothered playing decoy and being written off by Rick, but, although with a fair share of low IQ/total bonehead decisions (like being scared of catching off rebounds in G6, refusing to post up Reggie Fucking Jackson for the majority of the series and that fucking fastbreak 3pt attempt in G7), he was a team player, he did his role, he never checked out. To summarize, he wasn't Ben Simmons. Apparently he understands why Rick planned the whole game to hide him, and he is working a lot with the coaching staff. He was in Dallas in the middle of the offseason, before FA even began, he was one of the first to arrive there for this pre-TC period. If Kidd can give him just some hustle on the paint and can tighten his leash on the perimeter, Luka will feed him more and we will see a completely functional offense (until Luka sits, but this comes back to the lack of passers behind him).  Oh, we are definitely waiting for a buyout on Dragic. Don't think it will happen, though, I'm still not convinced of anything that would benefit the Raps on buying him out (some people said about going into the tax, though). People are seriously underselling Powell, he would start at the 5 there. He's a little undersized for a 5, but I'm yet to see someone with more hustle, hunger for rebounds and who excels so much setting up screens. His screens are elite on my eye test, I have no idea on stats. He took his time to recover from Achilles, and it was dreadful on the 1st month (when Luka was a sub .300 shooter, so yeah, everyone was dreadful), but I'm more than confident on him coming back this season. Only reason we would involve him in the Dragic trade is to match salaries, we would be much better off sending WCS if it was to fleece the Raptors. But well, they do have Achiuwa, that plays a similar role to Powell. In any case, he is the type of player that I think Kidd will fall in love the same way Rick did.   Yes, as far as I remember, Keldon was the primary defender on him, but Pop doubled him on almost every possession. I remember him using Murray a lot as well. Murray became the postcard on that nasty crossover/stepback hybrid Luka had on him in the 1st game on Dallas to ice the game, but I was never at ease. Pop was throwing 2 defenders on Luka before he crossed half court, and it was clear that Rick wasn't ready for that and that bothered Luka a lot. He threw more TOs in one quarter than his usual for a game, he got a tech out of sheer frustration and our offense stalled until Rick fielded Brunson and THJ at the same time, giving Luka some escape valve with 2 self creating shooters (mind you this kills our defense. This was how desperate Pop made Rick). On 1v1, only Simmons neutralizes Luka 100%, and Bridges is very effective limiting him, but Pop always gang up on him, asking defenders to be physical, and that bothers Luka a lot. Again, I'm surprised more coaches doesn't do that, only Stevens did that sometimes in the Celtics series, and even though it was sporadically. Lue did that on spot-on moments, but his mind was clear on ""we cannot stop him, so good luck making him win the game alone, because we are making everyone else non-existent on offense"". THJ crazy run almost made him pay, but I digress. I'm not anxious at all to see Pop using Keldon and Thad to guard Luka, if he wants to double him again, that would obliterate Luka's playmaking. Kidd isn't as clever as Rick, and Rick had a lot of problems trying to create offensive alternatives against Pop's defense.   Also, let me use the chance here: what's your thoughts on Primo? I was sure the Spurs would take Sengun and prep him to take Poeltl's role at the 5 or play behind Thad at the 4."
Shoutout to Reggie Jackson who saved OKC that series
Yea Reggie Jackson betta
idc what position you call him but reggie jackson 😤
Reggie Jackson when he was on the Pistons and they were the #8 seed against the cavs. He said the Pistons would shock the world instead the cavs swept them easily
Love topics like these.  1- Cavs - Kawhi   2- wolves - Kyrie  3- Jazz - butler   4- cavs - klay   5-  Raps- Isaiah Thomas   6- wizards- vuc  7- bobcats- Kemba   8- Pistons- Tobi  9- bobcats- valancunis   10- kings- bojan   11- warriors- Reggie Jackson   12- Jazz- Marcus Morris   13- suns- Enes Kanter   14- rockets- Nikola mirotic
Yeah the dude who’s been 1 or 2 wins away from the finals three times with Roy Hibbert Lance Stephenson and Reggie Jackson as his numbers twos. He’s trash right?
Why would Houston take ibaka??? They’re rebuilding and if they get him they can’t trade him because he has no trade stock. And they do need Bledsoe. Tell me the other guards on the  clippers without naming Bledsoe and Reggie Jackson
"I like it. Nobody ever brings up that team. Jermaine O’Neil cleaning the glass, Ron Artest scoring like 20 a game and locking down people, Reggie still running screens, and Stephen Jackson doing his thing. Who was the coach? Was Bird still there? They had like the best or second best record in the league walking in that night if my memory"
Reggie Jackson   Luke Kennard   Paul George  Marcus Morris  Ivica Zubac   That’s not getting you a top 6 seed in the west buddy. That’s the 2017 Detroit Pistons backcourt.
Luka didn’t give Kawhi anything. He was switching on Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverly every play. Luka’s numbers were shit when guarded by Kawhi  It was an elite performance by Luka but stats don’t tell the full story. Plus Kawhi’s numbers were just as elite
I think the Clippers will be much worse than people expect. People will point towards their playoff run after Kawhi got injured but it's a lot different for Reggie Jackson to have a hot hand for 2 series than to be an efficient 18 ppg scorer for 82 games.  It's easier to adjust in the playoffs to injuries because you play the same opponent and can plan for it than to grind out 82 games. But I could very well be wrong just my 2 cents.
"Bledsoe, Ibaka and Kennard for Wall and House?  When he plays good, he's better than Bledsoe. When he plays bad, the Clippers have Reggie Jackson."
"Not without Kawhi, unless you think PG will play like an MVP and Reggie Jackson will be all star level"
"&gt;Pelicans roster was better than the Clippers roster without Kawhi  No way, LA is a much more intelligent and better spaced team.  Reggie-PG are snipers from 3, and in the playoffs they closed out the 1st seed Jazz without Kawhi &amp; almost went up 3-1 on PHX if not for an alley oop GW.    Batum was on the verge of retirement and so was Jackson, both became some of the best role players in these playoffs."
"What makes you think he’ll give more effort plying with Paul George and Reggie Jackson than he have playing with Zion, BI, and Lonzo?"
"Because Rudy Gobert, the supposed clear best defender of this generation got cooked constantly from Reggie Jackson driving at his face. The whole team are frauds."
"Dame and maybe Luka imo.  You have to build your offense around these guys and then hide them on defense, PG is a more accurate shooter and a very good defender, so if you want to win a championship i'd take PG.   I think Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum stink, but if you put elite three point shooters and defenders around them they look kinda good.  Luka and Dame kinda take the wind out of Porzingis and CJ's sails, PG can play with anybody."
So? Just because they play different positions we can't say shaq &gt; reggie jackson?
"Every Pistons fan knows he was [jokingly referring to his close friend Reggie Jackson](https://mobile.twitter.com/MickstapeShow/status/1262740965430669323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1262740965430669323%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-37505139794270388879.ampproject.net%2F2108280007001%2Fframe.html) in that clip. Incidentally, Reggie loved him so much as a teammate that he [literally shed a tear talking about their friendship](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f0vqdb/as_the_andre_drummondreggie_jackson_era_closes/). And that wasn’t when they were being broken up — he got emotional talking about his closeness with Andre during a random interview before a regular-season game!  You may or may not respond with some more shit, but watch that clip and reconsider (in your head at least) whether you have enough evidence to say someone is “by all accounts” a “complete jerk.” Again, I’m critical of Andre and I’m disappointed in his career, but you don’t have enough evidence to be throwing that kind of shit out there."
"You don't think that star players aren't going to play for something that gives them a competitive edge over their rivals?  For a team like the warriors for instance signing a guy for the Full MLE without it counting towards tax or cap would be huge. Imagine being able to add a Jae Crowder, a reggie Jackson, a Nick Batum. You'd be able to offer market rates whilst still. Offering contention. And for mid tier teams it's another way they can improve. The blazers would probably love it.  Plus if the squad is still getting 1 million, this gives role players the incentives, and the core players incentives as well."
"You're not understanding my point. The fact that the best thing on offense you can give Gobert is how well he sets his screens is pitiful. If you're a 7'2 center (not even counting the fact that he's on a max contract), you should be able to back down a 6'9 Morris, Paul George, Batum, and even 6'4 Reggie Jackson/Luke Kennard instead of relying on your guards to create something for you when you're looking to grab a bucket. You don't think Lebron, KD, and Shaq all disrespect Gobert for a reason?"
"The Clippers role players never really got the props they deserved that series. Marcus Morris, and Reggie Jackson are certified Mavs killers"
Reggie Jackson whenever he sees Gobert
"So you can rewatch Jazz vs Rockets and Clippers and say he hasn't gotten exposed? Reggie Jackson blowing by Clarkson a million times isn't Gobert's fault, but if you aren't able to recover and get a good contest after having 20 3's rained on your head, I don't think you're the DPOY. And that's not even considering his offensive deficiencies that rely purely on being fed open PnR lobs from an elite guard"
"They sacrificed getting those piss poor perimeter defenders in exchange for more firepower. Clarkson was getting blown by Reggie Jackson every time, but he had 20 points and was pretty big in getting that 25 point lead."
"I was unaware that Bogdanovic, Ingles, and Clarkson were injured. Reggie Jackson was blowing past everyone"
"Reggie Jackson, 2014 1st round game 4 vs. Memphis"
Nah I don’t think he’s that bad  I think he’s better than guys like Lonzo and Reggie Jackson
In the stretch of games without Westbrook KD averaged 35ppg on dam near 50/40/90 with a 19-7 record (60 win pace) in that span including an 11 game win streak where his best offensive help was Serge Ibaka and Reggie Jackson. It absolutely should have been unanimous but KDs MVP season is rarely talked about as a good carry job
"It's worse from a neutral fan perspective because its definitely statistically worse.   But as a Clipper fan, Houston and OKC were worse. The fans had to sit through those chokes, and they were era-ending chokes that proved that team couldn't get it done. The Denver choke, while definitely worse on its own, also FINALLY got us rid of Doc, and the very next season we had our best ever season even with our star going down in the playoffs. Mostly because our worst player in the bubble learned from the experience and balled out this time around (PG, but also applies to Reggie Jackson)  As I firmly believe we'd have stuck with Doc if we made the WCF but lost to the Lakers, I chalk the Denver series up as a necessary evil. No such silver linings with 2014 and 2015"
Reggie Jackson with the Clippers this year had a good run.
Reggie Jackson was amazing for them in the 2014 playoffs. He had some huge games off the bench. He bailed Russ and kd out vs the grizzlies when they were about to go down 1-3.   But he had a huge ego and wanted to start.
"KAT is also the best shooting C in the history of the sport, while Utah can’t rely on Gobert to score against reggie jackson consistently"
lol.  clearly thought you were challenging my hockey/baseball assertions.  yes former Piston Reggie Jackson came up big time in that series
"I was talkinf about reggie jackson on the clippers this playoffs lol, he was able to swing a series as a role player"
Reggie jackson would like a word
"if Reggie Jackson played like how he did in these playoffs, they beat the historic 2014 Spurs in 5, and take down the Heat in 5 as well. It's unfortunate that a lot of their depth they had never panned out. That's an underrated fact when talking about why OKC never panned out post-Harden"
"IIRC Reggie Jackson got traded because he started some beef with Westbrook because he was unhappy that he wasn't playing over him lmao  Someone said this year in the playoffs that ""Reggie Jackson is finally playing as good as Reggie Jackson thinks he is"""
"It's such a shame that a lot of the role players they had (Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne) never blossomed like they are now. They needed that extra firepower"
"&gt; you really  don’t wanna make that argument after Kawhi was nearly taken to game 7 by a warriors team that had significantly worse role players and injury to Thompson.  Significantly worse role players but way better stars. We don’t have anyone on draymond and Klays level. Iggy is arguably better than any role player we have.   We wouldn’t have even made it to the finals if kawhi doesn’t carry us past Philly. And I don’t think Kd could.   Kd went 7 against the grizzlies in round 1 in 2014 lol. Went down 1-2 and almost 1-3 if Reggie jackson didn’t bail out kd and Russ.   Kds 3-1 lead vs GSW only shows that the thunder had enough to win, and according to iggy and others on the warriors, they were the best team that season lol.   They just choked. Choking a lead is not a better run than kawhi in 2019."
"Damn that is an almost unbreakable record, only active player with any chance at all is LeBron and he's 1701 short  Great players always hold these records for obvious reasons, see Reggie Jackson with strike outs or Favre with interceptions. What's absurd is Tom Brady is only 33^rd with like half as many"
Klay doesn't have a season below 40% from 3. That is an elite consistency. If you are claiming that he is hot and cold more than others than you have an all time great expectations towards him  Hot or cold should be considered someone like Reggie Jackson or TJ Warren. Guys like George and Klay are elite as it gets.
Reggie Jackson
"AD and Lebron were both injured, and nobody stepped up for us.  For the Clips I give it to them, Paul George and Reggie Jackson stepped up big time but can you count on Paul George to play like that again? Can you count on Reggie Jackson to play like that again?  And we were the only team when we had Lebron and AD on the floor to give the suns some trouble"
reggie jackson was better than him after kawhi went down
"&gt; Forgot we got monta in the 2nd my bad! Honestly thought we got him as a free agent since our drafting was so bad hah  Nellie's signature was finding 2nd rounders and UFAs. Every year he'd have some Anthony Morrow or Kelenna Azubuike or Marc Jackson come out of nowhere, while the Patrick O'Bryants and Ike Diogus flopped.   Sometimes a Reggie Williams would show up and average 20 for a couple months, then just disappear back into thin air."
"Hard to say because it’s not like Kawhi played poorly before he got injured. Him, Paul George, Reggie Jackson, and Morris all did their things to get past the mavs."
"When PG said Doc didn't make the right adjustments vs Denver, Doc replied by saying Lue was an assistant coach at the time and Lue didn't make any adjustments either.  &gt; Hey listen, I enjoyed coaching him. So not a lot to say there. Ty Lue was sitting right next to me. So he better hope it's not adjustments. It ain't going to be much different.   -Doc Rivers, December 2020  What kind of head coach throws his assistants under the bus? As if it's the assistant coach's job to make adjustments that override the head coach's decisions.  Bad call on the ""it ain't gonna be much different"" either, as Lue did a great job coaching and adjusting in the 2021 playoffs. Doc, OTOH, can't even recognize a good adjustment after it happens - eg, trapping Trae worked well in Game 1, then Philly abandoned it. And you know Doc would never, ever, ever bench Rondo for Reggie Jackson.  Then Doc claimed the other Clippers didn't accept PG, due to PG getting special treatment. But while he was Clippers coach, he claimed there was no special treatment. Then after he left, he claimed there was special treatment but that he'd tried to fight it.  Makes you wonder what Doc even thinks his job is, if he thinks assistant coaches are responsible for making all the adjustments, and he thinks the head coaches has no say in how much leeway any player gets. Apparently Doc, to hear him tell it, had no actual responsibilities while serving as head coach - maybe that explains why he never took responsibility for any of his teams' many embarrassing failures."
Did you see 2021 Playoffs Reggie Jackson?
I doubt that's guaranteed Reggie Jackson is fitting a lot better than John wall right now
"He was horribly inefficient this past season, which is saying something bc he’s never been the most efficient scorer. But he still has some nice burst and straight line speed, and still averaged 20 a game with a broken jumper and questionable shot selection. He can still get to the basket and be a secondary playmaker. I’d love to see him traded to a contending team that needs an elite backup point guard, or a team with a lot of shooters who needs a starting point guard.   My best fit for Wall at this point would be a team like the Nuggets tbh. He would be the secondary ball handler and playmaker behind Jokic, and would be the 3rd option/elite backup  once Murray comes back. They have a versatile lineup full of shooters and he would give them a nice spark. Don’t let this sub or his TS% convince you that the man can’t even dribble a basketball anymore. He had a meh or even bad year, but he still had plenty of great games and flashes of prime John Wall. 2 years missed in a row is a lot of rust.   Also in addition to the Nuggets, would love to see John Wall to the Clippers. They run a platoon at guard the last few years anyway, are a great 3 point shooting team, and they could use another playmaker/scorer/initiator while Kawhi is out. Wall and Reggie Jackson soaking up all the point guard minutes is decent, and could be good once the Clippers are at full strength.   Disclaimer: I know Wall’s contract is ridiculous which probably means he’s untradeable. But I would love to see him on the Nuggets or Clippers if they could make it work."
"Yeah like, I understand he's not a good offensive player in the post, but can they at least try when it's Terrance Mann or Reggie Jackson on him ? When it was Eric Gordon or Harden I understood okay those guys are strong, but against LAC they could've at least tried"
My dream crew is Reggie and Van Gundy. Jackson adds nothing of value.
reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson
"Reggie Jackson. Spent most of his OKC career whining about not starting over Westbrook, but I really liked watching him this playoffs"
"I did reply to you.  the flow of the conversation was  top comment: Lakers will be fine against Jazz because Jazz got owned by Reggie Jackson  second comment:  it's more complicated than that, Lakers matchup differently with the Jazz than Clips  me:  yeah Lakers don't have anyone like Reggie so mentioning Reggie doesn't really make sense  you:  but Lakers have guys who can attack Gobert  me:  other than Lebron, not really in the same way  you: but Jazz don't have anyone to stop Westbrook either  me:  yeah, that's not what I'm talking about"
"I think you've missed my point.  I was replying to the guy who said the Jazz got beat by Reggie Jackson, they'll be fine against the Lakers.  I was just pointing out the Jazz's vulnerability to Reggie doesn't matter in a matchup against the Lakers since the Lakers don't have guards who can do what Reggie managed to do.  That's all I was saying."
Mark Jackson and Reggie Miller are my least favorite analysts. They get so wet for the Lakers it's abhorrent.
&gt; Reggie jackson is a career 35% 3pt shooter  not relevant given the topic of discussion.  the question is whether the Lakers have anyone who can replicate what the Clips were able to get from Reggie in the '21 playoffs.  Monk isn't even going to be a starter.  He's definitely not going to play 30+ mpg.  using him in this discussion doesn't really make sense.
strong argument on how thats asking him to be someone he isnt.  lol okay with the edit. Reggie jackson is a career 35% 3pt shooter
Is this a hint of Reggie Jackson slander? I won't have it
No chance Russell Westbrook could do what Reggie Jackson did though.
Didn't they just get run out the gym by Reggie Jackson? I think the Lakers will be OK
"It was so funny when Reggie Jackson told his teammates to clear out so he could iso Mobley. I was like ""this isn't gonna go how you think it is, my dude"" 🤣🤣"
Reggie Jackson calling for a clearout to iso Mobley was hilarious.
"Oh, I was just watching for Mobley. He is insane defensively, it was hilarious but he couldn't get post positioning on Reggie Jackson, who just pushed him into a corner. He really needs to put on some muscle."
"And there’s nothing wrong with that. But Russ, as an older guy, should just let a kid (on what’s honestly a kid’s team) have his moment.   I think he’s a genuinely good dude off the court, from what little I’ve seen. And outside of Reggie Jackson, all of his teammates have always loved him. He has good relationships with stars around the league. Everyone loves Russ outside of the media.   But damn he can be a sore fucking loser sometimes and that’s kind of disappointing."
"Lauri Markkanen: The Paul George stopper  Reggie Jackson blatantly changing his pivot foot 25 feet from the hoop in front of the entirety of Staples Center and not getting called for a travel perfectly summed up this game, F- refereeing tonight"
"Considerint Reggie Jackson (unlike Kanter and Dion an actual starter) was in that deal, yeah you could've done way better than a guy who was useless in 2 (including one that thye would've 100% win without him )of the 4 playoff series his team was involved in and another who averaged 7 points in 31 minutes per game against the Warriors (and yeah I know Reggie tanked his value because he is an asshole, doesn't mean he + 2 first rounders = 2 back ups)"
sorry not everyone could play like Reggie Jackson :/
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson averages 10.3 3PAs a game. Only hits 28% of them so he does Jack tons.
"Ian Eagle with RJ and Reggie Miller. Sound bites galore lol.    Or Mike Tirico, Mark Jackson and JVG   Honorable mention: Hornets announcer who screams every time. That man should be on National TV"
Reggie Jackson carrys the ball every dribble.
the one I said in my post? lol it wasn't Favors that Reggie Jackson flexed on when he attacked him at the rim. it wasn't Favors who got dunked on by Terrance Mann twice
Bruh Reggie Jackson was sonning him inside in game 6
I get you’re defending Gobert and it totally wasn’t his fault that his guys couldn’t stay in front of their assignments but let’s not act like Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson weren’t going at Gobert game 6
Maxey's ceiling is Reggie Jackson
He also dragged the pistons to the playoffs with Reggie Jackson as the starting pg.
&gt;You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don't take      - Reggie Jackson
"""It's Reggie Jackson time""  -Reggie Jackson"
"""It's Reggie Jackson time!"" - Reggie Jackson"
How is Reggie Jackson leading the Plus minus lmao
"Reggie ""green light"" Jackson"
"&gt;Why is dame stinking so much?  Just one of those nights and the clippers individual defenders a great    &gt;Why is Reggie Jackson jacking up so many shots??  because the blazers perimeter D is awful and they're leaving him open a lot, but just like Dame it just isn't his night tonight"
Why is dame stinking so much?  Why is Reggie Jackson jacking up so many shots??
Not a fan of the way Reggie Jackson has been playing.  He’s on pace for about 30 shots I mean come on that’s absolutely ridiculous
Reggie Jackson looking like he's getting into playoffs form early
Reggie Jackson ladies and gentlemen. That man is fun to watch
His dad is Reverend Jessie Jackson. That’s why they call Reggie “Big Government” and why his high school bros called him Lil Jessie or Junior Jack
Jokic: Big Honey  Reggie Jackson: Big Government
I will maintain forever that he was better than Reggie Jackson on those Pistons teams.
Reggie Jackson was under ranked his whole high school career and went to Boston College. Sure it’s less likely but it happens.
"Pistons had him for 3 years, he was pretty solid off the bench despite the team being generally mediocre. He and Reggie Jackson were some of the few highlights of watching Detroit the last few years."
Reggie Jackson keeps wearing the same two colorway combo of the PGs
"I know he's not really all that great of a player, but when Reggie Jackson is playing nice he looks very smooth. Last years playoffs is a great example. Also I think Tyler Herro is smooth with it as well."
Surprising know one has mention Reggie Jackson. Also not seeing a lot of Kyrie brought up a lot.
I'm surprised they kept putting the ball in Bledsoe's hands towards the end instead of Reggie Jackson?
"I think it would interesting if you swapped Reggie for Klay on those teams. It's not like they were trash. Can you imagine that defense with Klay/Stephen Jackson/Artest/O'neal, and I think Klay gets off any shot Reggie does while also D'ing up the other end."
Dennis Schroeder and Reggie Jackson annoy me for being so over confident while sucking at times.
"Every commentator and analyst don’t care about any teams unless there in the two big markets, Doris is the worst at it by far, van gunny and Jackson close seconds, Reggie at least is pro pacers obviously"
"It’s interesting, though… on most nights, it feels like (to me, readily admitting my bias) all of the other national broadcasters openly root against the Lakers. Van Gundy, Mark Jackson, and Reggie Miller are especially bad. I think my fandom colors that judgment a bit, but my buddy who hates the Lakers often agrees with me."
Lakers needed to get a playmaker in a bad way. If there was a way for them to keep KCP and get Kyle Lowry then that would’ve been the better option.    Maybe they should’ve gone after Reggie Jackson. Or Dinwiddie. But I doubt Nets would’ve cooperated with Lakers.  Perhaps they could’ve rolled the dice on Bledsoe. Maybe even Lonzo.
"1.TJ Warren  has always been known to be a ""random scorer"" i say this as someone who has followed His career since he was with the suns 2. PG has always been bad in the Playoffs post injury he hasn't done well except last postseason not to mention that Clippers team was simply outmatched by the Nuggets (you know what matchups are like yes?) Trez is an undersized Big both Murray and Jokic bullied not just PG but the whole clippers team including Kawhi last Playoofs PG had someone to bounce off him And take the pressure Reggie Jackson was an underrated signing that turned out well for them  and the addition of versatile players like Nic Batum And Ibaka did wonders for them   3. The Heat made the finals that year because they were one of the favourites everyone knew that any of the Bucks  Heat and maybe even The Celtics or  76ers would make a competitive run for the finals once the bucks was out of the Picture the east was wide open for the taking and once again this was a matchup advantage for the Heat Against the Bucks Bledsoe was unsurprisingly disappointing in the playoofs and  Giannis struggled against The Heat not to mention Middleton was the only legit shooter they had Everyone else struggled to shoot which meant Giannis struggled to Drive and kick the heat lost this year because The Bucks actually had a legit good player in Jrue Holiday and they revamped their roster not to mention the heat struggled with health issues through the season With a lot of their players catching Covid Butler was awful but that was only because the Bucks actually had a better roster similar to how the Clippers managed to make a Run to the WFC because of a better roster... It's not rocket science my dude 4.The suns  namely Booker Ayton and Bridges always had potential they only needed one missing piece and that piece was CP3 it's no coincidence CP3 wanted to be traded to the suns He saw what they had if  anything  that bubble run by the suns was foreshadowing of what They could do with a Veteran precence that could also playmake Ricky Rubio obviously wasn't gonna cut it... Not only that they also had Monty Williams they actually had a legit coach in the bubble and the suns this year we saw what they could With A legit coach in Monty Williams And a Vet precence in CP3 and Cp3 has always been one of the best PG's in the league so the bubble run was a foreshadowing of what Booker and Ayton could tho with a legit Point Guard lol and here i thought everyone already knew this"
Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson were taking turns dunking on him
"I used to think the same way but then I stepped back and thought about it and we seem to hate announcer pretty independent of sex tbh.  We hate Marv, Reggie, Mark Jackson, JVG, etc. I think we’re just a really picky group of people lmao.  FWIW, I like Burke a lot. I actually like her takes in general. There are some like Jackie I can’t stand through. Such a homer it hurts. I can’t even name other female announcers tbh."
"It's so annoying because she just clearly has favorite players and does nothing to hide how she favors them. I understand that commentators are fans of basketball too but you don't get Reggie Miller salivating at Pacers wins or glossing over bad calls in their favor. It's only on ESPN too with Van Gundy and Jackson who clearly favor, and dislike, the teams they previously coached.   It's wild how there's no bad broadcast team for the TNT crews, and both broadcast teams are horrid for the ESPN team."
"For sure. Chris Webber, Mark Jackson, Jeff Van Gundy, and Reggie Miller are also really bad IMO, but Doris and Chris Webber are by far the worst. I will actively mute the TV with either of them because they suck so much."
Just you wait. There’ll be dozens of comments about Reggie Jackson / Terrance Mann exposing Gobert soon enough.
"Or you could argue he is a much better catch and shoot player. The guy scored 60 points on 11 dribbles...that is insane. Who needs FT's if you have the ability to catch and shoot at that pace.   The guy is unreal.  Also 37 points in a quarter is silly.   And Reggie played with Mark Jackson and Chris Mullin, both are great shooters. Not to mention Reggie played with better bigs (Dale/Antonio  Davis and the Dunking Dutchman)"
"Some of those concerns are realistic, but you are missing the major reason why we overrate DFS and brought in Bullock (and it was a legit discussion if he should start): defense. We have **zero** decent defenders out of DFS and Maxi. There's a reason we trade for J-Rich, there's a reason why Donnie thought Iwundu would be a thing, and there's a reason why bringing in Bullock was celebrated.   Last series much of the reason that the Clippers could do whatever they pleased was because Maxi was banged up and DFS was gassed. We couldn't switch to save our lives. Both Donnie and Nico had the same line of thought: we won't go anywhere if only 1 player can consistently guard 1-3 in a playoff game, and only DFS could guard anything other than a bus sign against the Clippers.   I think we blew up things by not bringing a proper point (aka Dragic) to allow Brunson to run the 2 and, considering Kidd envisioned KP as PF, it was a sin not to sign Holmes, but signing Bullock wasn't bad. It was a *good* sign for our woes. Hell, Ntilikina will bring what we expect to see from Green last year, a guy that can come off the bench and not allow Reggie Fucking Jackson to go 40/40 from the 3 in 1 quarter.   Our wing defense is good, we have decent backcourt defense personnel, but, honestly, even the majority of us lost sense to the hole at rim defense. This exacerbates due to Kidd wanting to run a fast pace, transition offense, that basically obliges us to start Powell or WCS, one undersized and another with a hustle level that makes Simmons look like Kobe.   If they insist on this gameplan, I definitely can see they using the TPE to trade for a C that can protect the rim and is athletic enough to survive in a transition offense."
Is this supposed to be something new? Dude couldn't post up Reggie Jackson in the playoffs last year.
Esp with 2 main guys and a big bench guy out. But they still have good defense and decent shooting (great for both with all the others in). Question will be which Reggie Jackson and Eric Bledsoe will they get from night to night until Kawhi is back. And can they stay healthy as they have quite a few vets.
Reggie Jackson slipped so many times
&gt;luckily reggie jackson finally got the ball  First person to ever say that ever
"PG is still one of the best players in the league, and Reggie Jackson has turned into a god damn sniper from deep what the fuck"
I somehow feared Reggie Jackson the most despite being cold all game
"Reggie ""iso god"" Jackson. Dude got every mismatch he wanted i stg."
Reggie Jackson looks like the MyCareer player that equips every accessory possible for each body part and they are all different.
"Reggie Jackson really gets like 20 shots a game, I would re-sign too"
Still not used to Reggie Jackson being a dependable shooter
Reggie Jackson is so buttery dude
Reggie Jackson man
"I'm hoping for a redemption arc for bledsoe, following the reggie jackson and batum redemption arcs. There's something special in the clipper's side of LA's water."
Fucking finally Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson finally
"Reggie ""I should start over Russell Westbrook"" Jackson giving his best Russell Westbrook impression"
this is without reggie curry jackson shooting a fucking shot like he was all playoffs
Reggie Jackson must’ve been hanging around chuck in the offseason with having to many doughnuts
Reggie Jackson breaking his own ankles lol
"Reggie is still drunk from his name being on the 75th-anniversary list, he literally just called Mark Jackson a ""visionary."""
"Well, talent-wise he deserves to be on it, but greatness wise, he’s on the borderline. People bring up 3 rings and his comparison is often Reggie and Ray. Look, I think Klay in a vacuum is just as good if not better than those two. But, Klay has never been a first option like Reggie was, or high up the 3pt list like Ray Allen is.   Reggie Miller took MJ to 7 games with his best help being Rik Smits and Mark Jackson.   Took a Pacer team to the Finals with Jalen Rose and Mark Jackson as his best help. Not to mention, playoff Reggie is a tier or two above Playoff Klay.   On the other hand, Ray Allen has the longevity over Klay while having peaked higher than Klay. Has 2 rings of his own. Has been 1b or 1 in Milwaukee and Seattle. So, while I like Klay, his resume (for Ray) and impact (for Reggie) don’t quite match up to these two. Talent wise, you can make a case"
"I like to compare announcers with their peers. One of the worst in all of sports means he is worse than…   Booger McFarland   Mark Jackson   Baseball Joe Buck   Cris Collinsworth   Magic   Bill Walton   Dicky V   Troy Aikman   Brent Musburger   senile Marv Albert   Reggie Miller   Howie Long   Joe Tessitore   Mark Schlareth   *shark tank voice* **and for that reason, I’m out**"
Cuz Lac will be in no man's land and may decide to have a premier creator which they tbh still lack..and fit wise too Things can't get better than at Clippers for Russ...You can Run a lineup like Russ/george/Mann/Morris/Ibaka with zubac /Batum on the bench..and Leonard can slide in to morris/Manns place seamlessly when he returns...Which Imo prolly will be a better team than having Bledsoe and Jackson run point and kennard was barely used last season anyway.. Reggie is good but I don't expect him to be as good as he was in last playoffs
"lol yeah exactly.  there's a reason you can't describe what happened in that series.  it's because you didn't watch it, or at least didn't watch it with enough knowledge and intent to form your own opinion.  we have exactly one player that is a competent perimeter defender, and the original game plan of having Royce guard PG didn't work once Reggie Jackson started lighting everybody up.  so we had to move Royce over to Jackson and put Gobert on PG as our only competent defender.  that left Bogdanovic guarding the 5, which he literally can't do, so coaches just left Terrance Mann open.  if you're interested in learning something and not just talking shit, watch that play that was on all the highlight reels of Mann dunking on Gobert.  Gobert picked PG up on the 3 point line, guarded his drive forcing him to give it up to Mann in the corner. Bogdanovic is the closest defender but doesn't move to close out on Mann because he was fronting Marcus Morris on the 3-pt line like he was denying an entry pass to Tim Duncan on the low post.   Gobert on that play picks up one of the best offensive players in the NBA, stops him from getting to the basket, then when he kicks it to the corner Gobert runs from the basket to the 3 point line and runs Mann off the corner 3, then follows him and contests his shot at the basket.    he was playing without reservation the best defensive basketball I've ever seen anybody play in my life during that series, but goobers like yourself just see the dunk highlight and go to bbref and think he sucked.    if you think Rudy Gobert played poorly in that series you're a moron."
"And that led to them slumping out of the playoffs against a team without their best player, because Gobert couldn’t score against 6’8 guys and the team wasn’t good enough playing defense against Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann while Gobert was forced to stand in a corner. Like I said there’s a cap on your teams success. Paying Gobert 40 million means Mitchell has to ascend to a top 5 player to compensate. Whereas when you use your maxes on players who can give you production (Giannis&amp;Middleton/ Bron&amp;AD/ Steph&amp;KD/ Harden&amp;CP3) you can have Kevon Looney or Brook Lopez or Clint Capela at center and be a better more dangerous team."
"It's true, local sportswriters, Sports Illustrated and later Slam &amp; ESPN would blow out dramas.  They did this with ""whose team is it, Kareem's or Magic's?"", Marbury vs Garnett, Scottie Pippen vs Phil Jackson, Spike Lee vs Reggie, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refusing to stand for the anthem, Dennis Rodman vs Larry Brown, Jordan banning Isiah from the Olympic team, ""is Charles Barkley a role model?"", Karl Malone creeping on Kobe's wife etc.  This is the stuff people care about. No one wants to hear real analysis, they want drama."
"Shamet isn't an MLE-worthy player. You don't give MLE money to a 9th-10th man. He's getting paid more than Reggie Jackson, who averaged 18ppg in the playoffs on 48/40/88 splits.  Shamet averaged 4ppg in the playoffs."
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
nba showing anti-reggie jackson propaganda smfh
"&gt; Uses so many cliches. Tends to state the obvious. And all he does narrate stats/averages/standings  This describes most national color commentators. Are you really getting great insight from Marc Jackson, Dorris, Reggie, RJ, Chris Webber. Once in a blue moon JVG will pause his podcast to talk about the game.   Personally I like Hubie because unlike all those other guys, I've never had to mute him because he is actually ruining a game with him commentary."
"I mean, look at the numbers for Ayton against perimeter defenders in the playoffs. Reggie Jackson and Paul George were like 30% when Ayton was matched up against them"
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
Reggie Jackson??
&gt; Also PG is a Conference finals player as the #1 option. Luka hasn't done that yet  lmfao PG doesn't get out of the 1st round without kawhi and reggie jackson carrying his ass
"Yup. Most of the really good defensive guards have a crazy wingspan. Makes contesting shots and getting deflections that much easier.   Josh Okogie has a 7'0 wingspan, but is only 6'4. Reggie Jackson is 6'3 with a 7'0 wingspan. Jrue Holiday is 6'3 with a 6'7 wingspan. Etc."
"Nick Nurse is overrated and won’t win the best coach award. The Raptors are going to be a play-in team no doubt. LeBron is going to win MVP and let’s be honest, Gobert is egregiously overrated at defense. Reggie Jackson was bodying that oaf"
Reggie Jackson didn’t like being Westbrook’s backup for OKC back in the day
"jumping into defenders is one thing but players are way more skilled now from the perimeter. back in 2012 how many players could shoot 3s off the dribble or even do a step back 3? maybe KD, Melo, Curry, Kobe, lebron, pierce?  now you got non-star guys like tj warren, levert, terrence ross, mccollum, reggie jackson who can all create 3s"
"On one hand, I can't blame you because if I weren't a Pistons fan, I wouldn't have paid attention to anything that has to do with the organization from the past 12 years either.   But on the other hand, that doesn't make anything you said correct.   &gt;Drummond: tries his best  This was actually one of the biggest sticking points of his tenure and why so many folks were ready for him to go by the time it was all said and done. He often played as though he was half asleep, he frequently skimped out on the concept of defensive rotations, and was a big fan of slumping his shoulders and not getting back on D when things didn't go his way.   &gt;statpads to try to make all-star teams  I felt his first all-star selection was pretty natural. That was when he arguably was as close to knowing his role as he ever got. Reggie Jackson was out there setting the table for him and he was poking lobs through the hoop. But the more shine he got, the more he decided he wanted to try to do out there, despite it being well outside his skill set.   &gt;is asked to do way too much on a mediocre-at-best team  The opposite is true. Coaches, particularly Stan Van Gundy, would implore this dude to stop trying to be something he wasn't. He was made to dunk lobs, clear the glass, and be a defensive presence. What they got post-'16 is someone who decided to skip making layups in lieu of spotting for threes and someone who seemingly couldn't go a day without trying to isolate off the dribble so he could get to his 14-foot contested floater spot.   &gt;is blindsided by a trade  Dude was on the trading block for years and knew it. The pattern, for years, generally went like this: Dude played hard for a stretch, then the Pistons had hope that he could be a part of a winner. Then dude would go back to playing outside himself and lumbering about and his trade value would instantly disappear. Eventually, his value dropped permanently and by then it was too late. His swap for table scraps was an inevitability.   &gt;still says good things about Detroit  That's good.   &gt;Blake: hobbles around  For the record, Blake was dealt midway through the first year of a long term contract in Los Angeles and never for a second brought any kind of disruptive attitude to Detroit along the way. Instead, dude buckled up and turned in one of the most impressive individual seasons in team history, yielding a well-deserved All-NBA Third Team honor and playing in the postseason on a knee that'd soon require surgery.   Then, he tried to come back from that injury for the following season but was never fully healthy, requiring another operation that ultimately resulted in 360 days between NBA games. *Then*, he returns and is thrust back into his A1 30+ minutes per game role on dead legs for a team actively trying to tank and, predictably, he played like a guy who hadn't played for a year.   The Pistons and Griffin mutually agreed to a buyout and Blake gets six free weeks midway through the season to continue rehabilitation and conditioning, arriving in Brooklyn with fresh legs and a limited role.   Or... what you said."
"He's definitely not DeAndre Jordan to a tee, but he still could have performed in a similar role in some regards. In fact, during the SVG era, he kind of did, and that's arguably when he was at his most effective. Reggie Jackson/Brandon Jennings/D.J. Augustin would utilize his screens then feed him scraps at the rim - he yielded his first all-star selection off of that.   But the extra stuff just became too tantalizing over the years."
Sucks as a Pistons fan when your team underachieves. Blake is also likely to get this treatment and Reggie Jackson already has. All these players came to Detriot and embraced the city. Unfortunately injuries (effort for Andre) derailed expectations for the Pistons
Safety Glasses Reggie Jackson
"And defending him means that reggie jackson drops 36 off dunks. Results based analysis is dumb, hindsight is 20/20."
"&gt;	SVG's stints in Detroit and New Orleans showed that he's just not as adaptable he was back with the Heat and Magic where he was more readily able to make use of the talent on those squads.  How did the Lakers make use of the tremendous talent of Andre Drummond? When SVG was coaching the Pistons, Drummond was still widely viewed as having a huge amount of potential.  But it’s clear now, in hindsight, that no coach can turn Drummond into a centerpiece. I don’t think he deserves blame for that.   It’s also important to consider that 2 of our starting point guards went down with injury under SVG. Before his injury, Reggie Jackson was performing very well."
That’s commonplace with Stan. Reggie Jackson was statistically the worst NBA starter in the league but SVG started him 4 years in a row &amp; even as the GM he didn’t look to upgrade that position
"When gobert is forced to go back to the paint after Reggie Jackson blows by his man, it would be nice if the team rotated their assignments."
Reggie Jackson taking it right at Gobert at the rim and then flexing on him shows how little fear players have of the DPOY. he's probably one of the most glaring examples of how analytics kiddies don't understand basketball
"All time great playoff scorer. Opposing defenses would double him, throw heaps of defenders at him and he’d still score in large volumes on all time great efficiency. This was with Mark Jackson over dribbling, aimlessly posting up, and providing virtually no rim pressure to attract defensive attention. Pacers default sets were to throw it into the post to Smits or just wait for Reggie to get open via off ball actions.   He’s actually super underrated on ball as well. He wasn’t Kyrie, but his handle was still good enough to be dangerous and put it on the floor. Super good floater/running shot game to compliment his insane shooting. He’s at worst a top 10 playoff scorer of all time, but is probably closer to top 5."
"&gt; I'm telling you the reality of the situation, he's going to go 0/3 this year, you'll find a way to make excuses for him but the reality is he hasn't done anything in the West.  Dude you have been writing paragraphs of excuses about Lebron chip in 2020 for like a hour now, excuses seems to be your strength.  And why do you keep bringing up a different thing every time, talking about people making excuses and pussies and here you are discrediting the Lakers chip because Marcus Morris was a late trade and Reggie Jackson was a late signing lmao."
"https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/  Lets see, we got ...   Danny Green Jae Crowder Tristan Thompson Reggie Jackson Nerlens Noel"
They did - Reggie Jackson is one in his head.
"Wingspan to height ratio is known as an Ape Index and the largest in the NBA is Bruno Caboclo at +11.0 (+11 = 11 more inches of wingspan than height), followed by Mo Bamba and Bismack Biyombo at +10.0, and THT and Reggie Jackson round out the top 5 at +9.0"
"I agree that Steph is a tier 1 talent, I put him tier 2 solely because of coaching of the earlier eras. Mark Jackson is a lot of things, but he is also the guy that believed in Steph from day 1 and gave him the opportunity to become who he is now.   A guy can’t show his talent without a coach to give him minutes and let him play through the mistakes. And even when it became undeniable that Steph was the greatest shooter the game has ever seen in 2016, people still relentlessly criticized his game and took it as an affront to their precious, ugly, caveman basketball they played in the 80s/90s.   Steph being in tier 2 is mainly comes down to a flaw in how earlier eras perceived the game and deemphasized the one thing Steph is the greatest ever at. I think if he was relevant in the 90s, we would regard him as a Reggie Miller (who was considered the best shooter before Steph but no one had him ranked top ten all time) instead considering him an all time out him in your top 10 that he is now."
A defensive system that got exposed by the NBA greats Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann
"I'd also like to see him do it against a different team  The Clippers switch constantly and he always ends up on Reggie Jackson or someone and can just shoot over him or bully his way by  Despite the ""they have Kawhi and PG"" argument he rarely sees either of them in a matchup, the Clippers' scheme actually makes them one of the worst equipped teams to handle Luka(on the other hand, it lets them completely make KP a non factor)"
"Guys like Reggie Jackson, Cole Anthony &amp; Desmond Bane are all shorter guards with low releases and they all average more 3p attempts than Seth on similar to less minutes per game.  If you look at the league leaders in attempts per game there’s really no reason why Seth shouldn’t at least be in the top 50."
"Yeah Pat Bev and Morris are the main ones. Mann is there too because the adjustment to put him in really messed us up. We also didn’t like Harrell when he was there.  Some might hate Reggie Jackson because he goes especially crazy against us, but I view him more like Kawhi. Love how he resurrected his career in the playoffs and balled out."
"It is not shit at all, the only other pointguards worst than Russ in the league are:  - Kemba (no more a starting pg) - Jalen Green - Jalen  Suggs - Cade  - Graham - Monte Morris - Reggie Jackson - Aaron Holiday  That's it. You could argue about Dennis Scrotum also been worst than Russ, but at least he seems more adaptable. And also Lowry is playing bad for now. Anyway if Russ isn't in the worst 10 PG is for sure below average (aka been worst 15).   And that's a fact, if you are dumb I cannot do anything about that."
"No, steals are accredited to the person who tips/deflects the ball away from the offense.   [source from the NBA themselves](https://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/steal-credited-to-defender-who-deflects-the-ball-away-from-opponent/)  The 4th steal should not have been accredited to Steph.  Edit: after reviewing the play again, I realized Reggie Jackson (?) dribbled off his knee. Steph correctly gets the steal. Your reasoning is still wrong though."
dealing with draymond green vs getting switches onto lou williams and reggie jackson
"I love that Reggie Jackson just looked him dead in his eye – didn't even follow the ball – and KNEW that it went in. He's just shaking his head, but there's really nothing you can do."
But how many has Reggie Jackson scored?
"Someone had to, Reggie Jackson didn't show up at all"
Today was especially bad because Reggie Jackson was MIA all afternoon.  Bledsoe's not the PG and isn't even averaging double figures. Reggie's averaging almost 20ppg and put up 0 (with 1ast and 3 turnovers).
Bledsoe wasn't too bad. Wtf happened to playoff version of Reggie Jackson tho?
A reminder that Scooby the dog had more points this game than Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson limited to 13 minutes with 4 fouls through 3 quarters.  Hope he can get in a groove in the 4th.
I pick the wrong day to bet on Reggie Jackson
Scooby has more points than reggie jackson 🤣
Scooby has put the ball in the hoop more than Reggie Jackson has today
ok Third Quarter Warriors vs. Reggie Jackson Nonsense let's go
"Nicholas batum, Reggie Jackson. The Morris Brothers. Jeff Hornacek derrick fisher. Rudy gay"
"Westbrook isn't hard to play with if your a primary scorer. He didn't have issues sharing the ball with Durant, Paul George, Harden, or Beal. He's had no issues deferring to LeBron and AD this year. Westbrook might be hard to play with if you're Reggie Jackson, but he's superstar friendly."
Embiid and Jokic can’t be guarded by Reggie Jackson so it’s tougher to go full small ball on them than the Jazz
"No it’s definitely not Rudy’s fault that he hasn’t developed offensively in 5 years and couldn’t score against Reggie Jackson, Mann, and Batum on switches. According to Jazz fans"
"Reggie Jackson is so underrated, and Hartenstein finally figuring things out has been big for them.  They’ve had such a deep team for over half a decade now, and that’s which a ton of turnover."
"The Jazz including Rudy aren’t a good enough perimeter defensive team to win in the playoffs. Rudy, Mitchell, and Conley are all below average/bad perimeter defenders. They got destroyed by Reggie Jackson, Terrence Mann and Paul George. What do you think will happen when they come up against Booker/CP3 and Steph/Klay?"
Like I said if Gobert was a stronger presence on the other end then it would be mitigated. You can’t switch onto Embiid and AD with Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum like you can with Gobert. Conversely Gobert can’t close out on shooters from the paint like Ayton and Bam. Worst of both worlds.  The only way to solve the issue is to make a trade since Gobert hasn’t improved on offense over the past few seasons
It was so hilarious last year watching PG and Reggie Jackson just go right pass them every play and making Gobert help which left shooters wide open every time. I felt so bad for Rudy lol

Who'd have known Reggie Jackson would be such a great fit for the Clippers. I'm happy for him
TIL Reggie Jackson is a white American family.
Yes because a guard (who carried your offense) being a bad defender should torpedo an entire team's defense.

The Thunder were much better without Westbrook. They were unstoppable when Westbrook was injured in 13/14 with Reggie Jackson starting PG. Only for Russ to come back and shoot 32% against San Antonio. I think OKC would’ve won it all that year without Westbrook. I got shit on for years saying Westbrook is a negative to any championship contending team except people are finally starting to realize I was right just in the last year or so.
Reggie Jackson was 62.6% scoring almost 18 ppg in the playoffs last year. Westbrook’s career high was 57% in his first playoffs and was never above 54% after that
"Don't look now, but Reggie Jackson has the same TS as Russell Westbrook at 51%."
man it pissed me off the reggie jackson turned into a 15-20 ppg scorer because they were my only hope for getting wall off houston😭
"&gt;He would start in the Clippers and the Knicks  He would be the 4th best point guard on the Knicks roster, and he's not better than Reggie Jackson at this point in their careers.  &gt;and would improve the 2nd unit of literally every contender  Cool, that's not in any way relevant to a comment about him being a starter."
"Not always. In Detroit, 1 and 10 were both still in use (Reggie Jackson and Greg Monroe, respectively) when they were retired for Billups and Rodman.  Both continued to wear those numbers until they left Detroit, then the Pistons removed them from circulation."
Oh. Lol. I thought you were saying I misunderstood you. Shouldn’t you be hanging with the fam on turkey day instead of redditing? Or not American?   Clips play the pistons tomorrow. I’m not American but I am thankful for Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard. And Marcus Morris I guess. Thanks Pistons!
Pat Bev bags on the janitors while Reggie Jackson talks to them
"I am going to say this again because I have said it in game threads when the game was happening. It is unfortunate that Reggie is getting shit for this because that motherfucker was roasting us, but at the same time it is absolutely the most Reggie Jackson thing that could happen lol"
That’s Reggie “Go see the bitch - er beach” Jackson
**REGGIE “WEDGIE “BIG GOVERNMENT” JACKSON” JACKSON**
"He grew up in my hometown and to my knowledge has never come back, but one time I saw him at a pistons game and he dapped me up when I shouted the name of our city from the top of the tunnel lol.   That’s my Reggie Jackson story."
Reggie “Wedgie” Jackson
"One of my favorite pastimes is hating on Reggie Jackson and saying Reggie Jackson is a bum and this, coupled w last year’s playoff performances, is threatening my way of life"
"Assuming ""Reggie"" is the only name in the NBA that rhymes with ""Wedgie"" (I can't think of another one):  There are two Reggies currently in the NBA (Jackson and Bullock) and roughly 500 players in the NBA, so the probability of a wedgie being by a Reggie is about 1/250.  And the probability of a Double Wedgie Reggie is roughly 1 in 7 billion."
"There’s a comment that said nicest and grateful, he said reggie Jackson for that too"
Where’s the Reggie Jackson hater from the petty thread from yesterday 👀👀 Speak up now
For some reason my mind went to Yankees legend Reggie Jackson initially.
Because Reggie the Wedgie sounds like a super hero and Wedgie Jackson just sounds like someone has a speech impediment
Anyone remember that Ballboy AMA from a couple year ago where he said Reggie Jackson was the nicest person he's ever met
"I’m calling it. From here on out, Reggie Jackson will be referred to as Wedgie Jackson on No Dunks for the rest of his career."
I didn't know I liked Reggie Jackson but now I love Reggie Jackson
these two wedgies by Reggie are going to be referenced by the No Dunks guys forever.   Wedgie Reggie. Wedgie Jackson.

You also had players who barely played in the regular season (Kennard and Mann) step up and Reggie Jackson looked like a damn near all-star. You can't deny that the Clippers have a better roster than the Mavs
"Yeah someone post Reggie Jackson wedgie-ing two consecutive shots, shit was so improbable."
Wedgie Jackson (not my joke I love reggie but that was hilarious)
"Lol Reggie Jackson wedged the ball twice in ot. Which apparently, has literally never happened"
it’s entertaining because reggie jackson turns into prime MJ versus us
Reggie Jackson has been my best waiver wire pick up this year. Him and lamarcus
"Hello everyone, I just got released from prison after serving a 10 year sentence, is Reggie Jackson the best player in the league?"
"Imagine what the Mavs would look like if they had a Reggie Jackson caliber player on their team, the inconsistency is killing them"
the correct answer is reggie jackson
"Reggie Jackson definitely isn't good enough to have such a cool nickname like ""Big Government""."
I want Reggie Miller to see the pacers make finals one time and see them get absolutely blown out. Then I want him to be at dinner the following night eating sad food with mark jackson and Jeff van gundy. He’d then choke on his dinner and they would argue over who’d need to do the Heimlich to him as the life left his Voldemort ass head. His last words he’d hear would be those two absolute knuckle heads bickering as he made his signature pose one last time before crossing to the great Wendy’s in the sky.
"I met Reggie Jackson once, super nice guy"
"I sports hate Reggie Jackson for no reason. I don't know when it started, but I relish when he sucks and get angry when he's good. He's probably a really nice guy, but fuck Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson?
"Do you watch NBA games or look just look at BBall Ref. Watch games.   Because the starters are better than the bench unit. Russ’s net rating is not solely based off of his time running with the starters whereas harden and PG played more with the starters because of Russ’s reputation as a floor raiser  Is Reggie Jackson/Andre Roberson/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Steven Adams a stacked team? No, it only through the addition of another superstar that they become stacked"
"Yeah Luka not passing to KP is the reason he couldn't post up Reggie jackson, or grab more than 3 rebounds being 7 feet"
"So? Kawhi wasn't ""fed"" by Lowry, he created for himself in those playoffs. Never talked about DeRozan. Kawhi had the same numbers last year with Reggie Jackson as his PG. Lowry wasn't the reason Kawhi was getting those numbers, he creates his own shots."
"OKC’s picks since 2013 have been really high, by and large. We don’t know the impact of their recent and  more realistic drafting for a while. Giddey is looking very good already. Poku was a risk. But you’re not going to find value (normally) in the 20s. Even in the mid teens, often.   I’m not defending OKC’s drafting ability, only pointing out that, we haven’t seen that prowess in play for quite some time. Since they drafted their trio of MVPs, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, that is."
“awkward sho-OH MY GOODNESS”  actually the Reggie Jackson experience
Reggie “Aomine Daiki” Jackson
"Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson in the 4Q &gt; Jordan (THE COUNTRY).  Thank you to THJ for not turning into Steph and KD on us for a change."
Paul George and Reggie Jackson straight up smoked the mavs in the fourth quarter
Reggie Jackson aim bot
Opinion of mine: Reggie Jackson fits very well into the Clippers system and if he played on any other team he'd be doing much worse than he does now.
Reggie Jackson and 32 million in cap space
Whos better Westbrook or Reggie Jackson
"Reggie Jackson wishes he could pick and choose to play last year's playoff's Jazz every game, with injured Conley, injured Mitchell, Clarkson, Bojan, Ingles, and Niang. Our only point of attack guy was Royce and he was stuck on Paul George."
Live and die by Reggie Jackson
"A few of those Clipper guys who went off in the playoffs last year: Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann"
Reggie Jackson should stick to hitting homeruns
"it's actually pretty easy. Clippers didn't even care about Gobert and smothered the ball handler. if the pass to Gobert did get through, they just stunted at him with a corner defender and that was enough to make him freeze up because he's too slow to make the secondary read and not capable of dribbling more than once  they even got away with rotating Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson onto him in the post several times"
"I mean San antonio had great fucking teams built arround timmy, he also had the likes of The admiral, ginobili, parker, mad max, reggie jackson, kerr and so on during part of his playtime, on TOP of being coached by a top5  coach all of his carreer.  In the first 8 years of lebron career he had Mo williams, ilgauskas, varejao while being coached by Mike brown, not even comparable IMO"
KD Harden Kyrie is what then😂? Hell no. PG and reggie Jackson is not a super team in any way shape or form. Clippers have found the right combination of resources. That is example of roster construction.
"This could go either way. No one was allowed to take so many 3’s back then, or even when Curry entered the league. But no one was as good at generating or making them as Curry is either. Curry was already shooting 44% when he entered the league, better than Reggie ever hit in his career. Not only is Curry better at getting open than any other shooter (through any method - screens, ball handling, off-ball movement, etc), he’s also got pretty much the fastest release ever seen, so he needs even less space to be considered open. It’s only a matter of time before he breaks out in one of those MSG 54 point shooting display-type nights, especially when he’s a primary ball-handler like he was on the Mark Jackson Warriors. And when that happens, you’d be stupid not to try and run plays for that guy, especially when he’s more effective on said plays than anyone had been to that point in history, would you not?   Also TSadd isn’t a 3-pt shooting stat, neither is TS%, since they factor in 2’s and free throws, so it’s more relevant to scoring discussions than it is to a 3-pt philosophy discussion. Using a raw 3pt% stat, or an open 3pt% stat, would be better here imo."
Lol at his first assist to Reggie Jackson. I feel like at a certain point that shouldn't be an assist.
"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don’t understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden. For most teams the 2nd option is Bojan Bogdanovic, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, or even Reggie Jackson or RJ Barrett. And out of all of those players CJ is the best scorer AND playmaker you can get."
"Does not have big names? How dare you disrespect Reggie ""Big Government"" ""Mr June"" ""Bobby Schmurda"" Jackson like that??"
"""I'd rather go 0 for 20 than 0 for 8.""  -Kobe ""Reggie Jackson"" Bryant"
"Holiday, Lowry, CP3, Conley, Brogdon, Vanvleet, Lonzo, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Schroeder. I’m sure I could name some bench PGs that are better defenders as well."
"Not really. On similarly difficult schedules the Clippers are 8-5 and the Heat 9-5 (Jimmy's games are 7-4) - whereas while Butler has Bam Adebayo, Lowry and Herro (who I include in this list completely unironically), the peaks of PG's supporting cast are probably Batum and Reggie Jackson.  By the boxscores PG is 26.5/8/5, Butler is 23.5/5.5/5 albeit on better efficiency - but Butler has twice as many of his shots assisted and hopefully not too controversial but Lowry&gt;Bledsoe."
"Prime Blake dragged a horrendous Pistons team to the playoffs. His supporting cast was Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Wayne Ellington.   Throw prime Draymond on that 2019 Pistons roster and it’s a lottery team"
"I think Lakers fans are too attached to him. Say they didn't have Reggie Jackson, the Clippers would absolutely give up Mann to get Lowry if it were possible."
Saw Reggie and thought you meant Reggie Jackson lol
"The bench was bad at the beginning of the year when Reggie Jackson, Lou, and Kennard were playing together, but Lue adjusted and now they don’t and it’s been much better. As long as you play the right people around Lou he can be impactful"
"But they aren’t. Lou will is averaging the least minutes of his career since his second season in the NBA. Also he hasn’t even played the last two games and the Clippers won those games by 38 and 33. Reggie Jackson is completely out of the regular rotation now. Eight of his minutes tonight came in garbage time and he played 18 mins against the Kings bc Bev was out. Prior to that he hadn’t played in a week due to DNP-CDs.  If Lou Will and Reggie are your concerns, they shouldn’t be. So what exactly is the piece that they need?"
They're still a piece away. Lou Will and Reggie Jackson shouldn't be rotation players on a championship team.
"We're very polarizing; go up by 18, almost lose the lead; the pacers made it a game by half time. In the third we pull away making it a 20+ point game.    And ... we have Reggie Jackson"
Undefeated when Reggie Jackson dunk
"Fair enough. But I look at the best scorers as the ones who can score when it matters most. When the defense is at their best with everything to lose. Harden reminds me of that insult that George Steinbrenner used to say about Dave Winfield:  &gt;Steinbrenner often disparaged Winfield, saying to the press in 1985, ""I let Mr. October (Reggie Jackson) get away, and I got Mr. May, Dave Winfield. He gets his numbers when it doesn't count.""  Derek Jeter would fall into a similar category. His numbers weren't always great but he was the guy you wanted at bat in the most important moments of the game."
last season reggie jackson but he’s been really great and stopped doing that so far this season
Reggie Jackson but good
"Last year the best ones were Marvin Williams, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Jeff Green, and MKG. 2019 was the best I can remember in recent years, Wes Matthews, Wayne Ellington, Enes Kanter, Jeremy Lin, Carmelo.  Realistic ones I can think of this year are Robin Lopez again and maybe Aron Baynes? If the Raptors continue to struggle"
"that defensive stat is because ty lue was running our lou, kennard, and reggie jackson in a 10 game sample size, saw that it didn’t work, and now he won’t use them together like that anymore. nothing more to really talk about"
"Yeah, this stat is 100% bc Ty was playing Luke at the same time as Reggie Jackson and Lue Williams, whereas those players had more time mixed in with the starters.  Lue already said he tried it for a 10 game sample and saw it can't work, and already the defense and Luke's play are improving."
"Kennard was playing with Lou Will and Reggie Jackson until a couple games ago. Obviously his defensive stats are gonna be bad. Our entire bench unit’s defense will be bad because of how many minutes that lineup got. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think Kennard is a good defender (I have him below average), but come on...at least try to use stats correctly."
Reggie Jackson and Patterson are also pretty bad defenders.
The new Reggie jackson and ibaka duo that would absolutely murder us
Hard to say when one duo had Chris Paul and the other had Reggie Jackson.
clippers are undefeated when reggie jackson is starting...
Petition to replace one of webber/jackson/marv/reggie with mad max
bro that reggie jackson dunk WHAT
Reggie Jackson hot potato-ing out of open threes starting to bug me
Why is this man not on TV? He's gotta be better than Reggie Miller or Mark Jackson
"&gt; I really feel like if he was on a smaller contract and in a better spot, he'd be a respected player  Yup. Through all his years in Detroit I also felt he could have totally benefitted from an alpha dog or three above him who wouldn't stand for some of his on-court tendencies (random 3-point shooting, conceding possessions, bad fouls).   Instead, it kind of felt like Drummond and Reggie Jackson were handed the keys to the team when neither one of them had any real bearings of how to be legitimate team leaders and at that point, sometimes it felt like no one could tell those guys anything. I could frequently feel SVG's frustration with Drummond permeating through my television screen every post-game press conference, but he knew Dre held the upper hand there.   But had Drummond been a piece instead of a feature somewhere? Earning way less than his $23 mill but on a competitor like the LA's or GS (or even that next tier down), I always felt he could be a quintessential championship piece if he acknowledged and stuck to his role."
Why am I watching Reggie Jackson right now? What did I miss?
"luka can absolutely be schemed against and we successfully did so several times in our series (doc for some reason deciding to have reggie jackson defend him notwithstanding). he's an average at best shooter and can have trouble if you prevent him from muscling his way to the rim. obviously he's a superstar and will still get his, but so does giannis."
Reggie Jackson last year against us. We lost because of him because he shot better than goddamn prime Curry crossed with Ray Allen.
"The story was when he first got Reggie Jackson he punched him for stealing boards from him, lol. He’s gets clowned for it, but this is the same mentality a lot of old school centers had tbh."
Clips would have to throw in Reggie Jackson to the nets. Then it’s perfect  Edit: Clips also have PatPat so throw him in too
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
Reggie is not that bad. I'll stick by that  Webber just talks too damn much and makes shit up but every so often he has some good lines  Mark Jackson just sucks. Straight up
we'll take him for one (1) lightly used reggie jackson
"Marv Albert &amp; Reggie Miller are the nut low, but Mark Jackson isn't much better"
reggie jackson too
"Clippers. Rough watching Luke Kennard, Reggie Jackson and that other dude off the bench"
"I wasn't born for the first 2. But I feel really proud that the 2004 Pistons are ALWAYS the team that we talked about in the ""didn't have a superstar but won"" (even tho Chauncey and Ben were superstars for me) type of talk.  The tought of that is what made me survived years of Ben Gordon, Rodney Stuckey, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smth and Reggie Jackson"
Kobe was notoriously difficult and the only teammate who hated Russ was Reggie Jackson and the whole team hated Reggie
I’m good w saying the cutoff is Reggie Jackson and below
Reggie Jackson chose Kawhi over Bron
"&gt;Over half the season for both Kendall and Sebastian.  Barely.   &gt;And again, my argument isn't about Reggie Jackson. If you have more information than opinions - then share. I am waiting.  I'm giving you information. Dragic having an increase in scoring and a significant increase in efficiency is a fact. Dragic having a significant increase in advanced metrics is a fact. Those aren't opinions.   And nobody is talking about Reggie Jackson anymore lol"
"Over half the season for both Kendall and Sebastian.  And again, my argument isn't about Reggie Jackson. If you have more information than opinions - then share. I am waiting."
Reggie Jackson played more minutes than Westbrook that year
My overall point isn't just that Reggie Jackson should have won - it is that Goran should NOT have won.
"&gt; So, based on a simple calculation of personal statistics, the actual winner of the 2013/14 MIP award should have gone to Reggie Jackson, who was actually 13th in voting.  Reggie increased his statistical totals by 12.444 points. For reference, again: Goran increased his by 4.063.  Reggie Jackson's BPM (using one metric) was 0.1 in 12-13, 0.1 in 13-14. His VORP only went up 0.7 despite more than doubling his minutes.   How does that justify most improved? He probably got the most additional minutes..."
Reggie Jackson and the Tears of Joy
"Reggie Jackson is incredible with the ball, too. He's a dumbass player but his ball handling skill is pretty damn elite. He's always got the ball on a tight string.  That being said I still hope he gets zero minutes. He's a bad overall player."
"Ty Lue's still figuring out his rotations. Our bench has been extremely bad to start the season, since it consists of three guards who are bad on defense (Lou, Luke Kennard, and Reggie Jackson) and just in general seem to not know how to play together. For that reason Lou's had kind of a rough start to the season despite his counting stats.  That said, our rotations changed in the previous game, and Ty Lue's said he's planning on staggering Lou and Kennard as much as possible from here on out. Additionally, he told Lou to stop worrying about playing in the system and to just return to playing his game. So maybe that'll give Lou the opportunity for some more minutes, depending on which of him vs Kennard are playing better that night."
"Hard work is virtually imperative, though the term itself is open for debate. Is hard work just following a coach's instructions in brutal practices and committing to playing AAU and lifting too? Or is it a term meant to describe a Larry Birdian, obsessive compulsive, back-breaking obsession with the game?   If it's the latter, I think there's a bajillion guys out there who lived and died with the game like that and never came close to the league. On the other hand, those with rare genetic gifts buy themselves some breathing room.   For instance, if you push yourself in practice coming up, but maybe you're only the sixth hardest worker on your team, that can be mitigated if you're 6-foot-11 and 250 points at age 17. By and large, you're going to go places your 6-foot-2 teammate with the 6-foot-2 wingspan will never go, regardless of his effort.   That said, being a genetic freak is not a one-way ticket to the league. We've seen plenty of folks squander that. But it *is* a pretty reliable way to thin the heard. I'm certain Reggie Jackson worked hard, for instance. But being 6-foot-3 with a 7-foot wingspan provided him with a wildly significant advantage before even coming out the gate.   I guess I'll just say that for most, hard work is never, ever going to be good enough when it comes to making the NBA, but that little genetic oomph *will* give some a needed bump.   Duncan Robinson would be another example. Super hard worker, but also *reallllllly* helps that he's 6-foot-7 with a seven foot wingspan. If you take everything he's ever done in life in terms of his commitment to the game and packaged into my frame instead (6-foot-3 with a 6-foot-3 wingspan), I don't think he's making it. He'd be incredible *somewhere*, but perhaps not the NBA."
"Their bench has no defense and no identity, Lou William/Reggie Jackson/Luke Kennard are like a sieve in defensive side. If Lou William play no offense, he's useless and he's basically become 2017 Jamal Crawford.   &amp;#x200B;  They need to figure how to staggering Kawhi and PG because their second unit are really bad."
"No, you aren't going to have good defense when your playing Lou Will, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard in the same lineup. That's too much to ask for Morris and Zubac to cover up"
"I wanted to respond to something you said in your OP:  &gt; Maybe stop playing Lou will, Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard together  Is this even an option for the Clippers? Aren't the only other guards they have really just Pat Beverley and Paul George (who's really a wing who's simply playing out of position at guard due to necessity)? Somebody's gotta play those guard minutes and somebody's gotta handle the ball. If it's not those guys, who should it be? You can't play PG and Bev 48 minutes per game."
Jermaine was coming off a year he averaged 20/10 and was third int he MVP voting. Stephen Jackson was peaking. Tinsley was at his peak.   And 39 year old reggie miller was still useful (and actually averaged almost 15ppg when he was forced back to a more primary option due to the suspensions)  sigh lol
"Some of them even lick the hand before free throws (Reggie Jackson), kiss the ball during free throws (Serge Ibaka), play with their mouth guard putting it in and out of the mouth (Steph Curry). Basketball is the one game that is most prone to respiratory virus transmission"
That’s Reggie (one of the all time most freakishly long wingspan to height ratio) Jackson on defense to you!
"Oubre is elite at defense at his worst, did I just read that right?! The guy is -2 DBPM this year, Reggie Jackson is -1.3 for reference"
"I was never that high on Reggie Jackson anyways, but look how it’s going now lol"
"I would trade reggie Jackson for a bag of cheetos, just get him out of here"
"Well he did get Kawhi and Paul George in the previous offseason. On a talent acquisition standpoint, that's really good.  This season though, we got Serge and resigned Morris, got Batum, I guess Kennard is a decent move (also 4 second rounders, thanks Detroit), but resigning PatPat above min salary, and getting Reggie Jackson back are both moves that I don't agree with, at least."
"LOL. Also Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Patterson  Now that most players from past OKC teams Wiggins played against have dispersed across the league, I hope he thinks he's playing against OKC every time he sees a former OKC player on the opposing team:  * Blazers (Melo, Kanter) - current split 1-1  * Pistons (Grant) - 1-0 so far (do we play Eastern conference teams 1 more time in 2nd half of season?)  * Kings (Corey Brewer) - 1-0 so far  * Pelicans (Steven Adams)  * Wizards (Westbrook)   * Nuggets (PJ Dozier)  * Sixers (Terrance Ferguson)  * Pacers (Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermott)  * Suns (Cam Payne, CP3)  * Lakers (Schröder, Markieff Morris)  * Nets (Luwawu-Cabarott, KD) - 0-1 so far  * Knicks (Noel, Taj Gibson if they sign him)  * Bucks (DJ Augustin) - 0-1 so far"
"True, I forgot about Lou and Morris being out there too long b/c Zubacs was getting abused so much. Reminded me of the bubble when the Mavs and Nuggets hunted Lou, Morris, Trezz, and Reggie Jackson on offense."
"Lou Williams is one of the worst defenders in the league and is a undersized 2 guard most effective offensively against bench units. Reggie Jackson is also an undersized 2 guard who isn't that great on offense who's only a good catch and shoot three point shooter and is a subpar defender. Gary Harris is still better than both of them, Harris is one of the best guard defenders in the league and can still at least finish at the rim offensively even though he can't shoot like Lou or Jackson."
Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson are not starter level players in the league loool
Still so funny they signed Reggie Jackson.
"Luke Kennard, Lou will, and Reggie Jackson should never see the floor at the same time cause they can’t play D"
pat bev + kawhi + paul george + zubat + ibaka + sergio ramos + draymond + oubre + marcus morris + lou will + lebron + kirye irveng + nick batum + harden + xavi + reggie jackson + wiggins + terrence mann + eric paschall = curry
Can I interest you in a slightly aged Reggie Jackson?
Watch Reggie Jackson all day every day. Don't worry about whether his bluster is getting us results or not... he sure doesn't. But a guy to watch? That's him.
Webber has mastered the skill of talking while saying nothing of value. Dude will talk in his boring monotone voice for minutes and speak only in cliches. He's the absolute worst colour commentator in the NBA (I'm including local guys too). Give me Mark Jackson and Reggie Miller over him any day of the week.
Stan tried everything that relationship between SVG and Reggie Jackson/Drummond just got strained as hell over time.   The post ups ended up being a compromise the Pistons were known to start every game often with a post up play for Drummond. Deal was I give you the ball to start and you stay engaged and try on defense for the night. He just couldn’t get through to him Drummond stayed wildly inconsistent on defense he would have stretches of being quite good and stretches of just being a mess.   What SVG wanted was to build his Orlando magic template in Detroit. Lots of pick and roll try to space the court and have Drummond be a mini Dwight as your defensive anchor. Just like with Dwight the compromise had to come with giving him post up touches to keep him engaged. Only Drummond didn’t make it worthwhile
You’re born with the clutch gene. Luka Dončić is not clutch. One game winner against Reggie Jackson doesn’t prove anything.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are clutch. They were born with the clutch gene.
Levert is like shooting guard Reggie Jackson sometimes. Crazy tunnel vision.
"&gt; He’s a one dimensional playmaker. A decent passer with little court vision.   That's good enough for a backup role. The number of backup PGs with excellent court vision can be counted on 1 hand  - Rondo, Lamelo (who will probably be starting by February), Rubio, maybe Monte Morris if you're being generous. It's not like Corey Joseph or Reggie Jackson or Jalen Brunson have great court vision."
"drummond’s defense, he’s not a lockdown but go back and watch him on d and don’t focus on him, focus on how easily reggie jackson and ish smith get blown past. can’t really speak for how it is in cleveland doe."
Booker had no interest in that beating. Talked his trash and then walked back to his corner to pick up Reggie Jackson
"you guys will be active at the trade deadline and the vet buyout market. Why does Reggie Jackson suck this bad? I think its because the clippers don't know how to actually get guys who fit into their offensive system. I think they just spam ""talent"" when it comes to building out the team."
Not even the worst clipper players tonight. Reggie Jackson was brutal.
Can we trade Reggie Jackson for Jim Jackson.
"Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard were exceptional for the Spurs"
-21 from Reggie Jackson my eyes
I don’t know if Kawhi is great enough to withstand Reggie Jackson
"""Fuck the Clippers"" - Reggie Jackson"
"Reggie Jackson, lou Williams, luke kennard all on the same time.  Spurs score a bunch of points.  Shocking."
"Man, Reggie Jackson is complete ass"
reggie jackson taketh away
"Ok serious question for Clipper fans, how can you guys stomach watching Reggie Jackson and Lou Will on defense when they are inexplicably both on the court at the same time?"
Can’t believe we were able to get rid of Reggie Jackson so easily
Reggie Jackson is mortgaging his future minutes by getting minutes.
Reggie Jackson playing terrible lol
Lmaoooo Reggie Jackson
"The amount of players who get better once they LEFT OKC is astounding. Reggie Jackson, Kanter, Harden just to make a few"
"I know that, i meant like: Sabonis,Durant,Harden,Westbrook,Bledsoe,Steven Adams,Reggie Jackson, Ibaka. List goes on depending on who you value."
You really are unable to read lol  Teague and Reggie Jackson started while Drose was coming off the bench.   You write up so much shit it's maddening
oh yes would have been a lot of playmaking on that team. who's running point Reggie Jackson or DJ Augustin?
"Lou Will, Kennard, and Reggie Jackson gonna get shredded in the playoffs on defense."
PG was +17 in a 5 pt win. Kawhi was -11.   Am I doing this right?  Bonus +/- stat: Reggie Jackson was +16 in 16 mins of play. That doesn't happen often.
"Found the fake Lakers fan. No Laker could possibly think Shaq was better than Kareem.   Kareem   1st and 2nd Championship with the Lakers, Wins vs Dr. J and Darryl Dawkins' 76ers  3rd &amp; 4th Lakers Championship wins vs Larry Bird, Bill Walton, Danny Ainge, Rick Carlisle, and Kevin McHale's Celtics  5th Lakers championship was vs the Bad Boy Pistons.  Shaq...  1st Championship vs Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, and Jalen Rose's Pacers   2nd Championship vs the 76ers Iverson, Mutombo, and Raja Bell  3rd Championship vs the best team they'd beat in the Finals the NJ Nets   Kareem &gt; Shaq"

"Except one dumbass Reggie Jackson who thought he should start over prime Russ, and faked an injury while we were down on man. Fuck Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson. Hit 3 homers in the MLB too.
Reggie Jackson aka Bobby Shmurda had the best face
He waited until Reggie Jackson was right in front of him to make a move. 100% bluster from PG
"The Clippers have a make-a-wish kid on a 1 year contract, name’s Reggie Johnson? Robert Jackson? Something like that."
"You said KD can't carry a team, that's just false nephew. Westbrook played 46 games but Durant literally carried OKC to the 3rd seed with Reggie Jackson being one of his best team mates, just stop."
Reggie Jackson forever and always
"Rose was an amazing player, but boy this man is SUPER fucking stupid  Last season the Lakers were begging Detroit to get Rose for their playoff roster  That's not just an easy ring with low expectations as small minutes role player, it's an easy ring next to LeBron in the nicest NBA city of LA  He turned that deal down saying he didnt want to go to the Lakers (or even the Clippers for that matter - before they went out and got Reggie Jackson off waivers)  Guy could have had a ring and a huge pay day after said ring (see KCP) but instead chose to hold out for another year in Detroit then beg to be traded to the Knicks where the very little mileage left on his legs will be used up in the last half of this season by that mad man Thibs  TLDR: Derrick Rose is about as intelligent as a bag of skittles"
almost everyone except Reggie Theus and Mark Jackson
i think he sucks actually  i think hes totally washed and done  hes reggie jackson level now  but i could be wrong
"Candace is fantastic.  Wade is still kind of figuring things out.  He bumbled a few other phrases besides this one.  I actually like the Ernie replacement guy.  And Shaq sucks.  And for the games, I think Jim Jackson is better than CWebb and Reggie."
Anyone else liking Jim Jackson a lot more than CWebb and Reggie?
"To play devil's advocate, if the Clippers were interested in trading Beverley and had talked to teams about trading him, it wouldn't have to be the Clippers who were leaking the story, it could be any of those other teams. Also, it does make some sense as to why the Clippers might be looking to move on from Beverley, given his age and how he's always injured (as he is right now).   On top of that, he's probably the most valuable trade asset the Clippers have that they'd actually be willing to move. They don't have any 1st round picks to offer, none of their youngest guys are thought of as great prospects (and they're all on tiny contracts anyway), Morris and Kennard are on giant contracts now, PG is untradeable this season because of his extension, they won't trade Kawhi or Ibaka, and I can't imagine they'd be willing to trade Zubac either. Batum and Reggie Jackson are on minimum deals, and Lou Williams is probably a risk to just retire at the end of the year.  So if the Clippers were in fact looking to make some kind of trade to upgrade the roster, Beverley is pretty much all that's left simply by process of elimination. So if you told me the Clippers weren't even looking to make any trades at all, then sure, obviously the Beverley rumor is BS. But if the Clippers are in fact looking to deal, who else is more likely to get moved than he is?"
"Well you can tell them that it doesn't come close to working under the salary cap. The Clippers would also need to include either Zubac, Reggie Jackson or Batum as [even this pupu platter isn't enough to match Lowry's salary.](https://i.imgur.com/VLerbZk.png)"
&gt;Reggie Jackson starts  Yeah thats kind of the problem.
It was either their game vs the Nets or Celtics that I thought that they really need Pat Bev's defense.. but I also thought that Reggie Jackson is terrible as a replacement starter.
"Is it just me or it feels like Lue is removing everything from the former Clippers team (before Kawhi and PG) and building a new one? Who wasn't traded was benched, and the starting line-up now is Reggie Jackson, Batum, Kawhi, PG and Ibaka, with Kennard being the 1st man of the bench.   Not saying it is wrong or anything, Clippers look really scary now, but one must wonder how much a coach and an assistant can disagree."
I understand Lou but why trade bev? Reggie Jackson starts wtf
"Look I'm a ""basketball nerd"" and even I would find it kind of tedious if they forced X's and O's talk into every play. Ppl complain about guys like JVG and Mark Jackson not talking about the game but I hear them speak tactics all the time, its probably just flying over ppls heads because they just say it casually.  ""Player X needs to do a better job staying attached to the body of Redick. Coming off these handoffs theres too much daylight.""  ""Yeah and Player Y guarding Jaxson Hayes is way back because he's a non-shooter, so when he hands it off to Redick, Y is not ip at the line to contest.""  Yall just like to complain to complain lol. But yeah there are some lackluster commentators like C Webb and Reggie Miller part of what makes them so damn annoying is that they try to analyze the game and its just garbage. Trying to make mundane plays sound profound or getting all goofy over a highlight."
1. Kawhi 2. PG13 3. Pat Bev 4. Batum 5. Morris Sr 6. Zubac 7. Tmann 8. Ibaka 9. Reggie Jackson  10/TBD: Rondo
"I think that had a lot to do with wanting to establish some sort of consistency amidst a very erratic situation. Doc knew there was a short window to get to a title with this squad. He had a completely revamped roster with two new Superstars. One was still healing from surgery and the other was load managing a ton of games. He wanted the rest of the main rotation guys to get into some sort of rhythm.   At the time you had Lou Will, Pat Beverley and Shamet ahead of him, and they also picked up Reggie Jackson. Even Jerome Robinson was thought to be a potential future rotation guy.  From the moment Kawhi walked in the door this has been a win now team and there's been an emphasis on getting the team playoff ready in the present, not developing for the future.   Doc failed at that and was fired but I don't think the approach was incorrect personally."
"Stan Van Gasbag trying to will a 39 win Pistons team into glory by trading away Tobias Harris and 1st round picks for washed Blake Griffin to build around flakes Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson.  As Paul Harvey used to say...""and NOW we know the REST of the story""."
"Lol are you trying to pretend like Markieff Morris and Reggie Jackson are really good? They give about the same production as Marvin Williams. You should do an ounce of research before you respond. And are you really complaining that the Bucks and Nuggets, who are led by two superstar big men, didn’t get the buyout guys who all happen to be big men? Of course they didn’t sign with those teams. There’s no need for them there"
Last year alone lakers got markeiff Morris and clippers got Reggie Jackson. That’s total bs that “this is a one time thing” it’s every year bro
Reggie Jackson starts d 2nd half w/ a floater
I saw a stat that Reggie Jackson is like 17-33 from 3 with 4 seconds or left on the shot clock.
"You said games though. So one playoff game Reggie Jackson carried the team, and you use that to convince yourself KD is trash lol. I’m not gonna bother continuing a conversation with someone who doesn’t watch games and just goes off Twitter narratives lol, have a good dag"
Not that year. Maybe 2014 or 2015 Durant and Westbrook played awful in a pivotal game and Reggie Jackson dropped 30+ to save them
Denver isnt as good as last year(although the trade they made might change that)  Portland got slightly better with Covington and powell  The mavs got much worse  The clippers have gotten much worse defensively   The Jazz are playing better but they’re not a serious threat  I mean the only team that actually has the capability of beating the lakers are the clippers but they have too many vulnerabilities on defense with some low iq players on offense( like Reggie jackson).   I think its more than a 50% chance
He was ass af for the Thunder in the playoffs yearly. Had Reggie jackson bailing him out in big games against Memphis

"&gt;People like being angry at refs more than they like learning the rules.   Yes and it's tiring. The refs do miss a lot of calls, always have, but I hate it when people in here absolutely ignore reality and the rules just to bash on the refs because their favorite team lost.  Or things like Jaxson Hayes dunking on Reggie Jackson a couple days ago - I don't think more than 5% even recognized the charge. Instead everyone is *ooOhhoOhHhooooo what are you doing Reggie Jackson...??*. Casuals."
"Devin Booker, Steph (though the narrative gets overplayed sometimes), Embiid, and on the obscure side of things... Reggie Jackson.  Oh, and now we can add Zion to that list"
Stars: Steph Scrubs: Reggie Jackson
"Doris has really grown on me over the past couple of seasons. I used to dislike her but honestly she’s one of my favorites these days. I can’t say I’d stop at a Pistons/T-Wolves broadcast just to listen to her, but she does make any broadcast I listen to seem just a little better.  I am a little surprised as I thought I was the only one who didn’t like Jackson/Reggie/Webber."
"Also, Kennard is regularly getting DNP-CDs nowadays and he has a 4 year $64 million extension that kicks in next year. Nobody is going to want him at that price. He's a negative value asset because of the contract extension he signed. And Lou Williams said recently if he was traded he'd just retire, so all he represents to another team is $8 million in cap space next summer. Reggie Jackson is on a minimum contract, so he can't fetch much. Beverley is incredibly injury prone and is old who also has a contract larger than what he contributes. Morris is also getting old and is way overpaid.   None of those guys really have much trade value. Morris probably has the most value, then Beverley, but everyone else is pretty much worthless in a trade (or worse, would need more assets attached to them to unload them). The Clippers can't give up Beverley without getting a starting guard back, because they're already so thin at guard. And they're using Morris as their closing center because Ibaka has been so underwhelming this year (only 23 mpg). They could possibly do Morris for Turner, if the Pacers are interested in taking on $64 million of Morris who's already 31 years old. But that's probably all they could do unless they trade Ibaka instead."
Whats up with Reggie Jackson? Thought he would’ve been good on that team.
"I respectfully disagree. IMO the problem with NBA officiating is:  1. Nepotism and corruption in the recruitment and training systems (Cuban covered that), resulting in mediocre refs. 2. The league values ratings and highlights more than the game of basketball.   A constant example of this is ""superstar calls"", and a great recent example of this is Jaxson Hayes' ""poster"" on Reggie Jackson. It was a clear offensive foul - Reggie was not in the restricted zone and he had legal guarding position. But no ref in the league is ever gonna call that, since a huge dunk is valued by the league more than a good defensive play (and by extension, more than the rules of the game).   And honestly, judging by this sub's response to that play, so do most fans. So until that changes, and we as fans start to demand a better \*basketball\* product, NBA refs are gonna stay trash."
Why did Reggie Jackson attend the nets game?
I genuinely thought it was gonna be Reggie Jackson
He did it for Reggie Jackson
Problem with this comparison is that Embiid is better overall than Lillard and Beverly is better overall than Whiteside.   Would you rather have Luka and WCS or Reggie Jackson and Embiid? That’s a better comparison.
You perfectly described reggie jackson
That’s the great Reggie Miller to you.... shut the fuck up mark Jackson.
"Pistons fans are fucking stupid when it comes to Blake. We were garbage for 10 years, trying to build around Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond and then traded for Blake and they act like he broke the franchise.  If anybody’s mad that he starts dunking with that prime real estate that big 3 will give him I won’t be surprised."
"He helps them a lot in the sense that he's way better than Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson and kinda combines their skill set into 1 player.  But he still doesn't solve their play-making issues, Hill is a shooting guard in a point guard's body."
"I’m a Thunder fan of simple taste. I see Reggie Jackson get t-bagged, I upvote."
"Hey guys, I think we should all post about how much we support Reggie Jackson. A lot of other players wouldn’t even be in that play! I think him being involved is cooler than the dunk itself!!   /s"
Should be changed to Reggie Jackson shows great hustle and tried to stop Jaxson Hayes from scoring. 90% of the league wouldn’t have gotten in the way of that.
You need to go back a few frames. Reggie Jackson needs to be in position before Hayes starts his shooting motion.

To be fair Jaxson Hayes fucking murdered Reggie Jackson tonight

Reggie Jackson 🤝 Brandon Knight
Stimmy: $1400  Reggie Jackson at Dicks: Bring me the Balls
"I imagine the refund standing over him and in his best Prince voice saying ""In your face Reggie  Jackson."""
Gotta give it to Reggie Jackson. He goes all out trying to take charges. Balls to the wall player
&gt;And he's the only playoff level guard they have outside of Paul George  You're forgetting about Reggie Jackson /s
when the hell was reggie jackson able to shoot like that
I dislike watching Reggie Jackson
"He can't be traded because he signed a contract extension. So we can't trade him till the summer even if we wanted to. We also can't trade Paul George, Reggie Jackson, or Patrick Patterson even though I see them in a ton of trade rumors."
And Reggie Jackson
That game where Reggie Jackson went off
"&gt;etc   James harden, Reggie Jackson"
"Last year when Reggie Jackson signed with the Clippers, Shannon responded to that by saying ""Kawhi can't win by himself like LeBron, he needs all the help he can get"""
Nobody has mentioned:  2011: Reggie Jackson at #24 is fantastic value
"Hey, this feels like 2014-15 Thunder here. I remember when Reggie Jackson hogged the ball for the last three minutes of every game when he wasn't injured and watched as we fell to 3-12. Then Westbrook came back and tore New York a new one.  Good times."
"I remember last midseason the Clippers got Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson, Heat got Iguodala, and the Lakers didn't really get anyone - except Markieff Morris, but Lebron said they had enough. That said, I'm sure he wouldn't mind more additions."
Reggie Jackson played by Bobby Shmurda
The Clippers not having that many good defenders after Kawhi/PG/Bev is part of the issue yes.   The Morris at the 5 132 defensive rating lineups dont have that rating because of guys like Reggie Jackson. And theyve been terrible defensively in the sample we have(small) regardless of who the guards are even when its Beverley/Batum/PG/Kawhi/Mook. One shitty guard isnt going to make that kind of defensive rating good suddenly.  Also Ill believe Ty Lue wont play Lou Williams in the playoffs when I actually see it. Established veterans getting more time than they should in the playoffs is a tradition as old as any. And regardless their defensive rating has been about identical this year with or without Lou Will
"I mean defensive slips might have more to do with Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams and kennard in the rotation and sometimes two of those three will be on the court at a time."
Reggie Jackson step back on Dray when he could've just swung it to Marcus Morris with Steph switched is a perfect summary of Jackson
That awful entry pass by Batum to Kawhi lol  I remember a clip of Reggie Jackson unable to get the ball to Kawhi in another clip some games ago
"Reggie Jackson gotta be up there in pound for pound sweating, that dude is drenched at all times on the floor."
"OKC - durant, harden, westbrook, ibaka, adams, quickley, b clarke, bledsoe, reggie jackson,"
*Ibaka and Reggie Jackson
"Yeah this is an insane take.    The Clippers had no answer for AD, and they were putting Lou Will/Reggie Jackson out there for 20+ minutes a game which means Lebron would just force switches all day and dominate.    And on the other end the Lakers defense would stifle them, Harrell would get shut down. The guards would get shut down. Kawhi/PG would get theirs but every point would be a struggle and would leave them worse off when trying to stop Lebron/AD."
Fingers crossed for Reggie Jackson to be included in the rumored Lowry-to-Clippers deal.
It’s telling that the only team mate Russ has had that had a bad thing to say was fucking Reggie Jackson.
Westbrook is easily the most overrated athlete. The man gives it his all every night and every teammate of his (expect Reggie Jackson but who cares about him) talks highly of him.
"do you trust lonzo to be in there at the end of games?  to his credit, he has improved his shooting percentages this year but historically, his fg%, 3pt% and FT% have been horrible.  are you ok with kawhi or PG kicking it out to lonzo for the last shot?  are you ok with lonzo getting intentionally fouled at the end of games?  although I guess if the alternative is reggie Jackson, then I might pick lonzo too"
"That article has him fighting Gortat. In the months directly after he beefs with Brooks and Jeff Green and likely Oubre. Before all that Nene and Emeka Okafor.  On the court he 's tussled with Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart.  Goalposts. What do you want, a reacharound? What is it you want me to deliver? This conversation started about RW leading the league in techs since he's a hot headed dumbfuck but it's instead devolved into proving just how much of an ignoramus you are.   The original statement was that Russ never took the high road ever, never has, and continues not to as seen with his techs vs Wall and then getting tossed against Rondo. You're out to prove....what? That slandering Reggie Jackson as Wall did Gortat is ok? We've come far. Goalposts"
Fuck Reggie Jackson. He’s a Bitch.
"Yea he and Reggie in the Studio before Shaq came were great. For TNT color-commentators it should be Greg Anthony, Jim Jackson, and Grant Hill those 3 are the best. ( Honorable mention to Stan Van Gundy he was probably my Fav before going back into coaching)"
"Yeah why the hell haven’t Reggie Jackson and Elfrid Payton said anything about this? For that matter, what are their thoughts on Syria?"
I like his passion for the game. I just don't think he ever really got into a groove for in game commentary. Announcing with Marv who isn't what he once was probably hasn't helped C-Webb over the years.   It's gonna be Brian Anderson as the lead play by play man once Marv goes. They'll also probably bring Grant HIll alongside him for the new A-team.   This will give us Brian Anderson/Grant Hill and Kevin Harlan/Reggie Miller as the two primary announcing duos for TNT. (Guys like Ian Eagle and Jim Jackson also available) Not bad.
"Players want out all the time. But when players are toxic like Reggie was, then you have a problem. Reports of Reggie taking extra shots in a game that confused coaches, him not passing the ball to not only Westbrook but also Durant as well. Him not playing in a November game cause he was upset he didn’t get traded. Perkins and Ibaka (two veterans and one who had been a thunder lifer at the time) openly questioned the shot selection of Jackson since it seemed as if he was taking things in his own hands.  Melo George  Oladipo  Roberson  Adam Ibaka  Collison  Green Durant Perkins  Lot of different thunder players with differing personalities yet none of them ever has anything negative to say bout Westbrook (well Durant is iffy). And None of those players or other former thunder players were reported as “disruptions to the locker room”. Hell barely anything got out to of the thunder camp back then with how tight lipped they were. Yet when the one player (Reggie) even other players and media outlets say that Reggie was the problem, i don’t understand how somehow it’s Westbrook fault."
"This reminds of one of r/nba's all time great but unappreciated comments lmao:  &gt;Well if Reggie Jackson isn't happy, its his own doing. Dude's a straight up ball hog. And why would they dislike the leaders of the team? If it was me, I'd be so far up their ass that whenever they actually play and take a shot, the form would be mine.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2unpmi/dont_ever_leave_russell_westbrook_hanging/coa274t/?context=1"
Is this why post-OKC Reggie Jackson just seems like that dude in the Rec that wants to do all the amazing plays but ends up looking like a ball hog that won’t stop chucking bad shots?
"eh, a LOT of the comments tend to eventually get around to claims about being selfish, a ball hog, that sort of thing.  Maybe that's a criticism about his usage rate, but the conversation usually seems to indicate a personality defect, that he puts himself ahead of his team.  I don't think people have to love him because of his generosity or anything, but there are always a LOT of comments about how people think his teammates don't want to play with a ballhog like Russ, which (with the exception of Reggie Jackson) has never held up when players are asked about him.  Kind of straddles the line between on-court strategy choices and accusations of selfishness."
"When was there a Thunder Player during that era labeled as someone who was ""disrupting the team""? I generally would like to know because besides the issues the Thunder had in getting past the hump with Westbrook and Durant at the helm, there were never reports of players disrupting the team or anything like that.   Even during the height of the Reggie Jackson saga, multiple reports came out saying Reggie was miffed at not starting over Russ (which everyone and their momma knew wouldn't happen) and openly wanted out of OKC."
"Reggie Jackson didn't really help himself out. He was intentionally disrupting the chemistry in a championship contending locker room because he was selfish and unhappy with his 6th man role (even though he was playing starters minutes).  People got mad at Russ ""hijacking"" the offense but goddamn Reggie Jackson was the worst when it came to being a ball hog on those OKC teams."
the lakers do it all the time when they target reggie jackson and lou williams
The only player that has ever even potentially complained about Russ’s treatment of them is Reggie Jackson. And even thunder players and former ones have alluded to the issues regarding Reggie. Reggie had his own section in Steven Adam’s book about the issues he caused. So am pretty sure it’s Reggie who was the combative one against everyone then.
".....Please, outside of Reggie Jackson, name me a player who didn't share the same sentiment. Even KD has said similar things!!!  The media loves to tear Westbrook down and some folks hop on that bandwagon....but then someone like Beal says this statement and POOF - everyone remembers that they're watching a generational player who may not have Seth Curry's jumpshot or KD's range....but is not afraid to go downstream into a 7ft's chest to get a FT or isn't afraid to clean the boards to start the fast break or isn't afraid to dish it 10+ times a game if his teammates are feeling themselves.  What the fuck is this conversation about in life????"
I’ve said it before and I’ve said it again. It’s Reggie Jackson. Not that unexpected.
"We have other reasons to be compelling, Durant and Reggie Jackson are the only players to have trashed how OKC is run (iirc). Everyone else is very happy with their time here,  With SGA, Dort, perhaps Baze and Poku all showing a lot of promise and being cheap, it leaves room for veterans to roll up make decent money and contend."
"Right, you make good points, especially about Durant’s time with Reggie Jackson. Do you think he could’ve sustained that level of play as his career went on ? What intrigues me is that we really haven’t seen Durant on teams without an all star level guard on the roster - so I think it’s interesting to speculate on how that may have benefited him in terms of fit. Or maybe it’s pointless, haha. Anyway, appreciate you taking the time out to type up a thoughtful response !"
"The way to maximize Durant is really easy. Just get a tertiary playmaker. A guy like Rubio/Lowry. Someone who can make secondary reads. Or install a triangle with a pippen type. You know, guys that are really easy to find in the market. With LeBron you need shooters. Durant can play 4 positions on offense or defense &amp; is a good passer who puts insane pressure on the defense. I think in a league wide redraft, Only LeBron goes ahead of KD.   You also keep mentioning how KD’s best value is with a star guard, but the very best season of his career was without a star guard. Reggie Jackson was his point guard. I think you might be taking the video too literally, KD can engine an offense just as well as anyone in the league aside from LeBron. Look at KD only lineups in Brooklyn, Golden state, OKC. He can keep offenses afloat.  Ben just doesn’t like Durant. I’ve known bens work since 2009. He’s low on Harden as well. He used out of context stats and for some reason included KD’s warriors series (the worst series in his career) for his peak but didn’t include Kobes 2004 Piston series it LeBrons Mavs series, etc"
Reggie Jackson but that is enough of a story that it has its own section in Steven Adams book.
Hey...I hope you respond to this comment I really want to get you’re opinion. Ben is being extremely Disingenuous with the creating his own offense part.....he’s using the 2014-2018 playoffs sample with Westbrook or Curry off the floor  but this is what he doesn’t tell you   2016: 54 TS with Westbrook off  53 TS with Westbrook on (so he was more efficient with Westbrook off)   2017: 64 TS with Curry off 68 TS with him on (Slightly less efficient with curry off but still great numbers)  2018: 59 TS with Curry off &amp; 60 with him on  (Kept up efficiency with Curry off)  2014: 58 TS with Westbrook on &amp; 41 TS with Westbrook off  That 17 point swing in 14’ swings the entire sample.   So KD keeps his scoring and efficiency for the large part without Westbrook or Curry but 1 anomaly year thats likely noise ruins the entire sample. KD can create his own offense just as good as Kobe/etc and doesn’t rely on star guards. Never believe Ben at face value. He’s very biased. Literally the reason KD won MVP was because he averaged 35 with Reggie Jackson as his best player.  Always check the stats for yourself.  u/thedarthvader17 should see this too
Warriors have a team around him too. They hve a top 10 defense. The warriors have a multiple time all star in draymond. Okc without Westbrook had Reggie Jackson and serge  ibaka as the main help for Durant
"&gt;There are multiple top 20 players who are not ballhandlers lol. Any big man before the mid 2010s is prob going to be in that list.  You never watched Hakeem or Robinson or KG did you? They can all handle the ball much better than Durant can.   &gt;this is such an awful take LOL  Is this an awful take or are you just insecure and don't like what I am saying? Playmaking is the ability to read the floor and operate. So is team defense where you, again, must read the floor and react. It's not a crazy breaking concept like you're alluding to.   &gt;Also funny how it went from ""Durant is an average to below average defender"" to ""Durant is not an elite anchoring defender"" lmao.  What is '''funny''' is actual your inability to read and comprehend something so simple. It's not that Durant *needs* to anchor the defense; it's that he ***doesn't have a high end defensive game*** that would *outweigh* his dogshit playmaking. Again, all of the all time greats have one or two faults. Durant has multiple and is horrible at ***creating for others*** which is something that is essential to running an offense. He doesn't have groundbreaking defense to make up for it either.   &gt;KD shot 54.2% in 2016's postseason. League average TS% was 54%. KD shot 57% in 2014, league average was 54.1%. KD shot 57.4% in 2013, league average was 53.5%. These are big jumps except for 2016, which as I said before was his choke year and a big outlier LOL  Look up lebron and curry's TS% and compare them relatively and come back to me. A superstar who is arguably the best scorer of all time shooting 2% above league average---***all while maintaining elite regular season efficiency***--is pathetic. Do you really need me to explain this? Really dude?  &gt;yes kevin durant lacks bball IQ. The other team lets him score 30 ppg because he is the resident make a wish kid, and the mvp was a consolation prize.  Yes, playmaking and basketball IQ are deeply tied are you kidding me? What happened that MVP postseason, btw? Oh right, Durant almost choked worst than Dirk did in 2007 against the ***grizzlies*** and was bailed out by reggie fucking Jackson. You clearly started watching the NBA after 2017 if you constantly ignore Durant underperforming at the highest level in OKC  &gt;And not even true, his FGA is roughly the same form the RS to the PO, it's just the harder playoff defenses that reduce his efficiency  Now you're finally getting it. You rightly throw in 'reduce his efficiency' but you're failing to realize this is absolutely integral to the argument. Durant craters against -10 defenses when he does any sort of playmaking, ball handling or increasing his volume. Other superstars, besides harden, don't drop the levels Durant does.   &gt;crazy dumb criteria. this literally means that if ur not the point of ur finals team u don't count 😭  Crazy dumb criteria that actually has merit and data to back it up. If you're along for the ride but don't do any of the actual offensive lifting, how much merit does your win have? Durant joined a 73 win team after the unanimous MVP just completed the best scoring season of all time after losing in game 7 against arguably the best player of all time."
"Lmao who was better then Drummond then? Was it KCP, Rose, Blake, Ben Gordon, Knight, Stuckey, Meeks, Stuckey, Marcus Morris, Singler,  Reggie Jackson, Harris? Just because I’m saying ur team is asshole the past decade doesn’t mean I’m wrong bud"
Reggie Jackson is our real weapon
"It's so nice to see past Detroit players doing so well. Bullock, Bruce Brown, Reggie Jackson, The Nard Dog, Blake Superior, Morris Bros, D Rose, KCP, Bobi, Svi, etc etc"
Reggie “starting point guard” Jackson
"Reggie Jackson is on the minimum and has essentially taken over the starting PG position since Bev has been injured for a lot of the season. He's averaging 14/3/3 on 47/47/84 splits since March, 10/3/3 on 45/43/80 for the season."
"I just know about it because I remember Chauncey being a little annoyed that Reggie Jackson was still using it after it got retired. He brought it up during the whole controversy of Paul Pierce getting his jersey retired the same night IT was returning with Cleveland and not wanting to share, but it was just an off hand comment."
reggie jackson
"He is the leader though. Russ is always the democratically elected leader on his team, even if he has a teammate better than him. The only guy who took exception to that was Reggie Jackson, a guy several tiers below Russ."

"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"I just wanna say...  RJ is fucking great as a color commentator.  Get him a regular national gig TNT/ESPN.  Smart, smooth on the mic, and witty as hell.  Knows how to ""go with the flow"" of the action too.  Huge step up from Mark Jackson/Reggie Miller/CWebb.  I love Miller/Webber, but they aren't great in their current roles."
Reggie Jackson is Michael Jordan with glasses on.

Obviously PG is a lot better than Reggie Jackson but he does more with the ball than PG. Would rather have Ben guard the player that runs their offense.
"Reggie Jackson is so good, they put DPOY Benjamin Simmons on him instead of on Paul George"
"Yes, Morris Mann and Reggie Jackson are ready to go!"
Bobby Smurda released an album called Smurda She Wrote and then was arrested and charged with murder a few months later.   He also looks like Reggie Jackson. There's also this https://streamable.com/jp32t
"I mean this is from Drummond's mouth during a podcast:   “Reggie Jackson was probably the second person. I used to do it to  Brandon Jennings, but he stopped pretty quick,” Drummond explained. “So  \[Jackson\] came in one day and tried to get a rebound. I elbowed him in  the mouth. Well, he came back again the next game and did it again, so I  hit him again. It happened like two more times after that. I kept  hitting him, so he finally stopped doing it.”  That doesn't read as incidental contact because he's trying so hard but rather a deliberate message of 'Don't you dare try to rebound when I'm around or I will hit you.' Maybe he will be different on your team but that doesn't change how he acted in the past"
Reggie Jackson it seems.
How many does Reggie Jackson have?
Reggie Jackson has single-handedly turned me into a clippers fan (Kawhi is cool too ig)
"JVG was not the coach, it was his brother SVG.  And he destroyed the Pistons (as GM) for a decade trying to build around Andre and Reggie Jackson, and then mortgaged the future by trading away assets (Tobias Harris and a pick that turned into Shai-Gilgeous Alexander) for damaged goods (Blake) on a massive outsized contract."
"Game on the line, I WANT REGGIE JACKSON"
"Aside from the Boston superteam, I think Reggie still had better teams around him, especially compared to Seattle Ray. Detlef Schrempf, Rik Smits, Ron Artest, Mark Jackson, Dale Davis, Jalen Rose had a year averaging more points than Reggie, and always good defensive roleplayers. Ray had Glenn Robinson, Sam Cassell, and Rashard Lewis until he got to Boston."

Must have been that Reggie Jackson dagger.

"Both of these articles reference the event, I've seen a couple of beat writers for the clippers mention it as well. Reggie was not playing well early in the year, and there was already a log jam at point guard. Ty Lue told Reggie to stay ready and when some injuries happened Reggie stepped in with whole new energy to how he played.   I remember those days with him on the Pistons, and even during his days on the Thunder when he would complain about his role versus Westbrook. He's come a long way in a short time; it's impressive to see. Playing on a veteran team probably helps too.  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-10/clippers-reggie-jackson-patrick-beverley-injured  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/ty-lue-met-with-lou-williams-reggie-jackson-and-luke-kennard"
"Can’t believe no one here is stating the obvious   Reggie Jackson is inconsistent as fuck   That’s been the story of the guy’s career. One game he would light it up, next game you would forget he even laced em up."

That shot was the most Reggie Jackson ever contributed to the Pistons success
I thought Reggie Jackson was a bad pickup last year for LAC ... Dude been ballin out this year
Who d’fuck is Magic Johnson? I got Reggie Jackson as the greatest point guard of all time

"Pistons in last 40 seconds  - allowed quick dunk  - up 3, turns the ball over with 20 seconds left by a basic trap  - allow a three in transition to tie the game up  - mess up the inbound out of the timeout and give Clippers chance to win  - give up game winner to piston legend Reggie Jackson  - lose another game"
REGGIE  FUCKIN  JACKSON
I think it's a bit different when Lebron's barking at you (and also setting you up) rather than Reggie Jackson lol. I suspect they'll reign him in a bit.
"Terance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and sometimes Luke Kennard"
"If that's the criteria, then Reggie Theus and Orlando Woodridge are consistent 20 ppg scorers as well haha. If you lower it to 3 seasons, then Stephen Jackson, Rashard Lewis, and Jalen Rose are consistent 20 ppg  scorers haha.  Worthy was a literal borderline 20-point scorer. You never knew if he was going to average 20 ppg or 19 ppg in a season, but you knew he was never going to average 23 ppg of even 22 ppg.  Because of the way the Showtime Lakers played, most people erroneously assume that Worthy was a big-time scorer. But the reality is Magic spread the ball around fairly equally among the top 4 guys. During Worthy's prime, Byron Scott usually averaged 16+ points and actually had a higher peak scoring season (21.7 ppg) than Worthy."
"It's not fair to say he's ""bad"". The dude is trying. He just wasn't gifted with a huge wingspan to block and get deflections.  Reggie Jackson has a longer wingspan than Enes."
"Offense doesn't run through him with Jokic on the court. And probably for good reason right now.  He's obviously in a different stratosphere of talent/potential than Reggie Jackson, but their effectiveness is somewhat similar. If they're asked to do WAY too much, they fuck up - TOs, forced/low % shots. But when he's just a piece in the offense, rolling off screens, catching the ball in his favorite left baseline corner 3 spot, he's deadly."
Ya umm Reggie Jackson would like a word
Bruh what a casual take. I thought I was having an intelligent conversation but you think Steven Adams would have been better than Porzingis. Like do you even watch an NBA game for the full 48 minutes. Adams has no offensive game whatsoever and would get cooked by Reggie Jackson on defense.
He's a rich mans Reggie Jackson.
How about Reggie Jackson
"Bev has usually been good for us the past 2 years. He just couldn't play much with the starters during the season and doesn't have an idea what he's supposed to do out there yet. For that matter, I'm really glad Reggie Jackson has stepped in beautifully for him and continues to do so for us in this series"
i am a huge fan of the reggie jackson/pg/batum/kawhi/morris lineup. it really helps and it makes it just a little bit harder for luka to burn us on switches. batum is still abusable.
"Reggie, Reginald, Goggles Reggie, Big Government, and Michael are the actual Jackson Five."
"oh I was agreeing with you kinda, but if porzingis can’t post up reggie jackson, he can’t post up an actual good defender in pg lol"
Those three plays perfectly sum up Reggie Jackson this year

Reggie Jackson!!
"You take the good with the bad with Doc. Loved him when he was here but Lue seems to have less of a problem with stubbornness and old-fashioned habits (aside from the baffling Reggie Jackson love). For Doc's whole tenure here he pulled the 5 man bench lineups, fell in love with guys who looked good on offense but played negative defense (Crawford, Harrell) and questionable spacing. But the man can draw up a play like no one else"

reggie jackson gear be looking like a youtuber's 2k character lol
Does Reggie Jackson know people are debating if he should even get minutes?
Why does Reggie Jackson keep starting man.
Cant wait to see KP pull a turnaround mid range J on Reggie Jackson instead of bring him down into the post
Him and Reggie Jackson are the same player.
Anyone else remember the Reggie Jackson Reggie Bullock backcourt? God the Pistons have not gotten any easier to watch
"She's ok, but I think the terrible cast of announcers make her look better than she is. Like Mark Jackson, Jim Jackson, Reggie, JVG, etc.  I think what she discusses during the game is middle of the pack if not better than average, but people don't like that she sounds pretty subdued, which would be fine on a colour commentator, but she needs a good hype voice (Harlan/Been) with her."
"In games where KP has 30/10 and looks unstoppable, he usually gets going with cuts to the baskets off of pick and rolls or for offensive rebounds and then relies on his shooting later on. The confidence factor I think is big for him, and also from what I’ve seen he hasn’t had a game since his injury in the playoffs that looked like that. Also with Lukas half court pace, KP misses out on transition opportunities. I know it looks like he would never get any with how much effort he puts in now but back in the day he was a good option for the fast break too. Now when he starts missing consecutive jump shots over Reggie Jackson I’d say he isn’t gonna have a good night"
Also the series your criticizing Kobe’s PPG was the series he had one of his career defining moments.  Bob Costas: “How good is this kid?”  Dude was hitting long midranges over Reggie and Mark Jackson and putting in a clutch put back all while Shaq fouled out.  YouTube game 4 Pacers Lakers 2000.  I feel like a dad preaching to some little kids in this thread lol.
"It honestly made me wonder if they even watched the game. They definitely knew nothing about our team this year. They even said Reggie Jackson isn't a shooter when he's literally an elite catch-and-shoot player (he has other huge weaknesses but that isn't one of them lol). Not to mention the usual load management jokes when Kawhi played back to backs this season.  But I don't blame them. Economically speaking, anti-Clippers content gets **far** more hits than pro-Clippers content. In that sense, they're just doing their jobs."
They got burned for like 4 straight possessions. Even after Morris got fouled out Reggie Jackson filled his corner spot lol.
Anyone who is ripping KP for not posting up Reggie Jackson has never been defended by an 8 year old. There's a reason half of Tony Allen's lockdown mix is against KD.
"Dirk had a lethal face up game tho. I mean, he killed mismatches. Put a small on him he goes right to the nail and scores.   The criticism isn’t so much he’s missing shots, it’s that he’s incapable of exploiting a mismatch. Put Reggie Jackson on Dirk and you might lose by 50."
It's really bad when a player doesn't understand who he is on the court. That's why I hated the Pistons bringing in Reggie Jackson. His best role is the one he rejected in OKC: bench scorer.   Also Drummond has trouble staying focused. There were a ton of games as a Piston where he just clearly had no motivation for anything other than getting his rebounding stats. Though in his defense those teams weren't going anywhere yet were being coached in a Win At All Costs manner for no good reason other than keeping coaches and management from being fired.
"This is such a stupid take... Morris is good starter, Batum can hold his own on defense and shoot lights out from 3, Reggie Jackson can get extremely hot, Terrance mann is the human ball of energy, Zubat is pretty fuckin meh but will feast on certain teams, Ibakas great but hes injured, and Rondo is rondo."
And he couldn’t even post up Reggie Jackson like 3 times last night. C’mon I was all on the Porzingod hype train! It’s heading the wrong way!
"Going small finally was a great move by the clippers. They put Dallas in a position to force porzingis post ups, which is way less efficient then Luka magic.   I actually don’t mind him shooting turn around jumpers in the post because he is 7’3. But he needs to get closer to the basket. 17 foot turn around jumpers on Reggie Jackson don’t look good, 5-10 ft turn around jumpers are better, he is a good free throw shooter he doesn’t need to fade away. Sigh"
"He really doesn't do anything else aside from spacing the floor. You could replace him with the current version of Davis Bertans and you won't notice anything, maybe they would drop by 2-3 wins in the regular season. He commands double teams on the post by reputation, but once the Clippers figured out he's shit and they could park Reggie Jackson on him, they stopped taking the bait and now he ain't doing anything.  &amp;#x200B;  I watched every game of the Mavs this season. The current KP is shit. Don't get me wrong, I still hope he gets a proper postseason so he can work on his game. Right now we need to win a playoff series first, the way Luka is playing. We don't wanna waste it."
"No you make a good point and I thought about it overnight (I posted that 10 hours ago). He very well may want to improve his post game but can’t because he’s spent his last few off seasons injured. Tough situation.  Still, Reggie Jackson is like a foot shorter than him so that one seems pretty damn inexcusable."
Just because he consistently does shitty things on the court  and you expect those things from him doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be criticized for it. If he can’t get a good look over a guy who is 7-8 inches shorter than him thats a legitimate problem. He should get stronger so he doesn’t need to take fade away jumpers over shooting guards. He doesn’t need to be Joel Embiid to have respectable post moves against shorter guys to at least not shoot 18 foot fadeaways over Reggie Jackson. His inability to get quality looks over shorter guys isn’t something that’s totally out of his control.
Don’t disrespect Reggie Jackson. He’s a hall of famer and a champion
He got outplayed by Reggie Jackson.
There's some truth in that since KP has a high center of gravity and the bottom half of a supermodel.   But he's also like an extra feet taller than Reggie Jackson. He needs to do the Embiid special of simply shooting over size mismatches. Its one of the most nasty big man go-to moves right now since it looks so effortless and its a perfect combination of shooting skill and being aware that you're goddamn huge.
Who could stop him?  Meanwhile you have KP getting clamped up by Reggie Jackson of all people
HOW DO YOU NOT BURN REGGIE JACKSON!?
"Not sure why the mavs kept rotating off him to close out on Reggie Jackson at the elbow 3 for consecutive possessions   Would have thought making Jackson shoot was the better option, even if Morris has been off for most of the  series"
"It took a perfect game from him, kawhi and Reggie Jackson to win this game. Good luck on Reggie playing two great games in a row."
They even neutralized him with Reggie Jackson
Not to mention he legitimately could not post up 6'2 Reggie Jackson on offense either
He couldn't even move Reggie Jackson lol....
A 4th one by Reggie Jackson to top it off
"Agree. There was a sequence where he had reggie jackson guarding him, yeah sure he was at the ft line, did one/two dribbles and reggie didnt give up an inch.  He had to pass out sigh."
"Props to the other players of the Clippers. Morris finally hitting those corner threes, and Reggie Jackson being given more minutes. However, damn it sucked watching Zingis squander Luka's hot start. I really hope that Game 4 will be better for us Mavs."
"Honestly I didn’t realize until watching this game just how goddamn awful the Clippers roster is outside of Kawhi and PG.   Like Morris is a legitimate starter, but outside of him who is their best player? Reggie Jackson who played like 20 mins a game during the season? Nic Batum? Rondo? Mann? Zubac?  It’s amazing they couldn’t find a few more starter-caliber players."
"Porzingis can’t even back down fucking reggie jackson, 7’3” shooting guard"
Couldn't even post up Reggie Jackson tonight. Settled for a long two instead of taking it to the rim. Disgusting.
I remember there was 1 possession where he posted up on Reggie Jackson and couldn’t move him an inch
i at least expect him to post up reggie jackson
"Pretty sure theyre not expecting him to body people like Shaq.  KP cant even score against Reggie Jackson, Mann and Rondo lol."
"Look, I'm not saying that he has to post up an entire game like Shaq. You have Reggie Jackson on you. Establish post position and shoot over him. You don't even need to fadeaway, there's like zero chance of him altering your shot.   The team on the court during that play was Mann, PG, Morris, Jackson, Rondo. If you have PG or Morris, fine, I can understand that they are thiccer, go get your 3 pointers. But Rondo Jackson, Mann? Get post position and shoot over them. Worst case scenario, it'll be easier for an offensive rebound."
He shot a fadeaway agaisnt Reggie Jackson lmao
"KP isn't even playing like a reliable role player, he doesn't deserve to be called a star. 3 rebounds from the tallest guy on the floor is disgustingly bad. MF couldn't back up Reggie Jackson"
"I have no idea why they keep giving reggie jackson so many minutes, hes so goddamn bad"
"KP just needs to do an AD and put the blame on himself for the loss. You can't post up/shoot over guards like Reggie Jackson? When the Clippers went small, it was supposed to be his time to feast"
Reggie Jackson was on him and he panicks and throws up some bullshit jumper
Luka played out of his mind. Again. KP didn’t do a god damn thing other than those two offensive rebounds.  Kawhi and PG showed out.  Reggie Jackson is a little bitch tho. Guess he’s beverely’s successor.
Dude is 14 feet tall and is doing fadeaways on reggie jackson
"Literally, dude was getting mismatched with Reggie Jackson and moving FURTHER from the net."
KP and Hardaway shown up by Reggie Jackson and Zu lol
Then Morris had like three straight. Bout damn time you started Reggie Jackson because he was playing well the first two games.
He was guarded by elite post defender Reggie Jackson
7'2 and can't post-up against Reggie Jackson.   Fucking bum. Holy shit.
"Pretending to shoot them is and has always been considered over-the-line in the NBA.  That is ""obscene"" in the eyes of the league and ever player knows this.  That's why Reggie Jackson immediately tried to get Morris to stop when he saw him doing it.  There is precedent for this. The NBA is hyper-aware of their old ""thug"" image and takes anyyyything involving guns, even fake guns, super seriously.  This is well known.  Some of y'all most have just started watching the NBA, like, this month.  This is an absurd debate."
Reggie Jackson loves those big ass goggles
lmao reggie jackson is a clown
Reggie Jackson still trash
Reggie Jackson MonStar'd THJ
Reggie Jackson 🤣🤣🤣
Reggie Jackson always been a fuckin doofus
What kinda clown shit is Reggie Jackson doing? Call that a T.
This is embarrassing. He had Reggie Jackson on him and couldn’t do anything with it
he can't score on reggie jackson maneeeee it sucks
He can’t even shoot over fkn Reggie Jackson
Why is Reggie Jackson in an iso?...
Reggie Jackson really thinks he's so good
KP posting up on Reggie Jackson? Foul line shot is the best I can do I'm afraid
KP struggled to post up Reggie Jackson......
Porzingis can't even back down Reggie Jackson.
Porzingis not backing down Reggie fucking Jackson and bricking a jumper instead is hilarious
Kp can’t score on Reggie jackson man.....
"FFS Porzingis, you can't hit a shot over Reggie Jackson?"
YOU'RE FUCKING 12 INCHES TALLER AND THAT'S THE BEST YOU COULD DO AGAINST REGGIE JACKSON??
"With his glasses and headband, Reggie Jackson looks like he was ripped trough a portal from the early 80s."
No team is winning a championship with Reggie Jackson as their starting point guard.
"Luka: “everyone out of the way, I got Reggie Jackson on me”"
Why arent they using Rondo more over Reggie fucking Jackson
You really think Reggie Jackson shouldn’t be playing at all?
"Either he was expecting a double on Reggie Jackson (and wanted the pass back) or he wanted Reggie to take the 3 (hot hand and all). Still, Rondo brought the ball up so casually and made the pass so late lol"
"Since I found out reggie Jackson was born in Italy, I have been wanting to call him Reggiano Jackson"
Reggie “big dick” Jackson
Reggie Jackson playing like that Game 4 he had against Memphis back in 2014-15 (I think).  He went off for like 30 points shooting like 70% randomly when OKC was down 2-1.
Reggie Jackson need to stop it
All I know is Reggie Jackson is doing things that Russell Westbrook hasn't done in a significant game since 2017.  If we are going back to that thread where 60 idiots downvoted me for saying I'd much rather have Reggie Jackson on the Clippers over Westbrook.  Eat crow idiots.  Playoff Reggie Jackson&gt;Playoff Russ
Greatest Reggie Jackson in sports history!
Reggie Jackson goes super saiyan whenever his star teammate is out
Wassup r/Lakers???  You really rather over pay Dennis Scrotum over Reggie Jackson?
Idk Reggie Jackson looks fine
This is the best version of Reggie Jackson I ever seen. And he was legit good back in Detroit 2016-17
reggie fucking jackson baby
Reggie Jackson is getting paided
"Hot take: WITH THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE ON THE LINE, I WANT REGGIE JACKSON!"
Clippers got Reggie Jackson on a minimum and he has been amazing all playoffs. Meanwhile Dennis Scrotum puts up 0 points in a game.
Mr. June Reggie Jackson obviously
Reggie Jackson is pretty known man.
Pistons legend Reggie Jackson lmfao
Reggie Jackson looking like a HOFer and Rudy Gobert actually looking like Baguette Biyombo tonight. This is the darkest timeline.
Who would you rather have Reggie Jackson or Ben Simmons?
"Paul George or Reggie Jackson declaring “No OT tonight”, who you got?"
Reggie Jackson is 5 years younger than LeBron? I thought he was like 21
"So I just finished watching the Russ vs. Reggie Jackson Beef History, come to this game to see Reggie doing Reggie things."
I feel like every one of the clippers playoff games this season are the same. Clippers start to lose a lead and Reggie Jackson hits multiple contested 3s
THE REGGIE JACKSON GAME  REGGIE &gt; WESTBROOK
I have absolutely 0 memories of Reggie Jackson prior to these playoffs. I didn’t even know who he was
If I'm a jazz fan I'm fuming it's Reggie Jackson cooking me right now. He's been incredible the whole playoffs tho
"OK, who had Reggie Jackson single handedly closing out Game 5 on their bingo card?"
Don't forget Reggie Jackson &gt; Tom Brady

Clippers fans harnessed their souls and gave to Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is who Pandemic P thinks he is
Imagine losing to Reggie Jackson

The original Reggie Jackson is nervous right now that he might not be the most famous athlete named Jackson
Lmao Reggie Jackson mvp of this series
Reggie Jackson has been insane these playoffs
REGGIE JACKSON LEGACY
Was Reggie Jackson a scrub on the pistons?
Reggie Jackson destroying the Jazz tonight
REGGIE JACKSON= MR.JUNE. I LOVE PLAYOFF BASKETBALL
reggie jackson always confident thats for sure
reggie jackson literally curry
Reggie fucking Jackson wow!
"Reggie Jackson &gt; Kawhi &gt; PG &gt; Michael Jordan &gt; Tiger Woods &gt; Michael Phelps &gt; Barrack Obama...  Whoever you like, Reggie is better"
Reggie Jackson is going super nova!
Why couldn't we have Reggie Jackson on our team :(
Reggie Jackson is who Schroeder thinks he is
Utah getting clipped by Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson has unmatched confidence
PLEASE REGGIE JACKSON STOP HURTING ME LIKE THIS
"Agreed, hate cousins, Morris, pat bev but conflicted bc I like PG and Reggie Jackson"
"Reggie Jackson has a better chance of getting $100M than Dennis, and even that isn’t a certainty"
"Reggie Jackson played his way into that territory.   Shroeder, not so much lol"
It’s a nickname for Reggie Jackson because he bails out the Clippers.
Idk about you but 2021 Playoffs Reggie Jackson is a top 10 PG all time
"Not at all, LA's season didnt turn around until the Phoenix game months back.  Rondo came in that game, called out Phoenix's plays &amp; successfully closed them out, from then on he was in everybody's ear from Jackson to Beverly &amp; LA finally figured out how to close games properly before that we routinely blew double digit leads.    Rondo also called out Ty Lues poor coaching against Dallas, our entire team is playing much smarter, cleaner basketball we have opponents figured out.  Dudes like Reggie aren't nearly as reckless as he once was thanks to Rondo's guidance as well."
Reggie Jackson
I agree with that for sure. But this thread is acting like we’re comparing Paul George and Schoder rather than Reggie Jackson.
I know it still looks like a long-shot... but I have steeled myself for the possibility that we could be talking about Finals MVP Reggie Jackson in a few weeks.
"Yeah a more athletic Reggie Jackson, good comp"
*Goggles Reggie Jackson
Yeah but I doubt it would get to that point if he were coached by Pop. Doc isn’t great at utilising his players strengths. Just look at Reggie Jackson from last years playoffs to this years.
Rather give this money to Reggie Jackson.
Who does he think he is? Reggie Jackson?
No but Reggie Jackson is
"Are you guys watching the same clippers that I am? PG is playing better basketball than he has since Indiana, Reggie Jackson is the best shooter in the playoffs, and they are playing the suns off the court. Im pulling for the suns because I want Chris to get a ring but after giannis goes down clippers may legitimately be the best team in the playoffs at the moment and they are down in the series. We need to let go of the narrative that they suck because kawhi is out. They are playing on another level right now and I’m terrified that the suns are gonna get leveled tonight in LA after two really lackluster games."
Every time I read Reggie Jackson I feel like it's a joke. Dude been ballin but reading his name in connents/threads is just comical to me.
Dennis Schroder thinking he's Reggie Jackson. SMH
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is who Schoder thinks he is.
If he's worth that much how much is Reggie Jackson worth?!
Not 7… not 8… NINE figures?! That’s ‘gets Reggie Jackson to the table 2022’ money
even then he is not. The recency bias of this sub is close to insanity   Better players than Reggie Jackson in these 4 teams ?    - Bridges   - CP3  - Booker   - Payne  - Crowder   - Ayton  - Middleton  - Jrue   - PG  - Bogdanovic   - Lou   - Capela   - Fat Italian with a mohawk   - Collins   Probably better:    - Tucker   - Portis   - Huerter   - Redish   - Mann   - Morris
"You're a $11,000,000 dollar player thoo. Reggie Jackson is better lol"
Reggie Jackson with goggles
"Yeah very team orientated instead of Kawhi isos now they have PG, Reggie Jackson, and Marcus Morris taking turns"
"Reggie Jackson never made All-star  Unless you count Major League Baseball All-star games in '69, '71-'75, and '77-'84"
"So I remember Kenny's college and Houston career, I was a UNC junkie and loved hakeem, yes he embarrassed my boy, but I still recognized game. Kenny was a sharp shooter that could drive and finish. He was kinda like what Reggie Jackson is now on the Clippers, but Kenny was a starter."
Am I crazy or were we not writing similar posts about Reggie Jackson back when he was saying he deserved to start over Russ?  That guy’s career has been really weird.
We've had Dennis and Reggie Jackson and I'll take Dennis every time.
"yeah even though PG, Reggie Jackson, Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Capela, Huerter, Bogi, Collins, Jrue, Middleton, Lopez are not hurt now"
"He shouldve stepped up when AD went down, just like Reggie Jackson is doing"
"Yeah, that Reggie Jackson is the 3rd best player left in the playoffs"
Lakers about to sign Reggie Jackson for that instead.
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson
"And that's why this man isn't anywhere near the player Reggie Jackson is, on god"
"Am I crazy or is Reggie Jackson better than Chris Paul by far. Better shooter. More versatile, way more athletic. Team player who doesn’t stop the ball."
"Wow, the disrespect on Mr. June Reggie Jackson"
"We really gonna have lou william , reggie jackson battle for FMVP"
Who the hell does this man think he is?     Reggie Jackson?
"They didn't give the ball to Terence Mann, Reggie Jackson and PG like they have been. They've focused more on ball movement since his injury"
I got Reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson will be getting the contract that Schroder wants.
"If he gets that much, Reggie Jackson should command 345M"
Reggie Jackson is more worth it than him
That’s Reggie Jackson money not Dennis Schroeder money.
My headcanon is that he passed his playoff mythos to Reggie Jackson and I'm sticking to it
Looking for that Reggie Jackson money
This was such a beautiful analogy. Vegeta is PG right? who would Reggie Jackson be?
This is crazy talk. Reggie Jackson will be the finals MVP.
Lmao reggie jackson getting that bag before you
"Reggie Jackson, Terrence Mann and our bench has carried us. If Paul George didn't choke away two games we'd have won the series by now."
that’s reggie jackson money
"It's also important to consider that Reggie Jackson has pretty much been the best shooter in the playoffs since Kawhi went down, and PG has stepped up. Kawhi or not they're no joke, no matter how much people want to use it to discredit what the Suns have done.   Series ain't over either. Monty needs to adjust &amp; CP3 needs to get it together, Clippers gameplanned to neutralize Ayton and there was no response. Definitely far from given the Suns advance."
Reggie Jackson chipped in??? Huh?
Lou Will? Predictable. Reggie Jackson? Never.
"Kevin Huerter vs Reggie Jackson, FTFY"
&gt;Schroeder doesn't make guys better. He scores buckets but they can try to find cheaper guys that can score. Look at reggie Jackson dude is balling out his mind. Lakers better off dropping schroeder and hoping they find someone cheaper that can give them 10-15 a night.
"Who would have thought, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson being the best microwaves these playoffs.  Every contender needs a microwave on the bench, someone who can get hot all of a sudden to help carry missing offense, or to break a game wide-open into a blowout, turning an 8 point lead, into an 18 point lead with your starters sitting."
Does he think he’s reggie Jackson?
Reggie Jackson should make more money than Schroder
"lakers fuked up , shoulda signed reggie jackson"
"Dennis schroeders not $120 million dollars better than a PG at #22. CP3, Conley, Lowry, Dinwiddie, Reggie Jackson, and Rose are all UFAs that are better than Schroeder. They're all probably signing for less than 120 million too. Any of those options is better than 120 mill for schroeder."
"&gt;Jackson has been hitting more timely shots than George for sure  My only problem with this is that the only reason they're ""timely shots"" is because of PG. PG's play is consistently putting the Clippers in positions to win games late in the 4th. There has not been 1 game this entire post-season that the Clippers have been blown out.    So credit to Reggie for knocking down big shots...but they're only big shots because PG got them there in the first place."
Yeah but Middleton ain't PG and Jrue ain't Glasses Reggie Jackson
"You're getting Kevin Huerter vs Reggie Jackson and you're gonna like it, goddammit"
He’s not lying it’s the leagues fault for the shortest offseason ever. At this rate we’re gonna have Reggie fucking Jackson be fmvp or some other B-/C+ level player. This is supposed to be the best of the best left competing for a title instead we’ve got store brand teams that probably are second round teams at best when the league is fully healthy.
Lou Williams vs Reggie Jackson in the finals is gonna be crazy.
This guy thinks he's Reggie Jackson or something smh
Who would have thought at the beginning of the season we would all agree reggie Jackson is better than Jrue.
at this rate reggie jackson is gonna win finals mvp
Is Reggie Jackson the best healthy player left in this offseason???
"what do you mean, PG and Reggie Jackson are healthy"
mark jackson and reggie miller subscribe to the 'just a hard foul' theory too much
who do you think you are? Reggie Jackson?
What a shit show of a season. I’m gonna have to watch Reggie Jackson tear up lou Williams in the finals. God dammit
Reggie Jackson got injured???
The Replacements was based on the wrong sport  Silver and the owners greed bout to do more damage to the NBA than anything else. God forbid PG or Booker gets injured you’re gonna have a Middleton vs Reggie Jackson finals.
Neither the clippers or the lakers can afford Reggie Jackson this summer
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis Schroder
Who had Reggie Jackson battling Kevin Hurder for the finals MVP on their season bingo card?
"There are a number of acceptable UFA PGs right now, but LeBron will need to put the sales pitch on.  He could go all Tom Brady and convince CP3 or Mike Conley to play for cheap.  There really is a non-zero chance of that happening.  He can convince Reggie Jackson to leave the Clippers and get a ring.  Patty Mills and Dinwiddie are FAs.  If this wasn't LA and LeBron wasn't on the team, Schroder would have a ton of leverage.  But it is LA and LeBron is on the team for the next 2 years."
Reggie Jackson on the Lakers will not be the same Reggie Jackson on the Clippers.
"Fuck it they're favorites at this point. Ty Lue is a coaching magician, Playoff P is real, and Reggie Jackson is Steph Curry. It's absurd how good they still are without Kawhi."
Reggie Jackson salivating
"If he pulls this off, he will go down in history and instant HOF. There is no other comparable team other than 2011 mavs that would shock the nba world as much as this.  Imagine playing 2k22 with the Finals clippers champions squad and your second best player on roster being Reggie Jackson"
"This mf thinks he's Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson"
"He has to be drunk, he should be on a minimum like Reggie this year while Jackson demands 100 Mil."
"Who does he think he is, Reggie Jackson?"
Who does he think he is? Reggie Jackson?
"He’s flourishing next to Reggie “Curry” Jackson, so I can only see him being better with the real Curry."
I’m ready for Reggie Jackson FMVP
"Media doesn't like the Clippers for some reason - add JVG to the names behind Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, SAS, Shannon."
Exactly. People are scared to rank roleplayers over stars who are underperforming.  Let's call it like it is.  Reggie Jackson right now is better than Cp3 and just a tad under Booker.
No that was ads injury not the bum ass suns who can't fuvking beat playoff pee and Reggie jackson
He ran a PatBev/Reggie Jackson/PG13/Batum/Marcus Morris lineup that was extremely successful last night.
"Well if the Clippers won, people would hype PG and underrate the contributions of Terrance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and Marcus Morris"
Reggie Jackson left a WCF team to go be terrible in Detroit
You mean Reggie Jackson could.
"We survived Reggie ""Curry"" Jackson, anything is possible now"
Derrick white and Reggie Jackson 2 man team
honestly wouldn’t even care at this point…reggie jackson and cam payne made nothing and were more impactful. If we can actually look for diamonds in the rough I would gladly take the dead salary. The best case is sign and trade but then were hard capped
They should just pick up Reggie Jackson at point instead
"Sexton to Knicks makes some sense. Wonder if Cavs could do a sign and trade. So maybe you get a third team involved.   I don't know how the Clippers get Lonzo based on their contracts and what Reggie Jackson is going to demand. Bulls seem to be the team that would land Lonzo.   If I'm John Collins and the Hawks don't resign you, I'd head to either San Antonio or Dallas."
"Apparently they're only allowed to give reggie jackson so much money since they don't have his bird rights and don't have space.  trading for john wall has no effect on jackson's situation, really, don't understand OP's logic there.  if he wants the bag he has to go somewhere else because clippers aren't allowed to give him it."
"They'd have to trade Kennard, Beverley, Rondo, and Yogi Ferrell to make the salaries match. And considering Reggie Jackson is probably gonna leave in free agency that would leave the Clippers with Wall as the only point guard left on their roster. That's why I'd be all in favor of them doing it."
One time is good. Multiple times is elite. Remember Reggie Jackson......
Could totally see them try and steal Reggie Jackson
They’d give money to Reggie Jackson first. Plus wall and Reggie have some brief history lol
All-time list of guards is as follows:   RANK | NAME ---|--- 1. | FIBA Patty Mills 2. | Glasses Reggie Jackson  3. |  Michael Jeffrey Jordan
I would beg the differ. Reggie Jackson had one hell of a series. Not saying Booker had to guard him but that dude was automatic. PG13 &amp; Reggie Jackson = Holiday &amp; Middleton.
"Right, the trade would basically be Kennard, Beverley, Rondo and Yogi Ferrell for Wall. But with Reggie Jackson most likely about to leave in free agency that would make Wall the only point guard left on the Clippers roster."
"What? No its not. Wtf are you talking about. Lebron is still playing amazing at 36. MJ won his 6th title at 35. You could plug in a lot of players in that team and could win a chip. Kawhi was a ROLE PLAYER.   They were good? Kevin Martin averaged like 15 a game on 61 TS%, he was good. Andre Roberson was like a top 3 defensive perimeter player. The fuck he also had Reggie Jackson, Thabo Sefolosha(prime) and vets like Nik Collison and Derek fischer. Ibaka and Russ alone is more talent than Harden has had in Houston before 2017-2018, so your argument is not a good one.   It was still just two all NBA players facing 4, one of them being Durant lool. So I dont want to hear the nonsense."

Reggie Jackson is the World Bump Champion; he knows how to make high pressure free throws.
"You didn't factor in the clutch factor.  Kawhi famously missed a FT in the Finals vs the Heat, PG choked just this past postseason.  I would think Reggie Jackson would be a better FT shooter with the game on the line vs Kawhi or PG"
"Clear answer if teams were healthy is the Clippers.  Lead the league in FT% last year, and even more importantly, have the right amount of really good FT shooters at the top.  Kawhi and PG a pair of near-90% stars, Kennard career 86%, Batum career 84%, and Reggie Jackson career 86%.  Problem with Nets or Warriors is it gets a little shaky in the 4/5 spots.  Like as amazing of a shooter as Joe Harris is, he doesn't get to the line much and thus misses a lot more FT's than he really should."
"Playoff Reggie Jackson would never, also Suns title hopes pretty much rely on Devin Booker outplaying Jrue for two games out of possibly 4"
"The Clippers would beat the Lakers. Pick and roll combo of Rondo and Boogie would be a thing of beauty. Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, and Ibaka on the same team would be scary. There is also Reggie Jackson, Nicolas Batum, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Luke Kennard, and Yogi Ferrell."
"Definitely the Clippers. The starting five of Rondo, PG, Kawhi, Ibaka, and Boogie is scary. Don't forget a prime Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, last year's Luke Kennard, and Yogi Ferrell with the Mavericks."
id take mark jackson over reggie miller any day
Trade Middleton for Reggie Jackson
"Am I out of line for thinking Reggie Jackson is similar? Something about his handling has always been so smooth to me, nice flow"
Reggie Jackson can look cool by merely catching a basketball. His one hand will sort of turn into a gravity well.
"The Knicks should bundle their picks and trade up in the draft to get a better option.  They should resign everyone on short deals and run it back and work on more development for Barrett, Quickley &amp; Toppin. Try to get Lowry or Reggie Jackson."
He did say that the clippers would lose to the mavs because they were relying on Reggie Jackson to be a third scorer.
That's Reggie Jackson music
He’s bidding his time to become the next Reggie Jackson.
"I really thought lavine was just gonna be one of those reggie jackson types, has a couple good post season series throughout his career and was just a pretender, but he's had good consecutive regular seasons and is really looking good."
John Wall is not better than either of those guys and definitely not Reggie Jackson tf
John Wall isn’t better than Reggie Jackson
"Maybe but the Clippers were way better in the last few games of that series than the first 2 if that makes any sense  They moved away from Zubac to the small ball lineup, they started to use Kawhi more to defend Luka instead of letting him abuse Beverly and Jackson, and PG and Reggie became better"
Bucks in general lack a creative player. This is probably their biggest problem and is half the reason their offense appears to suck right now. They don’t even need a star. Someone Reggie Jackson caliber would be hugely helpful to them.
"When we're talking about improvement deserving a big paycheck, I'm thinking of Reggie Jackson-type of improvement in this playoffs.  Collins improvements have miniscule impact on this team when it matters. But sure, if you want to be literal, he ""improves"" as a player."
"Imagine prime KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Reggie Jackson, oh wait..."
Cam Payne or Reggie Jackson proving it wasn't just a fluke?
"In a league dominated by stellar guard play and depth, where is Maxey gonna start? Where is Maxey going to be a top 3 franchise asset?  Teams barely even want Colin Sexton or Terry Rozier or Schroeder or McCollum or Reggie Jackson or other players of that caliber. Would Maxey be more impactful than these listed guys?   As for the Wolves? If they got Simmons they'd be too big to fail in the regular season. They'd finish above 0.500 and out of the lottery."
now we need to [convince Reggie Jackson to be our assistant coach ](https://twitter.com/FlyByKnite/status/1411368610312818691?s=20)
Reggie big governement Jackson is better than kawhi.
Reggie Jackson
"Which means it's the same as the Clippers with Reggie Jackson: they can offer him a starting salary of about $10 million per year as long as it's for multiple years. If he gets bigger offers than that then he'll probably leave, but I don't know if he will."
"Billups has been indispensable for us, so I think you guys get Kawhi and Reggie Jackson now."
The only thing that kills me is the pullup three 4 seconds into the shot clock. He's not that type of shooter like Reggie Jackson or Curry or Dame or Payne or whoever.
"I don't know why a Clippers fan is downplaying the Clippers, PG was playing at an elite level and Reggie Jackson had the best playoffs of his life, it's not like they were some easy out. I don't think the Lakers were some easy out either."
"&gt;name all the starting backcourts in finals history that were both scorers    Why add the ""were both scorers"" thing, aren't you literally making a Thad Young stat lmao. ""Being a scorer"" isn't a quantifiable thing, if you mean someone who scores then literally every backcourt in the history of the finals is on your list.    But even with your Thad Young qualifier that you added your still missing duos like Mark Jackson and Reggie Miller, Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobli, Byron Scott and Magic, and more.    Like I said at the beginning I think you're too adamant to change your mind on this, so unless you want to start being reasonable I'm done."
"It’s not like the clippers were targeting Rudy. They’d go after someone else, easily get by them, and then Rudy has to either help and leave his man open for three or give up a layup. This happened so much Rudy had to be hedging way before our guys eve got beat because he couldn’t trust them. The dirty little secret about the Jazz all along was nobody besides Rudy and Royce can actually hold their own defensively, and the clippers exposed that. Getting a simmons or Green doesn’t change that our guards can’t defend Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson."
Jrue is absolutely horrendous. Mans is worse than reggie Jackson and Cameron payne. Middleton is also God awful. Having one good game every 3 weeks doesnt excuse his terrible performances. Both of them deserve to be kicked off the Olympic team after playing this horrible for the entirety of these playoffs
"Bryn Forbes is gonna have a huge game, very Reggie Jackson-esque."
Bledsoe will be next year’s Reggie Jackson in the playoffs
Y’all got a Reggie Jackson in your group?
i know the Clippers wouldn't have looked at Ayton like BBQ chicken like they did for Gobert. Reggie Jackson went at Gobert's ass at the rim
"Do you guys have a Reggie Jackson or Terrance Mann? If not, oh boy..."
"Let the greatest postseason shooter of all time loose: Reggie Jackson, who you unfortunately do not have on your roster"
Get Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson clearly Space Jam'd Jrue Holiday
"Paul George and Reggie Jackson should have beaten these Suns, man"
I hate pat bev and rondo and Morris. But I do like Reggie Jackson. He will be good with my Mavs
If they are in a 3-2 then this on Bev. If he was wider he could’ve blocked off that cut from Bridges. Reggie Jackson who is the middle is already extended so he can’t stop that pass going to Crowder at the foul line. If you’re middle is extended then your sides need to drop and vice versa.
"i know everyone wants a ring, but i dont know if its worth that much for a guy like Reggie Jackson. he is never going to leave much in the way of a legacy. yeah it would be a cool experience to win a ring, but is it really worth leaving that much money on the table? with the amount of players that struggle financially after retiring, i think it would be very unwise for Reggie to forfeit $4M unless he has a sound retirement plan already laid out"
Reggie Jackson contract will be worth more if clipper sign him. They can easily trade him
So you don’t think Reggie Jackson is 2/3 the player kemba is? Yeah Kemba is way better on a terrible team as shown by Reggies time in Detroit but Reggie just showed he could have a huge impact in the playoffs which is the most important thing for a good team.
"People here throwing numbers like Reggie Jackson is a borderline All-Star PG, when in reality he is a decent role player that overperformed the heck out of these playoffs.  People are also forgetting that Reggie's numbers inflated considerably after Kawhi went down and the Clippers were forced to give more shots to other players. Like you said, a playoff team that needs a solid ballhandler will give him 15M a year, but 25M? That would be Vlade Divac dumb."
"I'm not so sure. Reggie Jackson was making $17m/yr before taking less to prove himself with the Clippers and I think there will most likely be at least one or two teams who will have watched the playoffs and think he proved himself enough to throw a bag at him. And look at Redick getting a ~$23m contract a few years ago and Rozier getting ~$19m/yr and the salary cap has gone up about 10% since then. I don't think that Reggie Jackson is *worth* $25m, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility for what he could get, although I'd say 20m is probably more likely."
"Anyone who pays Reggie Jackson anywhere near $20 million a year is going to regret it so hard. Jackson was great in the playoffs, but NBA history is FILLED with players who get overpayed for a good playoff run and then don't work out at all. We have almost a 10-year sample size that suggest Jackson isn't a particularly good player, so any team that ignores the 10-year sample because of 6 good weeks is probably going to regret it."
Reggie Jackson is better than both combined
Reggie Jackson about to trick y'all again.
If Reggie Jackson got paid $25 million a year you could go ahead and slap him on that list too
"Brogdon will make 21 mil, Jaylen Brown, Vucevic and Draymond will make 24 Mil, Bam, Donovan, Fox and Tatum will make 28 mil, and Ingram will make 29 mil. If any team gives Reggie Jackson anywhere in this range, they are basically signing up for salary cap issues. He's simply not in the range of those players."
"25M? Nah.  20M? Definitely.  Why would Reggie take 2 years/24M from the Clippers when he could easily get 2 years/44M from other teams?  Kennard just got 4 years/64M from the Clippers but Reggie isnt worth 20M a year?  After his unbelievable playoff run? Anything under 15M regardless of his career stats/injury history, is insulting to Reggie.   This is coming from a Pistons fan who watched the signing of Reggie Jackson catapult my team into an even deeper hole then they were before he got there"
"I don't get this... Recency bias is huge here.  Do people really think Reggie Jackson is that good? I know he came up big in the playoffs, but isn't he a career 12-13 ppg and 4 apg player?  I'm sure some teams will want to gamble on Reggie, but this is a gamble"
"Reggie Jackson is a borderline starter on the wrong side of 30. His market value is the mid level exception at 2-3 years, maybe there will be a team desperate enough to give him 3 years $45M. OP is out of his mind with his projections."
"Yes, in the hands of Reggie Jackson."
You are probably confusing Reggie Jackson and Reggie Beverley
Reggie Jackson is an exceptional talent in contract years. He is a mediocre talent in non-contract years. Not being able to pay him market rate might actually be the *best* scenario for the Clippers.
Lmao Reggie Jackson is not a 16-25m a yr player
Kemba was All NBA like 2 years ago my guy. Reggie Jackson has never even been close to that level
"I think we really need a vet to be a leader in our locker room so I prefer Lowry most. Even though he’s older, he checks all the boxes - defense, creation, playmaking, shooting.   In theory Lonzo is a better fit than Reggie Jackson because of defense, but I have concerns over some of his decision making. Reggie is steady in how he plays which I think would be more beneficial for our squad."
"If I’m honest, I don’t even think lonzo is the best among the three for the nuggets. Reggie Jackson fits their needs of “another guard who can seriously go and get a bucket but can play off-ball” plus he also plays into Jokic’s strengths like Murray does. Which makes him useful without Murray and opens a lot of rotations when Murray gets back."
Maybe not over Reggie Jackson if he plays like he did in the playoffs.
"btw the la clippers are the best team in the nba. They don’t need no super teams and mouses to get the job done. Enjoy seeing Reggie Jackson, Terrence man, Paul George, kawhi, zubac, and pat bev DOMINATE the nba. Cholos love the clippers. We ain’t no bandwagon fans foo"
I feel like Reggie stays on the Clippers as long as they don’t give him a bullshit offer lol. 12 million doesn’t sound too bad. Ik other teams can probably give him like 16-18 maybe but I think he may leave some money on the table. I obviously know nothing about Reggie but idk he seemed really emotional and attached to this Clipper team when they got eliminated. He’s on the wrong side of 30 and he’s not going to get a better chance than on the Clippers to win a ring. He saw how close they got even without Kawhi. If they were bad I’d say he’d go chase the money but they are legitimate contenders. Idk I don’t think any team is giving Reggie Jackson 25 million and 12 million isn’t too far off 16 mil. Dallas does seem like a good option if they offer him. I just have a feeling he may be willing to take a discount for the Clippers. Wouldn’t blame him if he didn’t tho.
"I mean, you can’t win a championship with Reggie Jackson as your second option."
"Should Dinwiddie continue the shooting numbers we saw in '19-'20, he would **not** fit into the Clippers' mold, because he shoots like shit outside of 10 feet and the guards' ability to spread the floor has become essential to their offense and success. Giving a defense a player to sag off of makes it harder for Kawhi and PG to get going. Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann all hit threes at 40% clips. Even Reg. Season Rondo in his Clippers games is shooting 43%.  I like Dinwiddie if you can get him that cheap (you can't) but I'm taking Reggie."
Why would the pistons try and sign Reggie Jackson again after they waived / bought him out lol
Kinda of different situations. Jabari was a former number overall pick who was 23 when he signed that deal and had shown flashes that had been derailed by injury. So you make that deal hoping for health and upside.  Reggie Jackson is 31.
I’ll take the under on all these Reggie Jackson contract projections.
reggie jackson is not getting 25m lol
Reggie Jackson.
I bet Kings fans would be ecstatic if their FO decreased their level of incompetence to just offering Reggie Jackson a max contract.
"They can only offer Reggie Jackson $10 million per year, so if he gets a bigger offer he's probably gone."
"You realize everyone else was hurt too, right? It wasn't like Kawhi was the only star that got hurt. If you're saying that the Clippers at full strength were ""clearly"" better than a bunch of teams with key injuries, then I have to ask: can you count on everyone else being hurt again next year? The Clippers were down 0-2 to the Mavs and then Luka hurt his neck, then they were down 0-2 to Utah and then Mitchell hurt his ankle (and Conley was already out).   It wasn't like the Clippers were just running away with the West and then Kawhi got hurt, and that's without even factoring in the Nuggets and Lakers who were also dealing with major injuries, along with Chris Paul dealing with Covid. If I was a Clipper fan I wouldn't be content to just run it back with no changes. This is especially true since Reggie Jackson is probably gonna get bigger offers than the Clippers can match, so he's likely to leave."
Reggie Jackson is definitely getting more than 10.5 mil/year
"Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson... They're assembling the 2011 draft class!"
Reggie Jackson and Julius Randle
Reggie Jackson?
Reggie Jackson
Just wait until they get Reggie Jackson.
Wall is a serious downgrade from what this year's Reggie Jackson played like.
"Just stop, you are talking from your ass at thid point. Seriously, if you don't watch our team why are you opening your mouth? The Clippers need health that all what we need. Yes and re-sign fucking Reggie Jackson our point god"
"Reggie Jackson was born on an a military base in Italy, he's not Italian by any means. Belinelli played the finals in the Italian league and decided to spend the summer to rest and not play with the national team, also because we had little chance to qualify for Tokyo."
"Why isn't Marco playing? Did he completely retire? Also, why is Reggie Jackson listed as Italian?"
"It's possible. I'd rather take a shot at Reggie Jackson (much cheaper) or Dinwiddie, but Schroeder does make some sense.  Honestly if I were gonna pay $18+M for Schroeder, I'd kick the tires on a potential Lonzo move first"
"Celtics will probably sign a starting PG for the MLE. Currently the only PGs on the roster are Smart, Pritchard, and Dunn, none of which I think are suitable starting PGs. Possible candidates are   - Patty Mills  - Reggie Jackson   - T.J. McConnell  - Derrick Rose  - Cam Payne  - Lonzo Ball in a S&amp;T  I don't really know what the FA market is gonna be like for any of these dudes tho so idk if the MLE is enough for them."
"I think my Clippers just bring back all of their free agents. Reggie Jackson, Batum, Serge for sure.  Wouldn't mind DeRozan giving us a hometown discount."
OKC fan base massively over value mid/late first round picks. Presti is also one of the absolute worst GMs when it comes to finding talent outside the lottery. Hadn't hit on a non-lottery pick since Reggie Jackson 10 years ago.
When did Reggie Jackson play for the Spurs?
Specially if reggie Jackson is leaving and it get Pat Bev(dirty player) less playoff mins and Kawhi (load management) less season mins.
"lol what, reggie jackson was playing like a borderline star in the playoffs, you can make arguments for him being the 2nd best or even the best player on his team in a lot of playoff games"
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
The disrespect to Reggie Jackson
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don’t bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"
I second this as a Jazz fan whose team got destroyed by Reggie Jackson when we sold out on Paul and Kawhi
"Mmmm probably Reggie Jackson was the 3rd best after PG and Kawhi, he was ballin"
Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
They should bring back  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
A lot of people are forgetting that Westbrook could go on another level like Reggie Jackson did.  This is a great trade for Lakers
"I replied to two people.  I didn't think that's being ""all over this thread"".  I don't know why you're taking it personally.  I see Lakers fans being critical of Schroder all the time, and they're justified in their criticism, he's not a good player.  I'm not sure what Reggie Jackson has to do with this but I personally think he's going to get an offer the Clips can't match and he'll end up on another team and good for him."
"You're really having a hard time with all of this, aren't you? You're all over this thread stomping your feet trying to tell everyone how much Schroder sucks. Rough day in Clipperland or something? Look at it this way, it could be a few less teams bidding for Reggie Jackson. There, feel better now?"
"Yeah Reggie Jackson having a outlier playoffs run in his contract year is fine, but the lakers role players played “unexpectedly” hot is not"
ur thinking about Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann were right there.
"He wrote about Reggie Jackson as a blog boy for the Pistons, now he's his teammate 😂"
"Yeah man.. to me this trade makes no sense for the Lakers. What's their gameplan with Russ? He brings the ball up the court 50% of the time, then LeBron the other half?  Who's the spot-up shooter? One of the two will dominate the ball over the other, and do what... kick it out to Caruso?  Why not go for Duncan Robinson, Reggie Jackson, maybe Derrick Rose as coming off the bench (please resign this man Leon!)? How does Russ move the needle? Yeah he's going to be a HoF player, but he doesn't fit with the Lakers at all, unless he, or LeBron start shooting 40% from 3.  Wizards won this trade hands down. Got rid of Russ' contract, got Kuzma (who might be able to develop into a good player if he puts in the effort), KCP who they can keep or trade, Montrez who can be a good player in the right situation, and pick 22. That's amazing, just for Russ. If Wizards draft well, and build the team right for the next 4-5 years, they can end up with a very good young core that'll just need a nudge from a veteran star or superstar from FA."
"To me that doesn't make sense. How do Russ and LeBron work together?  Both of them need the ball to be effective, and neither of them can shoot that well (esp. Russ). Who's bringing the  ball up the court? Even if they split those posessions, what's the idea behind that offense? Suddenly LeBron starts shooting 40% from 3, and Russ keeps feeding everyone?  I just don't get how this trade makes the Lakers better. Russ is going to be the starting PG 100%, but he needs the ball to be effective, like LeBron. IMO, the Lakers needed to swing for Duncan Robinson and Reggie Jackson. Add another big that can hold the fort while AD is gone, or not playing centre, and trade Kuzma plus some picks for someone that will actually contribute to the team. Get a Wayne Ellington, try to sign Nerlens Noel (don't leave the Knicks baby), couple of players that complement the team structure.  With just LeBron and AD healthy, and a decent backup team, they can win the title. Russ, to me, doesn't push them over the edge like a superteam."
We still have Hayward who would be that guy if he didn't have legs made out of cardboard. Graham has also shown some serious clutch moments and can make incredibly difficult 3s late in the game. Terry honestly should be playing a Reggie Jackson role on a contender and just get set up by some ball-dominant superstar because he is pretty ass when he has to put the ball on the floor but is a top 10 catch and shoot player in the league

They'll have the taxpayer's MLE ($5 million) and vet mins. If they luck out they can find some good guys. Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum were both signed for vet mins this year for example.
Mavs got hella good shooters. Their problem is bad defense and Porzingus not having a post game and unable to score against Reggie Jackson.
He almost beat Kawhi and PG (and freaking Reggie Jackson lol) singlehandedly. There's nobody on that list I could see doing that except from the guys I mentioned.
Gold: Brooklyn   Silver: Clippers (I'd probably say Reggie Jackson instead of Ibaka though)   Bronze: Milwaukee   Barely misses medal: Phoenix   Finishes higher than expected: Dallas
"Kawhi, Pg, Reggie jackson(or Marcus Morris)"
Reggie Jackson sign and trade and a bag of beans
Lol this dude was feeling some type of way when he dunked on Reggie Jackson but hasn’t done shit in the NBA note worthy. Backup center with low ball IQ
"He isn't going ahead of Pippen.  Robinson, Reggie Miller, and Pip still go ahead of him. No way he goes ahead of Kevin Johnson or Mark Jackson either."
"Kenny is probably drafted ~10th in a real redraft behind Robinson, Pippen, Miller, Mark Jackson, Kevin Johnson, Horace Grant, Derrick McKey, Muggsy Bogues and Reggie Lewis, roughly in that order.   Psh, 3rd before Scottie is laughably idiotic lmao."
I could see him on the Clippers for the vet min as a Reggie Jackson replacement
"I’m convinced Dennis is just the German variant of Reggie Jackson.  In both their playing styles, and (early career) self evaluations"
"Yeah... because of all of the attention Lebron and Love were getting. If he and Reggie Jackson were switched, he'd be on the other side of that sweeping."
reggie jackson is never healthy.   you are getting tricked by one good playoff run.
"Late firsts are traded for useful veterans all the time. They also occasionally turn into Serge Ibaka, reggie Jackson,  or Andre Roberson."
"The Pelicans need an above average shooter. I would argue that Reggie Jackson would be a better target than Dinwiddie, assuming they miss on better PGs."
Shit if Reggie jackson ain’t go down along with just the injury bug in general we’d have been pretty solid.  Also to this day I say Kyrie fouled the shit out of reggie at least twice on the final play
"&gt;Definitely puts a damper on resigning Payne next year though.  The Suns can only offer him about $10 million per year no matter what, so he might have left anyway. If someone else offers him more you'd have to imagine he's gone. He's in the same situation with Phoenix that Reggie Jackson is with the Clippers."
"Like I said, Harden was one of their few shining spots in that Finals series, Sefolosha was getting old,  and they had no other guards other than a washed Fisher and young Reggie Jackson. It made no sense to pick Ibaka at the time especially for the mediocre hull that the Thunder got from the Rockets"
"Hard disagree, I think the Clippers suck. They've never really been a true contender. Reggie Jackson got hot for a bit, that's not sustainable. The rest of their roster is washed up dudes that can catch an occasional hot streak... And Terrance Mann."
Pretty sure they can't bring Reggie Jackson back so if they lose him kawhi and pg that's just a fuck ton of efficient scoring to be replaced by what are fantastic role players. They could pretty easily have a top 5 pick with just a bit more bad luck.  If they only lose kawhi I agree they're no where near a bottom 5 team.
"PG: Curry SG: SGA SF: Kyle Anderson PF: Giannis C: Boucher  Bench: Haliburton, TJ McConnell, PJ Tucker, Aron Baynes, Trevor Ariza, Reggie Jackson, Jordan Poole, Maurice Harkless, Chuma Okeke, Willy Hernangomez"
"What's the narrative? He was never good at posting up smaller players and seems to have lost the explosion that made him somewhat effective facing up vs other big guys.  When he played for the Knicks he took about 25% of his shots from 3. He's taking about 40% of shots from 3 now. Those are JJ Redick shooting splits. Spot up shooter numbers.  I don't how you want him to be used? He can't put it on the floor against smaller guys. Can't back them down.  If you can't or don't switch on the pick and roll he's pretty effective still, but if you do he can't do much. And, if you guard him with smaller players you limit him even more.   Fundamental for all bigs is the ability to actually force other teams to play other bigs. Be it getting on the glass, sealing off your man for easy baskets, posting them up. KP doesnt do any of that stuff which is why you can stick Reggie Jackson on him and he just camps out at the 3 point line."
"Lol he definitely ain’t Zubac and Reggie Jackson are definitely better. In most cases Pat Bev is a 2nd string PG, but they gave him more time because Rondo underperformed and Kawhi was out."
He can't create his own offence. The second you start switching KP pick and roll he mine as well be Rudy Gobert. About 20% of his baskets were unassisted last season which is in the range of players like Willy Cauley Stine and Dwight Powell.  You can guard KP with Reggie Jackson and he is incapable of getting a quality look.
Hell if he played like this year’s playoffs Reggie Jackson we might be celebrating rn
There's a german Reggie Jackson in your lineup
"If he lead his team to 82-0 , I'll give him a slight edge over Reggie Jackson.  But I'll believe  Luke kennard will be the mvp"
Tbf Reggie Jackson was Stephen Curry in that series
"Hell if you swapped KP for Reggie Jackson this series goes your way. Luka is unreal and I feel is top 5 for sure. Its just that half of these players have injuries but every one of them played incredibly when last fit, so we should all expand and have a consensus top 6 or 7 rather than the nice round 5."
Feel like clippers could’ve did a better job on the rest of the team besides Giannis. Also think their big 3 of Kawhi PG and reggie Jackson would’ve done well
"Definitely getting better imo  But honestly, the USA team is so much more talented individually, they should still be winning by 20 easily. I watched the game last night in the second half and it was hella ugly.   Doesn't help that they're all a bunch of high volume shooters with no PG, everyone was just passing the ball till someone bricked a 3. I dont know if they're scared to attack the rim because Rudy can just sit there all day but Reggie Jackson can do it."
"All season I heard people talk about how people shouldn't sleep on the Jazz and that Rudy Gobert is one of the best defensive players in history and y'all blow like a 26 point lead as a first seed with the best defense in the league supposedly with D-Mitch on fire to Terrance fucking Mann and Reggie Jackson.   I don't care if Mike Conley was hurt, choking like that is unacceptable for any contender and a first seed"
And Reggie Jackson was the third best player on the clippers. Sometimes players go on hot streaks
The Clippers cannot make any moves.  They don't have any picks to trade. They already had to overpay Kennard and Marcus Morris. Ibaka unfortunately feels like he might be on his way out of the league due to back injuries. They will have to overpay or lose Batum and Reggie Jackson.  Their only real assets (outside of Kawhi and PG) are Zubac and Terrence Mann.  They don't really have any avenue in improving their team from here. They will need to rely on cheap FA signings and Kawhi and PGs long term health.
"so basically only OG, THJ and Reggie Jackson this past decade  3/20 players for an even useable player."
Cus Reggie Jackson exists
"&gt; he’s not expected to defend on the perimeter  He can. Historically he has, and even in that series Reggie Jackson was the only one getting by him when people isolated on him because Reggie pretty much was unstoppable. The games you’re talking talking about Gobert wasn’t the guy getting blown by, that was Conley and Mitchell. Gobert was always guarding Mann in the corner while also having to play rim protector and the Jazz chose to never rotate over on Mann.   This take drives me nuts because if you really think Gobert was getting blown by you’re just defending how much you didn’t watch."
Glasses Reggie Jackson would win with these cats
Time to call **REGGIE “BIG GOVERNMENT” JACKSON**
I’ve fallen in love with Reggie „big government“ Jackson
Dennis is super talented. He reminds me a lot of Reggie Jackson who wanted out of OKC so badly to “run his own team” and be a star.  He got to Detroit and he was who we thought he was.  No one in the league is going to wager their teams success of $100m or 20 shots a game from Schroeder
How? I would pick Reggie Jackson and Brogdon over Westbrook at this point. His playstyle does not work in the playoffs.
Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schroeder wishes he was. I hope Reggie gets the bag. He was fucking phenomenal.
Reggie Jackson is a baller though and just stepped up huge in the playoffs and in key moments. Schroder is the opposite
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
Fax. Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis
exact reason why i'm wary of reggie jackson as well
"I don't see it. Not enough demand for his skillset. The normal people who get overpaid during free agency are ""Potential"" guys, guys that have rode the momentum from a good season (Reggie Jackson gonna get PAID), or guys with a completely overrated but still in demand skillset.  &amp;#x200B;  Shroder is a guard that uhh... I guess he's good at generating offense?"
"No it was a fine trade. Ultimately it was the injuries that fucked the team. Sure Schroeder can play better but when the team was healthy, they were rolling and we’re up 2-1 against the sun at home, with potential to go up 3-1. He can play like Reggie Jackson and it still wouldn’t matter because the team isn’t healthy enough, just like the clippers"
Nic Batum and Reggie Jackson
"&gt;all the pretty reliable source is saying is that teams want kawhi bad  That teams would really want Kawhi is not new news. But this sentence from as reputable a news breaker as Marc Stein is news: ""The situation with Kawhi is no longer a safe assumption he’s staying with the Clippers.""  &gt;also kawhi would have to be pretty dumb to think the Clippers window is closing  Not really, it's pretty easy to see why someone could think that. Consider the following things:   * Kawhi will probably miss next season  * By the time Kawhi returns in 2022-23, Beverley could be gone (as he'll have hit free agency, and/or the Clippers could trade him while they can still get something for him). Even if he's still there, he'd be 34 and already has had serious injury issues  * Ibaka may also miss all of next season recovering from his back surgery, and it's unclear if he'll ever even play again, or at least with the Clippers, given his age and that injury  * Marcus Morris will be 33 by the time Kawhi plays again  * Reggie Jackson and Batum are very good chances to leave as free agents this summer  * The Clippers have very little in the way of tradeable assets with which to improve their team  Given how poorly the Clippers faired in the bubble combined with how many other contenders got eliminated due to injuries this year (namely the Nuggets and Lakers), it's not at all clear if the Clippers ever really have had an open window at all. But if they did, it's certainly difficult to see it as opening going forward as opposed to closing."
Reggie Jackson can also shoot the 3 which is very valuable and size wise is just bigger
"He's basically the Reggie Jackson of this year, except Jackson balled out, and he was pretty decent during his time with OKC."
"TNT just for how much better the pregame, halftime, and postgame content is. I did prefer Breen-SVG-Jackson over Marv-Reggie though by a lot."
"Chris Paul isn’t even allowed to sign a 4 year contract due to the CBA’s Over 38 Rule. The most he can sign is 3 years.   Sarver already said that he’ll pay the money to keep this core together. Ayton and Bridges are eligible for extensions this off-season and will sign them. That locks in Book, Ayton, and Bridges.   The only questions are Paul and Payne. We can offer Payne about $10.5 million with Bird Rights. I think he’ll take that. There are several other point guards in this class that other teams would probably prefer, including Ball, Dinwiddie, Reggie Jackson, and obviously Lowry.   The only way Paul is leaving is if he decides to take the vet min with the Lakers, which means he’d be giving up $40 million next year and guaranteed long-term money when he is already going to be competing for a championship with the Suns anyway. Just doesn’t make sense to leave."
He’s the future. Reggie Jackson is the present.
Yeah you’re right Reggie Jackson &gt; Steph Curry
"Literally 90 percent of the players to come through Detroit.  I thought signing Chauncey Billups in 2002 was a waste of money because they already had Chucky Atkins.  My first reaction when the Pistons traded Jerry Stackhouse to the Wizards for a young Richard Hamilton was, ""That's all we got?!""  I celebrated and high-fived my friend when the Pistons drew the No. 2 overall pick because we knew that meant we were getting Darko Milicic, who we were both certain was going to be a godsend.   I thought Rodney Stuckey would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.  I thought Brandon Knight would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.  I thought Reggie Jackson would be the Pistons' point guard of the future.   And I didn't really care when Khris Middleton got traded because he and Kim English were basically interchangeable to me at that point and I figured neither would be in the league for long."
"Clippers under Ballmer aren't the same as the Clippers under Sterling. Overall the Clippers have put together a top notch organization with Lawrence Frank at the helm. Last year Paul George shit the bed in the playoffs but this year the Clippers looked solid with great role players like Batum and Reggie Jackson playing great basketball before Kawhi went down. Ballmer expects a lot from his team but also doesn't try to micromanage his team. I like to shit on the Clippers as much as any Lakers fan, but as an organization I can't fault anything they have done."
"5th, this postseason has exposed him as a poor mans Giannis. Sure his defense could carry you to a 97-83 win against tanking teams on cold monday nights in january when your star players are resting but in the playoffs he's an utter wet wipe. It's one thing to get humiliated by Steph and Harden, but a whole another thing to get humiliated by Ja Morant, Reggie Jackson, and Terrance Mann."
"Again, wrong. His shooting efficiency from the floor was solid, but hardly special. His EFG% was pretty average at 56.9%  Here's all the people that started for the Clippers that series:  Kawhi: **67.5%** --&gt; this is the dude that actually shot the lights out  Paul George: 52.5%  Reggie Jackson: 56.6%  Batum: 56.5%  Beverly: 56.7%  Zubac: 58.8%  Morris: 52.9%  He only shot better from the floor than Morris and PG man. His shooting efficiency was pretty average   **The Clippers as a team had a higher EFG% than Luka at 57.1%**. Like Luka's ""great shooting efficiency"" was literally worse than the average shot for the Clippers"
"Disagree.  A two guard that’s exceptional at making tough shots and mediocre at defense? Where have seen that before? Sounds pretty close to Middleton.  Not saying that there’s another Giannis, but Embiid is pretty close to having that same two way dominant effect.   Pair a shot making guard like CJ with elite defensive personnel like the Sixers do, and he would for sure be good enough.  For reference, the number #2 players on the four conference finals teams this year were Reggie fucking Jackson, DeAndre Ayton, John fucking Collins, and Khris Middleton.  Only one of those dudes has ever made an all star game and they have zero all-nba team selections between them."
He's more dangerous than the suns cause y'all really be puttin Reggie Jackson and pat bev on him   That's BBQ chicken to him
"I like the list, up until CJ and Reggie Jackson."
I’m going with another Big Ten player and go Duane Washington out of Ohio State. I don’t think he’ll ever be a star but I could see him becoming a Reggie Jackson type of guy
Sabonis no but Reggie Jackson and Steven Adams
"Cmon man, you can't expect your 7""3 max player to post up Reggie Jackson."
"If he played like Reggie Jackson during the playoff, this wouldn’t be a issue."
"I wasn't only talking about the anti-asian racism during covid though. I'm talking about him having his own documentary where he films and publishes disrespect he's received on the court. He's more or less consistently addressed issues with teammates. He openly said Kobe stopped talking to him and didn't like him at times. Which leads me to:   &gt;The other is Lin with a complicated relationship with a teammate he respected and got along with who maybe just didn't like sharing the spotlight with anyone, but was also maybe still kind to him in personal interactions.  Like Lin has never done that. He's only ever been positive about it. Moreover the idea that Melo doesn't like sharing the spotlight after they traded for Iverson and he was upset when they traded him away. After he came to NY to play with Amar'e. There's just not much evidence Melo didn't want to share spotlight....especially in this context. There was no spotlight to share. Lin wasn't an all-star.  I wrote a breakdown of all the articles and sources that existed. Again, Melo and Lin is THE most contrived feud in history. And it's wild because there are a number of teammates that have OPENLY feuded. Paul George and Lance Stephenson, Blake and Chris Paul, KD and Draymond, Wade and Love, Bron and Chalmers, Westbrook and Reggie Jackson, etc. etc. etc. it isn't at all unique or notable for teammates to feud. Which is why it makes it so weird that people: 1. are forcing this feud to be a thing when there's little evidence, 2. even if there WERE evidence, that a feud between teammates is at all unique or representative of a particular type of selfishness.  Here's the post:  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/NYKnicks/comments/c1019y/oc_revisiting_linsanity/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=nba&amp;utm_content=t1_h8dhegg  r/nba doesn't let you post links without the NP, but the NP is going to say its restricted.

how do u explain reggie jackson
"like deadass I might rather have Malik Monk over him right now straight up, much less for the discount they got. Schroeder was lucky to even get that contract, because it's be like when Reggie Jackson got his big one with Detroit. you're lucky to even get that, bro, like I can't imagine how overconfident you need to be to end up in this position. 20 million as a maybe-star for the Lakers is worth more than 30 playing for the Magic because of all the endorsement money."
"No other team besides the Lakers would give him more to be honest. Barely anyone had capspace this offseason. It wasn’t gonna be a 2016 type situation where teams started throwing $18-$30 million a year to above average role players.   But I think, had the Lakers had a great post season and Schröder balled out…he’d have gotten $100 million. But that whole scenario being likely was pretty minuscule. A guy like Reggie Jackson, who is better than Schröder and had an awesome playoffs only got $11 million a year."
Reggie jackson
just because that incident was a hoax doesn't mean Howard hasn't been on the DL with others.  Also PG and Reggie Jackson are probably a downlow couple.
Kawhi  PG13  Dame  Donavon Mitchell  Russ  Ja Morant  Kyrie  Derozan  Bradley Beal  Dejounte Murray  Keldon Johnson   Giannis  Patty Mills  Blake Griffin   Reggie Jackson  Oladipo  Sabonis  Bojan Bogdonavich  Mike Conley   Jimmy Butler  Rudy Gay
"- The roster?  - We traded for Brown with Boston and signed Brown and Reggie.  - Jaylen Brown, Bruce Brown and Reggie Jackson?  - Not quite ...."
"Well I’m fine with taking credit for drafting Westbrook, Harden, Reggie Jackson, Ibaka, and Sabonis,"
Mine typically end with me falling out of bounds like Reggie Jackson after Kawhi ripped it from Boban
"Even if he really wanted to stay in Phoenix his agent still needs to be fired. He was eligible to get the same starting salary with the Suns that Reggie Jackson got with the Clippers, as both teams had early Bird rights on these players. I'm guessing someone else out there probably would have paid Payne more to leave, but even if his main goal was to stay in Phoenix he still could have got significantly more to do so. It's crazy that [Reggie Jackson got $7 million more guaranteed from the Clippers in two years](https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1423694622522478599?s=19) than Cameron Payne got from the Suns for 3 years, especially when Payne is 4 years younger than Jackson is."
"Lol no. People like you do all they can to absolve rudy of any blame lmao  The guy is payed 40 million to play fucking defense. I don’t care if his teammates were getting beat, he can’t defend the perimeter and they were going against a 5 out lineup. Terrence man and Reggie jackson were attacking him and scoring over him lmao. That shit happens every year. Being “fine” on defense when your supermax contract is for you to play defense doesn’t cut it. Keep making excuses to absolve him of any blame tho"
"He's getting paid basically nothing and we still have Rose (no injurie worries there /s). Considering the other options were Schroder, Reggie Jackson and Elfrid Peyton, it's a risk well worth taking"
Man said Reggie Jackson. I’m deceased
"Lmao Reggie Jackson is not underrated after his playoff run.   I’ll tell you who’s underrated, Jamal Murray. He took a huge leap in 2019-2020 but got injured so ppl have forgotten about him. The guy torched the Utah Jazz and the LA clippers in the playoffs."
"I think Clippers was the deepest team last year. I don’t know about this year but they are looking good.   Pg: Reggie Jackson, Pet Bav, Preston, Rondo   Sg: Paul George, Luke Kennard, Keon   Sf: Kawhi, Mann, Justise   Pf: Batum, Marcus Morris  C: Zubac, Ibaka, DC"
"If Kawhi somehow gets healthy during the season and plays   Ceiling: Championship  The team last year showed how tough they are even with their best player out (plus other key pieces like Ibaka) and when you get that with guys constantly improving (Mann, Jackson, etc) and you add an arguably top 3 player in the world when healthy, I can definitely see them take it home   Now, the most important thing is to see how well the Lakers play cause the team is pretty incredible but I would love to see fits and all of that. And of course, injury status of the Nets cause that team is still gonna be tough as shit.  Floor: 2nd round exit   Even if Kawhi is out, I could still trust the PG and Reggie led Clippers to at least get a decent seed and win the first round (hopefully we don’t play Luka again if Kawhi’s out). I don’t know, however, if the Clips beat a Suns, Healthy Nuggets, or Lakers without their best player"
"I'm happy for Reggie Jackson. The Clippers seem like a great fit for him professionally &amp; I'm glad the Clippers are ""running it back"" because if Kawhi didn't get hurt I think they would have won a ring."
"Eh, kinda works out to being a good move for both sides.  Worst case, he just sucks balls. Best case, he benefits from low pressure situation in LA in the same way Reggie Jackson did and resurrects his career. Worst case, he sucks balls and whatever spot he was supposed to have gets taken."
I don't understand how Jackson gets a 2 for 22 and Derozan gets a 3 for 85.  Reggie is worth 3 Demars in the playoffs.
"&gt; when he comes back at 31 he probably will load manage I would think(maybe not?) do you want to pay a 31 year old kawhi a 5year 250 max?  Load management or not, even at 31, I don't think the Clippers blink at all to a 5 year 250 max for Kawhi. I don't think people really realize how much value a true superstar brings and how much their salarys are deflated by max restrictions. If there were no restrictions then I really believe the top players would command 70m+ a year. Guys like Duncan Robinson, Reggie Jackson, Spencer Dinwiddle are getting about 20m per year and a superstar gets you over triple their value (both in terms of chances of winning championship and selling tickets) easy."
Guess we can call him Reggie ‘max contract’ Jackson now
"Reggie Jackson had a 5 yr/$80M deal with Detroit.  He's had a phenomenal playoff series with the Clippers.  Now he's getting a 2 yr/$22M deal?!  Unless there's a nod and wink that Reggie will get seriously paid by the Clippers in 2023 for something like $30M+ no matter what, then HTF does this make sense?"
Crazy how people said this same thing about Batum and Reggie Jackson.
He needed that Reggie Jackson government pack
If you want perspective.   Salary comps  LeBron = Kawhi  AD = PG  Westbrook = Kennard + Morris + Pat Bev  THT = Reggie Jackson  Deng + Nunn = Ibaka  Except now the Lakers have a bunch of minimum salary guys. While the clippers have Rondo at $7.5mill and Zubac at $7.5 mill. That extra $15 mill gets compounded in the luxury tax zone
"Ironically, people said this about Reggie Jackson while he was in Detroit."
"Yeah—and I'm speaking as a die-hard Clips fan since the Baron Davis years—I don't really get this narrative. Kawhi should get the most he can get, bc that's what he deserves.  Opting out is totally acceptable and should pretty much never be interpreted as being too selfish or anything, and also we have no information here.  Batum just took a deal for less than what he could have got, Reggie Jackson just took a deal for less than he could have got... How do we know Kawhi isn't considering something similar for his injury year? I certainly don't expect it, but it's stupid for media to project like this when we have no information."
Oh good to see Reggie Jackson get paid for his good work out there.
"The [Los Angeles Clippers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-clippers) and free-agent combo guard [Reggie Jackson](http://bleacherreport.com/reggie-jackson) reportedly came to terms on a two-year, $22 million contract.  ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported details of the signing Friday:"
There's still Reggie Jackson &amp; .... ugh .... Dennis Schroeder
"&gt; I don't understand Monk, a 23 years old, goes there for min contract.  Remember when people were talking about paying big for Reggie Jackson during the playoffs.  Monk is working for that kind of talk, which no one was doing in Charlotte. One big run and he can get paid next year.  Risky, but huge upside."
"I don't think either of those players were getting 20+ million more than they just signed for. That's what Reggie Jackson could be giving up by re-signing. Plus in the case of Cameron Payne, he'll likely have another opportunity when his new contract is up.  Reggie Jackson was lucky to sign for the minimum and this is his last opportunity for a big contract. He's not getting another one in 3 years.  I just think it's more likely that he didn't end up getting those big offers that people speculated he would get. I think the ""he just wants to play with his friends"" is less relevant."
"I've said this before, but if New Orleans wants to overpay a PG they're better off offering that money to Reggie Jackson. He would not only provide better leadership, but he's a much better shooter, which is something the Pelicans desperately need. Reggie might turn them down, but they can offer him more than the Clippers can, and they should probably at least ask. If he says no, *then* go after Schroder."
NOLA might go for him if they can't get Reggie Jackson from Clippers.
"Worst part of it is, Presti has a terrible track record over the last decade of drafting outside the lottery. People act like he's a genius for securing all the mid and late first round picks, but he hasn't nailed one of them since Reggie Jackson about 10 years ago. Roberson was a decent pick, but even that was like 8 years ago.  He has actually nailed his lottery picks though (Steven Adams is probably his worst one, and that was an above average pick), so hopefully Giddey isn't a bust. I'd love to know how many first rounders he offered Cleveland for #3.  As the number of picks we have coming in is way more than the number of upcoming roster spots we have available, I would've offered #6, #16, #18, Phoenix's 22 first rounder, Clippers 22 first rounder, and an all you can eat buffet of 2nd rounders. Wouldn't have thought twice about it either."
Thats a great idea since it seems like reggie jackson will stay at the clippers.
"1rst seed. We are one small trade away from our ceiling being the ecf(reggie jackson or Schroder), one medium change to our ceiling being a finals loss(cj or fox), and one big trade from our ceiling being winning(Dame or beal.)"
In what way does Kawhi taking a pay cut help Reggie Jackson?
"Yeah, I don't think there's much question Kawhi is returning to the Clippers, but I'm just trying to figure out why he's taking so long to re-sign. My only guess is he's using his leverage now to get them to do something else first before he re-signs. After all, the Clippers have been *incredibly* quiet this week. Literally the only thing they have done since the draft is re-sign Batum. I'm just assuming there is something going on behind the scenes that is the reason for why both Kawhi and Reggie Jackson haven't re-signed."
"To be honest we don't have a great sense of what the Clippers rotation is going to look like this year. Kawhi probably won't play at all, it's unclear how much Ibaka will play, if at all, Reggie Jackson and Cousins are still not signed. A couple of those dudes you're listing may either not be on the team or could be starters.   If Kawhi and Ibaka are out and Reggie Jackson signs elsewhere, then what's the Clippers starting lineup? Probably Zubac, Morris, PG, Mann and Beverley? Or maybe Batum instead of Mann? They're an incomplete right now, we need to wait and see what happens. All they've done in free agency so far is re-sign Batum. That's it."
"I do have to wonder if Kawhi's indecision (or slow pace to decide to do what everyone thinks he will do anyway, whichever it is) might have hurt the Clippers chances of getting cheap vets to sign with them. Since the draft, literally the only thing they've done is re-sign Batum. I can't help but wonder if they would have done more this week if Kawhi had just signed that max deal as soon as free agency started.   On the other hand, the last time Kawhi was a free agent he took his time because he was working things behind the scenes to get the Clippers to trade basically everything they had for Paul George before he'd sign with them, and there were no hints of any of that happening until it was announced as a done deal. Is he lining something similar up this time? Is he again using his leverage to get the Clippers to make some huge move before he officially commits to re-signing? Because I'm also curious why Reggie Jackson hasn't re-signed or signed elsewhere yet. What are those two waiting for?"
Yeah you meant to say Reggie Jackson.
"What’s the deal with Reggie Jackson? He absolutely killed it in the playoffs, is he holding out for big money or unwanted or ???"
Maybe if he performed in the playoffs things would be different... Look at Reggie Jackson
Really? Feel like everyone is exaggerating how bad he is? If they called the Clippers for a Reggie Jackson/Ben Simmons swap that deal would get done in a heart beat imo.
"They did that off and on all season, though.  Mann and Reggie Jackson came out of nowhere."
"Reggie ""I am the law"" Jackson"
"Some time in the future people will figure out that the problem with the defense of the Jazz is NOT the 3 time DPOY, 5 time 1st team All-D center, but rather the small, unathletic, pathetic perimeter defenders, who cannot be bothered to even attempt to stay with their man or rotate when it's needed.   The Clippers did NOT attack Gobert on the perimeter. In fact they took him away from the action completely. They were attacking everybody else and were putting whoever Gobert was guarding in the corner as far away from the action as possible, which stretched Gobert to the corner 3. Then the Jazz defense would break on the perimeter(pretty much everybody was getting cooked by the likes of Reggie Jackson) and Gobert would help on the drive in the paint from the corner which would open the corner 3 and noone from the perimeter defenders would rotate to cover for Gobert once he went to protect the paint.   In essence Gobert was required to   * guard the corner 3  * help in the paint pretty much every possession because no Jazz perimeter defender could keep any of the CLippers ballhandlers in front of them  * recover back to the 3 because noone was rotating to his man  * go get the rebound  ... because apparently noone else on the Jazz has any defensive responsibilities and it's all on Gobert."
I can’t stomach Mann and Reggie Jackson turning into Larry bird again
Not if they re-up Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson made him his bitch
I think Reggie Jackson would be a better choice contenders need shooters
Reggie Jackson
"It's always tough to watch players give it their all because they want to win badly for not only themselves but their team.  Luka, Booker and Reggie Jackson all come to mind."
Ask him about Reggie Jackson lol
The comparison isn't even close. Sprewell broke laws and had standoffs with the police. Schroeder is just an average PG that r/nba doesn't like cause he rubs them the wrong way. Totally different. Schroeder not breaking laws or going broke he just missed a payday that he still might get next season just like people thought Reggie Jackson was gone smh my head
"And Reggie Jackson is still out there, so Dennis is going to have to wait for him first."
At that pint just sign reggie Jackson
"And honestly, wouldn't Charlotte rather have Reggie Jackson for that same money?"
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
Reggie Jackson isn't going to shoot 3s like Steph Curry again.
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."

"Trying to get some karma from the anti-Pelicans circle jerk? I won't be surprised if they sign Reggie Jackson or Schroeder, but even if not their offseason hasn't been terrible. They messed up with the Adams and Bledsoe moves last year but managed to unload them and bring back Valanciunas which was a pretty solid deal. Nickeil Alexander Walker and Kira Lewis are guards with potential who could play more minutes, and Graham is a solid bench scorer. Satoransky is a decent distributor and gives them some height on the perimeter. It's yet to be determined if Lonzo is worth 21 mil so we'll have to wait and see, but they have a pretty solid young core, and drafted Trey Murphy III who is a smart player with a lot of upside."
"Correct. The hard cap is $143 million. Assuming Kawhi re-signs for the max, the Clippers right now are at $156 million in salary, and that is without counting whatever Reggie Jackson gets if he re-signs. So to get DeRozan on something similar to what he got, the Clippers would have had to somehow dump *a lot* of salary.   If they were adding DeRozan at say, $25 million (less than he got from Chicago), then the Clippers somehow would have needed to ditch about $38 million from what they already have, and then probably just not re-sign Reggie Jackson. Some of that $38 million could have gone to the Spurs, but San Antonio couldn't have taken all of that back. Maybe they could have sent the Spurs Morris and Beverley and then tried to salary dump Rondo somewhere else (OKC maybe?), but they probably would have needed to use picks to do all that, and the Clippers really don't have much in that department that they can send. Also, consider that the Spurs got a better trade package from Chicago than just Morris and Beverley, as the Bulls sent them picks.   In short, DeRozan to the Clippers was always basically impossible unless he was willing to take the $5.9 million MLE instead of the $85 million deal he got from Chicago. It made for some headline grabbing rumors but it was never realistic."
"Kawhi being injured didn't leave a black hole in the roster. Paul George and especially Reggie Jackson stepped up. Sure it was a downgrade, but not a significant one. Suns could have lost with Kawhi healthy, but they could have won just the same."
"I would actually feel shitty taking reggie jackson for the vet min after his playoff performance, and probably apologize to clippers fans lol. Dude deserves much more than vet min.  Kawhi on the otherhand…"
reggie jackson
Nah Kahwi gonna retire and Reggie Jackson to Toronto
"This is a correct take.   I actually do prefer Devonte Graham on his contract certainly over Dinwiddie and what he got, probably over what Schroeder and Reggie Jackson are going to get, and arguably over Lonzo (though really I think Lonzo comes down to more that Lonzo simply does not want to be in NO).  But there's no doubt that the point of everything Griffin did was for Chris Paul and Kyle Lowery, he struck out on both, and punting with cap space/moveable to next year, while not making the situation worse, is obviously not what he paid all of those 1st round picks for."
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
"“Pelicans offered to rename team to “The Jackson 5” but Reggie settled for a free 5 day vacation at Steve Ballmer’s time share in Fargo, North Dakota.”"
I think if we make playoffs the free agents will start coming in. That's why I don't want to tie up too much long term money in mediocre contracts. That said Reggie Jackson does make this team better and the Clips can only offer like 11 mil a year so it's not too hard to beat that and still have him on a reasonable deal.
Easy. I'd unironically take a Reggie Jackson open 3 for the win over a contested Kawhi jumper
"Reggie is a definite upgrade.  They’re both kind of gunners, but Jackson is just better across the board."
"Reggie Jackson is a good player, and you have to overpay to get people here…our best FA signings ever have been Peja and Julius Randle"
"I think the Pacers were in the running for a ring that year but I think calling them a potential dynasty is a reach, in my opinion. Reggie Miller was almost 40, Jermaine was was the real deal, Stephen Jackson was having a moment, and Ron Artest—basketball-wise—had a great start to the year before he asked for time off. Beyond that, I didn't see a lot of dynastical qualities.  Not to mention, the state of Artest was always such that the team was going to ebb and flow with whatever he was up to at any given time. The Malice wasn't completely random, nor was it all Artest's fault. But if you were to poll fans, players, and coaches beforehand as to who would be the guy to truck stick his hometown radio play-by-play guy, fracturing multiple vertebrae in the process, then leap into the stands to begin attacking fans at random, I'd bet 95 percent of those returns would have had Artest's name on it.   I think the shocking nature of it all, on national TV with endless camera angles, is what made it all resonate. We all saw it unfold right before our eyes. And for whatever reason, we'd trained ourselves to believe that those types of things should happen even less in basketball than any other sport (though, I still remember the moment a fan fell into the penalty box with Tie Domi, too)."
Reggie Jackson apparently.
Reggie jackson did that and isn't making shit
If you get Reggie then you can relive the Drummond-Jackson connection
That’s a huge if. Pg and Kawhi are 2 of the most rested players during the regular season. I’m a big fan of Reggie Jackson and I think he’s taken a huge step forward but can he lead the team if PG goes down?
Weren’t you just talking about IF Kawhi was healthy and IF Reggie Jackson stays. Not smart of you to use that or haze right after tossing out hypotheticals
"Pretty surprised Reggie Jackson hasn't been picked up yet. It seems like most teams saw his playoff performance as overperformance I guess.  That's good for the Clippers though, he's a good fit for that team and they know how to make him effective."
We arent giving them shit lol. We are doing them a favor taking Dragic contract and they can accept the 2 guys to match salaries or they can fuck off and we sign reggie jackson or dennis
"While true, it doesn't seem like you guys are going to have a use for the money. If the Clippers offered you guys a Reggie Jackson/Marcus Smart sign and trade, that seems like a slam dunk yes especially if Jackson's salary is lower than Smart's."
Reggie Jackson probably.  Schroder gonna spend the next year sitting by the phone waiting for his $20M offer.
The fact that Andre Drummond thinks he’s a better player than Reggie Big Government Jackson is laughable
Kind of shocked that nobody has thrown 10+ million/year at Reggie Jackson. He had an absolutely insane playoffs and is a great slasher/3 point shooter + an improved defender.
"He couldn't make a pass to zion to save his life. He was terrible in pnr actions, especially for the roller. Didn't help that drummond was the roller most times, but Dennis usually chucked it out to the 3 point line or went for an easy bucket most times. His biggest problem is that he's exactly what the clippers didn't like about reggie jackson before these playoffs(held the ball till the clock reached 8 and passed it off to kawhi)"
clippers trying to retain reggie jackson
"As a Knicks fan, I'm jealous of the secure PG situation both the Heat and the Nets have. We love D. Rose but we don't wanna make him play 40 mins a night. I'm still hopeful we get Reggie Jackson, Jalen Brunson or Collin Sexton (for cheap)   Besides that, we're pretty happy with our situation."
"There’s still lots of free agents out there still. Reggie Jackson, Collins, Schroeder, Dinwiddie, Markkanen, oladipo.   Dallas is in better shape and he has a defined role there. I guess it is strange that he turned down what  14m more from NOLA allegedly."
"If people are discounting the Lakers because AD is always hurt, we gotta start doing the same with Kawhi and the Clippers. His health sucks and a team is gonna feel better going up against Paul George and Reggie Jackson instead of Kawhi."
"Low key 2000 would actually be kind of a perfrct team: Shaq, Chris Mullins, Reggie Miller, Kobe, Mark Jackson."
Reggie Jackson in the clutch apparently
And consider they’ve had to carry Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson
"To be fair even Gobert got hunted by Reggie Jackson of all people, so CP3 and Booker doing it to Jokic makes sense. 2019 Gasol couldn't keep up with Curry on the perimeter but his interior defense and overall scheme more than made up for it. I wouldn't say Jokic is a plus defender, but for being 7 feet tall he puts up a pretty decent fight and plays the passing lanes incredibly well."
It’s hard. Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson are both stars.
Lonzo  Reggie Jackson  Lebron  Morris  Wood  This team could win it I think.
"It certainly won't be an issue for Westbrook, he rides for his teammates.     Can't remember Westbrook ever having any issue with any teammate other than Reggie Jackson, and that issue was on Reggie's end.     Every other teammate he's had has said nothing but great things about him."
Lmao Gobert couldn’t even handle Batum and Reggie Jackson and you think they match up better against AD…Nah
Gobert is definitely not overrated lol. People have been clowning him for the entire summer and saying that he's a fraud. If anything he's underrated- he did a damn good job in isolation against Paul George and pretty much everyone besides Reggie Jackson. It's also not his fault the Jazz perimeter defenders have piss poor rotations and can't stay in front of anyone.
Cant think of a Westbrook teammate other than Reggie Jackson that didn’t like him
Reggie Jackson   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Marcus Morris   Serge (perfect man)ibaka   Pg and ibaka carry them
"A Reggie Jackson/Paul George/Kawhi Leonard/Marcus Morris/Serge ibaka starting 5 is more sexy imo, ibaka and Paul george are atleast top 5 in the league in terms of sexy ness"
Any Ty Lue slander for not 'believing' in any of his players from last year is straight garbage. Lue let Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson (two guys nobody had faith in before last season) play massive minutes and didn't hesitate to experiment with lineups that utilized our entire bench.
"Yep.  For example, this play:  https://youtu.be/_NeoI86W5Vg?t=306  Beat instantly at point of attack. Gobert correctly helps. Ingles has 0 idea of what's happening (head turned). Then after Mann catches it, one of those 3 should probably rotate.   Or this play:  https://youtu.be/_NeoI86W5Vg?t=410  The ball is at the rim and Ingles is guarding Batum like he's curry, back turned.  Mitchell forgets he's guarding two guys and just assumes the ball is going up to the wing and not the corner (but the wing is easier to help with).   Clarkson is beat off the dribble immediately.  This play:  https://youtu.be/_NeoI86W5Vg?t=506  Let's laugh at Gobert guarding the rim. Mitchell isn't guarding. He's completely given up on the play.   https://youtu.be/_NeoI86W5Vg?t=531  Jackson knows that the second Gobert glances away that he's going to get a layup. Now Gobert has to sprint across the key to contest because Reggie Jackson, a guy that's not a top scorer, is capable of making his defender look like a traffic cone.  If you replace Gobert with AD, maybe he contests a couple of corner 3s better. But there were way too many leaks in the jazz defense for one guy to plug up. If you replace Gobert with just some center the jazz get destroyed."
"An average player would at least be able to hit jumpers and make free throws, or posting up Reggie Jackson"
"&gt; he averaged 16.7 51/47/88 on in the 9 games he started though (before Kawhi got hurt).  Why do only the 9 games he started matter? He got 21 and 30 minutes in the games he didn't start.  &gt; and one of those 4pt games was because the clippers were blowing them out  He played 28 minutes in that game, what's the Clippers blowing them out have to do with anything? He played 1 less minute than the previous game, which was also a blowout, in which he scored 17. He scored 4 because he took 4 shots and they didn't need him.  &gt; That's pretty much equivalent to his post-Kawhi stats when you factor in the increase in minutes/touches.  You understand it's more impressive to maintain efficiency on greater minutes and touches, right?  &gt;  It's objectively false to say Reggie Jackson wasn't going off before Kawhi got hurt  If your definition of going off is strictly efficiency in games you start.  I don't know if you don't remember these games while they were happening, but the whole narrative was about Reggie Jackson filling the void to keep the Clippers alive. It wasn't ""oh he's continuing where he left off before Kawhi got hurt"" because he had a bigger role after the fact."
"he averaged 16.7 51/47/88 on in the 9 games he started though (before Kawhi got hurt). and one of those 4pt games was because the clippers were blowing them out. That's pretty much equivalent to his post-Kawhi stats when you factor in the increase in minutes/touches. It's objectively false to say Reggie Jackson wasn't going off before Kawhi got hurt. He didn't get better when Kawhi got hurt, he just got more minutes"
If Kawhi was playing they wouldn’t have to rely on Reggie Jackson. They’d have Kawhi
Whether or not the guy is a scout...is he wrong? Can Gobert do anything besides dunk the ball and catch lobs? He definitely has no post moves.   He’s supposed to be the best defender in the NBA yet spent all series against the Clippers getting bodied by Reggie Jackson lol.   This guy is overrated imo. These things are why I think Shaq goes so crazy when Kenny and Chuck talk about Gobert being elite lol.
"Reggie was playing like that because Kawhi wasn't. If Kawhi plays, Reggie Jackson doesn't go off."
I'd guess more non sport fans would be more likely to recognize the name Reggie Jackson
"He honestly wasnt that bad for the clips they just also had reggie jackson, pat bev, tmann, and kennard all playing pretty solid and when you add all the pg/kawhi/batum minutes at wing there just werent many minutes to play"
Facts. Look at the supporting cast around PG13. Im not buying the Reggie Jackson playoff run.
"I picked the first player that popped into my mind without thinking twice, obviously I don't think Reggie Jackson is the greatest Piston of all time:  Mavs - Dirk   Nuggets - Jokic    Warriors - Curry    Rockets - Harden   Clippers - CP3    Lakers - Kobe    Grizzlies - Conley   Timberwolves - KAT   Pelicans - AD    Thunder - Westbrook    Suns - Nash   Trailblazers - Lillard    Kings - Bibby    Spurs - Kawhi   Jazz - Mitchell    Hawks - Young    Celtics - Tatum    Nets - KD   Hornets - Walker    Bulls - MJ    Cavs - LeBron    Pistons - Reggie Jackson    Pacers - PG    Heat - Wade    Bucks - Giannis    Knicks - Melo    Magic - Eric Gordon   Sixers - Embiid   Raptors - DeMar    Wizards - Wall"
"The playoff run your referencing is certainly impressive, especially as a rookie. But “leading” isn’t actually accurate. He was certainly one of the main driving forces, but it was a very by committee effort from that entire squad. I can also mention impressive regular season performances PG has had so that doesn’t really mean anything. And when PG missed those clutch free throws he was far and away the biggest threat and no one on his team was on the caliber of Jaylen Brown and he lead the playoffs in minutes significantly at that point. Reggie Jackson did help him a lot though.   I just think PG is better. He’s way better defensively, shoots better everywhere from the floor and is a better playmaker. Tatum’s ceiling is def higher though he can pass PG in 1-2 years easily"
"Led his team to the ECF as the best player while PG was ass in the playoffs and choked against the Nuggets. First NBA player to drop 50 pt game in reg szn, play in, and the playoffs, and also scored 60 pts and won while being down 32 against the Spurs. Took one game off of the Nets by scoring 50 pts and going against KD’s 39 and Harden’s 41 without his second best player in JB. PG redeemed himself in this year’s playoffs but u can’t deny that Reggie Jackson and Tre Mann were huge factors in winning some of the games for the clippers. Also didn’t PG choke in game 2 against the Suns by missing crucial fts. Meanwhile Tatum is 2nd in clutch/4th quarter scoring behind KD in this year’s playoffs. Tatum has shown up for big games and is way more consistent than PG."
clippers will just pass him up as well after 2022. they only got bledsoe just to minimize the absence of kahwi in the regular season. in the playoffs he won't get minutes over terrance mann or reggie jackson.
"this is not necessarily true. Rondo challenged the leadership (Kawhi) and there appears to have been a bad reaction. So Rondo just coasted from that point on. His mere presence on the Clips, however, brought out the best in TMann and Reggie Jackson and got them to the brink."
"Actually the Lakers *could* have offered him more, they just didn't. They had early Bird rights to him since he'd been there for two years, so they could have basically given him the same thing the Clippers just gave Reggie Jackson. They just apparently didn't think he was worth that much."
I dont recall anything about Reggie Jackson saying Hakeem was his goat centre
Reggie Jackson was bought out by the Pistons in Feb. 2020. He signed a two year deal for $22m three weeks ago with the Clippers.
Reggie Jackson wasn't a buyout guy last year. He was a buyout player for the Clippers in the bubble and he was awful for them. That's why he got no offers last fall and had to accept a minimum contract with the Clippers this year.
"Jazz this year game 6 against the clippers. People like to blame  rudy, but the lack of adjustments by Quinn was laughable. Up 25 in the second half, reggie jackson and co were  blowing by perimeter defenders. When the ball handler penetrated, rudy stayed under the basket to guard the paint, and would rotate out if passed out to a shooter (Terrance Mann in this case). Clearly, Quinn decided to live or die by Mann shooting the 3 instead of guarding the paint, and we died by it.  On offense there was no urgency, Donovan sat for about an 8 minute breather, and Ingles Conley or Clarkson would dribble it down and shoot an off the bounce 3 or one perimeter pass/contested 3 by one of Ingles/bojan/Conley. Clippers have great perimeter d and ride high on arc. We clunked all of those during the 25 point skid.   When we subbed back in Donovan he started driving to the hole and scoring a 2 here or there, but we coulda used any of those players to try and drive on offense for a PnR to either try and score with Rudy, a Pg shot, or to suck in the d and kick it out for an open 3.  People like to blame rudy but Quinn gets the blame in my book. No adjustments on D, and lazy contested 3s on offense. Imo no one talks about the lack of offensive adjustments which was just as important as the sieve perimeter defense we had during that second half.   Inexcusable and still makes me mad we let up a 25 point lead without Kawhi"
"Reggie Jackson really helped the clippers, it was a year later but still was a buyout guy"
Reggie Jackson?
"KD &gt; CJ obviously  Warriors with KD &gt; warriors with CJ obviously  they'd still win a ring with either one. both are better than harrison barnes.   blazers this year had a better roster than the 2012 thunder? Stop trolling cmon. That's a laughable take.  even after harden left, OKC still had kd/russ/ibaka. That's 2 all-nba players and all-defensive 1st team player. Blazers are not better than that lol.   Not to mention reggie jackson in the 2014 playoffs was huge for okc and bailed kd/russ out many times. OKC almost went down 1-3 vs memphis in round 1 if it weren't for a 30 pt game by reggie jackson."
"Watching all the reddit stat nerds crap on Mitchell to prop up Gobert all season was honestly the most frustrating shit ever. Once playoffs rolled around and Spida started routinely dropping 30 bombs on a bum ankle and Rudy got cooked by Terance Mann(lmfao) and Reggie Jackson in game 6 they all shut the hell up for a day or two which was nice.  Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the Utah Jazz, end of story."
"Spreadsheet nerds to be exiled, it’s so obvious none of them have touched a basketball in their lives.   Basketball is a fluid game, offense and defense are interlinked. The key reason why we could run small ball, is cause we were fin with guarding Gobert with whoever.  And on defense people blaming the guards as if small ball isn’t one of the hardest things to guard especially with guys like Paul George and Reggie Jackson driving with the floor spaced.   The counter is to match them and play extreme scramble with fast, switchable players which Gobert isn’t or you make them pay on offense.   If you can’t figure why the guy getting the max and touted as the best (lmao) player on the team is getting this criticism then just stick to your spreadsheets and quit the sport."
"Buddy Hield's contract is similarly bad lmfao, and Barnes doesn't put them over the top. Like if you asked me Mikal Bridges and Jae Crowder or Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum maybe different story"
I'd rather have Nico Batum and Reggie Jackson for $13M combined than Ben Simmons for $30M.  But I'm only talking about the Clips situation.  The Clips are built on spacing and guys who can shoot.  Simmons would be a difficult fit.  I think the answer depends on the rest of the roster and what the team is trying to do.
Reggie Jackson happened
Also Scott brooks and Billy Donovan. Carmelo. Reggie jackson. Even fucking Derek fisher
reggie jackson
"the fact that his narrative still around after the playoffs, KP looked like a g-league player trying to post up Reggie Jackson and fading away every time and suddenly is Luka's fault lmao, if he could score then he would get the ball more just like Jalen Brunson or THJ, or he could run the bench more but KP can't get a bucket nowadays, specially after his injury in the bubble"
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson!
"random. zeke, d'angelo, westbrook, paul george, ,reggie jackson/lamelo ball"
Sixers. Can’t blame the Jazz for Reggie Jackson turning into Reggie Miller
"I mean if you think about it like a computer:  Expectation: Clippers beat Jazz  Result: Clippers beat Jazz   Conclusion: I was right and not surprised  Idk I wasn't as invested in that series so I didn't have much of a reaction other than ""How tf did you blow a 28 point lead to Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson"". If I watched it live maybe I'd have a stronger reaction but I turned the game off and went to sleep at halftime thinking ""I'll stay up for game 7"". One of my bigger regrets this postseason 😭😭"
Pistons  1. Derrick Rose  2. Blake Griffin 3. Khris Middleton  4. Tobias Harris 5. Spencer Dinwiddie   Bench: Reggie Jackson
"Yes, but usually the new player should be pretty special too. That’s why the Pistons let Rodney Stuckey wear Ben Wallace’s 3, Greg Monroe Rodman’s 10, and Reggie Jackson Chauncey’s 1.  Obviously kidding but in each of those cases those guys selected those numbers before they were retired so it worked for the time."
"Not really a decade, but Pistons let players wore number 1, 3, 32 previously worn by Billups, Ben Walace, Rip Hamilton after they left.  Reggie Jackson even keep wearing number 1 even after Billups' jersey retirement."
"TBH, that's fair. I too said top 25 while giving both the brothers the benefit of the doubt. Lamelo is quite talented but the thing is the league is stacked with guard talent top to bottom. Every team either has guards that are elite/great at the moment or has guard talent that will be great/elite in 3-7 years. The only team I can think of that is not stacked with guard talent is the Clippers, but even the clippers have Reggie Jackson and Mann"
Reggie Jackson stepped up in that playoffs though. Went from 5 to 14 ppg in the playoffs
"Damn OKC's lineup was so bad offensively in this game aside from KD lol  2013 Ibaka(before he developed any kind of shot), 22 year old Reggie Jackson who averaged 5 PPG, Sefolosha, and Kendrick freaking Perkins?  People always wonder why they didn't win titles in the KD/Westbrook era but if that's the rest of your team your spacing is going to suck  Even when Westbrook is playing you can just double Durant, still guard Westbrook, and leave some other guy open"
"The Pacers lol  PG- Mark Jackson (4th all time in assists) SG- Reggie Miller (obviously) SF- Roger Brown (considered the GOAT to never play in the NBA) PF- George McGinnis (averaged 20ppg, 11rpg for career) C- Mel Daniels (2x ABA MVP)"
How could a team with Reggie Miller marl Jackson and Chris mullin Scott only 59 points in a 48 minute game?
"These ""bad stats"" are always owned by great players because they have the most opportunities. Like the player who has striked out the most is Reggie Jackson... former MVP and 2 time world series MVP."
You think Reggie Jackson can keep the playoff form for 82 games? Eric Bledsoe going to dial back the clock to 3 years ago? Terrence Mann suddenly gonna be good for 16 ppg each night?  All of those players are going to play off of PG and the system so whenever PG struggles you'll see the Clippers struggle a lot.
"I think you are just prejudiced against Gobert and the Jazz, because anybody who watched that Jazz-Clippers series knows that Gobert's defense was not the issue, it was the atrocious perimeter defense by everybody else on the team.   Honestly what is Gobert supposed to do when Reggie Jackson is blowing by whomever is guarding him in isolation and the rest of the Clippers, who I already mentioned are the greatest 3-point shooting team of *all-time* are spaced out perfectly on the 3-point line? The answer is nothing. Anthony Davis wouldn't be able to do anything in that situation. Nor would Giannis.   The bigger issue for Gobert is punishing teams offensively when they go small, but for that, he needs Mike Conley, who only played ONE game in that Clippers series, something that's conveniently forgotten when it's shit on the Jazz season on /r/nba. Conley/Gobert was statistically one of the best PnR in the league last year. Mitchell doesn't even register that Gobert is an option on offense, that dude has tunnel vision and is only looking for his own shot.   Everything you are saying about the Jazz now are things people said about the Bucks the last 2 years about their playoff failures. Look at how stupid those takes look now."
"The disrespect to Reggie ""big government"" Jackson."
Basically what Reggie Jackson did to force his way out of OKC
"Draymond is a great player, but I feel like he's a ""multiplier"" star, where he's bad as a first option, okay as a second option, and good as a first option. Draymond is at his best with a full fledged second star.   I haven't watched Jordan Poole in the preseason this year, and I'll definitely pay attention once the season starts. Even then, it sounds like he falls into the fringe all star players that all the teams I've mentioned have as well (Tobias Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Reggie Jackson, hell maybe even THJ).   What I'm trying to say is that all the issues you've resolved (depth, competent role players with solid BBIQ) that the teams above have also ""resolved."" The Warriors may at the top of the ""West Morass"" group and be 4th seed, but I still think it's hard to confidently say they'll knock any of the top 3 down."
"People on r/nba must have forgotten OKC was a title contender for a decade.  Also they are probably high on OKC bc of stability of the organization as whole:  1. Presti is OKC. He's one longest tenure GM's in the NBA 2. Coaching stability. From Brooks, to Billy D, and now Daignault the ""Fire the coach"" rumors are rare and a change is only made when it's clear it's time for change. 3. Ownership. The ownership group doesn't fuck with the basketball operation, they let Presti do his thing. Presti has their full support for this rebuild.  4. Listen to every player not named Reggie Jackson talk about OKC. Nothing but good things to say about them.   I swear people hate on the Pelicans for trying to build too quickly around AD and think they are doing the same with Zion then turn around and hate on the Thunder for slowly building around Shai."
reggie jackson played the best ball of his life this postseason at age 31. yet to see if that will translate over to the regular season but he has absolutely become an elite shooter which he was not earlier in his career
"I knew Westbrook would have a comeback after his slow start last season. Some still disagree that he had one, but I'm pleased with the results. I had no special insight on Westbrook, I just saw a mean that had been oscillated too far away from.  I thought Reggie Jackson looked great as soon as he joined the Clippers and at all moments since. This doesn't mean I'm a prophet, it means I'm easily seduced by the type of moves he favors."
"OKC got Ibaka, Dort, Reggie Jackson and Roberson without having to tank either dude. Also tanking is tanking no matter what happened they still tanked their season away last year so there is no justifying that just to fit how you feel."
"i give Simons a 5. he’s loyal to indiana and i respect that he cares about the sport and the team as much as he’s shown. however i hate that he’s a penny pincher and doesn’t believe in paying max contracts. he put his money down on the in the early 00’s to bet on Reggie Miller’s final years and got young Jermaine O’Neal, Ron Artest, Stephen Jackson, and others and pushed for the contention window but since then he’s been hesitant to do it again (like in the early 2010’s with the PG lead teams he wouldn’t pay Lance and missed on some other moves that would’ve been a big push for those teams that went to the ECF but he kept his checkbook closed). i truly believe he wants Indiana to win a championship but i haven’t seen him make any moves or take a risk in a long time."
Bol Bol Reggie Jackson Kevin Looney Elfrid Payton Tony Snell
How is a team with Reggie Jackson averaging 3 PPG on 32% shooting not a super team? /s
"KD wins the scoring title, Westbrook was arguably in his athletic prime and Harden was the runaway 6th man of the year. including Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Perkins and a few decent role players like Collison makes a pretty damn good basketball team. Certainly better than other “super teams” we’ve seen before"
"Oh you mean the year KD won the scoring title averaging 28 a game, Harden was the far and away 6th man of the year and Westbrook was in his prime? With a bench consisting of Serge Ibaka (also in his prime) Reggie Jackson and Kendrick Perkins. The team that only lost a combined 3 games in the entire first 3 rounds of the playoffs? Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and say that team was more than capable of winning a ring lol.   I know you just became a Nets fan this year so you probably don’t know a lot about basketball but I think you might be the clown here, bud!  None of this taking into account the MULTIPLE Houston teams that Harden was a part of that repeatedly choked in crunch time. Were the Rockets super teams? Probably not. Were they capable of winning a championship at the time? Absolutely. More than capable."
You’re telling me that Reggie Jackson and Paul George were avoiding Gobert when they took turns droving in his face and finishing off the glass like 4 times in a row? Lmao. He’s a fucking bum.
"He got clowned on by Reggie Jackson too, don’t forget that."
i still see reggie jackson on the floor wdym
"Myles Turner is the only player on that list that is both better than Caruso and less talked about. John Collins, Roco, Eric Bledsoe all have gotten plenty of attention. Cam Payne has been plenty hyped by this sub ever since he turned his shit around and became a good player, and people were all over reggie jackson in the playoffs - both backup point guards in the same tier as Caruso imo"
Yeah I was gonna say: how many teams have even 4 great shooters lol. The nets? The warriors if you include Poole? The clippers if you include Reggie Jackson? Hard to do. Then what is your team at the end of a game when free throws matter? Can’t give the ball to your point guard cuz he can’t hit free throws. Bench him? You constructed your whole team around him! He’s not a good player lol.
"I agree that would be great but there’s no commentators out there that provide good insight into schemes, etc anyway. All these former players like Reggie and Mark Jackson just have shitty punchlines and talk more about the personalities of the players more than the intricacies of their game. There’s no guy like Romo in the NBA where it’s really a joy to listen to them breakdown the game from a professional perspective, at least not at the national level."
Eric bledsoe Myles Turner Jamychal Green Mikal Bridges Robert Covington John Collins Thaddeus Green Dorian Finney-Smith Royce Oneil Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne
"I think 6th-8th seed. I'm sure PG will play great, but I don't trust him to stay healthy for an entire year as the first option. They have a few good role players but Marcus Morris/Reggie Jackson isn't who you want as your 2nd option competing for a playoff spot in the west."
reggie jackson also played some of the best ball of his career in the playoffs this past season. if he didnt step up they prob have a much harder time on offense with their lack of playoff caliber ball handlers
"The clippers are going to rely a ton on Paul George staying healthy and Reggie Jackson continuing his great play from the playoffs. If both of those things don't happen, they could fall into the play-in but I don't think it's super likely."
Reggie Jackson drove it in his face and finished high off the glass like 3 times in a row lmao. I don’t want to hear about “hey this video of Rudy Gobert scaring off a 2v1 in a regular season game on a Tuesday proves he’s the best ever” when just another guy has no fear when it actually matters.
I know the playoffs didn't turn out as planned for the Clips but Mann and Reggie Jackson absolutely went off. It will be fun to see if that carries over and if Serge stays healthy for the season.
"Lmao what a take. Gobert is hilariously overrated. People give him dpoys because they look at stats in regular season games that other teams don’t care about.   He is the Russell Westbrook stat-padder of defense. I’ve seen the video where players on some random Tuesday regular season game avoid taking it into the paint when he’s there, but that really doesn’t mean shit in a game that actually matters.   When Reggie Jackson drives in your face multiple times in a row in the playoffs and absolutely chops you up, you are not a DPOY, let alone “underrated” on defense."
Luka put up those numbers on Pat Bev and Reggie Jackson tbf  He mostly switched off of Kawhi and PG
He thought he was cool for intentionally elbowing Reggie Jackson in the face because Reggie “took” a few of his rebounds.
"I actually kinda agree.  So that leaves 3 series, against 3 very ""weird"" teams, basically Reggie Jackson was the best pnr guard he had to face, and I think guarding the spread PNR is a more important skill than guarding the post in almost all match ups.  Don't take anything away from him, he was very good on AD, very good on Jokic, pretty decent defensively vs the Clippers when they were playing big, but I think his defense may be a bit overrated now (again purely based on that playoffs run, if I'm wrong and he looked great as a PNR defender in the regular season)"
"He was great in the playoffs, but I also think he may have faced the best possible match up for him defensively, the best pnr guard he had to face is Reggie Jackson (well given how he played in the playoffs that may have been a real test actually), which allowed him to shine as a one on one defender against AD and Jokic because yeah he is a GREAT one on one defender as a big.  Maybe I'm just unfair to centers, but IMO the bar is just super high to give a center a 25+ Millions contract"
"Worth losing him for?  What are u spending that money on instead?  Kantavius Caldwell pope and iggy?  Reggie Jackson?   Come on….       Plus not doing this…. The pr hit you’re going to take from ANY future star is immense.  Let’s say luka comes free.  He’s NEVER going to sign with a franchise who won’t pay to surround him with good players.  Why would any star in their prime want to be on a team that is cheap af.  If you’re a max player like AD, KD, giannis, Trea, luka, kawhi, etc.  you’re never going to a franchise that doesn’t offer someone like ayton the max."
"Do you know why Luka lost that series?  Its because he was horrendous in the 4th quarter and when guarded by Kawhi instead on abusing switches onto Reggie Jackson all series  Before pointing to the results and saying dumb shit like ""Luka outplayed Kawhi"" look at the 4th quarter efficiency results"
"It’s fine bro. You obviously just have an irrational hate for Luka. As if he didn’t drop 42/8/14 in a close game 5 where there was no “stat padding.” Zubac also only played 2 minutes game 7 when Luka put up 46/7/14. Who was he scoring on then? Or as if the 2020 playoffs didn’t happen where he got the switch on Reggie Jackson and hit the buzzer beater. You keep pretending like Luka scored 0 on Kawhi or some shit.  Meanwhile, let’s see Dames good series in the last few years. Denver 2021 no good guard defenders, he plays well. Lakers 2020 have good defense, he plays poorly. 2019 GSW plays a good defensive team, plays poorly. Did meh against Denver 2019 because they had Gary Harris back then who was good on defense. He was atrocious 2018 playoffs with Jrue Holiday. Maybe Dame is the one u need to worry about being exposed. Because Luka has played a good defensive team twice in the playoffs without any reliable offensive help. I know dame don’t got the best squad around him either, but he definitely has some offensive talent.   Anyways, we will see how this season goes. I do hope the defensive improvements the team made help Dame and Portland as a team out. But the fact u only tried to bring Luka down and not counter with anything about Dame and how good he is (because I know he is a top 10 guy) just screams that u are a hater of a player."
"youre highlighting a better ts% performance in a single playoff series. in terms of advanced stats vis-a-vis playmaking, the clippers are a very iso-heavy team in the playoffs so he's naturally going to be playmaking less—a lineup of pg, kawhi, reggie jackson, marcus morris, and batum has 4 potential iso players, for example.   wrt the second point, pgs bad performance simply occurred earlier than jimmys, with the added caveat of it being a completely anomalous playoff situation in the bubble. if youre making a list based on the current perceieved quality of those players, youve gotta have pg higher. because if we were having this discussion a year ago i would be laughed out of the room for even suggesting pg was as good as jimmy"
Can someone explain why people think LAC will be good with no Leonard?  Did reggie jackson trick people again?  there second best player is Marcus Morris for god sake. PG hasn't lead a team since his Indiana days.  What am I missing here?
"It feels bad when your max contract second option  cant create his own shot. And when he does its a sub 40% midrange fadeaway against reggie jackson.  KP was assisted on 75% of his shots last season, for refrence Capela was assisted on 70%"
"Yours, I think 2 is the lie to you. DM me if I'm right.  My turn:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Harden is just as important to the Nets as KD was, it's just injuries ruined that so public perception shifted. 2. Otto Porter Jr will be the Reggie Jackson ""Playoff Shocker"" of these playoffs. 3. Giannis slightly edges KG all time for PFs and is now a top 2 PF of all time with his FMVP and historic finals, plus extra MVP."
Lol it’s not “impossible” for a tall player to gain ground against a much shorter player in a defensive stance. KP can’t because he’s too skinny. Reggie Jackson couldn’t stop Shaq from backing him down in the same position.
"That's one of the most notorious defender the game has ever seen, Reggie ""DeAndre Jordan"" Jackson."
"Luka is an MVP player and they played better as a team, but they are not a more talented team.  If you swapped BI for Dallas 2nd best player people would be saying they could compete for the one seed in the west.  LAC seriously they go as far as PG13 and Kawahi will take them.  Reggie Jackson was waived and resurrected his career but he is not that top notch PG.  PG13 will need to stay healthy all year and play at an MVP type level or that team will struggle to score.  If Lillard stays they are in it is still a question of if he stays.  Chauncey is also a bigger question mark than Green.  Chauncey was an assistant for one year before getting the head coaching gig and Green did stints with the GSW and Phoenix.  The Grizzlies are worse than last year.  Adam’s was on our team and he is not as good as JV.  JJJ has never played 60 games.  They play well together but the moves they made this offseason show they want one more high draft pick before going for a big playoff push."
"- Ben Simmons is basically unplayable in the playoffs and thus is essentially worthless.  - Duncan &gt; Kobe. Advanced stats are not kind to Kobe, ‘03 carry job, fundamentals, volume scoring overrated, etc.  - “Moses Malone is the most disrespected old player.”  - Your personal all-time list: MJ basically has to be #1, LeBron and KAJ 2 and 3 in any order (you can also claim that it’s KAJ at 1 and MJ at 2, some real old head shit, but LeBron cannot be ahead of MJ). Have Bill Russel, Hakeem, and Duncan pretty high. Underrate Kobe, Wilt, and Steph/KD. Throw a random old all timer like Oscar Robertson ahead of newer players. Be highly opinionated on Magic vs Bird, even if your opinion is that they’re basically even.  - Talk about various styles of PnR defense. You don’t have to learn what each one is, just learn the names (Hedge, Ice, “Switch everything,” etc.)  and throw them out there at random, whoever you’re trying to impress probably won’t know any better.  - “You would know X if you actually hooped.”   - The winning coach “made adjustments.” The losing coach didn’t.  - Any contested shot that goes in: “Good D, better O,” or “that’s still a bad shot.”  - Any halfway decent pass: “Great court vision/BBIQ.”  - Winning team has “good spacing.” Losing team does not.  - Guy gets an open look: “He’s so good at moving off-ball, underrated skill.”  - Commentators you like: Mike Breen, Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle. “Gus Johnson is the NCAA goat tho.” - Commentators you hate: Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Dick Vitale (college only!) basically everyone else. “Marv Albert is one of the greats but he’s literally senile.” - Also have a strong opinion about JVG. You can love or hate him but you can’t not care.  - Analysts you like: Zach Lowe, the Inside crew (but you mostly just think they’re funny). - Analysts you hate: Skip Bayless, Stephen A Smith, any overly dramatic ESPN type person.  - Like JVG, you have a strong opinion on Bill Simmons in whatever direction.  - NCAA specific stuff: complain about conference changes/blame them on football. You hate some combination of Duke, UNC, Kentucky, and KU. Complain about one and dones. “I can’t believe these guys will finally be able to get paid!” Virginia lost to a 16 seed."
I mean… Reggie Jackson-PG13-Terrance Mann-Ibaka-Zubac. You really think that lineup is a playoff lock in the West?
turned me into a reggie jackson fan.
"PG i knew had that in him, i've never really bought into the hate, but reggie jackson truly won me over in that series. he was amazing, seemed like he constantly had an answer, and was super cool and level-headed in every post-game interview."
Reggie Jackson ugly as shit.  Respectfully.
Reggie Jackson is a ugly ass dude man
"The biggest difference with all of these is that Durant had westbrook, Ibaca, Reggie Jackson. We were up 3-1 on the warriors but It was Durant that choked. From my recollection that didn't happen to Messi or LeBron or Bosh, they weren't about to possibly win a title, choke and then join that the team that just beat them. Right?!"
"I think Terrance Mann is a good guess, if he gets enough playing time due to Kawhi's injury. Dude was a terror in the playoffs. Alternatively, I could imagine Reggie Jackson putting up 20ppg on great efficiency. He's had some good years in the past, and is a little old for MIP, but if Clippers surprise and are in top 4-5 in the West, I could see him getting it."
Westbrook is a bad teammate. With the exception of Reggie Jackson there is not a player out there that has anything bad to say about Westbrook and his ability to be a good teammate.
Just false lol. I cannot stand watching Westbrook play basketball but by literally every account from everybody not named Reggie Jackson dude is an outstanding teammate.
"Derozan is only making the Hall if he plays long enough to accumulate enough points.  It would be a technicality and controversial.  Lowry is unlikely to make it unless the Heat win a title with him.  HoF's in their prime he beat in the East working backwards...Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Mutumbo, Webber in Washington in year 4 (clearly not as good as his Sacramento days so he can be ignored), Shaq in Orlando year 4 (again not as good as Lakers Shaq still much better than any player Lebron faced in the East), Patrick Ewing, Dominique Wilkins, Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, and Charles Barkley on the Sixers.  Many of these guys he beat multiple times.  He never beat the Celtics in the playoffs.  He lost twice and then was on opposite sides of the bracket going forward.  He lost to them with Bird, McHale, Parrish, Bill Walton, and Dennis Johnson in his 2nd and 3rd year.  Bill Laimbeer might make it.  Mark Jackson will eventually make it based on his stats.  Neither are all time greats, but they would be the equivalent of a Lowry or Derozan making the Hall."
Lol Reggie Jackson and PG wearin same size shoes. Dame wears 4 sizes larger than PG.
Lol serious answer to this question... probably Reggie Jackson. PG who is a plus defender and a good shooter. Limited playmaking but you aren't getting any half court playmaking from Simmons anyway.
"I don't think it matters if they are healthy. Sure, Mike Conley has great defensive numbers, but like said that's because he was tethered to Gobert all year and he wasn't a positive defender for his 1:1 ability. The guy replacing him (Ingles) is also a better defender than Conley. If Conley is on the court, he's probably the biggest switch target and Mitchell might be right behind him. While Mitchell has been extraordinary offensively in the playoffs, he has completely abandoned playing defense over his career. It's not an injury thing, he's gotten worse every year defensively and it's because his effort continues to lessen.  Besides, our ""best"" perimeter defender still gets cooked on his own. There's really no need to hunt for switches against the Jazz because O'Neale can't stay in front of anyone either. Murray annihilated him, Reggie Jackson annihilated him. Some of this is because that's what our defensive scheme was in the RS, but the Jazz also just don't have much perimeter defensive talent anywhere.  There's no excuses for what the Jazz did, they simply have to be better. If Quin stays stubborn and doesn't change his schemes and defensive principles, things won't improve."
"&gt;the thing is you do this even when the other person isn't really making a point at all, they're just making a throwaway comment.    OK, let's look at this whole discussion here as an example. The guy I initially responded to made the ""throwaway comment"" that Reggie Jackson was a lot cheaper than Westbrook, so I made the throwaway response that I thought Ballmer could afford either one (or both, really).   That should have been the end of it, but then you joined in to incorrectly say that the issue wasn't whether Ballmer could afford it, but that the Clippers didn't have the salaries to trade to match for Westbrook. That was you crafting a serious response to my throwaway comment. But because your response was wrong, I pointed out how it was wrong. What I don't understand is how that is suddenly my fault or me being combative or attacking you or something. You responded to *me* with a serious response to my throwaway line, so I responded to you with a serious response in kind. Is that wrong for some reason?  Look, I didn't mind you making your response, but you seem to be upset with me for doing the very thing that you yourself did here. Why did you feel the need to contradict me saying Ballmer is rich with some ""well actually"" response that turned out to be wrong? It's fine if you do that, but if you're going to try to correct someone and you yourself are wrong, I don't see how you can get upset with them for correcting you.   I really don't see what I did wrong here. I'm right that Ballmer could afford Westbrook (and Reggie Jackson), and I'm right that the Clippers had the salaries to trade for Westbrook if they wanted to. Now maybe Westbrook didn't want to play for the Clippers, or maybe they just didn't want him, that I don't know. What I do know is that instead the Clippers executed a salary dump in the Bledsoe deal and opted to retain Kennard. And maybe that will prove to be the smart move, I don't know. But they could have tried to trade for Westbrook if they wanted and Ballmer could have afforded to pay for it if he'd wanted to. And they could have done that and then re-signed Reggie Jackson. But they didn't, and trying to say it would have been impossible is just wrong."
"Small ball 5 does nothing. Seriously, what does that actually help with and how does Rudy Gay solve any of the problems that the Clippers caused us defensively?  Does Rudy Gay solve the situation where Reggie Jackson walks past our ""best"" perimeter defender? Can he protect the rim and the paint at the same time? Gobert could not, Gay cannot, and nobody on the planet can either. Fact is, the Jazz have a sham system that works in the RS because Gobert is great, but it's impossible to have a one man defense in the playoffs.   Jazz have to get out of their gimmicky defensive system, stop relying on Gobert to do everything, and reestablish their principles to play defense as a team and not 4 statues around Gobert. Small ball 5 on exasperates the problems faced."
"This year's Reggie Jackson IMO, guy is gonna ball out in the playoffs."
What's overlooked is that Reggie Jackson is on the Clippers and Russ HATES Reggie for how he acted in OKC.   When Reggie was in OKC he was talking about he should be the starting PG and he thought he as good as Russ and KD. Then when he forced his way out and tweeted some shit about crying tears of joy after getting traded.
"I imagine Russ and PG are still cool but I'm sure he's pissed at Kawhi for teaming up with PG instead of him.  Also, Reggie Jackson is on the Clippers and Russ hates Reggie soooooo much."
&gt;So Clippers fans are just going to forget how trash Reggie Jackson was for most of the year?  Asinine
Lol I dont think this has anything to do with reggie jackson or Beverly. This has everything to do with the clippers being the clippers. Same way Lebron was going to LA and there wasnt a chance in hell he played for the clippers.
Reggie Jackson has really come a long way &lt;3
reggie jackson wasnt trash throughout the year at all… did you watch all our games? his role definitely fluctuated but he had huge games in the regular season and was a flamethrower from 3 the whole season
"&gt;your attack against me  you asked how I felt, I told you how I felt.  what you do with that is up to you but trying to argue with me about why my feelings are wrong just isn't it.  &gt;You've called me out before though and you're doing it here again, and I honestly don't know why  it's because you pointlessly split hairs.  look at the start of this discussion.  what does Ballmer being able to afford Russ's contract have to do with wanting him vs Reggie Jackson?  that added nothing to the discussion except to just manufacture an insincere opening to start an adversarial discussion.  it's not a question of whether he has the money, the only question is whether the fit would have worked and also whether the Wiz would want the salaries the Clips could send back.  So I tried to steer the discussion in that direction.  But the whole reason the discussion started in the first place was kind of a needlessly adversarial comment by you.  I've seen you try to do that with so many comments made by users with Clippers flairs, not just me.  Any thread where a Clippers flair makes a comment about a Lakers player, even if it's fairly innocent, there you are making some irrelevant point trying to start something.  &gt;If you see someone say something you disagree with, don't you respond?  the thing is you do this even when the other person isn't really making a point at all, they're just making a throwaway comment.  you also do this when the point you're making doesn't really disagree with what the other person is saying.  or when interpreting the comment in a slightly less adversarial way could have avoided the argument in the first place.  you go out of your way to look for a fight whether the other person was looking for one or not."
"Heh, everyone is looking at this in terms of history with Kawhi and PG. But I think he's afraid of how powerful Reggie Jackson, Starting Point Guard has become."
"Depends on the team.   On a bad team I'd like Westbrook no question.   On a team with an established superstar:  If I'm already capped and only have 1 spot and have a lot of shooting already - Westbrook.   If I got 2 spots can get a 33m/yr player and Reggie Jackson then I'd do that.   If I'm on a team with two other stars tho and no shooting, I'd take RJax."
"&gt;reggie jackson was good for all of last year.  Nah he really wasn't. He was bad at the start, iso'd a lot unnecessarily, was laughably bad on defense. Starting March, however, he transformed into a match-winning player suddenly, and thankfully his form carried into the postseason."
I'll take reggie jackson and the extra $34 million cap space.
Reggie Jackson for a quarter of the amount sounds brilliant. No team is clearing their books and trading 2/3+ players for a 33 year old Westbrook.
"westbrook is better, but reggie jackson was good for all of last year. he shot 43% from 3 on 4.2 attempts per game, wasn’t just a playoff hot streak. will he be as good this year? I don’t know, but he was good in the regular season as well as post season"
"So Clippers fans are just going to forget how trash Reggie Jackson was for most of the year?  No way in hell I’m taking Reggie Jackson over Russel Westbrook… Reggie had a great playoff run for sure but come on… Russel as the third option? He’s still a heck of an athlete that wins games… Russel on the Clippers with Kawhi, PG, Morris, and Batum on the 3 point line would kill…"
Just wanted to say never forget Reggie Jackson saved his legacy vs the Grizzlies in 2014
Reggie Jackson and giving it his all  First time for everything
Reggie Jackson is so cool. He reminds me of Dave Chappelle's anchorman impression.
Big Government is the nickname Clipper fans gave Reggie Jackson.
"People get on him for ""not winning on his own"", but in those 4 years what exactly was he supposed to do?  In 2011 was it his fault that Dirk averaged 32.2 PPG on 70% TS in the WCF?  In 2012 was it his fault that LeBron had a superteam and Durant's 31 PPG on 65% TS(by far the best scoring numbers in the series) weren't enough, while Westbrook and Harden meanwhile had extremely inefficient series?  In 2013 was it his fault that they had traded away Harden and a young Reggie Jackson was his second option against a very good defense when Westbrook went down?  In 2014 was he supposed to beat a team that demolished prime LeBron in the Finals?  You can get on him for the 2016 WCF all you want, but I don't see any other player who would have done better in 2011-2014 except Jordan  2011 and 2014 he lost to the teams that LeBron, the second best player of all time, lost to  2013 winning the West with no help is basically impossible, it's pretty much only done in the East(even Dirk's role players played well, while Kendrick Perkins did Kendrick Perkins things in 2013)  2012 was he supposed to do better than 31 PPG on 65% TS, literally the most efficient 30 PPG Finals of all time until he broke that record himself in 2017?  People will disagree but I don't think anyone would have done better in the same circumstances  Contrast this to the 2015 Warriors who played an injured point guard in every round, do you really think OKC loses if Wade and Bosh got hurt?"
Reggie Jackson that man CLUTCH
reggie jackson
I want a full compilation of Reggie Jackson 1on1s from this past post season. Dude looked like he could absolutely get passed and beat anyone no cap
tbh I always thought reggie jackson was a bum until I watched that series... he balled out. Great effort on both sides.
Dude did not deserve Andre Drummond and all those miserable years in Detroit.. I’m really happy for Reggie Jackson.
"Reggie Jackson / Eric Bledsoe / Paul George / Marcus Morris / Ivica Zubac  Honestly, seeing it laid out like that...this team goes from title contender to not scary in the slightest.  Like there's a chance the team doesn't make the playoffs if Kawhi doesn't play at all.  Am I crazy for thinking that?"
"completely made up. He had 3 turnovers in the entire series (to 11 assists over 40+ minutes) which was pretty much the same a:to as the previous series.. the reason he didnt play is because reggie jackson was demanding 30+ mins a night (with his play), terrence mann was playing a ton, kennard played well, and pat bev was ahead of him in the rotation plus with pg playing the 2 there just werent any minutes for him"
"It seems like a lot of players these playoffs did. It was awesome to see.  Cam Payne, Bobby Portis, Reggie Jackson."
"Reggie Jackson was the player that I didn't expect to show out like he did in the playoffs. It felt like everytime he pulled up from 3, it was going in"
After that playoff run last year Mike Breen going 'Reggie Jackson... it's good! Reggie Jackson' got stuck in my head
&gt;Reggie Jackson brought his camera. He thought it was going to be a Zoom availability.  lol
KPJ went from being cut by the Cavs to being a center piece of Houstons future. Could also throw Aaron Gordon in there now that he has a defined role on a contender. Reggie Jackson as well.
Reggie Jackson
This is nothing new. KD even defended Reggie Jackson when he was being childish on the Thunder; only to roast him when he got traded
"Only an elite offensive player for 2 years? Bullshit. The stats have said Jokic has been an elite offensive player literally since he started playing in the NBA.  He was also the first team All NBA center 3 years ago so you're full of shit.  Last - this idea that Kawhi had to carry the Clips offense more than Jokic had to carry the Nuggets in the playoffs is straight up *wild* considering, again, PG13 exists, and was healthy. PG averaged 29 against the Mavs so is he also an all time offensive player? 9.5 boards and 5 apg too (slightly more than Kawhi did on that front). Reggie Jackson meanwhile averaged 18 ppg against the Mavs.  For comparison, the Nuggets next highest scorers against the Blazers after Jokic (again, 33 ppg) were MPJ - 18 ppg, and Monte Morris, 15 ppg and Aaron Gordon, 12 ppg vs Portland. Everyone else was 10 ppg or below for the Nuggets vs Portland. Not a single other player averaged double figures. Marcus Morris averaged 13 ppg for the Clips, Terance Mann 10, to go along with those PG + Reggie Jackson. It's not a close comparison here as to who had to shoulder a larger burden on offense. Not even a little close."
"I mean that's pretty damn debatable - it seems rather like you either dont watch much Nuggets if ever, or you just believe scoring is all that matters for offense given you just keep saying he scored many points. But - Jokic is one of the two best midrange shooters in the NBA statistically (along with one Kevin Durant - this has been the case since Jokic entered the league as well), and shoots from there quite frequently (and while I'm not going to go track down where their shots came from overall in the playoffs, in round 1 Kawhi shot 40 3s over 7 games - Jokic shot 35 3s in 6 games - the point is that your ""paint vs midrange"" is not really that significant, given that Jokic was literally the team's only person capable of regularly handling the ball at times in the playoffs, and how much each team sold out to stop him - all of his shots are contested too, for the most part). So, all that to say: Against Portland Jokic averaged 33 ppg on 53/43/92, without the Nuggets whole regular guard rotation except Monte Morris, and without his second best player. I'd argue 33 ptspg on those efficiency numbers with only one of your top 4 guards playing &gt; 30 ppg with a fully healthy roster, personally. Also worth noting that the Mavs have uh... exactly zero good defensive players to put on Kawhi and PG. The Blazers meanwhile matched Nurkic to Jokic's minutes and it's worth noting that when Nurkic played last year, Portland defended at a top 10-11 level. So there's that.   Jokic wore down against the Suns shooting very poorly compared to all his previous playoff series, but still averaged 25 ppg... and while Will Barton played the last 3 games of that series he was clearly still hobbled, and the Nuggets still were without Murray and their best perimeter defender in PJ Dozier - the Suns basically loaded up to stop Jokic because the Nuggets had literally no one else who could handle the ball and reliably punish them.   Jokic and Kawhi's assist numbers in round 1 are also in fact nearly identical, except one of them was playing without his second best player and the rest of his starting and backup guard rotation.  OH! And while Jokic's efficiency went way down against PHX, Kawhi's also went down against Utah. He didnt shoot 60% for this whole playoff run. Against Utah he averaged 27, 7 and 4 on 50 (still really good!), 33 (much less good), 84.   That all said, I'd be curious what Kawhi might average without PG13, Reggie Jackson, Terence Mann, and whomever else would work as the last guard. He might average a similar amount of points. Might even still be really efficient. I'd be willing to bet not as efficient though, and likely with fewer assists. But it's not even a fair comparison really given the Clippers were *healthy* in the playoffs, until Kawhi got hurt.   Last - Steph Curry conserves his energy on offense? WHAT? Have you ever uh... watched Steph? Or did you mean on defense? If you meant on defense, that might be true (though I dont think in the playoffs you can really do that), but *we aren't talking about defense*. Literally just offense."
Eric Bledsoe--&gt; Marcus Banks  Paul George--&gt; Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard--&gt; Gerald Wallace  Nic Batum--&gt; Rudy Gay  Serge Ibaka--&gt; Shawn Kemp  --------------  Marcus Morris--&gt; Al Harrington  Reggie Jackson--&gt; Robert Pack  Shawn Kemp and Scottie Pippen would be an amazing duo
"Is Jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neal and Bogdanovic clearly better than Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann, Batum and Morris?   I'd say they're pretty even.  Clippers had the two best players in the series."
Schroeder was supposed to take over after Jeff Teague. And Reggie Jackson was supposed to be the new Harden-lite in OKC.
"As a Mavs fans, I'm tired as hell from swing the clips. But I respect the hell out of Reggie Jackson. He showed"
"Man Clips should fuckin love the Pistons. We basically gifted you your current team!  - Took Blake Griffin off your hands, one of the worst contracts of all time, which freed up cap space to sign Kawhi   - Gifted you a first round pick in that trade, which became Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and later packaged for Paul George  - Drafted and developed Luke Kennard, gave him to you for pennies  - Developed Reggie Jackson for 5 years, bought him out so you could have him for free  - Created &amp; developed a defensive intensity within a key part of your coaching staff in your WCF run (Chauncey)    If yall win a ring the Pistons should get one too, just sayin 🤷🏾‍♂️"
I should also mention last year I watched a ton of clippers because paul george and reggie jackson were super fun to watch. Lot of stuff to learn from pg
"Two way star who's playing the best ball of his career.  Excellent narrative of taking a team with low expectations because their second best player is maybe Reggie Jackson, and carrying them into a high seed in the west.  If the Clippers get a top 3 seed, PG is definitely a top 5 mvp candidate."
Reggie Jackson? More like Leeroy Jenkins with those heatcheck threes while ice cold holy shit
Reggie Jackson was heat checking that whole quarter 😂
goddamn east coast reggie jackson
"The Clippers scare me. They're red hot and Reggie Jackson has been fantastic. It's also going to tough to pull it off without so many core players in Vuch, PWill and Coby White"
reggie jackson was born in italy
Goggles Reggie Jackson  Headband Harden  Tim Hardaway Jr vs the Rockets
Reggie Jackson would like a word. And who is consistent on the Lakers outside of AD?
reggie jackson FEASTS. Zubac EATS anthony davis’ LUNCH.
Googles Reggie Jackson
"Completely agree with you my man, he’s still been positive about Detroit too and has even thanked us for giving him the opportunity last season. Still reps detroit which I actually respect. I remember spamming reggie jackson gifs in piston groups lol"
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
"I feel this isn't being talked about enough. In the last 2 calendar years, Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum and Eric Bledsoe all looked like they were on their way to being out of the league and now they're 3 of our best 5 players."
Oh yeah the jazz are mad at us all right. Good thing Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann owns the state of Utah
"Back in the day of creating my custom team in Madden, I’d always make these insanely bright green jerseys. Yalls jerseys remind me of them a lot, but they’re not quite as bright. I like them! I’m also an A’s fan and they remind me of their old jerseys a bit https://www.mitchellandness.com/reggie-jackson-1974-authentic-jersey-oakland-athletic-s"
"I mean Reggie Jackson had MVP Westbrook in front of him and still wanted to start over him doing all the locker room drama which led the Thunder to trade him away. So, it's not like this is a given.  Schröder was just a great guy on and off the court in OKC. Therefore a lot of Thunder fans wishing him nothing but the best."
idk man i was rlly betting on reggie jackson leaving the clippers but that didn’t happen. mavericks also rlly got no NEED to trade for wall but maybe an injury happens (hope on doesn’t but they’re part of the game) or maybe some wild shit with kyrie happens in like a multi team trade idfk😂😂i think ur right tho i doubt he gets traded but as a rockets fan i’m praying for anything
"I know the thing is head to head etc, and the freedom of movement is different in eras. But the way defence was played in the 90s... I just don't see how the Warriors don't get open three pointers from 3-5 behind the baseline and make it splash. If they miss the Bulls win, but with three of the best shooters of all time, I just don't see it happening. Also Phil Jackson, albeit using Fisher as his coaching conduit showed that the triangle is not efficient enough an offence in the modern NBA. If both teams get transported to the beginning of the other's era, and are adaptations of that era, it's a different question. A 90s Steph probably doesn't shoot more than Reggie Miller. Draymond is probably on the bench somewhere because what the hell is a 6'5 man doing at center. Etc etc, but if you just superimpose the 2017 Warriors into 1993 or whatever, and they need to face the Bulls with one real scoring option, no real outside threat, and not a cold chance in hell they'd run enough plays through Bill Cartwright at Center to take advantage of the fact that the Warriors are undersized at when playing the death line-up - the Warriors win, probably in six. If you place the Bulls into 2017, not only do the Warriors win, but its not even competitive."
"right but it can still apply to most teams and most games. clippers were missing ibaka, morris, obviously kawhi, and reggie jackson had zero points in the first half which is unusual for him. i just see this “if a few more shots went down…” argument so often and it really feels like a cheap excuse"
him and reggie jackson have been my money pick ups off the waiver wire
Scheme is more important and harder to break  Elite on ball defenders are important but they can get switched off them. Look at how Luka torched the Clippers by attacking Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverly
"Bam is fantastic.  Robinson is really streaky.  Herro isn't a leading guy.   The rest of the Miami bench is ass.  Not sure how, but the Clippers have turned Reggie Jackson into a good player, are they going to do the same thing with Bledsoe?"
If they would ever decide on cyberpunk 2077 basketball DLC just facescan reggie jackson with glasses
I like how Reggie Jackson had 0 points in the first half and 22 in the second half
REGGIE JACKSON IS A GOD
Reggie Jackson looks like he just walked out the Pro-am on 2k22
reggie jackson has the greenest light in the nba. what an experience its been watching him play basketball this year lol
Reggie Jackson is playing his fucking heart out like it's game 7
Reggie Jackson is so bad. Still confused how he’s getting minutes
"Not necessarily the worst player, but I feel like Reggie Jackson has absolutely said this before putting up 14 points on 20+ shots lmao"
"Yeah now you got dudes like Reggie Jackson asking for ISO's to brick from 40 ft lol,  its sad but also funny."
Lots of guys are struggling with their shots to start the season. They're not all blaming the refs.   Reggie Jackson was shooting 31% after 5 games. Korkmaz was 2/18 last night. MPJ couldn't buy a bucket before his injury. Were they all blaming the refs?
Didn't this guy use to elbow Reggie Jackson in the face for rebounds lol.
so no one noticed Reggie Jackson dancing at the back lmao
that's a bad call.  kicking your leg out is supposed to be for the reggie miller kick out to the side.  jackson was fading backwards.  your leg kind of just sticks out in front of you on fade like that for balance.
Would you trade Reggie Jackson for Dame straight up?
"Rest of the lineup with Westbrook out was Reggie Jackson(13 PPG on 52.7% TS), Ibaka, Caron Butler, and Sefolosha with 20 minutes from Kendrick Perkins  The other top Western teams were the Spurs and Lob City Clippers  The Suns missed the playoffs with a 48-34 record"
You think the Warriors can keep Poole? If he keeps playing well I can see him leaving for a starting position. The situation reminds me of Reggie Jackson in OKC.
"Reggie ""Reggie 'Reggie Jackson' Jackson"" Jackson"
Are Reggie Jackson goggles prescription glasses?
If he could score on Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum then the Clippers wouldn’t be able to run 5 out and negate his defence in the first place
Reggie Jackson is what westbrick thinks he is
"The 3 pillars of our franchise.  1. A center who literally gets bodied by anyone (can't even post up Reggie Jackson). Super passive, but likes to scream at the refs. Can't make a pass to save his life.  2. A SG who likes to chuck the ball and offers very little elsewhere.  3. Another SG who is pretending to play PG. Streaky guy who is best suited for a 6th man role.  I would say life sucks as a Wolves fan, but life has always sucked so this is the norm. On the other hand, Terrence Mann is amazing. He took Karl's balls tonight. Neutered KAT."
"kawhi only missed the last two games &amp; in the last game terrence mann scored 39, reggie jackson scored 27, &amp; they shot over 50% from 3 including patrick beverley’s 4/4. they jus played out of their heads"
Plus pretty much every player who's played for us have had nothing but great things to say about the team and the city - only exceptions being KD and Reggie Jackson
Shoot PG too tho. And if either is out y’all can’t win a chip. Reggie jackson and Terrance Mann tho. Love them.
Can he block Reggie Jackson driving directly down his throat?
*Reggie Jackson makes a great defensive play /s
"and the turnover issues stemmed from not having Conley due to his hammy injury. could argue some of the defensive issues were because of his absence too, Reggie Jackson was doing anything he wanted to us  people always talk about Kawhi being out for games 5 and 6 but we got it to 2-2 with Mitchell on one leg and Conley out"
"Clippers aren't, it's Paul George 1v7 (5 opponents plus Reggie Jackson and Eric Bledsoe)"
"Ayee as a fantasy owner, finally got the Reggie Jackson game I needed!"
Wow. How was Reggie Jackson so wide open in the corner out of the time out
Reggie “Tunnel Vision” Jackson. Pass the ball up to PG
"Luke Nukem Nuke Kennard.  Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson."
"that zone was a carlisle creation and jason kidd kept it and uses it sometimes, maybe because the players are all familiar and comfortable with it  but I hate it, it rarely does anything good.   they have to abandon it for important possessions.   they do strange things like put their centers on the free throw line which leads to matador situations with boban and willy cauley stein.   not that WCS is good wherever he is on the floor, but why the free throw line  like there were some possessions in the nuggets game with boban playing way up the court dancing around there on the perimeter.  it looks so bizarre and I just think theres no way this can be effective.  clearly jokic doesnt respect it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpVz97fUbIs&amp;t=400s  just too easy for him.   and it was similar in the clippers series where kawhi or reggie jackson would see boban on the perimeter against him and just turnstile him, not scared at all that these short guys in the post are going to even try to get in his way"
Why isn't Reggie Jackson more involved? I thought he was on pace for a career season after the playoffs last year. I haven't gotten to watch a Clips game yet.
"How does your post reflect what is going on in LAC? Reggie Jackson showed capable playmaking skills in DET, and Bledsoe showed playmaking skills in PHO and other stints. This isn’t like they’re starting Beverly and Collin Sexton in the backcourt…"
"Funny, I seem to remember Kawhi Leonard playing 4/6 games and Reggie Jackson averaging 18 on well over 50-40-90 splits 🤔"
"Bruh Luka always asked for screens so he would get switched on Reggie Jackson. All of him and kawhi's one on one plays are on youtube, he basically missed all his shots all over him"
reggie jackson going for dem pizza hut book it points!!
Jalen Suggs is Reggie Jackson with a fade.
"Oh, not THE Reggie Jackson."
Yeah gimme all the Reggie Jackson interviews. He's candid and interesting to listen to
Also currently reading the Count of Monte Cristo.  What a good fuckin book!  Reggie Jackson is a cool dude.
If Terrance Mann has a big game and goes missing it’s safe to assume Reggie Jackson entombed him beneath the Staples Center
"They are some of the best at what they do though, that guy is probably referring to bums like Reggie Jackson"
"Different roles.   Harell did this with the Clippers before falling out of the playoff rotation because of his obvious flaws, Morris on the Knicks was allowed to chuck up shots but is the 4th option for the Clippers, Reggie Jackson went from the 1st option in Detroit to the 5th option in LA, Kennard went from a starter with freedom on offense to a spot up bench player, Bertans has actually been pretty bad for the past two seasons, and was better overall on the Spurs, Wall was in his prime in the east and has been too injured and is now worse, Kuzma put up 19 ppg in the west before becoming a role player and then getting the freedom to shoot more on the Wizards, and DeRozan was just as good on the Spurs as on the Raptors.  It's not as simple as just switching conferences."
Reggie Jackson special shooting 4 / 20
"True but Baze ran himself into a PG and Reggie Jackson double as well. If we're gonna get doubled anyway, I'd rather have it in Shai's hands"
"Yeah, people are making tank jokes, but we actually wanted to win tonight. You can tell by the way we played Muscala and Kenrich Williams a lot tonight with SGA/Giddey; even though their stats don't look great, they're the veteran leaders of the team and play the smartest basketball. They're the players we play when we want to win.  Unfortunately, Dort was out and Darius ""I'ma go 1v2 with PG and Reggie Jackson with one minute left on the clock"" Bazley was out there with those four instead.  This wasn't a tank loss. This was a ""young team falls apart in the fourth quarter and also why is Darius Bazley taking the ball away from SGA and Giddey"" loss."
"Iono who this Barry guy is but this is something I made a long ass time ago.   &gt; That was obviously a case where they missed on a defensive rotation  What rotation? If they wanted   to rotate they'd have to hard double Mark Jackson and then play 4 vs 3.   &gt; It was more so like this wayy more often: Smits vs Ewing (used the same teams for you):  Your first few possession show the impact of illegal defense rules already. Two guys who can't shoot that must be guarded according to the rules. In modern defense they don't have to chase Ewing around, they can simply put one man right outside the lane to guard the paint and they try to commit a hard double right as he tries to shoot.   2nd possession again shows even more clearly Smits not having to worry about a help defender behind Ewing because of the illegal defenses.   3rd possession is similar to 1st possession but even more obvious how hard doubling compromised 90s defenses. This is how Reggie Miller had 6 feet of open space."
I'm just happy it was MVPG and not Reggie Jackson who fucked us  PG balled out. Shai balled out. I still see this as a W
I started the game rooting for the clippers (love pg and reggie jackson) but at some point I stopped. These guys didnt deserve the win. Are they playing every game this bad? This is the first clippers game I watch this season.  congrats on the win!
"That way Reggie embraces George tells me that Jackson has been struggling in some way, and PG has supported him, and his support is appreciated."
The second highest scorer on the team was Reggie Jackson who also shot 5/17
"i hate our fucking offense. all we do is fucking pg/reggie iso and jack a bunch of threes.  also: one, it's pg trying to facilitate when he below average. two, our second best player is reggie fucking jackson. three, injuries. four, if pg struggles, it's ovah"
"dunno what's going on with Reggie  Like the last possession that OKC deflected. PG and Luke we ping ponging passes to each other and then they'd flare out once the ball left. But every time they flared, jackson hadn't moved so they run into his defender.   Or a few possessions before, jackson passed it go a curling PG and just stood there so PG couldn't run to the baseline."
Reggie jackson looks so uninterested in playing basketball right now. Then add on how trash Bledsoe is. My goodness. Lue really needs to shake up the starting lineup.
"Reggie Jackson has turned back into Reggie Jackson, plus Ibaka and Morris injured. Bledsoe washed."
"Reggie Jackson came down to Earth, he was godly during playoffs."
"No Kawhi is the obvious answer, but they’re also missing Morris and Ibaka who can provide scoring boosts. Plus, Reggie Jackson is not only human but onto an abysmal start to the season."
With Marcus Morris actually playing and Reggie Jackson playing some of the best basketball of his life.
"I'm a different guy from the one who said the Jazz have a ""terrible construction.""  I think the Jazz have a very good roster construction, but that there's a clear weak spot that the Jazz have not yet been able to solve. You don't play effectively against great teams like the Bucks, who run through a wing/forward, nor do you beat the Clippers with Kawhi twice, unless you have one of the best rosters in the league. You just also don't surrender two 50 point games in the same series to Jamal Murray, or 39 points to Terance Mann, or three 20 point games from Reggie Jackson, unless you have a weak point."
Reggie Jackson now showing his true colors
He’s not but neither is Reggie Jackson yet u had no problem making that comparison. The point I’m making is neither team has a real dependable pg. You literally bitch and complain about team construction and then try to hype up Eric Bledsoe. You wanna swap Seth curry for bledsoe so you can have a “true pg”? You’re gassing up random clippers scrubs to make it seem like embiid is doing some hard carry job. Just give it a rest and accept you got called out on some bs.
Funny you don’t mention Seth curry. Dude just give me a break. Fucking Reggie Jackson? Lmao. Go to the sixers sub if you wanna circle jerk about Embiid. The clippers don’t have any real talented pgs just like the sixers don’t. I’d take Seth curry over Reggie and bledsoe. Bledsoe has been passed around the league cause nobody wants his bum ass. Maxey and curry are better than either Reggie or bledsoe now that I consider it. So yeah real nice argument there. Good job not including Seth but including korkmaz to hype up your boy too.
"No such thing as unlucky, it’s not unlucky to miss open shots. Paul George is basically a superstar at this point and he has literally 0 help. Reggie Jackson wants to act like Curry pulling every shot he can"
"As a biased Thunder fan, the difference is guys like Reggie Jackson have a whole career to show they aren’t a star. Eric Bledsoe was bad all of last year. Luke Kennard was getting DNPs last year. These guys have career history that does not match up with last years playoffs"

What happened to Reggie Jackson? Dude was making everything in the playoffs last season.
"You’re right, Reggie Jackson 20 ppg soon come!"
Y'all needed bubble Reggie Jackson last year.
What happened to Reggie Jackson? He was so huge at the end of last season.
Reggie Jackson actually brought his 3PA down tonight with just 8. He averages 10 3PAs a game lol
Reggie Jackson and Bledsoe shot selection needs to improve
"OKC fans dubbed the 2014-2015 season the plagues of Egypt Season.   Our starting line up was Russ Roberson KD Serge Adams  We also had Reggie Jackson until the trade deadline. If I am remembering correct. KD, Russ, Ibaka, and Jackson started the season injured. There are a couple others I think I am forgetting. Russ and KD came back full strength around December only for them to be in and out of the line up the whole year. When we finally traded Jackson and got fully healthy in March KD got injured again. It was horrible. We missed the playoffs by one game on an Anthony Davis buzzer beater basically. It was the season from hell. To top it all off we got the 14th pick which ended up being Cam Payne. One spot behind Devin Booker!"
Somebody said if Reggie Jackson played 50 years ago the nba logo would be wearing glasses.
why does Reggie Jackson look like that one guy from the Dodgeball movie
The world has advanced beyond the need for Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is dookie
My brother doesn't even watch basketball and he's clowning on Reggie Jackson for using too many accessories lol.
LMAO put in Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is -17 while Mann is +14. Wow
Why start Reggie Jackson tho?
What the hell was Reggie Jackson doing
Clippers still refuse to put Kawhi or PG on Luka. So far i've seen Reggie Jackson on Luka and that's it. What a bunch of pussies.
How was the answer to the clips getting shredded on defense to play Reggie Jackson more lmao
Putting Reggie Jackson into the starting lineup seems like one of the worst changes you can make for the Clippers
Reggie Jackson looks like he is about to go skydiving
Oh no! Not Reggie Jackson!!!!
"Reggie Jackson, ouch"
LMAO TY LU IS STARTING REGGIE JACKSON
Strong agree that their supporting cast has gotten pretty overrated because people have overcorrected on the value of “shooting” and “theoretical ability to switch” at the expense of other things. Like I’m sorry but Marcus Morris is complete fools gold he’s not actually good. Ibaka also go overrated off this pre injury. Beverley is old. Kennard more fools gold people just looked at his PPG on solid TS% in det and assumed that must mean he’s good  DMC is barely still in the league. I like Zubac but he’s matchup oriented and has limitations. Batum is fine but he’s a 5th starter/3rd wing off the bench type nothing more. Reggie Jackson isnt more than a biannual exception type player   The fit is just bad with this roster too many overlapping skill sets and role players who are worse than they appear after PG/Kawhi
"Feel like from the group of:  [Patrick Beverly, DMC, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Zubac]  At best on a championship roster, you should have a maximum of 1 maybe 2 guys from this list. And they definitely should not be starters  We're not even talking about a chip roster though, this is a first-round problem at this point."
"Lol this is the worst idea ever. Mavs are like perfectly suited to carve up a zone, Luka can easily penetrate and kick to one of the Mavs 3 pt shooters, of which there are usually 4 on the court with him at any given time.  I would consider throwing out a PG/Kawhi/Batum/Morris/Mann lineup out there and switch everything, they haven't done it all year but switching in theory should not be that hard to execute with a lineup of veterans. The rim protection and help defense are both still kinda lacking but it might work. Lord knows letting Luka go to work against the likes of Beverley, Reggie Jackson, and Zubac clearly has no chance of working."
"I swear a random rotational guard off the bench always goes crazy in the playoffs every year lol. Off the top of my head of the games I watched I saw Nate Rob, Aaron brooks, Beno Udrih, Goran dragic, Reggie Jackson, and patty mills win a game for there teams in a series."
"Their defense just switches too easily allowing Luka to get whatever matchup he wants, usually Pat Bev or Zubac. Even then, he is consistently cooking even Morris, Batum, and Reggie Jackson  In game 2, they tried more PG and Kawhi on Luka, but PG honestly can’t guard Luka (I think Luka hit 4/4 on him when guarded by PG in the 1st quarter).   Kawhi is literally the only person that can slow down Luka, but even then, Luka isn’t completely stoppable, and the exertion of effort on offense and defense seems to get Kawhi gassed by the late game, [as evidenced here](https://twitter.com/nickvanexit/status/1397591375063961615?s=21).  Coupled this with the fact that the Mavs’ role players are just absolutely on fire and Luka’s ability to pass out of doubles to find the open man, the Clippers’ defense is just unable to slow them down, and there is legitimate concern that they have a lack of defensive chemistry on court from the multiple defensive breakdowns and miscommunications.  I’m unsure what they might do to change it up, but it really seems like they’re banking on the hope that the Mavs just start missing more, especially from what [Ty Lue has commented.](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1397443485448343552?s=21)  In my own opinion, they should honestly just cut Bev and Morris from the starting lineup and put in Rondo and Batum who are contributing more, and to also try adding Mann as an energy guy to replace Bev’s antics, but I’m not a Clippers’ guy so idk if others share the same sentiment."
Its called doing a reggie jackson.
"I would say Kawhi &gt; Luka. Look at who Kawhi is trying to carry, while Luka has been the least efficient player on his team. Stats back it up also.  Marcus Morris, Zubac, Reggie Jackson, Bev... holy shit they've been bad."
He knocked the stupid into poor ol Reggie Jackson lmao
"Compared to Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris I'd rather have rondo out there more. And ibaka is barely getting minutes too, he's much better defensively than Morris and we need someone big to guard porzingas"
"Kawhi made the team. He held the team ransom and forced them to either stay a. bottomfeeder or trade for PG. He also has a lot of input on who’s the coach.  Then he got Marcus Morris. Then he got Reggie Jackson for free. Then he got Batum for free. And Ibaka. And Rondo. He has all the help a superstar should need and he’s handpicked his team more than LeBron ever has.  The team is very talented and supposed to be the best ever defensively based on their expectations when they formed because of Kawhi. If he’s worthy of being one of the greatest defenders ever he needs to have a greater impact on the game because right now he’s not even a Top 10 defender by any means.   Once the opposing team sticks who he’s guarding in the corner, he’s useless, and the team has already a crazy offense so he can definitely afford to play defense and guard Luka more and make it harder for him to get easy switches  Although I do say a lot of it is on the coach he picked; Ty Lue. His switch everything emphasis is stupid and always has been."
Kd   Reggie Jackson   Patrick Beverly
"Lol what a spin moving that average salary loss to 1 million per player. You should work for Fox or CNN.  *Ron Artest - ($4,995,000)   *Stephen Jackson - ($1,700,000).   *Jermaine O'Neal - ($4,111,000).    *Ben Wallace-($400,000)   *Anthony Johnson -  ($122,222)   *Reggie Miller- ($61,111).    *Chauncey Billups- ($60,611).   *Derrick Coleman -($50,000).   *Elden Campbell	($48,888).    *David Harrison-(0).     Ya keep spinning while telling me I am presenting the weird take “average 1,000,000 per player” Lmao."
"2011 was ""just make the playoffs, win a game or 2 and ill be happy"" 2012 was ""just get past the celtics"" 2013 was ""THIS IS OUR FUCKING YE- oh fuck you roy hibbert"" and then somehow 2014 became ""we couldnt even get reggie jackson for shump and jr?!"" Its been a long ass road"
"Ty Lue is a trash coach with his starting lineup and rotations. It's obvious those cavs teams were really coached by lebron. He should be starting rondo, kawhi, pg13, batum, and ibaka. Morris should be coming off the bench and beverley should not be playing because he looks washed. Zubac is a bad matchup in this series so they should play Patterson or cousins or go small with Kennard. Also Reggie Jackson should not be getting 30 minutes a game, 10-15 should be the max he gets."
"Did you watch the game? Pretty big plays, he makes them consistently. He's one of the best defenders in the game there's no arguing against that. This sub just cherry picks plays.   Go back and watch the steal, picks Luka 1 on 1 iso then leads the fastbreak leading the a Reggie Jackson layup. But him scoring on him once with no help defense means he's a bad defender? ok..."
"Yeah, that is annoying as hell but that's all, especially when he guards Luka, he is just too big to begin with and way too smart... and it's too easy to beat, you just let someone else take the ball to front court and then abuse the shit out of him. When somebody is that close to you you don't even have to know how to dribble too well, you just go past them. I think Bev is their most useless and most overrated player at pg. No freaking idea why he and Reggie Jackson are both getting more minutes than Rondo... Rondo is way smarter than both and I would argue he is a better plater by a mile. He has his issues but man, i would play Rondo as long as possible and put Reggie in when Rondo needs rest... and Bev would be in for 10 mins at the most to get 6 fouls and annoy the shit out of everybody and get thrown out for some dumb shit. If they don't play Rondo 30 mins they ain't winning shit imo. He is their best floor general and play maker by far and he is not a bad shooter any more where people can leave him super wide open."
Make PG actually guard Luka instead of just switching and letting Luka bully Reggie Jackson
"Idk why luke kennard isn’t playing when all of pat bev, Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson are missing threes AND are getting beat on defense. If they’re all getting beat anyways might as well throw kennard out there for shooting"
Reggie Jackson has played 6th man minutes in 50 playoff games across 6 postseason runs. I think that’s a good middle ground. He played on teams not as shitty as the Pistons
The way Kleber just rolled on through Reggie Jackson. May as well get Oturu out there chucking shots up tbh.
"i'd say it's more than they don't have a center, they play reggie jackson 30 minutes a game, and theyre paying 100m in salaries to guys that either dont play or flat out suck"
"Thing is, they're forcing switches and getting the Clippers out of position to where their rotations are getting screwed up. On the that play Luka screamed ""you can't guard me"" to Pat Bev it looked like PG and Kawhi were guarding THJ and Maxi Kleiber on the perimeter, Reggie Jackson was guarding KP in the post and Mann was sagging a ton of Finney-Smith to help with KP...but Pat Bev and Kawhi both played Luka as if there was going to be a big rotate over to stop the penetration.  [https://streamable.com/urvby8](https://streamable.com/urvby8)"
"Really bad team defense. Starts with a bad reach by Beverley, compounded by a previous switch that looks like it left Reggie Jackson in the post guarding KP. Probably no one communicating on defense to know who was going to help on a Luka drive."
"Honestly when he's played this year he's actually been pretty good and his shooting percentages and per 36 numbers back that up. For whatever reason Ty Lue just doesn't give him consistent run. Can't be any worse than Reggie Jackson out there, maybe a little less off the bounce but still can facilitate some and a much better shooter and competes defensively."
"True, if they're going to give up uncontested threes then they have to try and match or outscore them. PG has done well scoring but he's been disappointing at the 3pt shooting right now. Same with Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris, they're way off compared to the regular season.  They've been competitive in just about every other category, so it really comes down to the 3s"
"You have theoretically one of the best lineups in the league to switch everything with in Kawhi-PG-Batum- Morris and either a PG (bev), a big (Ibaka probably) or just another wing (Tmann) but instead you choose to play zubac and STILL switch everything so Luka can literally hunt him on possessions (along with Reggie Jackson). Seems like awful defensive coaching to me"
"In the playoffs, I'd argue that your defence is as strong as your weakest link. Them dudes still playing Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverley."
Anyone else noticed that Reggie Jackson was laughing after a long pass turn over in last night's game? Those dudes at the clippers ain't it. They aren't serious about winning.
"Yeah but he also needs PG and Kawhi to score 70. Good luck getting that kind of offensive production while asking them to play against a guy Lukas size all game long. Also, he’s playing pat bev bench minutes. It’s pretty clear they’re only going to play him 20 minutes and it’s hard to play less. They’ve also tried Reggie Jackson and batum and anyone else on the roster and still have to put pg or kawhi on doncic for stretches"
"Problem with the clippers is outside of PG and Kawhi, is there is no great 3rd options or any shooters, Reggie Jackson, is their next best option. All other playoff teams have a big 3 or two stars surrounded by shooters, some even with a big 3 with shooters, Clippers don't have any shooters they let lou willams, shamet, greene, all go and we are seeing that 2 players can't get it done alone."
"Because people are more interested in narratives about Luka vs Kawhi than ones about Reggie Jackson, and Stephen A. has no genuine opinions."
"Well, as great as they are, they aren't anywhere close to the playmaker LeBron is. That alleviates a lot of the pressure off of someone like Rondo. That's partly the reason Reggie Jackson is playing so much because Pat Bev is useless on offense outside of a spot-up.  As for the others, they all have something compromising them on the floor. Ibaka doesn't look completely right since the injuries. Zubac is their best big but he can get played off the floor on defense. Cousins can't move on defense and can't score enough anymore to offset it. Rondo is their only true playmaker and he struggles to guard the way he used to and can still be prone to not scoring enough for teams to not cheat off him. Kennard is probably their best shooter and he's finessed them for a crap ton of money just to get DNP's since he can't guard a stationary bike."
"So I'll actually disagree with this. They needed 30 points from Kawhi in the first half to even be within reach of the Mavericks, that's not fine.    If they had defensive options to slow down the Mavs, they should try them, but they don't. So they should consider tilting as much into offense as they can in the 1st half or even first 3 quarters and just try to go toe to toe with Luka with Kennard/Reggie Jackson/Rondo/Mann/Whomever while Kawhi coasts so he can score 15 in the 4th when they insert their best defensive lineup against a hopefully fatigued Luka."
"He would do a lot better of a job than reggie jackson, that is for sure"
And play who in his place? Reggie Jackson should play 9 minutes a game in the playoffs and rondo ain’t gonna do shit rat bev can’t do.
"Play kennard Mann and ibaka, no Beverly and only a little Reggie jackson"
"Bro I don’t know why but I hardly seen Kawhi and Paul George guarding Luka. And they had 6’1 guards on him like Pat Beverly and Reggie Jackson. If the Clippers want to change the tide of this series, either PG or Kawhi have to permanently take the assignment of Luka"
"I'd happily take a contested stepback 3 over leaving Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Morris, etc. on an island lmao. The idea that it's just completely impossible to get over the bone crushing screens by such monstrous brickhouses like Kristaps Porzingis and Maxi Kleber is also funny; they ain't Steven Adams or Zach Randolph bruh."
The clippers are doing a lot of switching and I don't think they have the personnel for that.  You really need 5 solid versatile defenders and they usually have like three on the floor.  I think they need to try to chase over some screens.  Reggie Jackson or zubac guarding Luka is just never going to work.  Also outsider perspective I haven't seen Kennard at all and Mann only a few minutes.  I think those guys should be playing over Reggie Jackson at least.  I really don't like anything they're doing honestly.
They really aren't talented on paper. Zubac doesn't do much. Beverly is a horrible playmaker. Reggie Jackson is also amongst the worst playmaking point guards in the NBA. Kennard doesn't play. Ibaka is decent. Morris is okay.
I honestly think that's the Clippers' biggest problem. Like Kawhi and PG are average playmakers at best. Lowry was great and the Spurs' passing is practically unmatched. Reggie Jackson and Pat Beverly might be the worst playmaking point guards in the NBA
Reggie jackson isn't much better than him defensively and Kennard is a much better shooter. I don't see why he can't give a solid 15-20 min off the bench.
I saw reggie jackson guarding KP in the paint last night and the mavs scored without exploiting that soooooo that might be the problem
"I was wondering, who's their 3rd best player? Reggie Jackson? Rondo??? You're putting a whole lot of faith in Kawhi(fine) and George (uh-oh) when there is not backup plan."
"Spent the whole season vacillating between   1 - Kawhi and PG are studs, wings who can shoot and defend are the toughest thing to find and theyve got the best ones.  Some lead guard and big man will come up and they’ll be fine.  And   2 - Are they starting batum *and* reggie jackson?  Arent they fully healthy rn?  Ouch."
"I mean, it's still Kawhi and PG. The baffling decision is continuing to go with Reggie Jackson/Pat Bev/Zubac over Rondo/Ibaka/Cousins"
Holy shit you just made me realize Reggie Jackson is seriously the clippers number 3. They're dead.
reggie jackson has been an awful defender... atleast the other can can shoot which is needed.
Why did the closing lineup have Pat Bev and Reggie Jackson
"It’s maddening. Cuz who are they guarding otherwise? Richardson? Brunson? Kleber? Let those guys have to beat you, and even then, Reggie Jackson Beverley etc can handle those guys better"
The defense on Luka is not working. Down the stretch they kept switching Beverley onto Luka he just went in and scored. Why not have PG and kawhi guarding point of attack and when the screen comes for Luka the two of them switch. Luka still hit shots over kawhi and pg but it wasn’t as easy as him taking Beverly to the basket.   Cuz then on the switch kawhi or pg had to come help Beverly anyway and then Luka dished to hardaway for easy 3. Idk. Those 2 guys should be guarding up top. Not anyone else. Not Reggie Jackson Beverly Mann Morris etc etc.   Also play someone else over Morris. Play ibaka lol
"What’s crazy to me is how easily they’re allowing Pat Bev/Reggie Jackson/Luka’s favored matchup to get switched onto Luka.   This happened in game 1, right?   I mean I saw them pre-switching to try and nullify it for a bit. But Mavs countered by clearing PG/Kawhi’s (whoever out of them wasn’t defending Luka) man to the weakside, which then left Bev/Jackson in a switched-on-a-screen situation again.   Where is Ibaka? Isn’t Zubac a little heavy footed to be playing this series?   Why isn’t Rondo playing more? Didn’t they trade for him for these types of games?   Don’t get me wrong I’m pulling for the mavs here but I’m curious as to where the adjustments are? Lol"
I mean shooting 53% from 3 looks lucky but anyone who's watched like 5minutes of the game knows that them letting reggie jackson guard Luka on a couple of possessions is an easy L
It’s funny now because last year everybody was shutting on us for missing out on Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson. And here we are giving Drummond big playoffs minutes and he actually produced
"I said this last year and it’s coming true again.  Basically the way our offense is setup, it’s setup to attack the Clippers on switches, and  we have guys who can both spot up, attack close outs, and create off the dribble, which creates more complex rotations the Clippers have to make, and to further exacerbate that problem, we are making Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, Zubac, Ibaka, Batum have to do it.  Clippers best defenders are Kawhi, PG, and Pat Bev.   It also helps we have a hybrid Harden/Lebron player who with both his passing and scoring threat can exploit all the gaps and mistakes in a defense.  A player Who can read the modern NBA game PNR with Generational Basketball IQ.   This is why they are down 0-2. The Clippers attempt to pre switch the PNR hasn’t quite worked out because Luka just resets the angle for the screen or has another player the clips have to pay attention move to spot the Clips can’t close out hard."
"Thanks you. I feel like no one this sub watches the game. Saying clips need floor leader, Reggie jackson sucks, etc... The problem why the clips are down 2-0 is Lue defensive scheme. He is insistent on switching just because it worked last year in the bubble. Guues what Ty??? Luka got better and so did rest of mavs"
"I know it's easy to hate on the Clippers - I hate on them regularly. And I am also happy to see them down 2-0 in this series.  &amp;#x200B;  But I don't really think this is their ""fault"". I think Luka is just the best player in this series and the Mavs are just good as the Clippers are if not better. The Mavs were hurt the first half of the season and totally out of sorts. They could easily have been the 2-3 seed in a normal year. If this were, say, the 3/6 matchup with the Mavs at the 3 then we probably wouldn't be discussing things the way we are now.  &amp;#x200B;  Are we sure the Clippers are a better team than the Mavs? I really don't think so. Luka is clearly the best player, and even if you think PG is a better player than KP, the rest of the rosters don't even compare.  Do you like anyone on this Clippers roster outside of Kawai or PG?  &amp;#x200B;  Kennard? Morris? Jackson? Beverly? I don't think this is a good team at all. These dudes have one foot out the NBA door and the other wedged into the Shanghai Sharks bench.  &amp;#x200B;  I think THJ, Richardson, and Kleiber are better than anyone 3 - 15 on the Clips and maybe even Finney-Smith too. Hell, I might take Jalen Brunson over Batum, Beverly, or reggie Jackson at this point.  &amp;#x200B;  Basically this is Kawai and PG and trash vs Luka and good role players. And Luka is the best player in the series.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't get me wrong. I hate the Clippers. But I don't blame them for being down in this series. They aren't the better team."
They need Cousins and Ibaka playing more. Mavs were killing them on the boards and don’t have an answer for Porzingis. I also think Rondo needs more minutes. And no Reggie Jackson or Batum. Shorten the rotation.
he shouldn’t be starting on a championship aspiring team anymore. But the clippers have a shit reggie jackson and rondo(play him more lmao)
reggie jackson is like pgs best friend fyi..
His agent is the same as Reggie Jackson and Paul George's.
It looks bad because they don't play him. He was a productive player in detroit but they play reggie jackson instead for some reason.
"Tyronn ""Overrated"" Lue is really playing Pat Bev and Reggie Jackson over Playoff Rondo."
Reggie Jackson did real good and has been solid. Did y’all take the regular season off? We’ve been through this before
"Marcus Morris Sr., Reggie Jackson and Patrick Beverly. Pick 1"
I get that he's a really limited defender but at least play him over Reggie fucking Jackson. Jackson also offers worthless defence but at least Kennard is a good passer
Reggie Jackson is a pretty good backup guard
"His rotations as just horrible, Reggie Jackson shouldn’t be playing at all"
"As an honest Clippers fan, I speak for the fan base when I say this franchise is in shambles. We’ll never be great &amp; a rebuild is our only solution. We need to trade Kawhi, PG &amp; Rondo for draft capital to build around our best player, Reggie Jackson. Tyrone Lue is not good enough to be our coach. Shame on you Steve Balmer"
ty lue played reggie jackson in crunch time of a playoff game tonight.
I don’t get it... Surely he’s worth a shot? Like why is Reggie Jackson getting 30 minutes?
Lue has been terrible. Why is Reggie Jackson guarding Luka in the clutch? Why not bring Ibaka if KP is on the floor?
This man really left one of the greatest defensive teams of all time only to be on the floor with Nic Batum and Reggie Jackson in clutch time of a playoff game lmaooo
"Their roster is horrible, Morris, Beverly, Zubac. These guys aren’t starters for a championship team, playing Reggie Jackson serious minutes. On the front office."
"Nothing sums up this Clippers team better than Reggie Jackson bricking a three, Kawhi clawing the rebound just for Jackson to brick another. Lol.   Kawhi can’t win with these cats"
"Pat bev, Terrence Mann, and Reggie Jackson in crunch time is pretty sad"
What's with the sunglasses Reggie Jackson is wearing?
Reggie Jackson really needs to trade in those glasses for a pair of RexSpecs
Reggie Jackson and Mann are playing well too
Lmao what even is Reggie Jackson tbh
Mavs gotta win the Reggie Jackson minutes
"ik but kawhi is way too efficient from the mid range. I rather have reggie jackson/rondo force them to make a play and cover the corners, than have kawhi 1 on 1 on offense. The idea is to gas out kawhi but once hes gotten going, kawhi way too efficient with his shots."
I don’t understand how the clippers are such a bad defensive team relative to their personnel. They have capable defenders everywhere (ignoring reggie jackson).   Is Lue’s scheme really that bad?
Luka should have shot that.  The help was reggie Jackson lol.
Reggie Jackson is the off brand Falcon lmao
Game 4 against the Thunder in 2014 was pretty great too. Most Clipper fans like to forget about it though cause then it reminds us of choking away an 8 point lead with 40 seconds left in game 5 that would’ve given us a 3-2 lead. Still can’t believe they missed a clear foul on Reggie Jackson AND gave the ball back to Thunder after that review.
"While Kenny “the jet” Smith is a great analyst, I don’t think many consider him in the goat conversation.   Reggie Jackson was pretty solid with the pistons and while he would be the goat high school player in many states, he isn’t sniffing this conversation.   Jason Williams is the goat for nasty street all stuff and I’m glad you included him.   Anthony Davis is the goat of street clothes, not basketball.   Anthony Edwards, while being a top pick, hasn’t shown enough yet to be considered a goat.   And lastly, Benjamin Franklin? You actually may be right about that one. Dude deserves to be on Mount Rushmore."
Celtics even without Brown are better than that Pistons squad who's best players were Reggie Jackson and Drummond...  Bucks with a 2 time MVP and a DPOY are easily better than the Raptors lol  Embiid led Sixers are better than those Horford led Hawks then too..
Now show all the times he had Reggie Jackson in the paint and failed to capitalize too lol
"reggie gives some original insight and decent reads. I at least still find him entertaining, but im not watching lots of basketball.  he shits on mark jackson... for what thats worth."
"If you include all field goals then you'd see passes for him for open dunks, putbacks as well.  In midrange, KP got enough touches to show that he cannot even finish over Reggie Jackson."
"Luka didn’t want Porzingis to touch the ball in the series cause he would pump fake, drive, stop, freak out  with pressure from Reggie Jackson and turn the ball over"
KP wasn’t even that bad offensively. Yes he was passive but the Clippers have the aggressive wing defenders that force him into a floor spacing statue.   It was his defensive and rebounding effort that was butt shit. A little bit less giving up rebounds to Reggie Jackson or more altering shots at the rim instead of conceding easy layups would of probably made the difference in DAL advancing.  Dallas just needs a consistent alternate playmaker that can give Luka a break. Someone that can play 25-30MPG and reliably create offense off of P&amp;R or isolation. Luka is literally doing everything for the offense every play. If KP can just contribute SOMETHING defensively people should be OK with him jacking up a shit ton of 3’s - I mean it is the calling card of the entire offense.
"Reggie Jackson was by no means perfect, but he really seems more of an injury guy, than a guy who didn't maximize his potential.  Shit, it's sort of like a discount Rose. Not as good, not as injured, but a similar player with a similar trajectory.  People ignore that uninjured, coming into his prime, Reggie Jackson was really fuckin good at basketball."
Shooting 3s...... HAVE YOU EVEN WATCHED HIM PLAY IN THE SERIES? he couldnt post up reggie jackson. Give it up fam.
Give me Game 6 Reggie Jackson
"true but AG and MPJ are only better than reggie Jackson, Bogdanovic and maybe Ayton and Capela"
Is Reggie Jackson really the clippers third best player?
"As someone that’s only watched him with the Mavs, I respectfully disagree. He can dribble against actual centers, but anything shorter and he can’t do anything . We witnesses Reggie Jackson take away his airspace and KP could do nothing."
"How? Did you watch game 7? Series is tied, Luka kawhi and PG all play well, and it’s a close ass game. What was the difference? Tingus pingus didn’t show up, THJ wasn’t as good as he has been, and then on the clippers side, guys like Reggie Jackson and Terrence man stepped up big and made some big shots and net positive plays."
No we fucking weren't shitting on him. We were calling for more minutes for both T Mann and Kennard and Reggie Jackson Games 1 and 2 of the series. Basically asking for the rotation that landed the Clippers the most efficient offense in NBA history. Nobody wanted Bev playing and we're glad Lue adjusted.
"Bruh. You couldn't successfully post up 6'3"" Reggie Jackson, your handle is suspect so you ain't taking none but the worst perimeter defenders off the dribble, and your perimeter shot is streaky as shit.  I have no idea what this man wants Carlisle to do."
“Yea I couldn’t back down Reggie Jackson”
Move Denver down at least 1 spot.   Replace Reggie Jackson with Marcus Morris and maybe move them down as well
"I know this is about KP, but the coach NEEDS to go.  Luka is a great and very dominant player, but he needs to be coached.  We can see it in the way he responds to the refs, he is prone to frustrated outbursts. He is used to getting his way, maybe a bit too much so. He needs to be coached.   The relationship he has with KP is a great example - a better coach would have figured this out already.  Another great example was the way the game ended last night. After Luka hit a step back three, the score was 114-107, with just over 2 minutes left. The Mavs make the Clippers work hard on the ensuing possession and Reggie Jackson takes a deep three late in the clock, and unfortunately for the Mavs, he makes it. 117-107, 1:40 left. The Mavs have two timeouts.  With the clock and score, you MUST get a good shot, and quickly, on your next possession, or you will lose the game. Given that you have 2 timeouts left, you must take one here. Carlisle doesn't take the timeout and Luka dribbles for 20 seconds, unsuccessfully trying to lose Kawhi, and winds up taking a contested midrange fadeaway that he bricks. Game fucking over.   Simply cannot have that in game 7. Completely unacceptable.  Need a coach who doesn't mind ruffling the feathers of the star, if that means his team will be in a better position to win.   If the Mavs don't figure this out, they will waste Luka Doncic."
"Pg/kawhi  on kp didn't happen much in the last two games though. Even when Reggie Jackson is on kp, he doesnt look to post up and mavs also dun look for him. That part I don't understand."
Reggie Jackson better than Marcus Morris?
He couldn’t back down 6’2” Reggie Jackson or Rondo in the series. Regularly settling for face up jump shots. Serious waste of height.
"I think they looked better against the mavs this year over last year. Kawhi was more locked in and PG was good. Role players like shithead Reggie Jackson, Mann, and shithead Morris stepped up when they needed to."
"What. PG had 28/12/6 in game 2 on pretty good shooting. Reggie Jackson had 15 on 12 shots .The clippers shot 54% as a team and 39% from 3. What do you mean Kawhi didn't get much help?  The Clippers dropped 120 that game, I'm pretty sure offense wasn't the problem lol. The Mavs role players were great that game and that's why they won. I think it's been pretty clear that the team who gets more help wins the game."
"reggie jackson was hitting some insanely clutch deep threes, completely stopped the mavs momentum"
We had Blake Griffin and now Kawhi and the great Reggie Jackson. We got plenty of things 😌
"Andre Drummond will be a perennial all star and Reggie Jackson will make multiple all star teams.  Dre’s ass and Reggie proceeded to get injured each season after his first (very good) full season as a piston.  The Dre one really hurts cause I talked this man up like crazy. Said he’d be better than all your favorite centers. He’s cheeks y’all.  The Reggie one hurts cause from when he got traded here to his first full season the guy was putting up really good numbers and was like top 3 clutch players or something like that along with being the only PG in the East top 5 in every category. Then boom he got injured, came back too early and wasn’t that previous Reggie ever again."
ye THJ&gt;Reggie Jackson
"Reggie Jackson in the 1st quarter? (Yes he was starting, but damn did Reggie pop off this series)."
"forget PG, Reggie Jackson might've been the second best player on the Mavs if he was playing for them."
Reggie Jackson went nuclear in quarter 1 of game 6
"This was my favourite part of this series. Ty Lue does not give a fuck who you are. Bev getting paid 8 figures, too fucking small? Benched for minimum Reggie Jackson.  Rondo not playing well? Big trade deadline acquisition but second round T Mann and out of the rotation Luke earn the spot instead.  There are no entitlement minutes. A deep team is usually meaningless in the playoffs. But Ty is willing to select the correct players, regardless of contact or status.  Doc would let Zu and Bev get cooked for 5 games and we'd be in Cancun."
It was mostly Kawhi but not all. Reggie Jackson kept the Clippers afloat in the 1st half.
"They shot lights out cause Doncic was giving them wide open looks. Then then cooled off and in game 7 it came down to Paul George, Marcus Morris, Terence Mann and Reggie Jackson getting it done on both ends for Kawhi to close it out."
"In terms of shot percentages, Luka shot 42.1% against Kawhi, the only two lower were the 40.9% he shot against Batum and 40% against Pat Bev.  He did struggle to hit 3s when guarded by Kawhi though, 31.6% compared to 33.3% on Marcus Morris and 36.4% on Batum while he was 50%+ from 3 vs PG, Reggie Jackson, Zubac and Rondo"
"Exactly. Luka was phenomenal this series, but the narrative flip flopping around Kawhi and Luka hurt my brain this series. Through 6 games the mavs role players had massively out played the clippers role players. The clippers players weren’t hitting their shots(outside of Reggie Jackson) and everyone besides Kawhi, George, and Batum was getting cooked defensively. In game 7 People were talking about Kawhi and PG’s playmaking but the main thing they did was limit their turnovers, the other clippers started making their open shots. Through 6 games the clippers shot 35% from 3(despite shooting 41/42% from 3 the entire season). Kawhi was the only one shooting above his average. Expecting him to give you an efficient 30-40 a night while guarding the other teams best player the entire game is too much to ask of one player. Game 6 was the best performance of the series. This is the second year in a row the number one reason the clippers got out the first round was because Kawhi was sensational."
"People in the other thread really are defending him. He has no hustle at all, he plays like he is better than going hard. Guy was under the basket where he should have grabbed so many rebounds only for smaller Clippers players to grab them. He doesn't close out hard, sometimes he does not even put his arms up. What happened with his defense? he actually was a competent rim protector sometimes last year. Dude plays like straight up ass and has the audacity to complain. Beat Reggie Jackson in the post and fuck your center of gravity man. I need Stephen A Smith to yell about him. Guy makes me so angry."
"&gt; Gobert is not going to punish anyone on the block.  Offensive Rebounding. I dunno if you want Reggie Jackson trying to box him out.   In addition Gobert, does fill space well, which is why he gets a bunch of dunks.   There is another issue with switching other than Gobert.   It would be having Morris on Conley/Clarkson/Mitchell, which is an awful matchup for the Clips."
They don't win without Reggie Jackson going off.
"Yes! How about grab a fucking Rebound Kristaps! Block a shot at the rim, your eleven feet tall, how is Reggie Jackson cooking you on every play, be it on drives or just shooting over you"
"True, you really can't judge these things as they go. In hindsight, though, it made some really shitty circumstances to the team. Nobody really thought KP would fall off the cliff like that. Everybody thought this team needed defense, grit. Obviously the trade pieces they got to alleviate that deficiency didn't work. James Johnson got traded mid-season, KP lost his blocking ability, Richardson is trash outside of that good season in Miami.   Nobody thought Luka would leap up and become a good defender. DFS became an Iguodala-type swiss army knife. Dwight Powell stopped being a turnstile.   But that trade definitely reduced their offense terribly. At the time when Dallas needed any offense, they couldn't buy a shot to save their lives. Surely a 45% 3 point shooting guard named Curry who just shot 21 and 30 his last two games would've helped that team. We know Tim Hardaway jr couldn't handle 2nd option night in and night out, why not just run it the same as last year and have them share wing duties?   In theory, that trade would've worked. A defensive minded play-making guard might've worked well with Luka. But, in my opinion, recreating those Lebron-led teams would've been the way to go. Give Luka 2 reliable shooting wings, a defensive minded power forward, a sturdy center that wouldn't have problems posting up the likes of Reggie Jackson, and this team would've gone farther than Game 7 of the first round.   But I digress.  I just hope management has something in line to help Luka get out of this first round hump. Mike needed a couple of years getting out of Detroit and Boston's shadows. Luka probably needs one more getting out of Clip's. It's a generational player's rite of passage."
"You aren't going to be featured when you are a 7'-3"" center who can't even post up Reggie Jackson.  Saying that, Luka does dominate the ball an absurd amount of time so it would be interesting to pair him with another actual star to see if his ball domination is out of necessity or that is just who he is."
"Right, but surely he can develop some sort of inside game? Getting muscled out of the paint by Reggie Jackson is unacceptable.   Hell, how bout a sky hook or baby hook? Seemed to work well for Kareem’s longevity. Like literally anything. He doesn’t need to be Shaq down there, but for the love of god make something happen down low every once in awhile. He’s 7’3 for Christ sake."
"Fair enough, but he should still be able to post up Reggie Jackson. That matchup should end in a Porzingis dunk or a foul 9/10 times."
"The injuries have hurt but his mentality I think is the frustrating thing   He didn’t seem to play with aggression even when given opportunities. There’s way more than height that goes into posting up, but multiple times he would have Reggie Jackson on him and just brick 15 foot fade aways. He did tip some passes but didn’t affect the game a lot on defense. Didn’t think he was getting into the mix with rebounds either"
"Jokic is the MVP of the 1st round, Kawhi was the best player.  Kawhi was out-worthy, but PG and Batum showed up big time in the Dallas series, and Reggie Jackson shot extremly well since he was put into the starting line-up.  Dallas lacked the depth to beat them and on the other hand Jokic played without Murray, Barton and PJ Dozzier against a healthy Portland team.  Also it is fair to say that CJ and KP underperformed, and a big WHAT IF they showed up, we would have been talking about Dame being the MVP of the 1st round and Luka the best performer."
SMH he can't back down Reggie Jackson... and the MF 7'3
"Ugh I hate watching these tall guys try and do it all. Shoot the long ball, dribble, pass, steal. There are very few bigs throughout history that can do it all and do it well. Dirk, Jokic, Giannis and Embiid (to an extent), and that's kinda it. The rest stayed in their lane and did it damn well.   If you're that big at least try and work the ball down low. God was it Reggie Jackson that KP wasn't able to post up? Work on your post game holy shit. Can someone force feed KP some cheeseburgers this off-season? It's like looking at a tall, white, starving African child. Of course guards 1/2 your size can you muscle you out of the point and make you settle for a bad shot.  I used to hate watching Yao Ming practice mid-long range jumpers... like DUDE YOU'RE 7'6 - take it inside and master the game around the rim. We don't need our team 7'6 mutant jacking up three's, you weren't brought here for that.  \--Stream of consciousness end--"
Reggie Jackson outscored him
Fuckin made Reggie Jackson look like a God damn DPOY candidate 😂
Someone clearly didn’t watch the series. He couldn’t even post up on guys like Reggie Jackson. He took a three in transition when we had a 2 on 1 fast break. He picks up his dribble every time he drives...
"I don't understand why people who clearly don't watch the mavs at all (or even follow them) during the regular season think they can out game plan an NBA head coach. KP couldn't post up reggie jackson in games 1-3, not could he post up anyone else during the regular season. The dude weighs the same as a wet graham cracker. You're right Marcus Morris vs KP in the post is a mismatch, but it's wildly in the favor of morris."
"I can't agree with this more.   I'll use Detroit as an example since that's one of the two teams I follow closest.   Between 2008 and 2015, we literally had seven different coaches.   That's an average of one per year.  That was the end of the 'contending' phase and the first five year of the rebuild.  Since the rebuild began, we had a lot of solid young talent come in and brought in some free agents. We had Chris Middleton, and Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond and Josh Smith. Brandon Jennings. Tobias Harris. Morris. Caldwell-Pope. Reggie Jackson. Kennard.  Ilyasova.    I'm certainly not making a case that any combination of those guys was going to be winning a championship.  But when young guys like Middleton, Harris, Drummond, and Monroe come in, and show some real potential, but then they get jerked around form one coach to another. One coach has Monroe run plays (effectively) out of the post, the next give Jennings the ball without (big mistake), it just established this turnstile of losing.  Young guys just trying to get there to get a pay day. No cohesion.   That's why I appreciate that teams like the Sixers, even though they got rid of Brett Brown, took the time to bring a player development guy in and just gave him 5 or 6 years without question."
"Fucking hated Reggie, Mark Jackson, the Davis “brothers”, Rik Effin’ Smits, Chris Mullins, etc. All of them."
The reality is unless Terrance Mann was starting there would always be someone huntable on defense. Credit to Lue for balancing the minutes well between Mann and Reggie Jackson. You guys genuinely do not win the series without those changes. Hopefully Ibaka can get healthy for you guys now
"Credit to Lue for identifying and fixing his lineup mistakes before it cost him the series.  Pat Bev and Zu were benched quickly when they became obvious liabilities and -despite being acquired specifically for a playoff run- I'm glad he recognized how little Rondo was bringing to the table this series.  I questioned his decision to give Reggie Jackson a lot of minutes when he was being hunted on defense, but he came through with a big Game 6 and hit a couple of huge bail out shots in Game 7.  His shot selection has been very questionable at times, but he's proven to be a valuable outlet option when Kawhi is getting aggressively double teamed.  Luke Kennard -who came up big this game- figures to be nothing more than a fringe rotation guy as long as Lue prefers Reggie's offensive contributions.  However, Terance Mann should absolutely be given some serious burn starting from the first game of the Jazz series."
"Reggie Jackson has been Steph. Not necessarily from range but if you think of the most absurd shot possible in a game, one you're sure he won't hit, he'll give you like 5 of those a night. I fuckin love the guy."
if we win the ship im buying a championship reggie Jackson jersey
what ppl dont realize is that reggie jackson was going to retire this year. PG and the team pretty much asked him not to retire last offseason. I wont be surprised win or lose if reggie jackson retires
"Yes he does need better conditioning, but have to consider Luka has to keep his foot on the gas from start. if he doesnt go all in from the beginning the mavs probably lose in a blowout and the game is pretty much over by halftime. Kawhi doesnt need to do that. PG played well, Reggie Jackson took some of the scoring load and the roster in general is better in that way. everybody gets tired if you have to carry such a huge load for practically all of the first 3 quarters."
"Great take.  As a clips fan I watched just about every minute of the series.  As a counter to your point, there was time when he would get Reggie Jackson on a switch. KP would be scared to back him down and just try to shoot over Reggie. Not a bad idea, but he’s gotta be more aggressive. KP also isn’t a great passer out of the double team. In fact I don’t think he’s great at handing doubles at all.  Maybe, just maybe, Carlisle knows his personnel. He knew he couldn’t rely on KP in the paint because he gets flustered if he gets doubled. Or that KP isn’t aggressive enough and settles for jumpers. Or just isn’t a good passer in the low post. So Carlisle would rather not force feed KP who isn’t a reliable primary scorer, or playmaker. Maybe Carlisle is actually using KP to his best ability.  KP was in a losing situation with bad coaching in NY. Maybe he was just one of those players that looked better on a losing team. On a good team he’s just a role player. He can’t be relied on to be a number 2 guy."
I love Boban but he was being guarded by small forwards and Reggie Jackson off of switches lol. Every te should want to have him though
I mean KP bricking egregious threes isn’t a big deal. He fancies himself a shooter and is “open” so let it fly. THJ takes worse shots sometimes and it’s all good.  The problem is the zero effort he’s putting forth both on the defensive end and rebounding. If KP goes 3-14? It’s ok shooters gonna shoot. But you can’t be giving up rebounds to Reggie Jackson and not even attempting to rotate and close out on shooters in a competitive playoff series.  He just played like a lazy entitled superstar in game 36/82 in the regular season. Except he’s in G7 of the playoffs and he’s NOT a superstar.
That’s a fitting bang for Reggie Jackson if I’ve ever heard one
"He posted up Reggie Jackson once, and just decided to shot a difficult fadeaway (and missed)"
"Doncic was sensational. Kawhi was sensational. The difference, as it usually is, was the supporting cast.  PG, Mann, Morris, Reggie Jackson performed better in Game 7 than KP, Finney-Smith, Hardaway Jr and Brunson."
"Disagree with point 2. The Mavs were full of shooters and had guys who could catch lobs. Hardaway, Kleber, Brunson, Redick and Finney Smith all shot really well from 3 this season and in the playoffs (Redick excluded). I recall Dwight Powell being solid at catching lobs last I checked. They have the tools. I felt they needed an additional ball handler to take the load off of Luka. Dude dropped 29 in the first half and the team as a whole had nothing to show for it. Kawhi relied on PG, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann today when they needed it most and dropped a great game himself. Nobody on the Mavs lineup was able to fill those shoes"
"lol this guy just reads and doesn't watch the player, how can you even argue that he is a good post player when he can't evenm back down reggie jackson"
"...What? In this series, Porzingis was getting Reggie Jackson switched onto him and couldn’t back him down. He was taking bad fadeaway midrange shots because he couldn’t jockey for position. He got lost on defense repeatedly, and more than once bit on pass fakes to guys who were covered and instead left his man wide open. He was atrocious this whole series.  Porzingis made a few solid cuts to the basket in today’s game, which was nice to see. But he was horrendous through just about every other game, and it looks like his injury has really done a number on him."
"I don’t think that’s true. DFS is a great defender and efficient shooter. I’d take him over Marcus Morris. Jalen Brunson has been talked about as a 6th man of the year candidate. I’d take him over Reggie Jackson even tho Reggie had a good game. Decided to play trey instead of him. Kristaps should be the best big on the floor (I guess coaching has nothing to do with him being a shit player now and don’t use the injuries excuse as he’s been healthy long enough). Rotation was garbage. Playing 2 physically limited bigs in kristaps and Boban at the same time seems stupid.   Boban getting burned on defense could have had Powell in who had a great game the other day getting offensive boards like a beast. THJ is a good player, but I see a lot of contested 3s from him. Not  many offball screens. Nobody can get a rhythm if it’s just Luka isolations/pick and rolls and some rolls to Boban every once in a while for the most part. And an occasional pass to a shooter"
Reggie Jackson stepped up huge with those nail in the coffin 3s in the fourth quarter
"&gt;The Clips guard/wing starters are Jackson/PG/Kawhi if you want to try hide him on Morris Sr. — he’ll go off.  &amp;#x200B;  I mean I said Reggie. I don't think that's a bad option. Clint will be in the paint and if we lose to Reggie stepbacks then so be it lol. Do you really think the Clippers are going to run the offense through Morris? Even if they did, we could send help on the back down and force him to make a decision to pass out like you pointed out. Something he's not used to.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;CP3 would cook him. Booker would cook him. Mikal moves off the ball well enough to where Trae would have to actually participate in the defense. Crowder can back him down pretty easily.  &amp;#x200B;  I was told that Danny Green moved off the ball well enough to where Trae would have to participate, but that didn't really ever become an issue. Not something I'm worried about. Anyway, Crowder is the most likely matchup I believe and again, if they want the offense with Chris Paul and Devin Booker to be run out of the post with Crowder, then I honestly see that as a win for the hawks. Clint will be there to help and we have a scheme in place to handle it just like you pointed out."
Don't forget playing a shitty zone that gives open looks to Mook and Reggie Jackson all game!
"Their third best player is Reggie Jackson. They play good basketball, you saw the ball movement and shot selection today. I think they’re more fun to watch than Dallas"
&gt; The Mavericks outscored the Clippers by 7 points with Luka Doncic on the floor in this series.  Is that really an impressive amount? DFS outscored the Mavericks by 26 points and Dwight Powell by 10 points. On the flipside Reggie Jackson outscored the Mavs by 50 points. Damian Lillard was plus +27 in his losing performance.
for sure especially PatBev out and sticking with Reggie Jackson—-guy had a 🔥 series  and also sticking with Batum after Luka embarrassing Zu
"Yeah, that cut it to 7 and then Reggie Jackson turned into Steph"
they changed into their Reggie Jackson jerseys and Clippers flair
"especially at that position  if you were wasting it on a pure shooter then maaaaybe you can justify it (30m) on the bench. Clips gonna have Kennard on bench at 20m. a lot of money on that bench.  but Mavs need that, too… already need that money to get Luka more help when Hardaway Jr dries up.  nothing left over then to get someone in the paint that isn’t gonna get out-dueled in the paint by Paul George and REGGIE JACKSON"
Reggie Jackson is the point guard for this team.
Thats the most reggie jackson thing that reggie jackson has done
?? This is not what the series hinges on lol. This series is much more about the wings. I think Reggie Jackson will have to be in point because the Jazz biggest weakness is the small guards that can shoot and get to the hole.   Lou Williams was the Jazz Killer so that will help the Jazz a lot to not have to deal with him.
"Despite all of that, they could’ve still won multiple other games in this series if it wasn’t for Reggie Jackson"
"PAIN. good series clippers, i hate playing you with a passion. so damn frustrating. kawhi and pg stop killing us for a second and then reggie jackson and marcus morris decide to become prime klay and send me into eternal pain"
By Kawhi and PG do you mean point guard as in Reggie Jackson? Guy was clutch!
"If Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson play like they did today, clippers in 7."
And Reggie Jackson was a black hole on defense. Luka destroyed him.
"Kristaps, THJ. Think critically and you'll understand that Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson are not better than those two."
So you think Rick should have KP post up Reggie Jackson again and fail? I will bet money KP couldn't score over Kennard either.
Jazz in 6. I can’t believe in a team that is so dependent on Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson shooting basketball.
"That’s not Reggie Jackson, it’s Bobby Bitch"
Dude luka went wild crazy his 22 this came down to role players not kwahi and luka really. Morris and reggie jackson mann were huge.
I would argue Reggie Jackson was roughly on par with PG this series
Reggie Jackson just made LeBron's list
#KAWHI STEPPED UP  #PAUL GEORGE STEPPED UP  #TERANCE MANN STEPPED UP  #LUKE KENNARD STEPPED UP  #MARCUS MORRIS SR STEPPED UP  #BATUM STEPPED UP  #REGGIE JACKSON STEPPED UP
So Reggie Jackson was the best player in this series all along
"When players like Reggie Jackson are draining 3s from 3, 4, 5 feet beyond the arc it's time to move the line back."
Come one reggie jackson just scored two straght 3s like he is dame. Kawhi did great though.
"Morris, Reggie Jackson, Mann and even Kennard stepped up to make shots big time"
Who the fuck is this Reggie Jackson

Reggie Jackson is Playoff Rondo now
Has Reggie Jackson had a single bad game this playoffs?
Reggie Jackson has the ability to close games he used to do that a lot for the pistons back in 2016  The good thing about Reggie and Marcus Morris is neither of them are really scared of the moment
"Reggie ""Miller"" Jackson"
Reggie Jackson the best point guard on the Clippers ain’t no discussion
It was for sure and Ayton also tugged and pushed Zubac into it too. The refs just aren't going to call a moving screen or a little push on the in-bounds play at the end of a close game in the playoffs  The inbounds before Reggie Jackson was holding Mikal and the refs did nothing. That's just what they do in that situation and everybody knows it
And a tech for the coach. He was told once to get the proper players in and he still tried to sneak Reggie Jackson out there...
"lol love that you use a stat that ignores one of Luka's biggest struggles in FTs.  If you look at TS% they are very close to each other.  It also has no context of who they have played/defended by.  Trae has played against two top 5 defenses and was primarily guarded by DPOY candidates/all defensive teams and had to drive in on an all defensive team Center.  Luka was primarily guarded by Marcus Morris last year and then this year he was again guarded by guys like Morris, Reggie Jackson and occasionally PG.  The Clips also had freaking Batum at C.  Like I pray to god you have a higher eFG% against inferior defensive opponents."
reggie jackson was carrying his ass for 3 quarters
"Yeah you could tell that Reggie Jackson knew he wasn't supposed to be out there when he came back to the bench, so like why try to get away with it?"
Nets almost traded Bojan Bogdanovic for Noel back in 2017.   Brooklyn ended up sending Bojan to the Wizards for a 1st that became Jarrett Allen instead.   Believe the trade broke down over draft compensation. Noel was also dealing with a bunch of off court stuff that made him look bad at the time like the reports of him trashing the house he rented.   Without the Wizard trade the Nets likely don’t get Harden since Allen wouldn’t be on the roster.   It’s the same kinda butterfly effect of OKC bailing on the Lopez for Reggie Jackson trade that eventually led to KD and Kyrie in Brooklyn.   OKC at the last second sends Reggie to Detroit who then Max him before his injuries instead of Brooklyn. Nets trade Lopez to LA for D’Lo which leads to them making the playoffs and become attractive to Free Agents.
"Clippers shooting kept them in the game. Every time the Suns stretched it to a 7-10 pt lead the Clippers would hit some clutch threes to bring it close again.  By doing that the Clips make the game a grind. No lead is really safe and you can't ever ease up on them.  Suns are very disciplined though so they were able to whether the streaky shooting.  Going forward the Suns need to hit their 3's (only 23% last night) and the clips need to get someone other than Reggie Jackson to step up. PG and RJ have been good, but they're not getting the production from Mann &amp; others they did against Utah."
Foster was zooming in on Reggie Jackson on the sidelines hoping at least one toe was on the court so he could allow him to play the final possession lmao. He didn’t want to lose his money line
I like reggie Jackson and Luke kennard and mann but the rest of the guys prolly not that much
"Larry Hughes, Shaquille Harrisson, Stephen Jackson,  Charles Oakley, Moses Brown, Isaiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Nikola Vucevic, Bob Cousy, Scottie Barnes, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Jackson..."
"No, all the suns guys were still around the bench. They didn’t try to sub anyone in whereas the clippers sent Reggie Jackson down to the baseline to inbound the ball (which is where the illegal substitution or delay of game would come into play). Only after Monty tried like 5 times to get the refs to notice did they actually do something"
reggie jackson abruptly standing up was hilarious
They do have power though. This would be a great time to wield it in order to make the game move along quicker.  It's a part of the job.   I bet Ty Lue and Reggie Jackson don't pull any shenanigans with subs if the referee threatens to hit the Clippers with a delay of game.
"Pat Bev, A Morris twin, and Boogie make them easy to hate.  It sucks since I've come to like Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann watching the playoffs so far but the 3 I mentioned make it impossible for me to root for them"
Reggie jackson shot 43% from 3pt range in the regular season. It’s not a playoff fluke
Reggie Jackson just stood there and let Mikael get the rebound.
Cmon dawg this man literally shit himself last year and now he led them past the Jazz with Reggie Jackson as his sidekick
How the fuck does it take you 5 minutes to tell reggie jackson to sit his ass down fr
Yes but mainly because Reggie Jackson is shooting like he's a Curry brother
Yeah I’m loving the Cam Payne vs Reggie Jackson duel
True. He’s taken a team who’s other best player atm is Reggie Jackson to the WCF without one of the best 2 way players in the league. If someone doesn’t respect that then this might not be the sport for them.
"Ya should have been reggie..even in games with kawhi, jackson takes the game ending FTs as hes the best free throw shooter on the team.  Dont know why Ty drew that for PG when he already missed 3 FTs on 6 attempts already"
Should’ve been a technical when the Clippers tried to put Reggie Jackson in
I don’t watch a lot of Clippers games but it felt like Reggie Jackson should have been the one they sent to the line.  But PG played great so no slander here.
"Even in that case, Clippers wasted 5 minutes having Reggie Jackson just chill on the floor while knowing full well there shouldn’t have been any subs. And it took the refs that long to figure it out."
Shout out to Reggie Jackson intentionally causing chaos by standing on the court when the refs are yelling at the same 10 to stay on  Shout out to Scott Foster for going to the monitor on every play under 2 mins as well
"almost every single review down the stretch went the Clippers way lol. Plus it took them an eternity to give time on the clock, give MORE time, AND get the Clippers to send back their actual players on the floor lmao  Seriously, does Reggie Jackson not know the rules of the league he's playing? He was REALLY determined to get away with being the inbounder lol"
Ty should let their best ft shooter shoot it reggie jackson.  PG missed 3 FTs already
Reggie Jackson wouldn’t have missed those FT
Oh fuck Reggie Jackson is gonna win this isn’t he
dont get why the clippers didnt run a play to have reggie jackson get the ball
Reggie jackson should have shot those FTs. I knew he was gonna miss it
Reggie Jackson should have gotten that inbound and free throws if he's Mr 50/40/90...
Agreed. And Contract Season Reggie Jackson.   Dude is going to get paid and go disappear.
Suns are about to get hit with that call that we got in our favor in 2014 when Reggie Jackson got the ball tipped by Barnes.
Run plays then. Reggie Jackson running the freelance offense isn’t working
How is that Zubac's fault? Why inbound it to the big man who's turned the other way when an open guard in Reggie Jackson is waiting for the ball?
Lol. The worst part is Reggie Jackson is open
Reggie Jackson. The man was already a solid regular season guy. These playoffs are making him look like a stud.
Reggie Jackson was only recently great. He kept whining about Westbrook starting over him his entire tenure. Mostly just a whiny bitch we had to banish to Detroit
Reggie Jackson goated tho
"Imagine having drafted KD, Russ, Harden, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Adams, Poku etc in just over a decade, and thinking that draft luck going against you is classic."
Every time Reggie Jackson shoots I think it’s goin in. Man is elevated.
Reggie Jackson is such a sharpshooter now I’m scared when he does pull up or iso 3s
ya reggie jackson turned into klay thompson. so........
Reggie Jackson is 31 bro
Reggie Jackson look like AI out there lol
Idk but I’m sure Adam Silver is thrilled watching these young guys like Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson emerge
How did we get Reggie Jackson to the lakers
"Obviously, four years ago, we all knew Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson would be significant players on conference finals teams"
Serious question: can Reggie Jackson dribble the ball without carrying?
"Bro where does fucking Reggie ""minimum contract"" Jackson rank among playoff performers this post-season? Gotta be flirting with top 15 or 20 players in these playoffs?  Every time he has the ball I'm expecting a 3pt off the dribble to be nothing but net. Fucking dumb."
Clippers Reggie Jackson is playing like the player OKC Reggie Jackson thought he was
"Reggie Jackson have been knocking down timely shots, makes me happy makes me smile"
Knowing that Sam Presti drafted both Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson with mid-first rounders is making me feel a bit better about us getting the fucking 6th pick.
"Seriously tho, WHAT THE FUCK has gotten into Reggie Jackson?"
reggie jackson is a beast this playoffs man
Who the hell has possessed Reggie Jackson? Like god damn he’s ALWAYS hitting big shots for the Clips lately.
cam payne vs reggie jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; kd vs giannis
"Without Reggie Jackson, clips would’ve been a first round exit this year. Dude can’t miss"
This is literally a battle between two OKC point guard legends:     Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson.
Reggie Jackson turning into Steph curry isn’t something I expected.
You are now pronouncing 'Reggie Jackson' as 'Reggjie (zzzhh sound) Jackson'
Suns might have to gameplan on how to guard Reggie Jackson.
When did Reggie Jackson become unstoppable from 3?
"Next time I ball on the street court, I’m coming out with my Reggie Jackson fit on"
REGGIE JACKSON GO AWAY MAN!
Reggie Jackson is getting paid this off-season.
Reggie Jackson is apparently not cooling down in the playoffs...
Reggie Jackson being this good is stupid and i hate it
REGGIE JACKSON TAKEOVER TIME
Cam Payne vs Reggie Jackson. Riveting stuff
It’s Reggie Jackson time
"Who’s getting paid more this offseason, Reggie Jackson or Cam Payne?"
"I’ve watched every second of the Clippers playoff run, I am yet to see Reggie Jackson miss"
I've only been watching the Clippers since the semis but Reggie Jackson is the Clips sleeper MVP
Imagine telling someone a year ago that Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne would be 2 of the 3 best players in a Conference finals game
"Death, taxes and Reggie Jackson 3’s to break home crowd momentum"
Is that Reggie Jackson or Reggie Miller?
Reggie Jackson has made a career of out those well timed 3's
HOLY FUCK REGGIE JACKSON GO AWAY MAN!
Reggie Jackson with no regard for human life
Reggie Jackson is getting PAID
Reggie Jackson needs to shoot more
Reggie Jackson has been so clutch
"So I’ve missed a lot of the playoffs...Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann and cam Payne are the stars of the league now night?"
Cam Payne vs Reggie Jackson is the star matchup we didn’t know we needed
Why the hell did Reggie Jackson just toss the ball backwards over his shoulder without even looking on the PG inbound lmao so random
Makes you remember the old times on the Thunder when you would wonder to yourself if Reggie Jackson could be a lead scorer someday.
Man what’s gotten into Reggie Jackson? He went from being paid to GTFO in Detroit to looking like a legit star in the playoffs.
Has Reggie Jackson always been a top 5 NBA player and just no one noticed?
Reggie Jackson looks like he has a collection of custom roller skates
Reggie Jackson has been so so good
Is it just me or does Reggie Jackson carry more than others? Like everyone carries but I feel like Reggie does it a lot
"I missed the first half, so i definitely expected to see Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne leading their teams in scoring"
"If PG and Booker are going to cancel out, what answer do the Clips have against Ayton? What about the Suns on Mann (I mean, is he at that level now?), if CP3 comes back, Clips need more from Reggie Jackson, Batum, and Morris."
You offer Reggie Jackson as much as you can if you’re the clippers and hope you can retain him. He’s been so good
Reggie Jackson such a good player. Doc had him looking like a scrub in the playoffs last year.
My grandchildren will hear of the epic Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne 2021 WCF
Reggie Jackson wants to get paid.
You misspelled Reggie Jackson.
Paul George had a big game 5 but he has not been carrying.  Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson have bailed him out a lot
List of point guards who are 100% better than Reggie Jackson (in no particular order):  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Kyrie 4. Cp3 5. Trae Young 6. SGA 7. Jamal Murray 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Jrue Holiday 10. Mike Conley  11. Westbrook 12. Lowry 13. Kemba 14. Brogdon 15. Ja Morant  and that's not even including big guys that technically play PG like  1. LeBron 2. Luka 3. LaMelo 4. Simmons
I predict Reggie Jackson scores 40.
"Clown time take. If this isn’t your first season watching the nba, then you got a lot to learn.  PG is a top 20 player. Reggie Jackson is a role player having a good playoffs. Big difference."
I think you mean Batman and Superman (PG and Reggie Jackson) need their Wonder Woman
Right lmao Detroit’s best move of the decade is Reggie Jackson playing like Steph on a min for the Clippers
"Reggie Jackson has been a beast with his rainbow ass high arching shots and even some savage dunks yesterday. Kind of shocked at how good and relatively consistent he's been so far this post season.  But PG is carrying this team no question. Also Morris gave Booker the work yesterday too and started off perfect. But shit I'm totally cool if Reggie wants to drop a 30 bomb next game and push the game 7, I'm def rooting for the Clippers."
"Two obvious and simple things here.  1. People were previously underrating Reggie Jackson, which has worked out excellently for me in draftkings 2. You are drastically underrating Paul George in his career.   And are you considering him the second option to Westbrook in OKC even though he was by far the better player on both sides of the court, as the season's on/off stats showed?"
"i mean kevin love definitely sucks though, unless literally NOBODY else wanted to go, just about anybody would be a better pick... tellin me youd rather have kevin love than reggie jackson this summer"
The GOAT Reggie Jackson
Uhhh current HOFer [proof](https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/jackson-reggie)
"Ah yes, future HoFer Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson
"For starters, he's not afraid to bench players in order to win. Benched Beverley in the Mavs series. Benched Rondo and went with Reggie Jackson, and Terrance Mann. Doc would continue to play players like Lou Will and Trezz who were obvious deficits. Paul George and Reggie Jackson are playing extremely well, but I highly doubt someone like Jackson is going to be balling out at this level in year 12 under a different team."
Houston literally took this method and maximised it and it got them nowhere. Play-off basketball isn't necessarily the same pace as the regular season and teams that force the shot and take a lot of shots might have a better offense and score more but if they're giving the opposition more shots then then there's a high chance they're getting scored on a lot too.  Yesterdays loss wasn't so much about their offense being stagnant and slow with CP3 on the floor. They let Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris give PG13 plenty of time to rest and close out the 4th. Mann is having his way when Ayton isn't in the game getting easy offensive rebounds and making his way to the rim at will.
"I’m not all too sure what Ty Lue has done? Cousins was a better fit and that came by chance to Ty lue due to injury. George playing well has to do with Kawhi being out. Reggie Jackson is getting more touches due to kawhi’s injury. Beverly always plays his heart out. I love ty lue since he’s been a laker, but I don’t understand what he’s doing that’s so revolutionary?"
"It’s somewhat expected . Not expected to be that efficient , but the points aren’t all too surprising. Imo the difference was between Crowder and Morris. Morris had 20+ for the Clips and Crowder had 4?  It’s the “others” that put the Clips over the top last night. Reggie Jackson, atm, is considered the second go-to this series so he’s not an “other”"
I think in the Clippers' case they need someone who can bring a little consistency. The role players look great when they're shooting 50+% from three and it looks awful when the shots aren't falling. It's great to win games when Morris starts 7-7 from the field or reggie jackson hits 6 threes but they've lost all the games where the game turned into a slog.
Reggie Jackson*
Clippers have Reggie Jackson. The undisputed GOAT all time
Reggie Jackson 8 spots too low
Dude would get crossed by reggie Jackson and try to get him arrested
"I was gonna say something pretty similar. We had to watch this dude for five years. I would have taken literally any of the players mentioned in the OP over him. Reggie lives and dies by the hero ball. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she don't. Fuckin' way she goes with Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson has legitimately been better than Cp3 n jrue
Young has been better than Booker and I’d argue Reggie Jackson has been better than Jrue and CP3  Middleton has also been better than Ayton
"I think it's because they had some adversity. If they hadn't lost Kawhi, everyone would be mocking them for needing to dig out of a hole.  And bc of Reggie Jackson. Everyone loves it when an unexpected non-star just starts balling out of their mind.  And bc, as much as Bev is disliked, everyone also secretly likes him messing with CP. If he blows in Paul's ear, this sub will lose its mind with glee."
Top 10 Active Players Remaining:  1) Giannis  2) Paul George  3) Devin Booker  4) Trae Young  5) DeAndre Ayton  6) Khris Middleton  7) Jrue Holiday  8) Chris Paul  9) Reggie Jackson  10) John Collins
"No - but while his FT consistency is maddening, he's getting clowned on constantly despite being the only superstar on the team and singlehandedly carrying the Clippers (with some assistance from Reggie Jackson). He's playing massive minutes, being a distributor, scorer, and defender.   People gonna clown on him for choking or whatever but dude is having a spectacular playoff run. Its not the level of carry KD did for the Nets elimination but its not crazy far off either."
Complete shit compared to top 2 player Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is having maybe the greatest playoff run by a minimum player of all time
Reggie Jackson is playing almost all star numbers on minimum contract payout
"It's entirely possible Kawhi's return hurts the production of guys like Reggie Jackson and Mann. Without him, the role players have been playing more freely instead of deferring to Kawhi to save them. Kawhi is going to get a decent amount of touches and if he isn't healthy those touches might not be very effective. Integrating a star back into the offense after a long layoff often results in worse team performance in the immediate short term because it hurts the rhythm that the role players gained while he's gone"
"We might laugh, but some GM out there (and some poor fanbase) is going to think ""holy cow, reggie Jackson is a top 10 pg!  We need to offer him a huge contract!""  Reggie Jackson UFA next season.  Bobby Smurda about to be very happy, not sure about the teams that signs him though."
This Reggie Jackson hype has got to slow the fuck down.
"Give this team some credit, Reggie Jackson is playing like a top 50 player, and guys are just playing their hearts out. Even if they don't win the chip or even make it to the finals, they gave it their absolute all. No matter how this ends for these guys, they should hold their heads high"
Pretty diminishing to what Reggie Jackson has been doing. Jackson has been LETHAL this postseason.
"When did I say game 4 though? I re-edited my post for context, which you failed to address. We are talking about last night  And if he wins a ring, without another top star, and against a healthier, generally better team in The bucks with 2 all star players/guys in Giannis and Khris  Well guess what?? How many players have that quality of play? Mind naming some? Of course you can’t. Nobody said hes doing it by himself. We got eyes, we all see T-Mann and Reggie jackson, and last night Marcus Morris and even DeMarcus cousins gave them quality minutes, but that’s kind of the point. If the Clippers want to win, it can’t just be those guys, it has to be PG leading the way. Reggie and Tmann won’t win them series, PG will.  Most importantly, again PG would be doing it without another star, and assuming the bucks close out this series. If PG beats them, one would assume we’d get similar performances like tonight. Clear argument for top 10 player. Nobody at the end of that top 10 list would have done what he did and this isn’t the bubble either. Fans are back and the world is opening back up. He’d have a better argument than anyone else in that top 12-25 range"
That’s fair it’s just that the Clippers can win multiple games in a series with an average Paul George performance which is what separates a top ten player with no other all star on his team from everyone else.  Most top ten players are so important to their teams offense they crater when he does nothing but Paul George can be average and Reggie Jackson or Morris can step up and be he best player.  That’s what I’m getting at.  Paul George as he is now can never carry a team to a title but the way the Clippers play with the five out unit is so hard to defend that if they win it all it’s because nobody has an adjustment for that.
"What are you talking about lmao this team is full of random dudes putting in work. Mann last series, Reggie Jackson putting in work all playoffs, Boogie stepping up last night."
"No doubt the team was solid, but superstars win, and Dirk was by far the best player on that team. JKidd at the end of his career, Jason Terry stepping up, and Tyson Chandler doing all the hustle/intangibles were still role players that stepped up and over achieved, like guus Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris are doing right now to a much lesser extent. Nic Batum's impact on the floor can't be understated either.   I'm just saying all things considered, Dirk went up against multiple potentially GOAT superstars in that run as the sole superstar. I don't think anything comes close to it ever."
number 2 right behind Reggie Jackson :)
"Should Reggie Jackson be taken seriously as ""Mr. October"" if his teams didn't win the World Series?"
"His transition defense in the late 4th on Reggie Jackson last night was awful, pretty much waved the white flag at that point"
"Does anyone actually like listening to anything Jalen Rose has to say? It’s disappointing Rose, Mark Jackson, and Reggie Miller are all annoying to some extent as a Pacers fan"
You are not going to out small-ball the clippers when they have 3 6”8 guys in PG Batum and Morris that can all defend and shoot. If kawhi is healthy they have 4 of them which is the reason they dominated both the mavs and jazz when they went small after going down 0-2. Even their smaller guards like pat bev and Mann can hold out on a post up okay and Reggie Jackson has a 7 feet wingspan
Reggie Jackson has not been good since his OKC days. You don't need to revise history just because he's found a role and is killing it in the playoffs.
"That’s what happens when you go from having Austin Rivers, Campazzo and Monte Morris guarding you to Reggie Jackson, Pat Bev (mostly been on Book), and Terrence Mann. And a week off of playing basketball, and COVID   Cp3 and Book play into the Clippers hands. They want you to shoot jumpshot cause they’re betting that their defense will contest the look as good as possible. They want to stop people from getting to the rim.   And for that reason, I think Monty is heavily under using Cam Payne. He’s too slippery to guard well."
"Wait you’re telling me Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann, etc are better than Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers???"
"And the team that pays him that fat contract will regret it. Don't be fooled by a hot stretch, as clutch as it is. We've all been watching Reggie Jackson play for years."
When did Reggie Jackson turn into one of the best guards in the NBA? Dude is playing elite ball right now
"Reggie Jackson channeling Reggie ""Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!"" Jackson"
"Exactly the team comparison matters, so why are you not accounting for injuries? You think PG and Reggie Jackson have a better chance winning the chip this year than Lebron and Kyrie/love in 2016?  Probably not since you already think they’ll lose in the wcf which would make them winning the chip very impressive no?"
Reggie Jackson was doing the Not All Heroes Wear Capes (metro boomin) album cover pose
I’m here for all the Reggie Jackson nicknames.
"Are we forgetting the jazz lost twice in a row to the Kawhi-less clippers as well? Are we saying that the Jazz and Suns are frauds? The reality is the Clippers are playing with a great intensity and a game plan. Reggie Jackson isn’t missing, contested or not, and Paul George is a great leader."
Reggie Jackson. Vet minimum.
Reggie Jackson and it isn't close😝
pistons putting blake griffin w andre drummond and reggie jackson. reggie jackson never played a healthy season w the pistons after 2016 why would svg do us bold like that and put blake next to him and andre.
Also the difference between having Rondo this year for LAC and last year for LAL? And actually playing Reggie Jackson instead of sitting him on the bench? Are we also taking the injury status' of both teams from last year and this year in the postseason into account?
"&gt; They just need a pass first point guard  I've seen this parroted a lot, but I really don't think this is true, especially after watching the Clippers who run so much of their offense through their wings and the breakout guy for them in the playoffs is a score first guard in Reggie Jackson.   The Jays have to get better at making plays, yes, but we don't need a Ricky Rubio type on this team, we need more 3-point shooting."
reggie jackson was great last night
Has Kawhi ever been in a position where he had to carry a team with a player like Reggie Jackson being the #2?
"I don’t think Kawhi lets the Clippers lose games 2 and 4, at the very least he doesn’t let them lose in the fashion that they were lost. Not a knock on PG, by the way, because he’s been sensational with Kawhi injured, but I just think Kawhi is better equipped to carry a team. There’s a lot of other things you have to factor in, too, though, like do the role players step up in the same way? Does the offense stay as fluid as it has been with Kawhi out? Is Kawhi willing to let Reggie Jackson and Terence Mann cook when they’re hot?"
Reggie Jackson has been a beast for the Clippers. Really impressed with his play
"These are interesting comments.   I mean, I've heard racist dicks where I grew up chastising a ball hog for playing ""n-word ball."" Those were not guys I liked to play with or hang out with, so they wouldn't get invited by me and my closer friends, or we simply wouldn't go when invited to play by them.   So this is nothing new. And it's often the criticism that guys like Melo and T-Mac have gotten. Hell... this is verbatim how Phil Jackson would coach Jordan. Instead of Doug Collins, who boasted that that Cavs series ender was just essentially giving Jordan the ball and let him do his thing, Phil Jackson drove him the importance of incorporating and trusting teammates and playing in a system.    I get (and even appreciate) that this passage seeks to explore the cultural contexts that shape style of play. It isn't *necessarily* 'racist' to observe that people from certain cultures do things differently than other cultures, but in this context, the 'white basketball' and 'black basketball' just sounds so patently offensive and racist, even with the cultural context. It's just cringy.  We see players from both groups adopt the alternate styles of play as well. CP3 is likely the best floor general I've seen outside of perhaps Stockton. Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Ray Allen, KG, Reggie Miller, Hakeem, D-Rob... nobody played TEAM basketball better than those dudes.   And then you got white dudes who get  to hogging the ball too.   But the comments on attention span? That applies to the enter generation (broadly speaking), not simply a subset. And the 'prison garb' and 'thuggery,' Jesus fucking Christ.   I don't know how I've never heard this shit before.   I think this speaks to how acceptable it is to be racist.    &amp;#x200B;  Thanks so much for sharing this."
Reggie Jackson: Road to Redemption
"Clippers are getting valuable minutes from all of their players with Kawhi out. Backs against the wall , they are playing their hearts out since they know their guy isnt coming back. Reggie Jackson looking like a star, OG Paul is back , Morris had like 13 in the first quarter last night."
is reggie jackson an all star?
Resign Reggie Jackson!!
Reggie Jackson is a twank versatile.
"As someone who doesn't watch much outside of my Phoenix Suns, I have yelled ""who the fuck is Reggie Jackson?!?"" Multiple times this series lol.  Dude is absolutely ballin"
*“Every now and again I think about how Reggie Jackson and I are the same height. But then in moments like this I remember he's got a 7-foot wingspan and NBA-level athleticism”...*  Some guys just luck out in the DNA lotto. I’m sure he worked his ass off in the gym as well. Dudes are just a different breed.
"Its hella impressive what hes doing in this playoffs. 0-2 twice, now facing a 1-3 deficit and battling like they did today without their best player against a fully healthy Suns team.   Of course he said it himself but his teammates have been carrying him as he hasnt been efficient.  Reggie Jackson has continued to be the biggest resurgence this playoffs and everyone in the team is chipping in.  PG13 is making the Suns earn their ticket to the finals and its just such a spectacle"
Reggie Jackson and CP3?
Reggie “Straw that stirs the drank” Jackson
"If you told me five years ago that Reggie Jackson would be an offensive spark plug deep in the playoffs in 2021, I'd probably laugh. If you told me he'd do that while also taking on tough defensive assignments and making the right moves within the team's defensive scheme I'd think you're insane.  Full credit to him as well as Lue for finding a role that he's thriving in"
The Clippers are somehow the better team in this series vs the Suns despite Kawhi being out. It’s pretty mind boggling. The Clippers small lineup is the best small lineup since the Warriors death lineup with Dray at center. It’s kind of bizarre how good they are with only only true star (tho Reggie Jackson is playing like an allstar).
But he would never be 1/20 in the first place because he's Reggie Fucking Jackson
"Suns don't want to see PG with googles.  (See Jackson, Reggie)"
"Big government, Bobby shmurda, Jackson and Jackson are the acceptable names for Reggie"
PG and Reggie Jackson outplaying Booker and CP by far this series. That can't happen as much as everyone wants to focus on the Clippers' moment.
Terrance Man + Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hakeem + Jordan
"Kawhi is controlling Reggie Jackson with his goggles, he’s up there to get a better view"
"If Doc even made 1/5th of the adjustments Lue does, then there is no way in hell Denver comes back.  1) Play JMG more minutes instead of Trez  2) Play Zubac more minutes instead of Trez  3) Stop playing Lou Williams/Reggie Jackson together  4) Stagger PG/Kawhi better  5) Don't force feed Trez/Lou the ball when you have PG, Kawhi, and Morris on the court.  Pick any combination of those things instead of living and dying by your ""best"" (i.e. favorite) players, and Doc wraps that series up in 5 or 6."
"TNT has the best pre and postgame show but ESPN has the best in game announcers, IMO  Jvg, breen, don’t care much for mark jackson, doris is ok in my book, Dave pasch, tirico, the guy who got hired by the kings, Ian eagle, RJ and his co commentator are all miles better than, Reggie, c Webb, senile marv. The only good one is Jim Jackson."
Reggie Jackson
"Reggie Jackson too man, dudes been insane."
"I don't know what he's talking about.  As a Pistons fan, Clippers aren't on our radar, we don't like the Lakers though.  Maybe he's eluding to Reggie Jackson being a star for you guys and not for us."
I already respect them. Except for pat bev and PG’s incessant elbow shoving on offense. Honesty though it’s hard not to respect that they don’t go away ever and have an irrational confidence (I’m looking at you Reggie Jackson).
"@mods or others: this is my first time posting on r/nba. Let me know screen recording a game like this is not allowed. I can remove it or upload it another way.  First of all, obviously it sucks when players get injured, so hopefully Zubac recovers soon and quickly.  This is my personal observation: Paul George played a great game. He's an all star for a reason but I haven't seen him be this efficient shooting 15/20 fg with a personal playoff high of 41 pts.   However, if you see how open the paint is in the clip from the absence of Zubac, I think it makes sense how Paul George and Reggie Jackson can get easier baskets with Morris spreading the floor.   This should be a really interesting rest of the series and see how Suns respond to this on defense for game 6."
"Reggie Jackson was still scoring with Kawhi, and Kawhi has gravity that gets teammates open, he’s also a elite defender so he boosts their defense significantly"
"You don't need Reggie Jackson looking like a top 5 pg in the league when you have a top 5 *player* in kawhi.  And the suns, despite winning the 1st 2 games, have been outscored and beaten in team stats.  Booker hasn't been the same since Bev got minutes. Not because of cp3 coming back lol"
"Reggie Jackson is blowing my mind. He would be an all star if he played like this all year, and he’s doing it against the best competition."
"So you watched the Kawhi~less clippers take 2 straight against the 1 seed and thought what… you were gonna get swept? lol  It’s just funny that you’d rather trash the Suns than praise guys like Reggie Jackson and Mann, and PG who are playing the best ball of their career."
"Exactly, that's even more overpowered, Reggie Jackson is clearly the best out of the 4"
PG dropping 40 isn’t historical. Reggie Jackson scored 23 lol.
He got Paul George and Reggie Jackson for this one though
Reggie Jackson top 5
"Reggie Jackson was pretty damn good on the Pistons.  He was just asked to do too much, which was being the best perimeter player on a team.  He’s in a perfect role now.  Happy to see him thriving."
Reggie Jackson would like a word
The clippers nearly made it to the finals with Reggie Jackson as a #2 option. Why would he leave? Not gonna get a good contract and a better costar than Gaul Peorge
"You beat an injured Lakers team, an injured Denver, and was pushed to 6 by Paul George and Reggie Jackson.  Excuse me if we don't have the utmost confidence in y'all"
"i would argue that, for how much better TNT’s studio crew is than ESPN’s, ESPN’s broadcast crew is that much better than TNT’s. i’d *easily* take Breen (who’s imo the best play-by-play guy in basketball) and the Mark Jackson-JVG (who i find to be very entertaining together) dynamic without a second thought over Marv’s senile ass and Reggie Miller"
are you going to sit there and pretend that reggie jackson isn’t a superstar?
"It's just become a circlejerk at this point. Ty Lue was getting praised for winning without Kawhi because Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann turned into prime Ray Allen in must win games, but Bud is clueless and getting bailed out by Middleton and Jrue for winning without Giannis."
"If they can get a better player in free agency then by all means that's the play, but he's serviceable for the most part. Losing a 6 man like Lou isn't great though, so maybe Reggie Jackson would be in play for ATL"
Reddish looking to join the Reggie Jackson Bag club

I know it’s a homer pick but Reggie Jackson is on a vet min lol
Reggie Jackson still giving Detroit what’s best for them I see. What a lad
Kd stans always act like Reggie Jackson and Russell Westbrook were scrubs.
* Full Reggie Jackson
reggie jackson was a good answer a week ago
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
Curry esque would be a pointe guard that doesnt need the ball in his hands to be effective so that Draymond/Simmons type players arent useless on offense if they dont have the ball in their hands. And there aren't  many point guards like that. Maybe Lillard Reggie jackson  Kyrie
Bucks are way above Clippers imo.   The difference between PG and Reggie Jackson? And Middleton / Jrue is massive   AD and Shroder are more close tho I agree
"Has to be a pure scorer, and can create his own shot.   Guy like Reggie Jackson comes to mind, D-Schroder, or it could be even d-rose, rose gonna lack his energy a bit."
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson against Detroit in the regular season. That midrange shot killed Detroit
"1. Reggie Jackson has Gobert 1on1 on the perimeter with no help in the paint.  - Bad rotation D  2. Mann gets a putback on well defended PG13 miss, where Gobert thought he had an easy rebound and failed to sense the need to block out - Less than optimal vision and timing   3. Reggie Jackson pull up floater deep in the paint in Transition where Gobert was deferring to on ball defender to prevent something at the hoop - Transition D off a missed 3  None of this is not indicative of the Clippers “going at” Gobert for easy points"
"I don’t think I’m a homer for taking the warriors with Klay if he happened to be 100% over the Suns.   The Suns were .7 perfect tip dunk from 3-3 against a super team of PG, Reggie Jackson, and Marcus Morris   And for the bench, only 8 play anyway so starters plus Oubre, Poole, and Toscano would be fine"
Yeah I dunno why everyone sweats draft picks so much.  The real value is undervalued people looking for their 2nd or 3rd contract.  Jrue Holiday.  Reggie Jackson.  You sign the right undervalued people... then bam
"I think the Warriors with Klay beat these Suns in a playoff series. They match up really well actually. Draymond Klay Wiggins can guard the best players on Phoenix . Draymond Curry Klay in a playoff series is as good of chemistry as it gets. Curry and Klay are a better duo than Booker and CP3  Let’s not forget the Suns we’re losing in the first round with AD at 50%, and were a perfect tip in dunk at the buzzer from being 3-3 with a team of Playoff P, Bev, Mann, Morris, and Reggie Jackson"
"You’re correct that Ingram mostly shoots 3s above the break both this year and last.  But Ingram took 1.5 more catch and shoot 3s per game than pull up 3s and shot 43.2% on them. And while he attempted less than he had the previous year, he was still making only .4 per game fewer than last year.   He averages more made catch and shoot 3s than Huerter, Gallinari, Ingles, Reggie Jackson and Seth Curry and the same as Gary Trent Jr, Mikal Bridges, and Norman Powell."
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.

Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
"Hell the SUNS have been doing that since 2010.  I have been woefully uncomfortable for the entire playoffs.  Like we were up 20 on the Clips and Reggie Jackson would nail an open 3 and I'd be like, ""oh lawd this is it, we're going to dump our lead!"""
That game was clearly the Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson show.
"We just saw Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne ball out after NBA obscurity. Bobby Portis putting up stats last night. We got no idea what the role players look like next year. I think the warriors are in the same conversation as any non-Net's squad.   Did you write off KD like you're doing Klay? They probably limit him at the start and ramp him up. Maybe he's toast, but I'm not gonna say he can't compete without seeing the man."
"I thought he was guaranteeing that come May'22, Dinwiddie will outperform what we saw from Reggie Jackson this June."
Do they bring back both Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum? How is Ibaka back? Kawhi knee?  Also Lakers need and will make some move too. Way too soon to say anything rn
I’d put Nuggets Suns and Lakers above them with teams that will be up there. Clippers need to try to find a replacement for Reggie Jackson
"The Warriors as presently constructed have no where near the depth of the Clippers. The Clippers on any given night have plenty of guys who can provide 15-20 points besides their top two players. Also, Paul George and Reggie Jackson are probably more talented than anyone currently on the Warriors not named Steph Curry. Without Klay, Steph would have to play every minute of every game to make a series with the Suns competitive. And considering Steph Curry would probably be targeted on the defensive end, that's not likely."
"Pippen and Jordan hated Krause and called him “Crumbs” because he always at leftovers on his chin and shirt after eating.  Krause did manage to trade Olden Polynice to the Sonics for Pippen on draft day and drafted Horace Grant 10th. One of the greatest drafts in NBA history and he did it with the 8th and 10th picks. Without Krause, it’s possible Jordan would have left the Bills considering how bad the 1987 draft was as a whole. David Robinson went first and the rest of the Top 10 picks other than Pippen and Grant were average players in the NBA.  Reggie Miller went 11th, Mark Jackson 18th, and Reggie Lewis 22nd and other than that, the rest never amounted to anything other than journeymen."
Goggles reggie jackson
"Jazz fans kept clamouring about how Rudy was one of the greatest defenders in history, and I’ve seen so many saying he’s better than Ben Wallace. All I know is, people feared Big Ben, he wasn’t getting targeted in the paint by Reggie Jackson and Terence Mann"
You forgetting about dudes like Reggie Jackson
1. Giannis  2. Reggie Jackson  3. KD  4. Trae young   5. Paul George  6. CP  7. Dbook  8. Luka  9. Bobby portis  10. Brook lopez  Nothing in particular order but bobby portis is #1
"Cameron Payne, Reggie Jackson, Dennis Schroder"
"If you’re including us you gotta include 3-1 nuggets.   Goggles Reggie Jackson.   Lord thiccolas Batum, protector of the paint   Not-fat Jokic"
76ers should do what the Thunder should have done years ago and pair Reggie Jackson with their current biggest star instead of Westbrook.
Dang. Cam was balling this year. Him and reggie jackson are going to get paid by somebody. I wonder if a starting duo of payne and jackson would work
I’d rather Throw that money at Reggie Jackson. Dude has proved he could be that guy.
We mean Reggie Jackson right?
Reggie Jackson would like a word with you.
Reggie Jackson would like a word
"Honestly I think this whole discussion is moot anyway, as I don't see the Clippers trading for Kemba. They're most likely going to be losing Reggie Jackson to free agency, so I can't imagine them then also trading more point guards to get Kemba, so IMO this is just a silly exercise.   But that said, for a team like OKC to be tying up $15 million in cap space that currently is open is not what they want to do. That's why they got that 1st round pick from Boston: because Kemba was gonna be tying up $20 million in cap space that Horford was not. They'd almost surely prefer to get Rondo and Ibaka instead of Kennard because then all of it comes off the books after next season. If the Clippers refused that and insisted on sending them Kennard, then I'm sure OKC would say sure, but it'll cost you an extra pick."
"I'm tired of all the nonsense trade scenarios involving LaVine. The Bulls aren't going to trade him! He's a stud scoring guard and the exact type of player who will thrive in the playoffs.  The single biggest reason the Bulls have been scuffling the past few years (aside from Jim Boylen) is their lack of a decent Point Guard. I'm confident the new front office will plug that hole with someone the likes of: Lonzo Ball, Spencer Dinwiddie, Reggie Jackson, Cam Payne.   So the idea of LaVine in a 76ers jersey is just as improbable as Embiid in a Bulls jersey."
Bruh y’all should’ve beaten the clips even without ayton. They had PG and Reggie jackson. Doncic almost beat them with kawhi going off and less than half the roster y’all have
"Bro...  Just because I am not on the ""shit on Ben Simmons"" bandwagon, doesn't mean I'm a ""Benabler"". One can be in the middle.  Do I think he has problems? Yeah. Do I think he's only worth Brogdon and a non-lottery pick? HELL NO. I am fascinated by people who pretend like everything is alright with him, but I am even more fascinated by people who think he's all of a sudden a bench scrub after a down year.  Melo got tossed from the league for a year as well, despite the fact that everybody knew damn well what a player he is and what he can do. Same nearly became the case for Reggie Jackson. And now you're all doing it to Simmons. What's next, Klay comes back, doesn't immediately average 22.3 PPG like he did in his best scoring season, and he suddenly becomes a scrub? Come on."
Lol and minus Reggie Jackson where are those other guys at??
"Wow this dude is in his first ever playoffs, and he’s out here setting FG% records and defending more/better than most of the other players..  And he went up against Bron/AD (injured but these are still two top-5 guys at times), MVP Jokic, and he had to guard point god Reggie Jackson this last series. Guy is special man"
"&gt;Then why use it as an example for LeBron? Guy has been basically an ironman since he came into the league. LOL.  He's turning 37 in December. He's not immortal man. With 8 straight finals, so many years of elite play, so many playoff minutes under straining circumstances, the wear and tear is building up. You think it's a coincidence possibly the 2 biggest injuries of Lebrons career have happened in a Lakers jersey? One was in this year but the overall point remains.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If you want me to reply, sure. Your whole presumption is that Kawhi wants to be with his family and thus he is in LA. Kawhi could have second thoughts about the situation since joining the team including but not limited to:      &gt;   &gt;Underwhelming postseason success      Clippers medical team      Inability to make moves  Why would Kawhi have second thoughts? He's smart, he's likely thought it all through. I think he knows there's a risk that he never wins a ring with the Clippers. I don't think that's a priority to him as much as his family is, which I can respect.  1) Underwhelming? To me, underwhelming was the Sixers. They had the chance to succeed and were expected to succeed, but they failed. They underwhelmed.  The Clippers didn't go as far as we thought BECAUSE of Kawhi. Not his fault, it's an injury, but Kawhi being with the Clippers is the reason they ""underwhelmed."" If Kawhi was healthy, I have the Clippers winning. Of course, that's unfair so let's make everyone healthy. I have the Clippers still making the Finals.  In fact, I'd say that under their unique circumstances, they exceeded and went beyond expectations. PG proved himself which likely made Kawhi very happy. Roleplayers like Reggie, Batum and Bev did great when they needed to. A young talent like Mann shined. Possibly the most important, Lue showed that he was a top coach in the league. That's a good foundation for Kawhi to come back.   &amp;#x200B;  2) Clippers medical team? What?   &amp;#x200B;  3) I already addressed this. There aren't many moves they need to make. They don't need a superstar. They just need to try to keep as many of their best roleplayers as possible while giving up what's necessary and replacing them. They have about as much of an ability to make moves as nearly every contender in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Against the Jazz, he was still playing even after his injury in G4 and could be a reason why he was out for so long. This could have been a misdiagnosis on the Clippers medical staff, and if he believes so, I don't think he will be staying.     Cmon man. Reread this.  So, you assumed and speculated that Kawhi playing extra minutes is a reason why he was out, and you assumed and speculated that this was due to the Clippers medical staff, and you assumed that Kawhi believes this, so you assumed that this would lead to Kawhi leaving the Clippers.  Really?   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Clippers are capped out and have no assets. Even if Kawhi and Ibaka opts out, they have 100m or so in their salary books. There is no way for them to sign anyone outside of a minimum contract. Morris and Kennard doesn't look like they're worth their contract and Terence Mann earns too little to move the needle for any one in the trade market. Key players like Batum and Jackson are UFA and will likely get better offers elsewhere. Beverley isn't getting interest after getting embarrassed by Luka and definitely not after the stunt he pulled with CP3.     Alright, you've lost me. You've let your own bias cloud your judgement and you're intentionally being doom and gloom. I've already addressed this but this whole post is just ""Worst case scenario for everything times 10.""   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Clippers aren't the better destination. Especially not with Kawhi's free agency looming over them.     As far as we can surmise, it's really not a big mysterious decision. He will re-sign.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Let's just agree to disagree on this subject. You're not budging from your stance and I don't think I will either. Dame isn't coming to either team so there's really no point too     Alright. I'll just end on this note. One team needs Dame a whole lot more than the other."
"Just FYI, Kennard and Beverley wouldn't be enough to match salaries, the Clippers would also have to include either Rondo, Zubac or both Yogi Ferrell and Daniel Oturu to make the trade work under the cap. Considering Reggie Jackson might leave in free agency in addition to this, I don't see the Clippers wanting to send their remaining three point guards out for Kemba."
"😂😂😂😂 What a joke , he’s not even better than Reggie Jackson"
"Like I said, Reggie Jackson very likely will get bigger offers than the Clippers are able to match, so there's a good chance he'll leave as a free agent. Given that strong possibility, do you really think it's wise to trade every other point guard on the roster for Kemba?"
Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann in Game 6. There you go
Reggie Jackson comes to mind
"Thunder - Grizzlies 2014  4 straight OT games, 7 game series  The first Reggie Jackson big playoff performance  The series that spawned ""Mr. Unreliable"" after which KD took over to come back from 3-2"
If THJ gets an offer for 25m do the mavs let him walk and try to sign reggie jackson instead
"On one hand, I don’t think that OKC would hate Kennard’s contract. It’s only about 14 million per year before incentives and has a team option on the 4th year. I’d guess that OKC would be down to take on him and Pat Bev for the 25th overall. It saves them money for the next two years and gives them an asset.  So I’d say the question is, do the Clippers want Kemba? He’s a huge injury risk, but could be a good reggie jackson replacement. I’d guess that they are tired of having so many injury problems and want someone who’s reliable"
"For Schroder? If they've got that kind of money earmarked for a point guard, don't you think they'd prefer to offer it to Reggie Jackson or Lonzo? Or hell, just absorb Kemba's salary into their cap space. I'd be surprised if Schroder is the most in demand PG this summer."
"I actually think matching salary for Kemba would be the bigger road block. I think Presti would be fine with the Clippers 2028 1st round pick, but to match Kemba's $36 million the Clippers would have to send out at least $29 million to match. I'm assuming PG is off limits, so [which guys from this group](https://i.imgur.com/fj04SmG.png) are the Clippers sending? Keep in mind that there's a very good possibility that Reggie Jackson won't be back, so PG depth will probably be crucial."
"&gt;**e.**  the Clippers can match salary and have the 25th pick to trade.  no idea if that'd be enough for OKC.  I'm not sure the Clippers would want to give up the players it would cost to get Kemba, actually. To match Kemba's $36 million the Clippers would have to send out at least $29 million in matching salary for it to work under the cap. Do they have that much that they are perfectly OK with moving? I'm assuming they'd start with Rondo and Beverley, which is $22.5 million. Who else? Ibaka maybe if it looks like he's gonna miss next year and opts in? Would the Clippers be better off with Kemba or Rondo, Beverley and Ibaka? Consider the answer to this if Reggie Jackson leaves in free agency.   Maybe swap Kennard instead of Beverley, but I'm guessing the Thunder may look at Kennard as a less valuable asset due to his contract (Beverley's is expiring, Kennard's four year extension is about to start). Doing that might require more picks. I'm not really sold on the idea that the Clippers would want to do that. What do you think?"
Reggie Jackson &gt; Hawks
Excuse me Reggie Jackson was eliminated yesterday
Bobby Potus is the east Reggie Jackson. man is gonna get paid
Reggie Jackson and terence Mann weren't either...
john collins not getting the bag -  the anti reggie jackson
That’s Reggie Jackson bro
"After Reggie Jackson, Bobby Portis is having a redemption year"
Clint in the Reggie Jackson goggles tonight
"Nah, give me Reggie Jackson"
"Ok now why would the Knicks sign Norman Powell or Reggie Jackson? We'd save more money resigning Burks to play Powell's role, and Jackson's a massive waste of time."
I agree. We should swap Schroder for Reggie Jackson.
"His leverage is that unless we find a team to sign and trade with, he's our only option outside of FA vet min players. I've seen this be compared to Tristan Thompson's contract on the ass end of Cleveland's Finals runs. I don't know what the vet min market looks like so who knows, we may find a Reggie Jackson  I had been saying Schroder is not a 20m/yr player since he joined us and he sure as shit proved that correct with his performance this year"
Honestly probably double that. I think almost any team full of Cap Space would gladly pay him that.   Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schroeder thinks he is
Whoever pays Reggie Jackson big bucks is gonna be mad when he’s not playing like he did in the playoffs
"First of all kawhi played the first 4 games and they split them, the Jazz very likely win that series if it started with kawhi out. The Jazz were up 20 at half and choked game 6, with Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson playing their minds out in the second half.  My initial argument was that a healthy jazz or clippers team would be a real test and those scenarios didn't end up happening so idek what you're arguing here."
"If Reggie Jackson keeps playing like a demigod, sure."
"Agreed. I really don’t have any reason or desire to hate the Clippers like I do, but Pat Bev brings it out of me. He prevents be from being impressed at how well other guys on your team stepped up and made a run this postseason. The heroics of dudes like Reggie Jackson, Paul George, and even Marcus Morris (who had a reputation himself but who stayed clean this postseason I think) who came up so big for y’all are partly lessened by Pat Bev’s antics."
"Lets play into this because it's kinda fun - his team needed him to go god mode against Dallas to advance, then immediately find themselves down 0-2 to a wounded Jazz team. They comeback and close out without him, had a scrappy but ill fated series where Paul George showed up for 1 game offensively and was a meh defender at best all series, then they needed bailed out by Reggie Jackson going HOT.  On the surface, yeah totally, why would he leave the *city* he wanted to go to, and a team 2 wins away from the finals? When you dig into it, why would he stay apart from the city?"
"Maybe he mistook batum for Reggie Jackson. It’s an honest mistake, they look the exact same."
Mark Jackson and Reggie Miller are on the same level of turrible for me.
"&gt; Is Dallas a better situation than that?   It obviously is. Dallas took you guys to 7 when Kawhi was healthy and Luka wasn't. I think if you add Kawhi to the Mavs then Dallas wins that series in 4 or 5, and that's even before we get around to removing Reggie Jackson and Batum from the Clippers. Luka and Kawhi paired up would be in the Finals this year. Two top 7 players together is much better than one top 7 player and one top 15-20 player."
Remember when John Wall lambasted Reggie Jackson for making the same amount of money as him some injury free years ago? “Pepperidge Farms Remembers” lol
"We need to remember that Kawhi really wanted to be in LA two years ago, before he'd ever actually played professionally in his hometown. It's totally possible he hasn't enjoyed it as much as he thought he would and might want something else now. He's really given no clues either way about what he wants.   But we do know he also made the Clippers get Paul George first before he would sign with them, presumably because he wanted to win championships, rather than ""just be in LA"". The Clippers are poised to probably lose Reggie Jackson in free agency and they might lose Batum as well. It's also possible Ibaka is out all next year recovering from his back surgery (after all, that kept MPJ out a full year), so it's possible Kawhi might not have as much faith in a Clippers core of PG, Mann, Morris (32 years old), Zubac and Beverley (33 years old). If you assume everyone else around the league gets healthy next year, I'm not sure that's a real contender. But Kawhi and Luka probably is."
"As a Clippers fan, at least he apologized but it's worthless if he keeps pulling this shit. I hate what he did. It detracts from all of the other likable players and the season the Clippers had when Kawhi, Ibaka, and then Zubac went down. Paul George playing his heart out. Reggie Jackson being damn near automatic and just an easy guy to root for. Mann developing."
"The Lakers probably win if they were healthy too, same with the Nets and the Nuggets. The Clippers without Reggie Jackson, Batum and Ibaka next year are not going to be title favorites just cause the Suns struggled more than they should have to put the Clippers away."
"Exactly, so it's possible he might feel the same about the Clippers, especially if Batum and Reggie Jackson leave in free agency and Ibaka's back surgery looks like it will keep him out next year."
Give Reggie Jackson the max you cowards!
Bad news- Reggie Jackson played his way into a contract that the Clippers can’t match.  Good news- Patrick Beverley’s $15 million a year contract will end soonish and they can stop wasting money on him.
Unless they sign and trade him somewhere of course. Pity you guys won't have that option with Reggie Jackson ☹️
As a detroit fan why are you so angry about the Suns lol  Unless you're just head over heels in love with reggie Jackson (which I totally understand if that's the case) I don't get it
"Damn, that's actually a much worse than it looks initially when you reexamine draft... when Kawhi, Klay, Butler, Kemba and Vucevic were still on the board. Hell even Tobias Harris or Isaiah Thomas. That was actually a great draft, a ton of role players that could contribute to championship level teams - the Morris twins, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, Bogdanovic. The odds were actually in your favour that year to get something worthwhile. Sorry that sucks."
"It also lasted like 4 possessions that went something like, Beverley shooting foul / and-1.  Beverly bricking an open layup.  Beverly lost on a screen.  Beverley kicking it out of the paint with 1 second on the shot clock to Reggie Jackson, who was already running back on defense (he missed a 35 footer).  The timing really couldn't have been any better lol."
"I’m a clippers fan, just flairing up for when the Raptors played in my hometown (Tampa).  You only watched Reggie Jackson, Kennard, and Rondo play in the playoffs and it shows so hard with how blind you’re commenting. Like seriously I don’t know how you keep clowning yourself even harder with every retort, it’s actually insane. You’re doubling down 😂😂😂  Reggie deserves bag after his playoffs but only his playoff offense lmfao. Reggie was a bench player just last series and plays poor defense in general. He surpassed expectations this playoffs no doubt but you’re talking like he’s Leonard and PG"
Thank you for the response.   I agree that Mook isn’t much of a leader but on the flip side I don’t think he was a locker room negative on the Knicks fwiw.   Also is DLO not a capable floor general? Sure he’s not Rubio level but he’s averaged like 7 assists a game for the past few years.  Patterson has to be included because the Clippers are so close to the hard cap. He’s an expiring that can be waived at least.   The Clippers would be thinned out a bit at the forward rotation with this trade but you can have PatBev as a backup PG. Kennard and Zubac can come off the bench as well as LouWill and Reggie Jackson (although the last two are kind of meh).
Hey man! There were a few Kevin Martin or Reggie Jackson plays in there too!
"14-15 season sits with me for the false hope.  SVG came in and waived Josh Smith in like December.  Brandon Jennings then leads us to a very nice run (I think we won 7 in a row at some point). He was looking like a potential all star and the team was actually looking like we could sneak into the playoffs. Then he goes down like early-mid feb, our season basically was over.  Pretty much happened again in 16-17 when Reggie Jackson went down I think late Nov-early december. Think we were 3rd or 4th in the East and we immediately became ass again cause of injuries to other players as well.  Been a hard decade as a pistons fan. Blake Griffin carried our sorry asses to the playoffs and he had to miss all but the final game of that sweep if I remember right. Then he was never the same again as a first option"
"Maybe if it's a decent salary cut.. I think Reggie Jackson vs. Pat Bev in these playoffs is an illustration of why it might not be a good idea.  Pat Bev for $13mil or Reggie Jackson for the $2mil vet minimum? You play in LA in a not-so-fast salary cap increase year, if you have Kawhi and PG13 you just need a 3pt defense guy of any position, you could keep signing minimum guys and buyout guys and trying them out 1 by 1 and you would probably approximate Pat Bev pretty easily."
TL;DR   1. Reggie Jackson  2. John Collins   3. Blake Griffin  4. Cameron Payne  5. Austin Rivers
"&gt; it's a worthy gamble  Because of Kemba's salary you have to factor in exactly what the Clippers would have to give up to match on a trade. To get to the $29+ million needed to trade for Kemba, the Clippers would have to probably trade Beverley, Kennard and Rondo. Considering that Reggie Jackson is probably also going to leave in free agency, that's basically swapping all of their point guards for Kemba."
"No so it's early bird rights.  Full bird rights mean y'all could pay anything over the cap to retain him (like you could with CP3), early bird just means you can pay up to 105% of the league average salary, which is around 10/yr.  Reggie Jackson has the same deal with the Clippers"
I rather have Reggie Jackson
"Reggie Jackson, back to OKC!"
In game 6 vs. LAC he started closing out on the ungodly sniper aka Reggie Jackson and it completely erased his 3 ball which prevented their offense from opening up becoming Steph curry reincarnated.
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
"Booker’s low assists are one thing. The issue is that hes consistently has a turnover problem in the past that hasn’t gone away despite not being the main playmaker. The only guy with at least 2.75 turnovers per game (he has 3.1) and the same or fewer assists per game is Embiid.   It’s just untrue to say all the things KAT’s better at is due to him being a center. Booker’s significantly worse from 3 for example and has been for years.  His advanced stats don’t just look bad compared to KAT’s or centers’, they look bad in general.   He has a negative bpm. Some of the guards above him who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard: Sexton, Reggie Jackson, Brunson, both Murrays, Devonte Graham, Haliburton, Clarkson, Fox, Brogdon, T.J., both Ball brothers, Kemba, Terry, Delon Wright, FVV, Jaylen, Westbrook, Beal, CJ, Mitchell, Jrue, and Conley.  His win shares per 48 is worse than qualifying  guards like CP3, Conley, Mitchell, Jrue, Trae, Brunson, CJ, PG, LaVine, Beal, Jamal, Lowry, TJ, Seth, Delon Wright, Jaylen, Reggie Jackson, Kemba, Clarkson, Connaughton, KCP, Rozier, Hardaway Jr., Brogdon, Campazzo and FVV.   Guys who played fewer games and still have a higher vorp include Kyrie, Russ, Zach, Beal, Jrue, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen, CJ, Terry, FVV, Brogdon, Fox, Shai, Jamal, both Ball brothers, Kemba, Haliburton, Lowry, Cam Payne, and Thybulle.  There is no reason for Booker to do so poorly in advanced stats across the board on such a good team where other guys do well in advanced stats. Not to mention his advanced stats were still incredibly low when he was a first option."
"Did you see his closeouts last series? Or him moving his feet? There's a stat of PG and Reggie Jackson shooting piss poor when defended by Ayton. Like, worse than when our wing defenders were on them."
"Middleton had 29 night, and I think Reggie Jackson actually is too."

A healthy Clippers team can give them trouble honestly. Reggie Jackson and Beverly really made that series competitive and slowed them down. Problem is CP3 got in the zone and the Clippers team was pretty worn out and spread thin.
it's time to ask the question  is reggie jackson better than the bucks?
"who would you rather sign this offseason, cam payne or reggie jackson?"
I was way more scared of Reggie Jackson than I am of Giannis lol
Looks like bridges took notes from pat Beverly and Reggie Jackson on defending
"- What if the refs call the foul on Reggie Jackson, which wouldn't have led to a crucial Matt Barnes turnover (2014 vs OKC) ? - What if Josh Smith &amp; Corey Brewer don't go berserk for 3 with Harden on the bench? (2015 vs Rockets)"
Reggie Jackson blasphemy
"his game was misunderstood and it appears it still is   dude was 21 ppg on 63% TS from 89-99  all he did was lead top offenses in the league because of his shooting and off ball movement, go look at those teams and you’ll be like wtf that was a top 1-7 offense???   like the 99 team, number 1 offense in the league with mark jackson, davis brothers, still on the bench jalen, 35 year old mullin , no one other than reggie plays more than 28.2 mpg   but people only saw 20 ppg and like 46% fg so they thought eh not that efficient not that impressive"
Reggie Jackson as well. Maybe to a lesser extent
If they get reggie Jackson they're the 4th  or 5th seed
"I could see Reggie Jackson being better for them. Could see them pursuing Simmons, too."
Would they be able to re-sign him if Reggie Jackson gets paid well?
I mean Reggie has gotten a lot better (to the point where I’d argue he’s a decent announcer) and I can’t think of any announcers on TNT now that Marv is gone that I’m not a huge fan of. I have no idea what JVG and Mark Jackson are talking about like 70% of the time lmao
"Flopping to get your opponent a tech is part of his game. He’s literally trying to affect the outcome of the game being played… how do you not see this?  He’s a wall in the regular season when teams with actual championship aspirations are testing things out. The jazz meanwhile try as hard as they possibly can and concoct a fundamentally flawed defensive system around him. Taking positive regular results as evidence of improvement and skill while ignoring how he gets played off the floor every damn playoffs. How many times did Reggie Jackson drive right at him and go high off the glass? Paul George was doing the same thing. There’s this narrative that Gobert single handedly makes opponents AFRAID to even approach the paint, but he gets rooked again and again. It’s embarrassing that Jazz fans try to compare him to Ben Wallace."
"Nah I mean Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson doesn’t really talk about the refs that much imo. I’m just comparing broadcasts"
Reggie Miller is on a different station. Do you mean Mark Jackson?
 Clippers are going to have trouble replacing Reggie Jackson too. He’s gonna get a bag somewhere and I’m not sure how they fill that hole
"The thing I’m talking about is that in nba, a timeout takes like 5 minutes but by rule it should only take 1 and a half minute. It takes forever to review something that is obvious. And they even spent 10 minutes just getting Reggie jackson off the field."
Yeah compare Kob to at least K’VON Huerter or Reggie Jackson smfh. OP almost had it
Yes lets lay Reggie Jackson 35 mil.
why would Reggie Jackson be telling you that
"To be fair, I MUCH prefer JVG’s complaining about the refs to being completely gaslit by Reggie Jackson saying every call is a good call"
"Reggie Jackson, Cam Reddish, and John Collins are the only ones who ""raised their stock""  The rest of those guys were gonna end up getting max contracts anyway if they want"
"&gt;Reggie Jackson wasn't trash in Detroit  So, he was waived just because? Lmao, 4th best player on a team that won the championship. Lebron, AD, and Rondo can't be the only ones to score if you want to win a championship"
Reggie Jackson wasn't trash in Detroit. He was injured. If you think KCP is a good player than I don't know what to say. Just because he's the 4th best player on the Lakers doesn't make him good.
"Why wouldn't you resign your most consistent shooter, arguably 4th best player in the playoffs? So, are you saying people shouldn't take a chance on Reggie Jackson because he might go back to being trash?"
Reggie Jackson
"Yeah all those commentators you mentioned are just classier than Mark Jackson and Reggie and them, I don't know what it is about them /s"
"Harlan and Breen are a 1a and 1b duo, in my opinion. I don’t think either is better than the other overall, but they also excel in different ways. They’re easily the top two(Eagle could arguably be put in there as a close second to them or even a 1c), so I understand some preferring Breen. I think JVG is really entertaining, and I love how much he knows about the rules of the game. Mark Jackson is really boring to me, and I actually always liked Webber.  I agree that Reggie is the best color commentator of the bunch, but I thing SVG will end up back in the booth now that he’s out in New Orleans. He was like Romo is for the NFL when he was in the booth in the Bubble doing color commentary, and I’d really enjoy hearing him do color commentary again.  I hope they bring in Ian Eagle as the second TNT guy behind Harlan, and then have Spero Dedes or Joel Meyers(preferably) for when they have a third game or a game where Eagle or Harlan aren’t available."

"He not only was but _is_ a legendary announcer. Ofc he fell off but I always thought his mishaps were pretty hilarious.   Other than Kevin Harlan and Mike Breen there are no actually great commentators in the NBA. To me it's no different listening to Mark Jackson Reggie Miller Chris Webber and so on, they're all really corny and don't actually provide the in-depth analysis you'd expect from legends in the sport.   With that point of view I at least had a laugh or two listening to Moreyball-Albert while still hearing the occasional great call. SVG ranting is also ok for me. But in terms of toptier commentary there's only Breen and Harlan really, so Albert having some signature calls with his legendary voice was always ok for me, even in 2021. I guess I just dont listen to the announcers for super sharp play by play because I can watch what's happening myself and don't need explanations most of the time as I've played organized ball for over 10 years. I just like to be entertained and hyped up while watching games and Albert was still very much capable of achieving this for me."
"i recognize Harlan as a great commentator (definitely much better than Marv) but i still much prefer Breen, personally. i also don’t like Webber at all. i think hes forgettable and boring as a commentator. Reggie is pretty good, and is better than each JVG and Mark Jackson, but i find the JVG and Mark Jackson dynamic very entertaining and i actually prefer that to Reggie’s pretty solid analysis"
*Reggie Jackson
"The Clippers players deserve more credit than Lue. Reggie Jackson balled out and PG was way more than a meme. It was clear in the early rounds that Mann was giving them solid minutes, but we were all shitting on Lue for pinching his minutes in favor of Luke Kennard.  I think everybody on this sub overstates the impact of coaches way too much anyways."
I submit that guys like Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne are not currently on good contracts because they're both about to end. A big part of what makes Dort's contract so good is that he has to stay on it for the next two seasons. A big part of what makes a contract good or bad is not just the money but also the years.
*Every perimeter defender on the Jazz gets blown by with ease by Reggie Jackson and Paul George*  /r/nba : Fucking Gobert. Fake DPOY!
"The thunder drafted 3 mvps and some real solid “others” like reggie jackson, cam payne, steve adams, serge ibaka."
Yeah rudy should stay in the corner and let Reggie Jackson get 40 points off of open layups lol
"Removing future transactions from it, the Kanter-Reggie Jackson trade was pretty bad for everyone involved. I can’t see if Utah even got the protected 1st out of it but they got Perk and Grant Jarrett so not a great return on their end either.  Kanter had his moments but was too big a defensive liability in OKC, Singler was a disaster, Augustin was okay for OKC at best, Reggie had maybe a good season and then was vastly overpaid and they only got one playoff appearance in Blake’s good year there?"
Reggie Jackson is a free agent this year... :)
Underrated: Reggie Jackson  Overrated: Dennis Schroder
"&gt; No one can organically build a team to beat four all stars, two of which are literally MVP level, as well as great bench veterans and dudes ring chasing on the tail end of their careers.  Uhhhh what the hell are you talking about, dude? Do you literally not remember that OKC squad at all? Harden, Westbrook, Durant and Ibaka were all drafted. Hell they even drafted Reggie Jackson.  They got vets in in that first year and if Presti had the freedom to go deep into the luxury tax like your GM is then he doubtless would've signed the veteran help required as well. Don't fucking revise history just for the heck of it."
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson better? 👀
Reggie Jackson and Batum are both FAs and probably wont stay this year
On most possessions Luka switched off PG and Kawhi on the PnR and targeted defenders like Reggie Jackson. That's when he went off. Later in close games when Kawhi would stick to Luka he would have terrible possessions that went nowhere.
Signing and trading Brogdon was more like the Thunder trading Reggie Jackson.  They also used one of the first rounders in the Brogdon deal to get Holiday.
"Man, people really sleep on Ibaka.   That was an awesome team. Even the role players were good - Young Perk,  KMart, Roberson, Nick Collison, Reggie Jackson, Nick Collison, etc"
"Yeah, and on top of that they may lose Batum and Reggie Jackson in free agency and Ibaka might miss all of next season alongside Kawhi, as Ibaka just had back surgery, and that can keep guys out for more than a year (just look at MPJ). On top of that the Clippers really don't have much in the way of tradeable assets and they're gonna be in the luxury tax, so it'll be very tough to make major improvements. I think they're easily the worst bet here given their odds. Two years from now, maybe, but not next year."
"You’re a bozo. 6MOY Harden who was there for 3 years when KD had 9 years with OKC and Reggie Jackson doesn’t compare to the guards on the Bucks. The fit was terrible, you named 3 non shooters (at the time) and thought you did something"
Westbrook harden ibaka reggie jackson
"Ah yes westbrook is so bad as is harden, ibaka, steven adams, reggie Jackson. Lol clown."
I’d still take Mark Jackson+JVG over Chris Weber or Reggie Miller every single time
"No Kawhi for the Clippers and maybe no Reggie Jackson. I think the Suns beat Denver in 6 or 7 even with Murray.  It's just the Warriors, Jazz, and Lakers."
I agree.  Reggie Jackson is a better third wheel for Kawhi than Lowry.
Still reeling from the fact the Pistons gave Reggie Jackson 80million.
"exactly, even if he was playing 6man in my Cavs, would those stats make him worth 6man money, or maybe like Toronto did with Lowry, Memphis with Tony Allen, and Pistons with Reggie Jackson, give him a starting role and starting minutes to help the rebuilt team into a contender or improve a winning culture."
"Im calling BS on the Reggie Jackson take, dude was balling when Kawhi was healthy. Look at that Dallas series  Completely agree with the Denver-Phoenix take. Jamal Murray isn’t turning that series around lol"
Mann was getting moments during the games Kawhi was playing. So was Reggie Jackson.
"Ah yes because Reggie Jackson&gt; Kawhi lmao, don't kid yourself, the clippers the Mavs faced were their best form"
"sure but you say it like he’s playing 1 on 5, he still lost and the clippers got substantially better as the playoff progressed. I mean reggie Jackson didn’t even start for the first two games the Mavs won lol."
Reggie Jackson to Pelicans today.
Sounds like Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson should get a bigger deal
He's talking about Reggie Jackson btw
Man what tf is wrong w/him lmao This has to be about Reggie Jackson lol
Yeah I believe he elbowed Reggie Jackson. Drummond is a Loon
Reggie Jackson maybe?  Edit: I just looked and RJ’s rebounding went from 4.7 to 3.2 to 2.2 in his first three years with Detroit lol
"anyone noteoworthy left aside from Markennen (or however you spell it), Schroeder and Reggie Jackson?  Im assuming Kawhi is guaranteed back to the clippers."
"Same with Reggie Jackson. No mention of no one even leaving the Clippers roster. Also, Clippers haven't announced their summer league roster. Something is BREWING."
"The Reggie system:  Ride the bench in OKC in the Finals, End up traded to Detroit, Get bought out by the Pistons mid-season, GLASSES REGINALD SHON JACKSON, Isolation scorer pulls Clippers into first ever Conference finals, End up signing long-term team friendly deal and take the Clippers to the promised land."
"I think if Kawhi is healthy and Reggie Jackson comes back and plays how he was in the playoffs, they are absolutely the best team in the west"
Wait what’s going on with Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson please
"Maybe y’all can get Reggie Jackson, him and D Rose would be a great PG duo"
"We've seen Reggie Jackson, starting Point Guard. That's not somebody I want to trust to run my half court offense for 35 minutes a night. He's definitely gotten to be a sweet shooter, but he's not really capable of playing the 1 on a team that needs their 1 to be a primary creator, and he's not a plus-defender.   He's a very good third guard, and he's a nice player to pair next to a ball-dominant taller guy. That has value, but I just don't think it's that far above the MLE."
Dinwiddie is nowhere near as good on three's. That much isn't a debate and I'll give to you. As far as everything else goes though Dinwiddie is pretty much straight up better. Reggie can't create his own shot effectively while Dinwiddie can. Dinwiddie can also create good plays for his teammates off of iso drives. His best ability and the reason he is even able to command 20m a year off an injury is that he has great bbiq and can hunt mismatches very very well. All in all you can put the ball in his hands often and count on him to do something decent with it. You can't do that with Reggie Jackson. Dinwiddie gives the Wizards a chance to be an actual good team because they won't rely on Beal to carry the entire load on offense. Reggie is just a role player (although he's definitely a good one and he was super clutch all playoffs long).
"There's John Collins still up but he's an RFA.  Reggie Jackson and Schroder are still up, I guess."
This guy said Reggie Jackson and the Knicks have mutual interest so I'll believe him too.
Reggie “spurs killer” jackson
"Can’t find an updated one but the biggest people left are kawhi, Reggie Jackson and John Collins from what I can remember"
"Schroeder I can't say I'm too surprised by. He's always been supremely confident to the point of being annoying haha. It was an issue in ATL too. He thought ATL should build around him and he played extremely selfishly. And he probably could have gotten a better deal in FA had he not shit the bed in the playoffs this season. It's weird to me that Reggie Jackson, who played pretty much the opposite, hasn't gotten a decent deal yet.  I also think Morey got real cocky by not trading Simmons for Harden (or Fertitta refused to do it). I was on the trade Simmons train last offseason. Honestly, I'd probably trade Simmons for CJ and 2 future 1sts considering that Dame might also leave."
"From a brief look at the depth chart, feels like you guys need more of an actual passer rather than. ascorer? Like Rondo vs. Reggie Jackson, George Hill vs. Isaiah Thomas... someone to set the table is what I mean."
"He could maybe get more. But he would be smart to go to a team with plenty of media coverage so he could make his name big again. Only reason he got big was because he was with chris Paul. He's gotta find a another guy like that to play off of and better his image. Clips actually need a pg if Reggie Jackson leaves. And with kawhi out, he's probably the second option."
"Thank goodness, this means we can still sign someone up to 4/42 and also get Niang on the BAE   Maybe Reggie Jackson?"
"I typed up a whole response and then realized you probably meant Jackson and not bullock lol. I also think they could use another ball handler but I think thats their number 2 need, and that they have options between a possible trade for dragic, Schroder, or Reggie Jackson.    Still I dont think there's any centers left that could either rim run or rim protect all that well (at least not anywhere close to Holmes or noel who didn't really cost that much)"
Unless they’re trading Randle they don’t have the salary to send out to give Shroeder’s delusional ass $25M per year. They’re either signing him with the remaining space or not at all. Hopefully they can secure him or Reggie Jackson as both would significantly upgrade the great Elfrid Payton
"Agreed, park Lakers much better. What’s left though is Fisher, Perk, Ibaka… Reggie Jackson."
I have no clue but if Dallas has any money left I'd throw all of it at Reggie Jackson.  He's the perfect player next to Luka
Lol it's a tanking/development year. Reggie Jackson does nothing for us long term.
"He might even be cheaper, as the Clippers can only offer him $10 million so it shouldn't be tough to top that. The Lakers could give Schroder over $30 million, which of course they won't, but with Schroder you might have more of a bidding war to deal with than you would with Reggie Jackson."
"I think if the Pelicans are gonna make a big push for a free agent point guard they'd probably go for Reggie Jackson, as they could really use more shooting."
"Could be the Pels, they expressed some interest I know. Would rather Reggie Jackson or we trade for someone"
We could take him on MLE if he agrees  Unless we get reggie jackson
"the following players are all better than any of your roleplayers, in most cases significantly:  * Nic Batum  * Marcus Morris  * Ivica Zubac  * Yes, Serge Ibaka  * Reggie Jackson (if he re-signs)  The following players are at least as good as any of your roleplayers:  * Terance Mann  * Luke Kennard  In general, not only do we have shooters at least as good as yours, but unlike you, ours can also defend."
"Clippers scare me more from the west especially if they keep Reggie Jackson  but yeah they got worse KCP,Kuzma,Mathews,Drummond,Shroeder,Harell and Caruso &gt; Westbrick,Nunn,Melo,Ellington,Ariza,Howard,Monk and Bazemore"
Clippers only priority should be finding a way to sign Reggie Jackson. (and Kawhi)
"They do, but don't you think they'd probably prefer Reggie Jackson?"
Probably similar impact to Reggie Jackson on the clips when they are both on.
Maybe you guys could go after Reggie Jackson? You can offer him more than the Clippers can.
Reggie Jackson probably 90% re-signing with the clippers right?
Reggie Jackson also still out there.
It would make people mad but I would rather pay Lonzo and get some extra wing help than keep Conley. The team is great on offense without him and he doesn’t help the defense.  Reggie Jackson looked like an all star out there against them.
Wonder if the Pelicans throw that money at Reggie Jackson now
"With Demar going to Chicago and Collins/Kawhi likely re-signing with their teams, looks like the only really big question marks left are Schroder, Oubre, and Reggie Jackson. Very little cap space left around the league for them."
Collins demar Reggie Jackson kawhi and a couple more
"DeRozan, Schroeder, Kawhi, John Collins, Oubre, Reggie Jackson, Markkanen, Kendrick Nunn"
SIGN AND TRADE REGGIE JACKSON FOR KYLE LOWRY
long shot but if we copped reggie jackson I’d bust in my pants frfr  ion even kno how we’d do it LOL
Why not Reggie Jackson?
"A hypothetical sign and trade could work out - but the question is do the Spurs (or any team?) actually want the contracts that the Clippers are sending out. Assuming Reggie Jackson resigns for $11m (the max he can with the Clippers) and Kawhi signs a 1+1 ($39m) they'd be at $162m\~ in payroll.      The tax apron would require them to get under $144m most likely.      So a hypothetical deal of Rondo + Yogi Ferrell (not fully guaranteed) + Daniel Oturu would amount to 10m (If derozen would even accept 10m). Then trade off the expiring contract of Pat Beverly + 2nd round pick into a team that can absorb the cap. It would put them close to below the tax apron.      But of course, none of this actually makes sense for the Spurs to take on Rondo, ferrell, oturu ha."
"A hypothetical sign and trade could work out - but the question is do the Spurs (or any team?) actually want the contracts that the Clippers are sending out. Assuming Reggie Jackson resigns for $11m (the max he can with the Clippers) and Kawhi signs a 1+1 ($39m) they'd be at $162m\~ in payroll.   The tax apron would require them to get under $144m most likely.   So a hypothetical deal of Rondo + Yogi Ferrell (not fully guaranteed) + Daniel Oturu would amount to 10m (If derozen would even accept 10m). Then trade off the expiring contract of Pat Beverly + 2nd round pick into a team that can absorb the cap. It would put them close to below the tax apron.   But of course, none of this actually makes sense for the Spurs to take on Rondo, ferrell, oturu ha."
Oubre sign and trade is definitely our best option. Reggie Jackson would honestly be better than Mills if we could get him.
"TPMLE - Oladipo (hail mary), Danny Green, Reggie Jackson (likely a hail mary as well) Re-sign Oubre and seek a trade? or Oubre Sign &amp; Trade?  Those are really the only things left."
You really think Reggie Jackson goes back to the Clips? He'd be turning down more money for a team that probably won't contend this season.
My projections  *  Kawhi Leonard (LAC) * Demar Derozan (DAL) * Dennis Scrotum (OKC) * Spencer Dinwiddie (WAS) * John Collins (ATL) * Josh Hart (NOP) * Victor Oladipo (BOS) * Danny Green (LAL) * Andre Iguodala (GSW) * Patty Mills (SAS) * Reggie Jackson (LAC)
Am I crazy for preferring Reggie Jackson over him?
If Reggie Jackson plays like he did during the playoffs then he would be a solid pickup for most teams
Best remaining players  *  Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Khem Birch * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala *  JJ redick * Patty Mills * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis
"I would love to have Reggie Jackson come to Miami in a sign-and-trade for Kendrick Nunn and be a backup PG for Lowry, but he deserves a starter role."
"longer the free agency goes, the more likely reggie jackson is gonna come back as a clipper. Wonder how much he's gonna get now."
"I know JVG said it on National TV so it might be mainstream but ""Mr. June"" for Reggie Jackson is an incredible nickname"
Reggie Jackson would be a huge get for the PG needed teams out there. I’m surprised the Knicks didn’t go for him.
Still a bunch of names out there yet to sign.  -  John Collins  -  Reggie Jackson  -  Danny Green  -  Melo  -  DeRozan  -  Dipo  -  Oubre  I know I took a bit of a nosedive at the end but still solid names.
Wonder what kind of contract reggie jackson is gonna get from the clippers. All the teams looking for PGs cap space dried up. gotta think the clips can re-sign him on a team friendly deal
Bruh I thought you meant Reggie Jackson lmao
"Yes that will still be a weakness. I think it remains to be seen how much better our defense will be if Conley and Mitchell are healthy. Admittedly guard defense is the least important, but Conley only played one game in the Clippers series, and Mitchell was a parking cone all series, both getting blown by again and again by Reggie jackson.   *Hopefully* a lot of our perimeter defense will be better (not great, but better) simply by having both healthy"
"Take the western conference last year. How many starting PGs would you take ahead of Schroeder? Conley, Paul, Murray, Reggie Jackson, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, curry, Ball, Fox, dejounte Murray, Russell, John wall, and Maledon.  I see maybe 2 I’d take after him. That’s pretty bad lol. He’s not v good. He’s a sixth man."
Except for Reggie Jackson ;-)
"Reggie Jackson was still dropping 20 with Kawhi, and he was great in the regular season."
Or Reggie Jackson after Kawhi went down
"I’m hoping we can get Patty Mills, Danny Green, or Kelly Oubre, Gay, and hell why not Reggie Jackson.   We’ll do a sign and trade for shroeder and Drummond to to any team for pocket lint or chewing gum haha"
"I think that's fair, I would've rather seen them go for an older guard who helps them improve but also helps the younger guys, or just a really good player, if you still have cap space, reggie Jackson 4 year 60/70 mil would be great"
Best remaining players  * Kawhi Leonard * Demar Derozan * Dennis Shroeder * Spencer Dinwiddie * John Collins * Kelly Oubre Jr * Josh Hart * Paul millsap * Victor Oladipo * Danny Green * Justice Winslow * Lou Williams * Andre Iguodala * JJ redick * Patty Mills * Rudy Gay * Lauri Markennan * Malik Monk * Reggie Jackson * Kendrick Nunn * Talen Horton Tucker * Terence Davis  Obviously Kawhi is the big fish but there is still a lot of talent left
How is this the same Gobert that Terance Mann and Reggie Jackson were taking turns abusing for us?
If I’m him I’m signing on the minimum to a contender and hope that I have a Reggie Jackson/Dwight Howard/Rajon Rondo sort of break out deep playoff run and then get some money the next off season.
"Why do people insist on proclaiming the Lakers a finished product when most of their big free agency moves still have yet to be decided on? Maybe this is the finished roster or maybe by this time tomorrow they have Buddy Hield, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills and THT added to the team, or maybe DeRozan signs for the MLE. It's literally a huge incomplete for much of their roster right now.   We should at the very least wait until 24 hours into free agency have passed before making judgements about teams. Things are going to change wildly for a lot of teams tomorrow and over the next week. Free agency didn't end when everyone went to bed on the first day.  This would be like saying the Clippers look awful because right now Kawhi and Reggie Jackson are gone. Let's wait and see what happens before passing judgment on anyone."
"I don't know who has the cap space left to just absorb Morris, but even if someone could, I think the Clippers will still be way above the apron. It'll depend on what happens with Reggie Jackson and Kawhi, of course. [This was $134 million just for these 8 players right here,](https://i.imgur.com/xukgBa5.png) and that figure probably goes up to $137 with Kawhi's new contract (whenever he signs it). Even if you're theoretically dumping Morris, you're replacing him with DeRozan probably making at least that much, so it doesn't help them get under the apron. It's theoretically possible, but I see the Clippers becoming hard capped as extremely unlikely this year. Just too much salary already on their books."
Shouldn't you guys instead focus on getting Reggie Jackson paid? That guy played like an all-star for you guys.
"Lakers are not done obviously.   People don't see it.   They didn't signed THT yet. Schroder still unsigned as well.   DeRozan is likely the one Lakers-Clippers-Spurs are fighting over.   But Kawhi too hasn't signed with the Clips.   I sense a bigger wave coming. Especially with these contenders role players in Danny Green, Reggie Jackson, Andre Igoudala, Carmelo Anthony, etc are still staying put. Oubre hasn't signed as well.   Something is up for sure."
"Before today I figured Reggie Jackson would get a big offer and leave, but now there's really no cap space out there for him, and a sign and trade doesn't make sense cause the Clippers can only offer him $10 million, and I'm guessing he'd rather just stay if it's the same money as he could get elsewhere. I think at this point he only leaves if he really hates the Clippers (which doesn't appear to be the case), or the Clippers play extreme hardball and refuse to give him anything close to that $10 (which also seems highly unlikely). At this point I'll be surprised if he signs elsewhere. Who all has the cap space to make him a big offer still?"
"that was with reggie jackson, who we will have to see if he re-signs or goes elsewhere."
They need to keep Reggie Jackson dude was incredible in the playoffs
"I’m not sure why the Clippers trade Kennard, he was good for them off the bench. You already have Paul George who is a good all around scorer and defender. Why take away shooters?  The Clippers made the WCF because of shooting, and Reggie Jackson he was playing at such an elite level"
Feel like Kawhi is backing things up. Clippers can’t make their decisions until they know what he’s doing which effects DeMar DeRozan &amp; Reggie Jackson &amp; probably Schröder too tbh.
If he played like Reggie Jackson he would get the 84 mill

"&gt;You think the majority of people on this sub aren’t like &lt;15 years old man?? Come on now. You can’t just trust everyone knows every single person who is available just because they’re on this sub lol.  If I'm having a specific conversation about free agency with someone then yes I expect them to know the market lol  &gt;And honestly, if you think any of those guys you listed are even close to as good as Paul was for the Suns last year then you’re the one who is out of the loop my friend  Well like I've already said they don't need an exact replacement for CP3 they just need a quality PG. If u look at the on/off numbers throughout the whole season and particularly in the playoffs Booker doesn't even particularly need Chris Paul  &gt;Reggie Jackson would’ve been someone you could’ve actually listed who would be a decent option  That's another one, I would've rather had him or a handful of others than paying an aging and declining Chris Paul but hey I get it...Suns fans aren't quite there yet because they just came off a Finals appearance. A year or two from now, you'll probably be begging to get rid of this contract"

Reggie Jackson in OKC vibes with Russ 👀
Reggie Jackson
"Some team is about to get him on a short term steal, then he'll Reggie Jackson his way into a bigger role and contract. Then he'll underperform with his larger contract and role, and this will go on back and forth for a few more cycles until his career just sort of ends."
I’ve been saying this in regards to Reggie Jackson. You don’t need him to be the second best guy on a playoff team but he showed he’s good enough to step into that role as a pretty lights out shooter(with magic goggles).   Just because the Pistons overpay was 15 million doesn’t take the cap into account
So who’s paying Reggie Jackson?
Pls just don't take Reggie Jackson from us
"It's pretty standard.  Likely a 2 year minimum, player option 2nd year, no trade clause first year.  He can opt out and go for early bird rights next year if he wants to stick around.  Basically the same situation as Reggie Jackson this year"
"If they used their taxpayer MLE ($5.9M), then they would only have minimum contracts left to offer (outside of early bird rights for Reggie Jackson).  Instead, Batum took the minimum ($3.5M) which leaves them with the taxpayer MLE option for someone else."
"Yep, it's ridiculous.    If Morris/Reggie Jackson/Batum aren't shooting lights out, they're done. And obviously they're not going to shoot lights out in a playoff series"
Reggie Miller is an idiot. Only commentator worse is Mark Jackson

"i don't like a lot of their players honestly   Zubac gets played off the court half the matchups  Ibaka is injured  Beverely as a point guard puts 0 pressure on teams (averaged 3 apg per 36, he'd be fine next to a Luka cause Luka is the point guard)   Marcus Morris can play 30+ minutes and you might not notice a single thing he did, he had 4/2/1 in 33 mins last game, that's not even an anomaly  Reggie Jackson - another just guy out there who thinks he's better than what he is"
Reggie Jackson was better than “replacement level” 🙄  also Russ still played over half of that season. Harden has gone multiple full seasons with replacement level forwards and still made playoff runs
"My stepdad went to batting practice back in the 80's and every pitch Reggie Jackson would miss he'd say, ""Oh I woulda crushed that.""  or ""I would have creamed that one.""  Reggie Jackson got tired of it walked up to him nose to nose and said, ""You wouldn't have done SHIT!""  all of his friends and other people in the crowd laughed at him.  Good times."
Yeah and he got bought out   Kennard can’t play over Reggie Jackson who is terrible and making a lot less  Who wants to pay a player 15 Million that is worse than Reggie Jackson
HARLAN &amp; REGGIE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Van Gundy Marv and Jackson
Nope. Remember it’s all Doc’s fault for making PG hit the side of the backboard and his bad rotations.   Like playing Reggie Jackson damn near thirty minutes and giving Kennard a DNP. You know?
"They don't have a great defense, so they need a great offense. But unlike every other team with a great offense, they don't have a supernova at the heart of their team(Steph/Dame/Jokic/Luka etc...) or a beautiful system(like Spurs).    Instead they rely on roleplayers(Reggie Jackson, Morris, Batum etc...) shooting unbelievably well in order to win and if they shoot under 40% their offense crumbles."
&gt; embiid so soft he cant even back down AC lol   &gt;doris is right up there with reggie/cwebb/mark jackson for worst commentators  Pot meet kettle.
"Yeah Clippers, play Reggie Jackson more minutes please"
"I was playing a series in NBA 2K20 against a team with Reggie Jackson and it was amazing how bad he was in-game. He would just dribble in circles and then jack up a shot, and almost never pass. He would keep doing the same hesitation move, which allowed me to steal the ball easily. On defense, he would die on every screen and foul on every drive.  it was fairly realistic"
"Still coming off back injury; only played 3 games. He’s gonna be key to being more versatile defensively than Zubac who’s slower and can’t hope to keep up with Luka on switches   Ibaka’s important but I also think they need to play Terrance Mann more to be bigger (rather than Beverly and Reggie Jackson), that way they have a bigger defense that can switch way better. Luka wouldn’t be able to baby them as easily"
I heard Reggie Jackson was the one who invited everyone
Clippers shot 27.5% from 3 and had Zubac and Reggie Jackson as the main defender on Doncic.  We won’t reverse sweep but let’s not act like we got completely outplayed by the Mavs
"Jaren Jackson Jr ain’t a starter Reggie? Lmao, he clearly never watched a Grizzlies game."
"Agreed   You remember the famous Reggie Jackson quote, right?  ""They don't boo nobodies.""  It's 100% a sign of respect. They wouldn't have chanted towards Solomon Hill."
"Then what is Pat Bev going to do out there? Time to play Reggie ""the shades shooter"" Jackson starter"
"Literally half their team is shooting over 40% from three this season. It's kind of bizarre honestly.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2021.html  Like, Rajon Rondo and Reggie Jackson are both shooting the lights out. Who could have predicted this?"
It's like you people don't even watch the Clippers. He's been benched all season since Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann has all been playing better. This isn't new news.

I feel terrible for Pistons fans who had to watch Reggie Jackson and Drummond together lmao
I don’t know why they play Reggie Jackson over him when they have Bev and Rondo?  As an armchair coach my Clippers rotation would look like this:  Bev (24) / Rondo (24)  PG (38) / Luke (18)  Kawhi (38)   Morris (28) / Batum (22)  Zubac (28) / Ibaka (20)
"Yeah, you don’t know shit cause Kennard is not good   The mistake was giving him that contract, not DNPing him   Though, he could maybe get some minutes over Reggie Jackson, but his play was a reason for their late season success"
Bruh what are you talking about there were a ton of small playmakers better than him. Didn’t Reggie Jackson avg like 9 assists in 2015??
Reggie Jackson isn't a good defender either.
"""Big Government"" for Reggie Jackson is still my favorite, although I'm definitely biased. He got it for always coming in clutch with the bailout threes in close games; not something that was evident yesterday."
"My comment wasn't about whether he was good offensively; It was about whether he can control the offense and be the main facilitator the way players like Lebron, harden and chris paul can, and the answer is he can't. He is one of the best offensive players without a doubt, but that factor is missing from him.   also, offensive rating is impacted greatly by the player's team. Reggie jackson has an offensive rating of 116.8, and zach lavine has an offensive rating of 114.9. Does that mean Reggie jackson is better than zach lavine offensively?  Moreover, offenses have shot up a mile since even 2017, with teams recording highest offensive ratings in the history of the nba. That inflation explains how his offensive rating has improved throughout the years."
"It's the defense too. With his season on the line Kawhi didn't defend or get stops against Jamal Murray or Jokic last year. They barely got by Luka last year too even on that game winner Reggie Jackson was the defender on Luka.   Kawhi is in the same class as guys like Curry he only plays offense and saves his energy on defense for offense even in the biggest moments. With his season on the line Curry wouldn't guard Ja Morant even though he's the best matchup for Morant on the Warriors, and Morant sent him home.  If Lebron was in these situations with his season on the line he would have been guarding the opposing teams best player and found a way to make a defensive play or at least try to make a defensive play."
Last year when luka hit the game winner the announcers were asking the same question. Leonard played on him for awhile after that. Then I think Reggie Jackson was on him for the last shot. I love that it feels like an actual rivalry with the clippers from two first round series.
"Isn't it the reverse? They did't play him enough in key minutes. Reggie Jackson played near equal mins and scored 2 points. Playoff Rondo makes good decisions down the stretch, at least he did when he won with Boston and last year with Lakers,."
I find the two main teams for espn are polar opposites. Jvg and Jackson are too critical of players and the state of the game while Doris sees everything out of rose tinted glasses. Neither groupings am I particularly excited to listen to.   But none of them are as bad as Reggie Miller who is just constantly wrong on what he’s seeing and just has a poor presentation skill and is unable to articulate
"The Mavs hunted Reggie Jackson &amp; scored damn near 30pts on him alone, they did it last year too, Mavs run their offense through him.  Him &amp; Mook were horrendous."
Clippers should stop switching Zubac onto Luka. And they should not give any minutes to Reggie Jackson.
Both teams employed Reggie Jackson at one point
Reggie Jackson shouldn’t see another minute unless he’s on fire
What about Reggie Jackson
Now it's Lue and Reggie Jackson
I don’t know who sucks more. Reggie Jackson or Kristaps Porzingas
Reggie jackson sucks
Reggie Jackson and Rondo are horrific
Send Reggie Jackson to the G league
So basically they could've potentially had both Middleton and Reggie Jackson. Okay yeah that's a pain :(
Is reggie jackson playing pickup?? wtf was that shot lmaoooo
Reggie Jackson trash. Prove me wrong
Why do clippers still keep playing Reggie Jackson lmao
Reggie jackson is dog shit
Reggie Jackson with a typical Clippers like dirty play
Reggie Jackson on luka one-on-one...
"Yeah but you guys were starting to turn the corner and develop into a playoff team, which started with that winning streak. So he got injured at the worst possible time. You don't trade for Reggie Jackson if Jennings stayed healthy, so the playoff Pistons at 2016 would've been better than the actual team. Unless Jackson was better for you guys than pre-injury Jennings, I dont really recall"
I know it’s muscle memory but bobby smurda looking reggie jackson always do a pump fake for nothing and drives. Nobody is being fucking faked by that shit anymore
Reggie Jackson looks like a kid who’s hanging out with his dad’s friends
Reggie jackson got pretty good handles man fucking bobby smurda can ball
"Or Reggie Jackson, he'll wake up on the right side of the bed and hit like 5 3s in the 4th."
"Shit, I thought they were being led by Terrence Mann and Reggie Jackson"

Reggie Jackson
1.Kawhi  2. Paul George  3. Marcus Morriss  4. Zubac  5. Luke Kennard  6. Terrence Mann  7. Patrick Beverly  8. Rajon Rondo  9. Ibaka   10.Reggie Jackson
"and KD with 36 in G6 and 33 in G7, OKC media asked why he only shot 5/5 from 3 and he had to say that's 100%. That's a good percentage  also Reggie Jackson dropping 32 in an OT win while Westbrook shot 6/24. gave Reggie the confidence to want a starting spot"
"Absolutely. MJ (GOAT or arguable GOAT), Pippen (top 50 player/a GOAT wing defender), Rodman (one of the GOAT rebounder/defender), Kukoc (swiss army knife 6th man), and Phil Jackson (arguable GOAT coach at best/top 3 coach at worst).  This was a time where not many teams even had 2 top 20 players in the league, much less top 10. The Bulls arguably had 2 of the top 5 players. The only other teams were Orlando (Shaq/Penny), Seattle (Payton/Kemp), and Utah (Stockton/Malone). Houston had an old and aging Big 3 with Hakeem, Drexler, and Barkley but they got swept by Seattle.  The Knicks were built around one superstar in Patrick Ewing (who's second banana was John Starks). The Pacers were built around one star in Reggie Miller (that's like building around Klay Thompson today). Those teams were good but nothing compared to today's league where you need 2 all-stars at minimum to even think about contending. A team with a John Starks type as their 2nd best player wouldn't make the playoffs."
"you realize Chalmers was drafted for his defense right...? Chalmers routinely took the tougher assignment. lol Spurs put Kawhi primarily on Harden. Tony Parker and Gary Neal were Westbrook's main defenders yet Harden was still faaaar better in that series  nope Westbrook's series was worse than Harden as a starter in Houston  Westbrook against Memphis 26/10/8 and 5TO on 48% TS  Harden against Portland 27/5/6 and 3.5 TO on 52% TS  only difference was Harden didn't have the luxury of a KD being the main offensive threat to bail him out. like in OT of G4 with OKC down 2-1, Westbrook shoots 0-3 getting bailed out by KD and Reggie Jackson"
The list of players who didn't like playing with Westbrook is as follows:   -Reggie Jackson
"If that's how you feel, that's how you feel.   I mean you're not wrong in the sense that he was better with the Cavs and the Heat, but he was also younger.   That's why I made the Reggie Jackson comparison on the Yankees. Reggie isn't even close to being one of the Yankees all timers and only spent 4 years there, but despite the many great players the Bronx Bombers have had he still has his number retired.   One can be great without being the greatest.   It not possible for him to pass Kareem, Magic, Kobe, Jerry, Pat, or Phil. And short of a three peat, he is not going to catch Shaq.   Everyone else on that list is a role player; Wilt, James, Pau, etc. I don't see how him and Anthony are not on at least those players levels with 2 titles."
"Curry is bigger than most pgs. He's bigger than Kyrie, Schroder, Conley, Morant, Lillard, Kemba, Rozier, Reggie Jackson/Patrick Beverley etc."
u reggie jackson 😂
"I'm really curious to see what the Clippers point guard rotation is gonna be like in the playoffs. It's highly unusual to go three deep at any one position, so will Rondo, Beverley and Reggie Jackson all get consistent minutes? Or will one of them basically be out of the rotation? To answer your question about why Rondo might not get more than 25 mpg, it's probably because Lue is gonna want to play those other guys too."
anti big government? what did reggie jackson do to kemba?
"1. Kawhi 2. Kyrie 3. Butler 4. Klay 5. Kemba 6. Isaiah 7. Vucevic 8. Mook Morris 9. Tobi Harris 10. Valanciunas 11. Mirotic 12. Bojan Bogdanovic 13. Reggie Jackson 14. Tristan 15. Kanter 16. Kieff Morris 17. Bertans 18. Burks  I stopped there, the other guys are pretty irrelavant even if some had a decent career (Bismack, Knight, Shump), had a lot of trouble ranking Isaiah"
1. Kawhi 2. PG13 3. Zubac 4. Ibaka 5. Marcus Morris 6. Terance Mann 7. Reggie Jackson  8. Jay Scrubb
"Shades of Reggie Jackson on the Thunder. Can win you playoff game when he's hot, can put up solid numbers as the main guy. Not a star though."
"These are all good points, and one in particular that I overlook/forgotten about is the number of times Luka doesn't get the call and either gets in trouble with a bad shot, bad turnover, and/or not getting back on defense cuz he's complaining too much.   The picks and roll that i'm actually particularly interested in not with KP, but with the smalls of Dallas - THJ/Brunson/Smith/Richardson. Forcing a small to switch onto Luka was what they did last year (forcing Reggie Jackson to guard Luka). The Clippers will (hopefully) be prepared better for this this year. So that is interesting to see.   Also Serge I feel will be a very important addition to this equation as well; another decent switchable big and rim protector. Although i have no idea about his health and how well he's moving at the moment."
Clippers:  reggie Jackson 43.3% Paul George 41.1% Kawhi leonard 39.8% Marcus Morris 47.3% Pick last player: Luke kennard 44.6% Nic batum 40.4%
"B+ :  \- We finally stopped the whole ""chase the 8th seed at all cost"" and picked a direction, we'll have a high pick  \- 2 of the 3 rookies looked great  \- the ""bets"" we made on Grant, Jackson and Plumlee all trned out better than I expected  \- despite being bad, we were competitive for most of the season, the games weren't unwatchable  \- I didn't have to watch Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson think they are Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook while actually being Erick Dampier and Jeff Teague  \- If Hayes looked better it would've been an A"
"Pat Bev pretty much didn’t play in that series either, he was so important for their perimeter defence considering his back up was Reggie Jackson. I think both teams are relatively healthy now, hopefully we will get a great series"
I hope the Clippers get swept in the first round and Kawhi leaves and Paul George asks for a trade and they’re stuck with Beverly and Reggie Jackson and never make the playoffs again
"It goes: Pat Bev, KD, Reggie Jackson."
That series ends in 5 if Doc doesn’t idiotically coach the game away and put Reggie Jackson as the single defender on Luka for the last minute shot
"In order: Mark Jackson, JVG, Reggie Miller, Vince Carter please stop before you even get started. Id say Dorris too, but I think she's at least put in the work, though ive reccently realized her commentary mostly amounts to being a big market homer and talking constantly about how big and strong everyone is."
Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson
"I think it will be, Clippers still don't have a solid 5 man rotation. They have one person(Kawhi) who can kinda guard AD/Lebron and then every lineup has 4 guys that will get bullied or blown by off the dribble. Lebron in particular will just screen off Kawhi and rampage through whoever is playing PG(Reggie Jackson/Rondo/Beverly) or beat Zubac/Ibaka off the dribble for an easy dunk whenever he wants.   Meanwhile the Clippers have to score on one of the best defenses in the league, and their offense is still too dependent on jumpshooting and shooting crazy high %s from 3. If Morris isn't shooting 50% from the corner, or they have to bench Reggie Jackson because he can't defend Lebron on switches, their offense will stall."
Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson.   Just hire Brent Barry.
"He's the master at talking for minutes without saying anything of value, my man strictly speaks in clichés. He also drones on with the most boring monotone voice in sports. He's so bad at commentating that he makes me appreciate Marc Jackson and Reggie Miller more."
"Wish we could just get a whole new set of analysts across all networks. Webber was not good, Mark Jackson is bad, Reggie Miller is just okay. Give us someone who can break down the game in real time, because most of them can't consistently."
"Two down, Reggie/Mark Jackson to go"
Don’t be so hard on yourself. You also had Greg Monroe. And Josh Smith. And Reggie Jackson.
we made reggie jackson take 12 three pointers (props for making 6). would much rather him shoot than say a kawhi lay up after lay up
"If Reggie Jackson is your second best player, you're probably not going to win."
"I about lost my shit when KP was posted up against Rondo at the shoulder, and this dude hits a jumper. Just post him up you’re literally 13 inches taller than him!! He did the same exact thing last game except with Reggie Jackson on him"
Reggie Jackson looks like he’s the real culprit LOL
&gt;Looks like reggie jackson and an insect had a baby.
"KP would likely be drawing gobert out of the paint, so I think that opens up more space for Luka to operate. Don’t think KP has a shot at posting up gobert tho since he can’t post up Reggie jackson"
Kawhi said that to Reggie Jackson earlier this season
"Reggie Jackson ""I didn't give the ball up for this shit"""
"Which has always been wild to me because they’re effectively the same height. I think we’ve become numb to the fact that Porziņģis is 7’3”. *7’3”*. That’s not normal. He’s three inches taller than Embiid playing like a spot-up shooter unable to back down Reggie Jackson in the post.  Meanwhile, Marjanović is out there actually playing up to his height when he’s only ¾” taller than Porziņģis."
He also can't hit short Jumpers guarded by Reggie Jackson
Did Reggie Jackson got spitted? haha
"So, Reggie Jackson?"
Looks like reggie jackson and an insect had a baby.
"Foul trouble was bad, I get it, but Kawhi was actually on the floor and at some point you have to blame him for not playing well during that horrible stretch they had. Kawhi scored the same as Reggie Jackson, don’t know how that’s PG’s fault"
"The 3rd quarter was bad, but I thought the Clippers as a whole were bad most of the entire second half. PG tried in the 4th, I'll give him that. But the biggest problem, I think anyway, is that the best player for the Clippers in the second half was Reggie Jackson and that just can't happen. Without Reggie, it honestly could have been a 25+ point blowout at the end of the third."
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
"Reggie Jackson should’ve taken it, he was on fire in the 3rd"
"The clippers make the WCF with a real shot at a title and the warriors don’t make the play in tournament. It’s not even a question.  Teams can’t double Steph on the clippers and if they do PG and Reggie Jackson make them pay. They’ve also got a good presence inside with batum and zubac to keep defenders inside. Steph doesn’t fit well into iso ball but with some adjustments the clippers are for sure a better team.  Kawhi struggles to make 25 ppg as a primary scorer. The big thing he does bring is his ability to attack the rim with his size and athleticism, something the warriors could benefit from. He also fits really well into Kerrs “switch everything” defense.   So to answer your question, yes, Kawhi to the dubs next year to join Steph klay and 2waywiggs!"
Reggie Jackson looks like some sorta Miyazakian monster in this pic.
"I mean, you held them to 100 total despite reggie jackson going bomber mode, that requires good defense"
"In this picture, but also the replay, Reggie Jackson just completely ignores all of this. He's like, I'm not getting murdered by Rondo too."
Reggie Jackson looks like he wants to be anywhere else in that moment.
Honestly fuck the kp haters. He hit a couple huge 3s. Played good ass defense all game minus one bad ball fake from morris. Everyone will point to that and not the 3 from reggie fucking jackson the play before on a late closeout by doncic. Luka is amazing but at times he makes us a black hole on offense and slows the tempo so much. If you just looked at the box score you would think this game was dominated by luka but in the 2nd half he was not good really. Also kawhi must really want an early vacation.
"It would've been forgivable if he redeemed himself.  You can't be letting the Mavs' plan of letting Reggie Jackson and Morris beat you happen. Jackson took 16 shots, Morris 13, PG13 14 shots only.  You never settle for 14 shots in a must-win if you are Paul George and Kawhi has a bad game. You fucking step up. Look at Luka, nothing was happening and he took 37 shots. THJ came big."
"He WAS passive on offence.  He HAD too many turnovers in the 2nd half.  And, I wasn’t wild about his team defence.  He seems too young to be dragging slow feet on defence.  I’m not saying Reggie Jackson is a great defender....I guess I expected more active feet and body from Kawhi"
yeah he passed out of it but it seemed to get rondo pulled out of the game or pulled off luka  maybe just because the clippers were down by a bunch and subbed reggie jackson back in for the 3 point shooting
"Yeah, when the best player has a shit game, you step up. 23/10/6 is the best the 2nd best player could do in a must-win? How are you gonna be called a 2nd superstar and settle for 14 shots  Mavs wanted Reggie Jackson to take those shots and he let their plan happen"
Reggie Jackson was out of position so the fouls on him I guess
"Carry what bums?  Kawhi scored 20 on 19 shots.. Reggie Jackson nearly out scored Kawhi tonight, Morris had 4 less points than Kawhi"
"He gets praised for the whole “silent leader” shit but people need to stop giving him that pass, the dude needs to fucking step up and not let Reggie Jackson out score him"
Reggie Jackson deserves better.
"Reggie Jackson scored 20, Morris 16  Kawhi.. 20... how’s that acceptable"
We won’t ignore the turnovers but we won’t ignore Reggie Jackson scoring as many points as Kawhi Leonard..  Also Reggie Jackson was hitting 3s in the clutch while Kawhi air balled the tying shot
Get Reggie Jackson some help!
"Reggie Jackson scored 20, Morris scored 16  Kawhi scored 20.. with an air all to tie the game that’s unacceptable"
Reggie Jackson cant win with these cats
2nd stars of each team  broke: PG13 and KP  woke: Reggie Jackson and THJ
Jesus Christ how is Reggie Jackson and  nearly outscoring a Kawhi  He also airballed a crunch time 3
No Reggie Jackson formed against me shall prosper
Kawhai and PG need to grow a sack and tell Lui how they’ll be playing defense and just take the shots for themselves. Two “all world” defenders and they’re happy to let Reggie Jackson and Rondo guard Luka. It’s a fuckin joke. If I was a Clippers fan I’d be pissed
"reggie jackson can’t miss, maybe draw up a play for him?"
"Reggie Jackson about to hit the 3, I’ll kill myself if he makes it"
Reggie jackson 3 and overtime please.
Clutch FTs...but I have a feeling we seeing OT tonight. Calling a Reggie Jackson 3
JUST GUARD REGGIE JACKSON
REGGIE JACKSON. MARCUS MORRIS. KAWHI LEONARD
Reggie Jackson somehow turned into a sniper lmao
  Reggie Jackson (Falcon) best player on Clippers tonight lmao
Reggie Jackson I swear....
Reggie Jackson needs help
Why is Reggie Jackson taking 16 shots ever
Reggie Jackson is cracked
Kawhi can’t carry shit. Reggie Jackson and pg13 ballin rn
Reggie Jackson has more points than Kawhi
wait how is reggie jackson with 17 pts the leading Clippers' scorer?? kawhi and PG both have less than 17 pts??
"Let me know what y'all think. I have a pet theory that Reggie Jackson is cursed and he can never win anything, wherever he goes he brings post season disappointment. I've been saying this for years, since at least his OKC stint."
"""He is 6 of 15""  why has Reggie Jackson taken 15 shots"
Reggie Jackson ISO while 4 Clippers stand around can’t be the play call right?
Reggie Jackson is shockingly bad at finishing at the rim
You love to see Reggie Jackson hit his shots early cause that fool won’t pass later and will look for his
Because he’s Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson the clips leading scorer. Kawhi got 15 on 16 shots and 4 turnovers.
Why does Reggie Jackson have more shots than Paul George lmao
"The big adjustment they made way stopping playing zone and going man to man. They were getting burned by Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris 3’s, clippers offense has stagnated without that, and two good plays got the Mavs confidence rolling"
Props to Reggie Jackson for keeping this one interesting at least. Imagine what this game looks like without those 3s lmao.
How tf you gonna have Reggie Jackson be your best player in a must win
He hasn't rested and PG has 4 fouls. Reggie Jackson might cool off too
When Reggie Jackson is outplaying Kawhi lol
What is Reggie Jackson wearing? Headband goggles? I love it
We need Timmy to be our Reggie Jackson
maybe Reggie Jackson just needed glasses

Reggie Jackson continuing Kirk Hinrich’s legacy of accessories
This man Reggie Jackson is a sniper
Currently scoring the same as both of them and Reggie Jackson combined.
Reggie “I don’t make quick decisions” Jackson today it seems
"Telling me you got beef with Mann, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Ibaka,  or Kennard?"
Reggie Jackson isos to close the quarter when you have Kawhi &amp; Paul George? Am I missing something?
One shot before half and they give it to Reggie Jackson and clear out? Wtf is that shit
"""The stars are out""  *Reggie Jackson bricks a 3*  Perfect timing"
"Lmao, Reggie Jackson acting like he's the number 1 option on the clips wtf."
Reggie Jackson such a dumbass
Reggie Jackson is a fucking enigma my god
Reggie Jackson turning into Steph Curry was a development I wish did not happen this series
I hate Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is now in the pantheon of greats along with 2016 Steph against OKC and 2013 Game 6 Ray Allen
I can’t explain it but Reggie Jackson reminds me of Usopp
Did Reggie Jackson steal an outfielders accessories?
Reggie Jackson from all people killing us lol
Reggie Jackson and Blake Griffin having strong playoff runs...  Pistons in shambles
damn all the Lakers fans in the arena putting on their Reggie Jackson jerseys
reggie jackson is the straw that stirs the drink imo
"Shout out to Reggie Jackson, that's so fucking clutch"
Reggie Jackson just did the circle below the waist
Back to back Daggers from....Morris and Reggie Jackson. Like we all predicted
The difference between Luka and Reggie Jackson
They always forget about the Reggie Jackson
We can finally put to bed the all-time debate of Dennis Schröder vs Reggie Jackson
Can Reggie Jackson fuck off? What an annoying prick
Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris? SMH
Gotta be so deflating to have a shitter like Reggie Jackson make some of the 3s he's made today
Reggie Jackson peaked
Reggie Jackson is the greatest Clipper ever
Reggie Jackson just took out the Mavs
Yeah reggie jackson was the clippers second best player this series what the fuck bro
Luka talked all that shit to Patrick Beverly just to get eliminated by Reggie fucking Jackson
Reggie “Bitch I’m Bobby with that tool” Jackson

Imagine getting daggered by Reggie Jackson
Ok I was wrong I Love Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson killed the Mavs haha who would have thought
reggie jackson aka flava flav's son
You just lost to Reggie Jackson
Reggie fucking Jackson lmaooo
Reggie Jackson saved the CLippers season
PG-13 and Kawhi need Reggie Jackson to bail them out against a 22 year old with no help. They won't win a title
Why the fuck is Reggie Jackson hitting shots/
Reggie Jackson a sniper
Where were you when Reggie Jackson became Steph
Mavs getting sent home by Reggie Jackson
"Imagine going to game 7 and getting beat by Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, and Terrance Mann. That’s gotta sting."
What am I watching? Reggie Jackson nailing daggers in game 7 of a playoff series. Never thought I'd see the day
Lol at Reggie Jackson carrying the clippers
DONCIC NOT CLUTCH  REGGIE JACKSON IS GODLIKE
REGGIE JACKSON CALLED GAME
fuck reggie jackson
REGGIE JACKSON
Reggie Jackson woke up this morning and chose clutch
Fuck you Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson about to be banned from Dallas lol
Big shot from Reggie Jackson
That’s such a demoralizing three by Reggie Jackson
REG GOD LITERALLY REGGIE JACKSON WINNING THIS SERIES FOR THE CLIPS EPIC DEFENSE AND OFENSE

NEVERMIND REGGIE JACKSON RESPONDED
REGGIE Jackson omg
"Reggie jackson hit 2 clutch 3’s, who would’ve thought"
#WHY CAN REGGIE JACKSON PULL UP FROM THAT FAR WTF
BRO TAKE REGGIE JACKSON OUT  EDIT: Nevermind
Big government reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson heard us all talking shit
Reggie Jackson literally gives no fucks
"Reggie Jackson been making those parking lot threes all series, no idea why he’s left open time and time again."
Since when could Reggie Jackson shoot like that?!
they got Porzingis on Reggie Jackson man and they don't take advantage of that
"I don't wanna see the ball on Paul George, I don't wanna see the ball on Reggie Jackson. Kawhi ISOs until the game ends"
"As soon as Reggie Jackson came in the Mavs make a run... I hated watching him in Detroit, such a hot or very cold player."
Reggie Jackson with his best Danny green impression
Lue putting Reggie Jackson back in for Mann is top 3 worst coaching decisions he made this game. His shoulder is clearly bothering him and he’s been short on all his shots. He brings nothing defensively. He’s left countless shooters open in the last few possessions. Clippers just lucky they’ve missed
Maybe Kennard should be taking these 3’s instead of Reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson wasn’t the move this game
Reggie Jackson a fraud
"That's the problem. Aside from Luka, Dallas don't have much firepower. Aside from Kawhi and PG13, Clippers have Morris, Mann, Kennard, Batum, Reggie Jackson."
Because Reggie Jackson is his adopted son.
Porzingis gonna have nightmares of Reggie Jackson if they don’t pull this out
Reggie Jackson might just win this for the Mavs
great rebound by KP off that Reggie Jackson 3
The was on play in g2 or g3 where he posted up on Reggie Jackson and couldn’t even move him an inch
what ? Reggie jackson was playing like Curry last game
Reggie Jackson has played like the player the Lakers hoped Schroder would be
"Reggie Jackson has those tactical glasses, as any gamer knows having weird gear means you’re high level. SMH can’t believe it took the clips this long to play him"
A’s Reggie Jackson never made a 3 pointer. Reggie&gt;Reggie
"#REGGIE ""BIG GOVERNMENT"" JACKSON"
"Idc what anyone says, Reggie Jackson is an elite presence on this team and I'm glad to see him doing well. Goggles Reggie for life."
Reggie Jackson is a chode
Reggie Jackson looks like podracer [Ratts Tyerell](https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15405/453921-250px_rattshs.jpg)
love mike breen's reggie Jackson voice
Reggie Jackson wtf
reggie jackson dressed like the one black character in an early 2000s video game
Reggie Jackson has made a little money this postseason. Clippers need to pay him with Pat Beverly’s salary
Reggie Jackson with the middle schooler look. Love to see it
"Reggie Jackson, maybe pass the ball there"
Terrified of Reggie Jackson
Bro why is he wearing Oakley's bro? Reggie Jackson looks so weird rn man 😂😂
fucking reggie rec-specs jackson
"&gt; Lebron  The team with Kuzma as the #3 option is deeper than Portland? Utterly laughable.  &gt; Luka  Luka isn’t a bigger star than Dame. He’s close. Maybe he’ll get there next season. He ain’t there yet. And he’s got nothing around him.  &gt; Jokic  I’ll grant Denver.  &gt; Kawhi  The Clippers have no depth. Their #3 scorer this year was... Reggie Jackson. They get 11 points per game out of their Centers combined. This claim is dumb.  &gt; Curry  You’re going to tell me that the team starting Wiseman is deep?! And didn’t even make the playoffs? Come on, man. Come *on*."
The only bffs on that team are Reggie Jackson and Paul George.
There's definitely a noise of some sort but I can't make it out over the wall that is Reggie Jackson defending in the post.
"I would like to say the Clippers but its but if 77 points from Kawhi, PG and Reggie Jackson couldn't do it I don't know of they have it. I dont have a dog in the fight but I thought this would be a competitive series.   Ty Lue still trying out rotations in the 2nd round of the playoffs is a really bad look for that coaching staff."
Lmao Reggie Jackson.
lol Reggie Jackson. Hope he does well.
I SAID IT FIRST REGGIE JACKSON ABOUT TO DROP 45 AND LEAD THE CLIPPERS TO VICTORY
"Ironically picked Reggie Jackson, but now I’m sketched cause there are unicorns on the line"
Reggie Jackson in 6     Jk I don’t trust the clippers to take out the suns if they advance so gotta be team Utah so they can avenge the lakeshow
Glad to see I’m the only person to vote for Reggie Jackson.
"If it's Marv Albert, Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson? Yes"
"&gt;I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not “cheap”  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn’t the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn’t he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren’t cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren’t exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don’t have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don’t have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don’t trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don’t know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I’ll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there’s a high chance of us bringing back. So you’re talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that’s 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you’re in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that’s fine.   Now I don’t even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we’re talking about the Lakers."
"Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard combo from yesterday was really bad. Maybe not quite as bad cause Jackson at least has some size, tho kennard is legit one of the worst defenders I've ever seen"
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
&gt; the Clippers have played shit both games   I'm not sure that's exactly how I'd categorize it. I doubt we can expect another 29 point game from Reggie Jackson going forward. Also it should be noted that the Jazz have played these first two games without their All Star starting point guard. Conley coming back and Jackson reverting to the mean could spell disaster for the Clippers in Game 3.
Reggie Jackson defending Mitchell who  A) was 30ft out  B) already guarded  C)didn't have the ball
Them running the offense through Reggie Jackson is not a better option. But the fact that it's their best option at guard is a huge flaw in roster construction.
"Dear diary,  Why is this team playing exclusively through their 2 best players by far?   I just can’t figure out why they aren’t running things thru Reggie Jackson more often."
"Lol nah man, this one is on Reggie Jackson. You don't just leave the man with the ball to go guard someone else. Stopping the ball is basketball 101"
Reggie Jackson plays in a way I thought Schroeder was going to play.
"No, PG is definitely the problem. He takes up too much of the salary cap, whose offensive production is spotty in the post-season and could be replaced by a player with a much smaller cap hit.  When Reggie Jackson shows you up on a minimum deal, what's PG's value for the team? His defense is still good, but I wouldn't say elite. It pains me to say but after watching both him and Middleton, I'd rather take Khris at this point."
I went back 3 plays to see who was guarding him and it was Reggie Jackson..
"Conley has a good track record against the Clippers. I definitely think the Jazz being able to take the first 2 without him is huge and that's why things are looking good. But again, it's far from over. If the Clippers get a couple of good games with Kawhi and PG (or hell, apparently Reggie Jackson now too) the momentum could shift. If the Jazz snag one of the 2 away games, I'll be feeling a lot more confident."
Honestly kawhi needed to shoot more at the end he kept passing. Obviously Utah played great D on him (bogie was electric) but he needs to take and make them. Reggie Jackson kept them in the game big time
Playoff Rondo for the last 5 or so years has been about getting like 3 game changing plays a game and he hasn’t been doing that for the Clippers and it’s not like regular Rondo is better than Reggie Jackson
29 points from Reggie Jackson and the Clips still lost. GG
I thought when the Thunder traded Reggie Jackson he was going to become an allstar lol
In what world is it okay for Reggie Jackson to have more Shot attempts than Kawhi and PG?
"Conley was like third in the league by DRAPTOR this year lol. Now granted his minutes were tied to Rudy’s, but his 1v1 defense is elite. He woulda shut down reggie jackson"
Or guard reggie jackson. Someone needed to guard reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson is the only player with heart on this clippers team.   Jazz in 5.
"Idk man I think Reggie Jackson is the problem not the solution. Dudes a ball hog, there’s no way the clippers can win this series if he’s your leading scorer with 2 assists while having PG and Kawhi on your team. I would’ve subbed Rondo in for a bit just to mix things up."

Reggie Jackson has been balling
"He always does this lol, and then people who didn’t watch the games say “can we stop this playoff p narrative look at his numbers guys!”   Although he did play better in the second half, it’s tough to justify anything when Reggie Jackson is showing more assertiveness while under pressure"
Reggie Jackson absolutely balling out and I don’t think it has anything to do with the clippers. The man is a unrestricted FA this off-season and just added $10-15 M to his future contract in the last few games.
You like Reggie Jackson until he’s laying bricks.
If that's Kawhi's call then I don't think it was the right one since Bev would have to go through Reggie to get to Ingles. That was probably what they wanted ideally but it was too late by then and Bev should've just stuck to Mitchell and Jackson switch over to Ingles.
"Reggie Jackson had one his best games in a long time, but did he actually outperform PG?  Let's do a quick comparison:  Jackson with 29 points on 19 shots, 3 rebs, 2 ast.  George with 27 points on 18 shots, 10 rebs, 6 ast.  Close, but looks like PG had the better overall impact.  Now how about Kawhi?  21 points on 17 shots, 4 rebs, 5 ast.  So between Kawhi and PG, if anyone was outperformed by Reggie Jackson, it would be Kawhi.  Just like between Kawhi and PG, if anyone is overrated, it would be Kawhi."
"Lmao you clearly never picked up a ball in your life or played at a high level if you don’t think that any player in the NBA can have a career night at ANY time. Reading is fundamental, you’re bringing up points as if that has anything to do with him faltering late in games, the same thing PG is getting flamed for. Reggie Jackson averages 10 points a game, and went off for 29. So yes the best athletes in the world being paid millions of dollars can score 30 at any time."
"As a jazz fan I agree we closed it out well, but Reggie Jackson hit a three to give the clippers their first lead with 6:30 left for his 29th point of the game. He definitely was a major factor, and the game was definitely close"
"You need irrational confidence on this Clippers team, and Bev has none of that on offense. They don't hype each other up or anything, they're not confident in each other, so you need that personal hype (heck even their own arena staff will heckle them). It's why I like Reggie Jackson so much on this team. He's his own hype man."
"Reggie Jackson needs to have the exact same role as Jordan Clarkson. If he does, he’ll be successful. But as a starter he’s just an undersized shooting guard, doesn’t work well there. He seems to have ego and want to start, he can do it but then he needs to go play next to Luka/Harden/Embiid/Joker types. Maybe Giannis or LaMelo too."
"So let's break this down  1. Kawhi points at beverly to go guard ingles   2. Reggie Jackson runs up to ingles and goes, I got it   3. Reggie Jackson points at beverly to guard...something   4. Reggie Jackson while pointing goes to guard Mitchell instead   5. Beverly literally looks at Reggie Jackson and goes ""wtf""   6. Ingles is like...ok I guess i'll shoot then if nobody is guarding me"
Reggie Jackson seems like MJ
That’s the point. Tonight was about as good as you get from Reggie Jackson. If that’s the best the Clippers can put up in terms of offence when it matters most then they’ve got no chance at even keeping this series competitive.
"utah used to face us alot, reggie jackson isnt steph curry"
"Reggie Jackson, Batum, Ibaka (if he gets better). Normally Mook, but his shooting has been cheeks. I'd say maybe Terance Mann too."
"Am I Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense? Is Rudy Gobert a ghost, and I’m the only one on this earth that can see him?   My man got the switch onto 5 foot 10 REGGIE JACKSON on the pick and roll a *DOZEN TIMES* in the 4th quarter and they maybe found him ONCE. I’m not even counting the vast majority of the game where Nic Batum, an undersized 4, was assigned to him.   Most of the time the result of the play when they ignored Rudy was a contested 3 (and yeah they made a few of them). The clippers were BEGGING them to get the ball to Rudy for an easy dunk. And I put most of the responsibility on Donavan Mitchell.   For a guy who gets MVP chants (which frankly don’t mean shit anymore because everyone who’s the best player on their team gets them) Donavan Mitchell just AINT it as a creator for others man. And I say that after being dazzled by his scoring performance tonight.   This game was won by his scoring, but it was also almost lost because he fell WAY too in love with his own shot in the 2nd half. For every sick layup where he split a triple team, he had 3-4 bad possessions where he got pickpocketed, bricked a 3, or couldn’t make a super tough paint shot because he was TRIPLED TEAMED. That’s how the lead dried up.   They need to find a way to fucking punish the clips for their lack of size. They gotta find Rudy for more easy buckets. Mitchell needs to distribute. Or the clips can find their way back in this thing. Mitchell isn’t going to get 40 every game. Most of his shots were TOUGH shots tonight."
I thought Reggie Jackson was going to actually carry the Clippers to victory in this one. He had one of those zone games.
"Bev was closest to Donovan, Reggie Jackson is the one that messed up."
The entire fucking 4th quarter was Reggie Jackson vs Jazz
"Yup, but that’s exactly it: the Jazz are never losing to a team where fucking Reggie Jackson top scores and takes the most shots lmao"
Reggie was INSANE. If the Jazz had lost to a team carried by Reggie Jackson I would have blown a fuse.
The worst part about Reggie Jackson playing well is that he will try to do more. Bad news for clippers
Reggie Jackson has been huge for them. He's done more than enough for his role.   Game 6 elimination vs dallas he had 25  he's consistently been a great shooter
I just have never believed in the clips. They seem like a great theoretical team that someone would make in nba 2k. They just don’t seem to have any actual chemistry or urgency. Reggie Jackson actually seems like the guy with the most fire on the team.
Reggie Jackson closed down that 21 point deficit pretty much singlehandedly.  Props to him.  Dude showed up.
Reggie Jackson was digging them out of the hole Kawhi and PG made then PG decided he wanted to run their offense and killed all their momentum with stupid passes and bad shots
"Ok but if any player doesn’t hit their shots, it will be impossible. I just disagree with the “alone” part. It’s a big piece yes, but it’s not the only thing. If reggie Jackson doesn’t go off for 29 tonight, it’s a 20 point game likely lol."
"When Morris started sinking shots, Mavs were in trouble. Him and Reggie Jackson are crucial"
"They had a real chance, they cut into the Jazz’s 20 point lead &amp; after that Mitchell turnover and Reggie Jackson three they were up 2 with like 6 mins left. Could’ve stole on the Jazz’s home-court.   Clippers missed too many open threes from that point out while the Jazz just kept hitting clutch shot after clutch shot. This one was totally winnable."
"Yeah like Bojan was awesome on Kawhi tonight, but I don’t care. If you’re the Clippers the fact that Reggie Jackson shot the ball tonight more times than Kawhi should have you scratching your head and feeling stupid."
Mike Conley would put clamps on Reggie Jackson. Reggie Jackson wouldn’t even sniff 10 points if Conley was playing. Jazz in Fo.
"Mitchell is a fucking baller but why are the Clippers like this?  I’ve be admittedly not watched much of them this year but it’s partly because they’re kind of boring and really shouldn’t be.  You’ve got two of the best wings in the game with some solid depth but losses like this are almost predictable at this point.  They were barely even running the offense late in the game and were just hoisting shots, often from guys you wouldn’t want taking them.  I mean, the last time they were in this game it was off the strength of back to back threes from Reggie. This team is waaay too talented to be relying on Reggie Jackson."
"In real time, i thought Reggie was reacting to the call. This is actually hilarious lmao    Also, doesnt seem like anyone other than jackson was too eager to extend the game"
"Speaking of WWE level of drama, what the FUCK was Reggie Jackson doing in this clip"
"Obviously we shot like shit in that series post game 2 but:  &amp;#x200B;  He benched PatBev when he was getting cooked by Luka and replacing him with Reggie Jackson. Their game plan in games 3-4 was shifted to attacking the rim until we made the adjustment in game 5-6-7 to go big (which got us game 5), and at that point shifting their scoring back to the three point line in response to the zone, even adding Kennard into the mix. And their overall strategy of letting Luka get his and tiring him out in the fourth worked.   &amp;#x200B;  Those were just some I noticed, and I don't even know a lot in basketball, and I bet some basketball minds here can point out the more specific ones."
"If Reggie Jackson is your best player, you're not going to win many games."
"At the very least he's clearly making adjustments. Less Kennard and Rondo, tried the Boogie Cousins experiment, tried zone defense. I don't know what he told Reggie Jackson but that seemed to work lol"
On the real though coaching and Reggie Jackson almost won the game
"Key Takeaways for me:  Mitchell is playing like a superstar. His numbers don't do him justice, his teammates got so many open looks because 2 or 3 people were trying to lock up Mitchell.  Gobert is showing that he is the best defensive player in the league.  Bogdanovic was locked in on defense and deserves major credit.  PG will probably get the most hate, but Kawhi was the one who really failed to step up. While given in theory the easier matchup it felt like he was invisible on offense in the home stretch of the game. He should've been eating Bogdanovic alive.   Reggie Jackson might have an error or two in him a game, but he has stepped up majorly for the clippers and has looked like an All-Star on offense. Without him things would be ugly."
get reggie jackson some help
Reggie Jackson is a better version of Pat Bev.
I think Reggie Jackson wanted to win that game
I'm just watching Reggie Jackson raging on Kennard
"To be specific, Kennard wasn't fouling. Reggie Jackson was going to kill Luke Kennard for not fouling though."
"I know Reggie Jackson shot poorly at the end, but he was the only reason this game was reasonably close.  Also, last years Jazz would've blown the lead and never recover."
"On a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, you can’t have Reggie Jackson be your best offensive option and expect to win. Clippers need to dig out of a 2-0 deficit once again, they can definitely do it. But they gotta prove it again."
The ESPN mics on the rims were getting worked by the Clipper role players ex-Reggie Jackson late in the fourth.  &amp;#x200B;  So many bricks
"Pg did alright, did well on drives actually. not to mention reggie jackson.     It's Kahwi tho...but it will be unfair if we did not credit Bojan's defence."
"He was literally the point guard for the clippers tonight. He’ll still get hate because of box score watchers but in my eyes only him, Reggie Jackson, and Kawhi showed up"
"When Reggie Jackson is outplaying your 2 superstar players, idk if that's a coaching matter"
Y’all gotta get reggie jackson sum help man
"Reggie Jackson can't win with these cats  Also how fucking insane is **Bojan Bogdanovic**? Dude's defense against Kawhi in the 4th quarter was truly something to behold.   I used to think Bogdan was the better Bogdanovic because I enjoyed his game so much, but man Bojan is fucking insane.  Obviously the 3pt that he's known for, but he can also handle the ball well, finish around the rim, or pull up from mid-range. And that defense is a god damn revelation. I didn't know he was that legit of a defender."
Lmao imagine Reggie Jackson taking more shots than Kawhi in your biggest game of the year (and one of the biggest and most important games of all time for your franchise)
Get Reggie Jackson some help!!
The real story of this clip is reggie jackson and kennard. The fuck was luke thinking?
"On a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, you can’t have Reggie Jackson be your best offensive option and expect to win. Clippers need to dig out of a 2-0 deficit once again, they can definitely do it. But they gotta prove it again."
"What was Kawhi's stats in the 4th? him and PG choked hard, would have been a huge blowout if not for Reggie fucking Jackson lol"
Haha type and walk is not ideal. Exactly. Reggie Jackson is stepping up while Paul George is...there.
"On a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, you can’t have Reggie Jackson be your best offensive option and expect to win. Clippers need to dig out of a 2-0 deficit once again, they can definitely do it. But they gotta prove it again."
Get Reggie Jackson some help ffs
Reggie Jackson outplayed Kawhi and PG bruh
Get Reggie Jackson some help!!
reggie jackson can’t win with these cats
May not*   Never say never. Reggie Jackson looks like the leader they needed.
Reggie Jackson dropped 29. Paul George dropped 27. No excuses
Reggie Jackson getting the bag 💰 this off season
Paul George is just Reggie Jackson at home
Reggie Jackson is a real deal
Didnt Clippers fans hate Reggie Jackson last year? WTF happened to this dude? This mf looks like a whole new player right now
REGGIE AIMBOT JACKSON
Is Reggie Jackson the most clutch player of all time?
REGGIE JACKSON WOOOO
Reggie Jackson deserves more respect.

Reggie Jackson redemption arc?
Reggie Jackson almost retired
Reggie Jackson is gonna get paid dude
Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum: look at us. Who would've thought
Reggie Jackson better than any Jazz player
Reggie Jackson going to carry them clips
I have never seen Reggie Jackson miss a 3 pointer
Reggie Jackson: I got this
GIVE REGGIE JACKSON HIS BAG 💰😤
Reggie Jackson hit an impossible shot and Patrick Beverly immediately gives Utah a free point and possession.  Such a dumb play.
Reggie Jackson good lord
Reggie Jackson the goat
You cannot convince me that Reggie Jackson doesn’t derive every last ounce of his offensive stroke straight from the center of his cyber punk athletic glasses
Most clutch Reggie Jackson of all time
"Just can’t help but think of how good okc was when they had a team of young Reggie Jackson, harden, uncle Jeff, ibaka, kd and Russ god what a fucking team."
Unrelated but Reggie Jackson has been insane
Reggie Jackson dad dicking Mitchell and the Jizz who would have thought LMAOOO
Reggie Jackson aka Robocop
"Big 3 of Kawhi, PG, and Reggie Jackson"
"Reggie ""Contract Season"" Jackson"
Reggie Jackson has secured himself a bag this playoffs
"Reggie ""Miller"" Jackson"
Reggie Jackson installed aim bot on those glasses sheeesh
Reggie Jackson is clutch as shit
"Reggie ""Vernon Maxwell"" Jackson"
Reggie Jackson looks like Trez hahaha
WHO THE FUCK IS REGGIE JACKSON  WHERE DID THIS COME FROM ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS PLAYOFFS
Reggie Jackson said he's better than Westbrook
Reggie Jackson is actually just Steph Curry
Why does reggie jackson hate utah lol
Incredibly tough shot Reggie Jackson!
Big government reggie Jackson wow
hot damn reggie jackson
Joe Ingles?  Yes. Seth curry? yes. Both bogdanovich. Yes and yes.  Capela?  probably. Marcus Morris. Probably.  Reggie Jackson? Maybe???  Is he even top 25 of every guy left in the playoffs?  LMAO
"Weird that you included Shaq in there. Just a bad look that Gobert is consistently getting beat off the dribble. PG, okay fine. Reggie Jackson? Yeah no you have to be able to shut him down if you wanna be considered the best defender in the NBA lol."
17-30 3 pointers and only up by 5 at halftime.  Got to take care of the ball and continue to play desperate because Paul George or Reggie Jackson can absolutely go on a scoring streak and take over.
Yeah he got cooked by grocery bagger Reggie Jackson. That’s embarrassing.
"Reggie Jackson, aka Mr. October, has really turned into a beast"
FROG COOKED BY REGGIE JACKSON 😹😹😹😹
Why does Reggie Jackson remind me of Frozone?
"Like the Buck's first half defense yesterday, this Jazz's offense in the first half is playing way too good to be up by only 8.  They're literally one scoring streak by Paul George or Reggie Jackson from turning this game around."
i actually have it on good authority that reggie jackson just mixes mouthwash with his sideline drinks in order to clean his mouth
Lakers would have beat the Suns if they had Reggie Jackson instead of Dennis the fraud Schroder
I swear Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum have both surely extended their careers with the level of play shown all season
"Imho Reggie Jackson don’t brush his teeth, he puts toothpaste in the mouthgaurd and passively brushes his teeth during the game"
Reggie Jackson better get PAID
Reggie Jackson becoming a star in front of our eyes these playoffs
Playoff Reggie Jackson is real
Reggie Jackson &gt; Clarkson
I'd rather have Reggie Jackson over Simmons at this point
Reggie Jackson has been incredible for the Clippers all playoffs.
Playoff p and … Reggie Jackson for LAC lol
"I hope the Clips lose but I gotta say, Reggie Jackson has looked and played like an assassin this whole playoff run."
"Dillon Brooks, Reggie Jackson, and Trae Young have all surprised me"
Reggie Jackson. Before I thought he made too many bone headed plays and wasn't making up for it on offense. But he's turned it on in key moments with his scoring. And those glasses look cool too
Assist leader. Usually on the top of potential assists. But cool.  I'm not confident in Paul George and Reggie Jackson like I'd be in Paul George and Russ.
"Detriot brought in bums who never did anything after their Detroit stint. Monroe, Jennings, Reggie Jackson, etc. The players he actually developed KCP, Tobias, Drummond got traded or just werent resinged. This mofo made Drummond an allstar.. He dragged your sorry ass excuse of a team to the playoffs and you dare complain about him? Your team had a young core and they let them walk and traded it for Blake Griffin lmao.  Also you want Zion to take more 3s and complain about a shitty 3pt shooter having 100 attempts on 600 games."
Stan has been getting a lot of shit recently but I don’t know what people expected in his last 2 stops. The Pistons were an absolute dumpster fire and he took them to the Playoffs with Drummond and Reggie Jackson being his best players. The Pelicans have one of the worst constructed rosters in the league and he still had them somewhat competitive even though Bledsoe played 30 MPG. Zion seemed to enjoy working with SVG and his old school approach with one of my favorite quotes on why “Always expecting greatness from you and never satisfied” while developing really well from last season.
"The problem is that they don't know the game of basketball. They have their own version of what the game should be in their head. They don't know, or choose not to articulate, the actual reality of today's game. They continually just get simple things like the rules wrong, and if they are wrong about it they just bitch that it isn't their fault and the league is wrong. That is absolutely one of the worst things you can do to increase popularity of the league.  There is a pretty large consensus that there are some excellent play-by-play guys. Breen, Harlan, Eagle. Color commentators are much harder to come by. It is mostly populated by fine to make-me-watch-on-mute guys. Hubie, Greg Anthony, Hill are probably the best guys right now. Dorris Burke is okay. I like the potential of Richard Jefferson and Vince Carter. Jefferson might have to censor himself too much for primetime, and Vince might be better as a studio guy, but at least there is some new blood. Reggie is boring, but generally doesn't make me mad anymore. Color people are better than they have been, but there is still a real void at the top. JVG and Jackson being super polarizing isn't good."
Reggie Jackson needs to drop 40 and PG13 needs to drop 25.
The X factor is Reggie Jackson.
If he loses this series there is no way he should get the blame. No player in the league would win a series with Reggie Jackson as there second best player.
Reggie Jackson career game incoming. Hopefully PG can get his usual 20+ with a couple 3s
"Reggie Jackson gonna carry the team, heard it here first"
"We will either see the Playoff P and Reggie Jackson duo in full power for a win or the Clippers get blown out, no in between"
"Kawhi because he's been carrying. CP3 has been leading, but he hasn't been carrying.  I like Paul George, but I think Booker and Ayton can win a game on their own before Paul George and Reggie Jackson."
And Reggie Jackson
He’s closer to Reggie Jackson then he is Kawhi is the point
Conley is closer to Chris Paul than he is to Reggie Jackson.
"No, you’re hopes are down to Reggie Jackson"
reggie jackson the GOAT
I didn't know about Reggie Jackson being born in Italy
"KD is one of the best, but so is Kawhi. I'd also take the box of P's over one-legged Harden while Joe Harris's spirit seems to have wandered off into Reggie Jackson. I think Clippers take it without Kyrie."
Rather lose to Jeff Green than ducking Reggie Jackson
Jeff Green shooting like Reggie Jackson
"&gt;	how is this team without kyrie and harden better than the 2018 cavs and 2007 cavs?   Lebron carried the dead corpse of a rotting starting lineup to the finals and almost took one game off of golden state   Durant got bailed out by reggie fucking jackson instead of choking his MVP year first round series against Memphis. WB was hurt but this is the first round.   As for this years net’s, I thought Durant was the “””second best player””” in the league behind lebron despite Durant never leading top offenses, never anchoring a historic defense (bron should have won in 2013 DPOY), and cannot playmake at a high level without his efficiency cratering.   Lebron would have sealed the deal against Milwaukee by now."
Rondo.   Schroeder.  Reggie Jackson.
Philly. I don’t really like any of the other teams.  I wouldn’t be mad at Atlanta or Utah winning. Suns would be pretty annoying but it’s a middling scenario for me given who is left. I hate how Giannis plays basketball but he’s a good dude and they have cool players so whatever.   I don’t even know who I want to win less between Brooklyn or the clippers. I wanna root against the clippers just because of their fan base and that I guess we’re direct rivals in theory but I’ve always liked Reggie Jackson for some reason and a Paul George redemption arc sounds kinda cool if he doesn’t get annoying about it.   Conversely kyrie is my least favorite player ever and the nets winning would kinda shit on everything that’s defined championship teams throughout history. But I do like harden and nash deserves a ring more than most people in nba history.   Idk trash season no matter what. Im rooting for good games more than anything at this point
"First thing, I think the NBA needs to figure out a way to stop fast break fouls. We were robbed of 15 or so fast-break scoring opportunities, because the team fouled a guy in the open court.   There were way too many FT's in this game both teams need to clean up the reaching in and try to stay out of the bonus. It is not fun watching a battle of FT shooting.   There were also a lot of fouls on both sides that were not called that in most games should be called. 56 fouls could have easily been 80.    The Jazz found something in the second half that may bode well in the future. It may come as a shock, but taking the ball into the paint and kicking it out is a lot better than passing the ball around the outside and jacking up threes.   The Clippers found a way to close. Every time the Jazz would cut into the lead they would respond with a big shot. Reggie Jackson finally took a night off in this series and Morris found his shot. Lots to be excited about. The worrying thing is a Kawhi injury. Hopefully he is ok."
"Kp s trash, did you even watch him this plaoffs, cant post up a chair, ok reggie jackson, cant dribble, cant create a shot for himself... If i remember correctly few days ago i saw a stat where KP was dead last in fg %(around 31) out of all 250 qualified players, when he makes more than one dribble... But yeah lets go to kp , he is so good"
He's a beast but he could afford to cut back on the flopping. It's the refs' faults for rewarding it but that shit spreads to the whole team and makes it really annoying to watch the Jazz. When Rudy stays upright and plays defense he's amazing to watch but the flinging his head back and flying backward from contact with a jogging Reggie Jackson gets old fast
"Yeah, I don’t think the hate is right. I’m not a Paul George fan I was salty about him staying on the Thunder  But I like how he’s been playing, dude has been unstoppable the last couple games it’s almost like if he’s open that’s going in. I’m starting to like this clipper squad, I still don’t like zubac or Beverly or Morris but everyone else especially Reggie Jackson I like his confidence"
"Clarkson and Reggie Jackson literally cost me 2,000 on a parlay I’m sick af."
" Kawhi Leonard and Paul George get 30 pts each for the 3rd time this year, the 6th time while being teammates.   If Leonard, PG, Morris keep shooting like this, and Reggie Jackson has great games here and there like he’s had several times during these playoffs, Clippers are looking like stronger bet for the title. This is only if the Nets are still banged up with injuries."
Morris banging threes . Kennard hitting. George popping off. Mann coming clutch. Bev gettin his hustle moments. Reggie jackson on fire  HOW THE FUCK IS KAWHI DRAGGING THE TEAM LOL  dumb fucks tried to say the same thing bout the raps like stop. Hes a god and definitely the leader and best player but just stop
what I'm saying is kawhi has never been expected to go insane on the spurs like most stars basically have to. he didn't on toronto either. in LA is the most he's been expected to show up every night but even then he has PG and reggie jackson going off.
I would actually kill myself if I had Reggie Jackson on my team
"Pistons fans watching Blake, Reggie Jackson, and Luke kennard in the playoffs like 😭😭"
Was reggie jackson actually right about deserving to start over Westbrook all these years later
The jazz aren’t doing it on purpose but they are absolutely roasting Reggie Jackson on almost every possession. Lol
Mitchell looking at Reggie Jackson like bbq chicken
Either him or Reggie Jackson going off is bad news for other teams
Unless your name is Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson
"His plus minus was really bad, was that his fault directly, maybe not but that’s still a big issue in general that reflects his skill set in the team. The 3s weren’t the only problem, he seemed tired or hesitant or something when they penetrated the paint. Reggie Jackson was beating him down the stretch for example. Seems like the main argument is jazz defense even worse without him but hard to divorce that from his value being tied to making jazz defense actually good. Less bad isn’t worth it."
The spirit inhabiting his body left him for Reggie Jackson.
\&gt;your 2021 defensive player of the year \&gt;can’t even keep relative manlet Reggie Jackson  from making ez layups  What did they mean by this? 😂
"Mitchell needs to be better on defence. Hes young and had to create most of their offence, but he shouldn't be getting blown by as easily as he was last game. He was supposed to be an elite defender with questionable offence coming out of the draft. His offensive growth has been amazing but for whatever reason the defence has never been there - hes sneakily a pretty bad defender most of the time.  In fairness to him, a lot of it is because he has had to create so much and take all the difficult shots for them. Hes been great at that too. But with their cap/tax sitatuation internal improvement from him is pretty much the only way they are gonna get meaningfully better.  Also, to OPs point a lot of those open 3s are somewhat part of Utahs strategy. They always put Gobert on the worst 3-point shooter by design  but last night the Clippers worst shooter was consistently hitting.  It was kind of shocking how easily Utahs perimter defenders were getting blown by though. Most of the time it was no screen just Reggie Jackson going right by them with no resistance. No offence to him but come on its Reggie Jackson. Hes not going to pull up from 28 feet like Dame and hes like a completely league average backup PG level guy it can't be that easy in an elimination playoff game."
"Who else is more talented? Suns without CP3, Clippers led by PG and Reggie Jackson or the Sixers with Embiid playing on a torn meniscus and Simmons air balling layups? Atlanta?"
KD without a superteam is still behind Reggie Jackson tho
That Reggie Jackson midrange is bad defense. He's wide open because Gobert was shitting himself to get back in the paint.
"&gt;	Acting like he did a good job at protecting the rim. He gave up layups everytime PG, Reggie Jackson, Mann, and everybody else came inside straight at him.  Like four layups and three of them were ridiculously difficult."
Don't forget the GOAT Reggie Jackson.
maybe Reggie Jackson can fax his goggles to Blake Griffin
Bruce Brown wants to be like Reggie Jackson
Broke: This game needs Reggie Jackson  Woke: This game needs Terance Mann
This game needs some Reggie Jackson or something. Dull af
Then Reggie Jackson still beats Donovan off the dribble and now Dray definitely can't leave his man because its PG and not T Mann.   Queue the layup line
Cam Payne vs Reggie Jackson
Thank you.  The inability to stop Dribble penetration made Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann look like all-stars.
"Thanks for this. Not every 6'10 plus guy with elite defensive impact is as near weakness free as the Brow, whose only real weakness is keeping up with north-south movements (step backs and stuff) but even then his length can still give a good contest. Gobert is fine holding his own on the perimeter for a big, and his rim protection is S tier. It's very obvious that the reason why their defense broke down was because they kept letting PG and Reggie Jackson get into the paint, and without the weak side defender having the effort and foot speed to slow down the 2 on 1 after the ball is swung there, Gobert has no chance to come outside to contest."
"He essentially brings rim protection to the table and any team that can make it past the first round can have him stand in the corner 22 feet from the basket or 30 feet from the basket guarding a pick and roll.  Sure if the Jazz had better permitter defenders they may have won, and Rudy would have the same non-impact standing in corner and being guarded by Reggie Jackson."
Reggie Jackson 20 pts 10 ast masterclass on the way
You do realize that he didn’t even do a decent job protecting the paint. How many layups did Reggie Jackson and Mann have on him. If you’re going to proclaim that’s he’s an all-world rim protector then he better wipe out a majority of shots at the rim. That’s why I never considered him to be in the class of Prime Dwight let alone legendary rim protectors like Hakeem and Deke.
"Mitchell and Clarkson were the reasons they were up 20 in the first place. They each took a quarter in the first half to get anything they wanted offensively. Idk how you could POSSIBLY blame Mitchell for this game, clarkson did exactly what is expected of him too. They scored 119 that wasn’t the problem. Goobert couldn’t get more than 12 on batum and Reggie Jackson and didn’t do shit on the boards either"
"Listen to goberts answers on Mann scoring 39. He literally explains how he’s responsible for it.   For Reggie Jackson one of Mitchell/Conley clarkson,   For pg13 one of ingles or bogdonavic   Gobert is meant to contest some 3s. Did you watch? They knew he wouldn’t step out and got an open 3 where he should close out over and over."
Because Reggie Jackson loves semi-open pull-up 2s.
"Several reasons.   For one Reggie Jackson isn’t a dunker even with a wide open lane.   Secondly I think at least part of the jazz perimeter woes are coaching scheme. I don’t think Conley/Mitchell/ingles/bogdonavic are trash defenders by any means. I think they are funneling perimeter players into gobert every time, essentially allowing the blow by and the clippers absolutely abused it."
"He balled out. When Kawhi went down I wrote the clips off. PG13 showed up tho. Also thoughy Ty Lue's coaching was great. Special shout out to Reggie Jackson too, always liked his offensive game, but he elevated his play across the board this postseason."
"He guarded tim hardaway for 88.3 possessions as his primary assignment, limited him to 28% FG. Other than Reggie Jackson, Tim hardaway Jr. Shot over 50% against all other defenders (including Kawhi).    Acting like Tim Hardaway wasn't the second best player on the Mavs in the playoffs."
"&gt; People don't seem to grasp yet how versatile this Clippers squad is. If Ibaka was healthy this team is monstrous.  Umm, a large part of Clippers' success comes from some (likely) unsustainable improvements by Reggie Jackson, Batum (and Morris to an extent).   Mann, Kawhi, PG13 are playing close to what's expected."
You live with contested Reggie Jackson and Paul George drives over wide open corner 3s any day of the week.  Either Snyder had a terrible game plan or gobert had garbage bbiq and positioning.
I 100% assure you you wouldn’t get Reggie Jackson dunking every play.  Paul George might have got a few but even then he’s not some unstoppable driving threat that’d go 100%    I think you take contested drives over wide open  corner 3s any day. Gobert himself admitted to his scheme and play being part of why Mann dropped 39 on them.
"&gt;contested Reggie Jackson and Paul George  Who contests them?  &gt;leaving the clips an open 3  And who is meant to contest that?  If the answer to those two questions is the same person, you can see the problem."
What is this turnaround.     Mitchell and clarkson played incredible. Getting blown by wasn’t the problem. You live with contested Reggie Jackson and Paul George drives all day. The problem was gobert camping in the paint and leaving the clips an open 3 every play.
"Agreed. For instance, most of the perimeter guys were getting blown by. Once their guy hit the paint and was near the rim, they could have at the very least shaded toward Mann to help cut off a pass or be in a position to rotate. Instead, they were often just following Reggie Jackson or whoever and providing no resistance."
Shit Reggie Jackson or Mann didn’t seem afraid of Gobert at the rim either.
And it wasn't like it was Kawhi or KD taking advantage of him it was Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann. One is a scrap heap guy and the other a guy better known for Critters 2.
I’ll take a Reggie Jackson contested drive over a wide open corner three any day
His team has to play 4-on-5 offense while opponents can play extreme-offense lineups since even Reggie Jackson or Luke Kennard can shut down Gobert on the other end.
"Ya, Aytons offense will be bigger than his D.  In fact against the Clippers he will likely look as bad on D as Gobert did, banging with a guy like Jokic is in his wheelhouse, I doubt chasing Reggie Jackson, PG, and Mann around is.  And Zubac isn't a real threat anywhere except the boards.    But the Suns perimeter defense is no joke, we looked a lot like last nights Clippers when we played the Blazers, but couldn't shoot for shit against the Suns.  We definitely missed some wide open shots, but over a four game sweep it is hard to argue it was just unlucky, Suns bother you on the perimeter and effect your shot, there is no question.    Series is looking to be a banger though, I would take the Suns in 5 if they had CP3 and Clippers don't have Kawhi, but while both are out I honestly think every game is 50/50,  Book versus PG and then which team gets the most out of their role players."
"What? Here is what is wrong with their analysis:  “the rim protector has to do all the garbage cleanup combined with Gobert’s ankle injury in game five hobbling him in the paint” is not being considered. The jazz’s entire defense is built on the philosophy that “we can favor acquiring offensive players without regard to their defensive ability because Gobert is so otherworldly great at rim defense that he can make this mish-mash a top 5 rated defense.” When this is exacerbated by rolling his ankle and playing against *literally the most efficient perimeter scoring team in nba history* people are saying that he doesn’t deserve to be DPOY because Reggie Jackson made difficult contested shots after Gobert had to clean up when the perimeter defense broke down  and allowed him to get a head of steam and a favorable angle of attack. Why? Because they think Reggie Jackson is a scrub for some reason I guess? It’s clearly not Gobert’s fault. Has he ever made a bad play on defense? Yes, even Bill Russell has made a defensive mistake before. But looking at the entire second part of this series and how Ty Lue adjusted to the Jazz’s defense, you cannot draw the conclusion that Gobert is overrated somehow. It’s asinine. Yet it is the dominant opinion here. That’s why I don’t pay much attention to the opinions here. I just laugh at some memes, use it to catch some highlights I might have missed from a different game than the one I watched, or catch breaking news because I don’t use Twitter that often."
"Eh I have to disagree. Small ball doesn’t work well when you constantly give up this level of penetration. Instead of open corner threes, it would have been constant wide-open layups. The clippers also can play small, because they have a lot of length and athleticism. Even Reggie Jackson has a 7 foot wingspan."
"Say you're Jackson at the top of the key You drive past Mitchell. You're already faster than  Mitchell can be laterally and add some mild ankle injury as spice. Gobert rotates down low to stop you. Gobert's man is still on the perimeter and is shooting a toasty 50% from 3 for the series. Jackson can pass faster than Mitchell can hope to recover, but say the next guy rotates so that Mitchell only has to rotate to that man. That just leaves Reggie Jackson 1 on 1 with Gobert, who strangely enough can't defend the mid range and let's say Reggie ends up shooting something like 58% from the field.   So where does Gobert start to get the blame? For only being a factor on defense where he can rotate AND the player decides to meet him at the rim? Or when he can't defend any of the players off the dribble? Or maybe when he's guarded by small forwards and power forwards but can still only average 12.5 ppg? Or his inability to defend basically any of the other players on the floor anywhere other than directly at the rim?"
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2yBy-EqnU  Go ahead and watch that for me. Defensive player of the year getting ran off the floor, has guys like Mann and Reggie jackson going into his chest and/or scoring over him, and flat-footed slow close outs on wide open threes. Clippers exploited the fact that he’s slow and sits in the paint. Not every breakdown was his fault but he won dpoy by plugging the holes in the jazz defense and being a rim protector. He did neither in this series and to act otherwise is being obtuse.  And this doesn’t even mention that the opposing fg % against him this playoffs was 46 percent vs 40 in the regular season, and the disparity is even worse the past two postseasons.  He’s an elite rim protector but he’s overrated because he is being paid and treated like a star when in reality he has so many holes in his game he can be unplayable. Snyder was better off benching him and matching up small ball because Rudy can’t make teams pay offensively for going small, and he’s too slow to guard anyone on the perimeter or hedge effectively."
"So when Paul George or Reggie Jackson easily torch Conley/Mitchell/Clarkson to get to the paint, then what? No Gobert to provide any interior presence. You just want to give up easy layups every play? Lmao   The first line of defense for the Jazz was *awful* and the problem on that defense, not Gobert. And the fact that some people spend time browsing r/nba and can't notice that very simple fact is hilarious to me."
"Honestly, Utah is weak defensively on the wing.  Rudy covered a lot of the  defensive holes by being a paint protector.  But u stretch him to the perimeter and then there are leaks all over the court.  No way Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann , and Morris all dropping huge numbers throughout the series.  The problem is bigger than Rudy"
"Exactly.  Plus CP3 getting covid.  Plus a flukey Kawhi ACL strain igniting Mann and Reggie Jackson turning into Jordan and Pippen all of a sudden. Like maybe I could've imagined Playoff Rondo and Ibaka pushing Clips over the top, but Mann and Jackson is absolutely wild.  And every team dealing with major injuries due to being overworked.  I've had to argue how the Lakers championship last year was not an asterisk year with Clip fans. Teams were well rested and playing high stakes basketball, which I know benefitted older Lakers in exchange for losing home court.   I don't even know how Clip fans would defend this one from not being an asterisk if they want to put asterisk last year too.  I do expect the Cinderella Clippers run to end though with Kawhi and CP3 out. I think PHX will have enough defense to handle."
"As someone who has followed the clippers religiously throughout the playoffs, here are my reasons why they will win it all. (Obviously Objective but what I’ve seen over the growth of 13 games this post season)  1. Paul George stepped up as the leader due to the Kawhi injury but also knows when to play reserved.  2. Reggie “Mr. June” Jackson knows when it’s time to step up, always plays with so much confidence in his game.  3. Ty Lue proved himself twice by being 2-0 in two consecutive series.  4. Terrance Mann is the San Antonio Spurs Kawhi Leonard, I see way too much potential in him. What other second year has the balls to yam it on a 3-year DPOY. 5. Watching Pat Beverley get minutes and play good makes me so happy since people have obviously forgotten about the annoyance of his defense.   Everyone is due to their opinions however these are some of the reasons why I remain confident when talking about the Clippers."
Under the radar is Reggie Jackson playing like an All-Star. Clippers better hope they can somehow hold onto him. He’s definitely in for more than $2 million next season.
He’s basically our reggie Jackson. Picked up from the waiver wire kind of player and has flourished on the right team
They better have a Reggie Jackson goggles bobblehead next year
Reggie Jackson can
"In our case, Reggie Jackson. Honestly, take Reggie Jackson out of the equation and we win in 6. But also tell wonders how Rick dueled Lue and IMO won (tougher win, now that I look in retrospect), but Snyder got totally outcoached by Lue."
Still - put gobert in average defensive team and they are probably among best defensive teams in NBA. Jazz has not competent wing defenders (in perimeter dominated game) and still have pretty good defense. There is just not much that he can do when Reggie Jackson is unsolvable enigma for his teammates - and tbh there is nothing that AD/Draymond could do too.
"It was clear their gameplan was to let Mann shoot though bc the next person over wasn't even rotating to help close out on the corners. They chose to die on that hill.   Over the regular season teams aren't gonna go ballistic and hit like 16/20 from three in a half on most nights. But in this one off game, they should've adjusted and subbed Rudy, as their season was literally on the line. If they allow Reggie Jackson to finish layups and give up 2's instead of 3's they might have won this game still."
"Because most people don’t understand basic concepts.  When a team is playing 5 out and they beat a guy off the dribble someone *NEEDS* to help. They put Gobert in that position because he is by far their best help defender.  People really want Gobert to stand in the corner and let the Clippers get wide open layups because Mitchell, Clarkson, ect are getting blown by off the dribble on every play. So fucking stupid.  Gobert is suppose to help and then the Jazz need to be rotating to the corner.  The whole point is that it’s impossible to stop a team playing 5 out when they are getting to the rim every play. They can just swing it to the open shooters.  The Jazz defense was killed yesterday because the Jazz couldn’t play on ball defense. Reggie Jackson had 10 assists in the second half blowing by his guy and kicking it to the corner when Gobert rotates.  The Jazz just don’t have nearly good enough perimeter defenders.  Edit: half*"
"Cam Payne vs. Reggie Jackson, the starting PG matchup we all expected in the Western Conference Finals. Both on minimum contracts BTW. Both are about to get PAID."
"Donovan Mitchell, it's not close, and I won't stand for this augmenting of PG talk. No contributions from Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann, no Clippers in the WCF."
Suns perimeter defenders won’t just allow Reggie Jackson to drive past them at will so no. Mikal Bridges is basketball Jesus suns in 3
"What are you talking about Embiid is one of the best centers of all time at perimeter defense. It isn't ideal for him to be out guarding Reggie Jackson, but he isn't going to get killed like this."
I saw someone else say this and i think its a good way of putting it. If gobert is getting picked apart by steph or harden maybe you can make an excuse for it. Theres no excuse for getting ripped apart by terrence mann and reggie jackson.
"Because the Rockets played a bunch of minutes with Capela and didn't move to true microball until they traded him away. Harden was getting his way throughout that series, though that was partially on slow adjustments. Covering Harden worked once they figured it out and forced Harden into a bunch of bad floaters, but it took until Game 4 for the guys on the floor to defend correctly and then the offense blew it.  And yeah, the Warriors winning in 2017 should be no surprise. Curry/Klay/Dray/KD/Iggy is a cheat code of a lineup with a really strong supporting unit, and no team really has the personnel to deal with that death lineup. (Are you really pointing at the Jazz's performance against one of the best rosters in NBA history who went 16-1 in the playoffs as evidence of defensive incompetency?)  If you somehow meant the series against the Nuggets, where Jokic and Murray were on fire the whole series, Gobert gave Jokic a hard time, and Jokic still made everything. In today's NBA, good offense beats good defense, and Jokic's offense is particularly difficult to stop. (NBA stats showed that he was over 50% FG% in all but one individual big matchup during this past regular season.)  If having Gobert is such a liability, how is no one focusing on our other players' defense? Conley and Mitchell were both hurt during the series and couldn't stay in front of their men, and our wings are slow. Our only positive healthy perimeter defender is Royce O'Neale (Ingles, Bogdanovic, Niang all have slow foot speed and Mitchell was defending on one leg) and while he does a good job on most, he can only cover one guy. Reggie Jackson could literally roast at least any three of the five guys the Jazz put on the floor purely by being faster.  If anything, Gobert's lack of participation in the offense was the more concerning part."
Reggie Jackson &gt; Russell Westbrook  FIGHT ME REDDIT.
"I love how it’s been less than 24 hours and people are still pulling out weird stats that they think absolve him. Just like all regular season when people said “just wait for the playoffs when teams specifically game plan to attack Gobert” it was:  “Oh no this years different his velociraptor stats are 5 higher than previous years he’s gonna be elite this postseason” like bruh  If you actually watch the games you can see 1000x more than any advanced stat. Nah man. Dude was getting bodies by Reggie Jackson in the paint, supposedly Gobert’s territory, while they blew a huge halftime lead while Gobert played every minute of that second half"
I get what you're saying but when you have to adjust the game plan by taking Gobert off the floor that's on Gobert.   Lets also consider the fact that Gobert was being guarded on offense by Terrence Mann and Reggie Jackson lol.
Wasn't it actually your guards simply getting blown by? Reggie Jackson smoking your guard line 1:1 shouldn't happen.
"Dude, Reggie Jackson was actively attacking him in the paint. He’s only good for lobs and open layups on offense. If he’s not stopping anyone, scaring anyone away from the paint, or scoring, then how is he better than Mitchell who could go off for 45 on any given night?"
Gobert’s lack of scoring also wouldn’t be an issue if the Jazz’s wings and guards could keep anyone in front of them. It’s not a black or white issue. Reggie Jackson (a buyout guy just last year) blew past every defender he wanted to. Yes it would mostly solve the problem is Gobert could score on mismatches but it would also mostly solve the problem if the Jazz players weren’t turnstiles.
"Not only was he abused on the perimeter/close outs for 3-point shooters, but Reggie Jackson, Mann, PG, etc were just abusing the paint as well."
They're Oakley's.  [You can see a close up picture here](https://www.google.com/search?q=reggie+jackson+glasses&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01HJV8z6aW69MjNwPMguoi9_RZ-0A:1624120345580&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjp3ZTij6TxAhVoqksFHcRcCPgQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1422&amp;bih=801#imgrc=m-U9rN1-cWQLUM). Not sure of the model though.
And we have some guys that are gonna be on their way out/down after this season. I don’t think we can get Reggie Jackson on a vet min again and Nic Batum is only getting older. He should definitely have a runway into more burn next season
"People are doing both. Lue has gotten a ton of praise for the win, so has Mann, PG, Reggie Jackson and others.  &gt;The Clippers schemed for his weakness.  Everyone knew it was a weakness.  Its not that big a deal for Gobert.   It clearly is a big deal because it lead to his team losing and they are going to be paying him 205 million dollars.  Quin should have adjusted but if you're a max player, winning awards you also have to find a way to contribute in these games."
By Reggie Jackson lmao
"He could at least put effort into his closeouts. At the very least, plus reggie jackson and mann were exposing him at the rim. Going straight at him."
Reggie Jackson and Mann were scoring on Gobert regardless that game. At least KP would bring something to the Jazz on Offense. You’re acting like KP can never learn post moves. All he has to do is stay healthy which Gobert deserves a lot of credit for and build up his body in the post season. He can still work with guys like Hakeem and Dirk to improve.
i watched the game on and off and reggie jackson blew by every single defender kicking it out to mann for a wide open 3 cause rudy slides to try to cover jackson   i don't watch much jazz games but jesus christ they got burned from this exact play like 5 times in the 3Q
Reggie Jackson causally returning to the Reggie Jackson that made Detroit give him a big contract is crazy.
"Seriously. Wow you made the WCF with a superteam of PG13, Mann, and Reggie Jackson. Big whoop."
Not enough has been said about Reggie Jackson. Carried the offense. Generated so many open looks as the ball handler.
"luke kennard and reggie jackson the real mvp's, gave mann the confidence and team energy they didn't have last season.  They got that detroit grindtime mentality and they ballin' with ty lue."
"I don't do it for the internet points, I do it for the love of the game.   There were several times yesterday where fucking Reggie Jackson tried Rudy on floaters/layups right at the rim too, which you'd be certain Gobert would swat the fuck out of. My man who was arguing with me is probably down bad right now."
Reggie Jackson and PG we’re getting into the paint whenever they wanted which was forcing Gobert over. But after a while and like the 4th or 5th three Snyder has to either tell Gobert to just not help on what would be layups or take him out. Jazz perimeter defense was some absolute shit the entire second half
"Clippers didnt need switches. Reggie jackson was roasting their perimeter guys in isolation. If that is going to happen, someone will need to rotate just like Gobert was."
Terance Mann played a wonderful game especially the 3rd quarter…. But Reggie Jackson was the star of today’s game….. every time that man had the ball he was so dangerous whether he was scoring or assisting…. He was the motor of the team he kept them going
They made Reggie Jackson look like Kyrie Irving
"People who believe this simply don't understand how basketball works and it's frankly embarrassing. The entire defensive scheme of the Jazz is built on Gobert protecting the rim and the Jazz wings taking away three point shots, the Jazz have some of the worst collection of defensive wings and simply rely on Gobert to clean up all of their messes. A team that can play 5 out and have dynamic perimeter players were always going to be an issue for this team.   You're literally blaming Gobert for not being able to be in two places at once. The blame should be on the Jazz wing/guard players who can't keep reggie Jackson in front of them."
"And he got terence mann and Reggie Jackson open 3's. This is team basketball, not 1v1"
"How would sitting him have fixed this? His guys were getting corner 3s because he had to rotate on every possession and then get back to his man. No other jazz player could do that. If the perimeter guys cant even slow down a straight iso from reggie jackson, a small ball center is gonna get cooked too. This wasnt a pick and roll problem or one that would be fixed by switching."
without Kawhi? not on paper. I mean their leading scorers yesterday were Mann and Reggie Jackson thats not what you'd expect a championship team to have lol
"They could have gotten good minutes with it against some really slow footed bigs. Basketball is a 5v5 game and a lot of the reason that LA got whatever they wanted was because legitimately everyone on Utah looked bad defensively, not just Gobert. Not sure if that’s because Conley and Mitchell were hurt but at the end of the day they had Nic Batum throwing down blow by dunks and Reggie Jackson looked like prime Tony Parker"
"Yeah, if you’re going to pick a Laker it should be Schroeder.  The guy thought he was worth $20 million a year.  Thats Reggie Jackson money."
He wasn’t even a defensive force in the paint. He was getting taken to the rim by Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann repeatedly. The fact he couldn’t even box out and reliably rebound over 6’4 guards had to deflate his teams energy around him.
No they aren’t lol. The Hawks are really good and lmaooo you don’t think Trae would have made Rudy look like a fool out there based on what Reggie Jackson and the Clippers role players did to him the last few games?
Reggie Jackson was looking like James harden against their perimeter defense and they come and blame gobert. Really weird one.

Lol reggie jackson and mann was attacking rudy at the rim all game and he couldn’t do anything about it.
"Reggie Jackson..did they run out of names they are recycling? Who was playing center, John Kennedy?"
"Neither because there is a zero percent chance they would get good enough value for either.  However there are literally 15+ guys that can do what Mitchell does at his level or above (aka be not that efficient on massive volume but go off big here and there with embarrassingly bad defense) and there is like 5 than guys in the entire league that can even do what Gobert does 80% as well.  Yeah Mitchell had alot of points, but him getting completely toasted by medicore players like Reggie Jackson (+ the whole team not rotating properly after Gobert) is why the Clippers had so many open threes. It was embarrassing to watch."
"I guess defense and offense are played on two different courts. The only reason our small ball works is because he’s an absolute scrub on offense. He can’t score on Reggie Jackson.   This is the playoffs, good teams are gonna have multiple guys you can’t stop 1v1. Now against five small shooters you’re in scramble mode with a slow ass center."
It's not Goberts fault that Mitchell and everyone on the perimeter were getting blown by  via backup pgs like Reggie Jackson lmao
Reggie Jackson straight up hit a lay up like he wasn't there was telling. Neverming running the same dribble drive play that got the Clips a lot of wide open baseline 3s

Ngl I had no idea who Reggie Jackson was before this season
Anyone watch that sbnation video on Reggie Jackson and Russ?
I think Reggie Jackson shoots 100% when there is less than a second on the shot clock.
Yea Reggie Jackson too. Dude is balling out.
pistons were non stop sell outs when they were good. People will actually go to games when we don't have to watch reggie jackson and drummond as our cornerstones
In my totally non-biased opinion... Reggie Jackson vet min
When did Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson become such lethal shooters… Especially Jackson… Everytine he shoots it I think it’s going in…
Cam Payne looking like Reggie Jackson tonight 😤
Cameron Payne vs Reggie Jackson duel
"Tinkering ty be tinkering  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers starting lineup  Patrick Beverley   Reggie Jackson   Paul George   Marcus Morris   Ivica Zubac"
"Surprisingly reasonable take from someone’s mom. This is kinda just human nature. Ty Lue has a ‘who gives a shit’ vibe. A ‘been there done that, I don’t really care Dude I played with Mike and Kobe, coached Bron’ attitude. I’ve had coaches like him. They help you to not care and just hoop.  Doc? Doc is old school. Seems like he’s gonna cry at any minute, always yellin. Probably changes up when it gets tight bc he knows like you know that he’s got that bad rep on his back. Which makes YOU tight   Doc coaches scared. Prime example is Ty Lue is like F it I’m sitting Rondo and Beverly and going with reggie Jackson and Terence Mann. Doc?  Doesn’t play Shake Milton who’s the more dynamic player, a scorer, higher upside. Doc goes with just about the safest player in the game George hill who you KNEW wasn’t gonna step outside himself"
"No. 8) No doubt Trae is becoming a star, but let's hold off on superstar until we see how the crackdown on foul-baiting affects him.  No. 6) Lue may not have LeBron, but he has whatever alien that has possessed Reggie Jackson"
"If you Google ""Reggie Jackson"" you'll find that he's, astonishingly, in the hall of fame already."
Reggie Jackson
"I think OKC is maximizing their future draft capital to find the next generation of All-Stars that can lead the Thunder to perennial postseason trips. I’m just a bit curious how long this timeline will last, and how it matches up with Shai’s. My best behind-the-scenes Thunder story: Reggie Jackson showed up to Kendrick Perkins’ kid’s birthday party at these horse stables. And around the corner, here comes 6’10, 270-pound Perk in an all black-leather cowboy outfit, boots and spurs."
"Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson"
"Payne, Reggie Jackson, Dort. There are probably many others that I can’t think of right now but those three came to mind."
"Agreed. This is the second-best outcome from my perspective. Of course I want the Lakers to win, but if we couldn't then it's awesome to see all these young guys stepping up and making their mark. I'm in awe of how, in their first ever playoffs, players like Booker and Young have stepped tf up. Even the Clippers have Mann coming from seemingly out of nowhere, and guys like Reggie Jackson who had been written off showing they do have what it takes. Very exciting playoffs, loving the parity."
Isn't Reggie Jackson with the Clippers now?
Porzingis is supposed to be. But man cant back down reggie jackson and gets stripped every other time he takes a dribble.
"you moved the goal posts, you stated the bucks have all of these weapons that can go off. Yet the clippers average more points as a team, and Kawhi, PG, Reggie Jackson, Morris, even Mann have scored over 20 once this post season. the clippers are far superior on the offensive end bud."
"I completely agree, man. Against the terrible bigs like Gobert who can’t even score on Reggie Jackson, he’d wreak havoc defensively and can play-make with shooters on the offensive end."
"His contact numbers are hard to predict because teams can’t be counted on to be rational actors. As far as his future as a player, I don’t imagine he can really be a point guard. His play making instincts aren’t quite good enough, and he forces far too many possessions. That being said, I don’t know if he’s quite the shooter necessary to be a great 2 guard either. I’d imagine he’ll end up in a scoring bench role. He reminds me a little of Reggie Jackson in OKC, but I do think that Reggie was a more assertive driver even at that stage."
Supporting cast take defensive pressure off the first option which allows them to play better. The difference between the 2020 and 2021 clippers isn't Doc. It's PG stepping up and role players like Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris taking punishing defense that try to double kawhi
Playoff Reggie Jackson looks like an all time great.
Kawhi using nano-bots to control Reggie Jackson from afar.
"Because the Clippers schemed against the drop defense, this wasn’t Reggie attacking downhill into Gobert waiting at the hoop, it was putting nothing but shooters on the floor so Gobert had no choice but to step out, and then in space cooking him with smaller faster guys who he can’t hope to contain on the move.  They very effectively neutralized Gobert and Jackson did a great job running the drive and kick five out system generating the outside in penetration to open up the defense and create points, but I don’t think it’s an indictment of Gobert."
"Lesson learned from this year, players develop and change over time, and a singular Covid year of wiseman is not necessarily an indicator of his success next year.  See: Deandre Ayton, Reggie Jackson, Trae Young"
Reggie Jackson is still playing last I checked
Even a Reggie Jackson type of player would make Embiid's game easier
"True Tobias is not a reliable second option. At this point, Reggie Jackson would be better.  Seth Curry and Tobias are not good enough as 2nd and 3rd options to get to the ECF   whereas the Atl play fearlessly, shoot fearlessly and knew the Sixers were playing scared. Raja Bell would say a team that doesn't know any better with that much confidence is dangerous af.    They're playing with house money from lottery to the sky."
Who's your #1 then? The Jazz losing to Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann?
"&gt; Not just Middleton, but Holiday as well (or Holiday out and a hobbled Middleton for a few games)...the Clippers equivalent of the Nets case is Kawhi healthy, but PG hobbled and Reggie Jackson out...I hate getting into hypotheticals and excuses but it seems difficult to win with the 2 and 3 options out.  Yeah I agree, I was just using two random players as an example, it could be any top 3 of any team and it would likely be the same scenario."
"Not just Middleton, but Holiday as well (or Holiday out and a hobbled Middleton for a few games)...the Clippers equivalent of the Nets case is Kawhi healthy, but PG hobbled and Reggie Jackson out...I hate getting into hypotheticals and excuses but it seems difficult to win with the 2 and 3 options out.  Harris was a 4th option to start the series, but the entire offensive scheme and focus changed so many times in the series alone, Harris went from the 4th to the 3rd to the 2nd then back to 3rd (when Harden came back, although it still could've been 2nd) option, a lot of drastic changes affected the offensive output there and the Nets had to plan around that each time"
"I get the comparison you're making but it's wrong to say he's like a younger Draymond Green. A big thing with Draymond Green is he is physically quite limited but he's making the most of everything he has while Ben Simmon is physically gifted.  But yes I think going forward Simmons is better off in a forward role, and playing alongside at least one lead guard who has a complete skillset. Look at how even a guy like Reggie Jackson was over to take over a game for the Clippers, and Dennis Schroeder last year - it's much easier to find above-average shotmaking and creating ability in guards than it is in forwards."
"Problem with that is Oubre thinks he’s a #1, not a #4/5 option. He’s Detroit Reggie Jackson, not LAC Reggie Jackson"
"You mean like Reggie Jackson did. Clippers challenged him in the paint and were successful, even small guys."
"If Reggie Jackson doesn’t drop 32 in Game 4 KD chokes in the 1st round of his MVP year  He’s always had the most help of all superstars. He was even favored in the Finals over the Heatles, so his team was superteam caliber even if people don’t think of them as."
No one forgets him in okc. No one forgets his pisspoor performances as well and being saved by reggie jackson vs grizz. His okc days shouldnt boost him lol. He was bad 2014 and 2016 in tons of moments
"you’re right, but let’s not forget that reggie jackson and terance mann were getting buckets on him in the paint too lmao."
"It is just weird that one coach uses Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum to destroy the best defense in the league, and another coach can't find a way to exploit one of the worst defensive players in the league. I agree with you that the Sixers weren't a championship level team with the injuries, though."
I think if one team figures out the other through adjustments it's the Suns. Clippers also have a few things they can fix but fatigue + already giving them the smallball looks and not having great success + no Kawhi makes their margin of error minute. Like I know he's been great for 9 games but Reggie Jackson was ridiculous last night.    Devin Booker was robbed of his all nba selection.   Terance Mann is dope and Pfizer P will be awesome to witness.   The chess match in the first half was compelling but the second half with the superstars going off and the Mikal showing in the fourth quarter was better.   I know that it's discounting the Clippers majorly and it will not go that way cause they're just that good at shooting but my feel has been Suns in 5 idk. I'd say 6 it's much more likely though.  Deandre Ayton can do some things better but he was great overall. Helped shut down PG when he stopped dropping on him in the 4th.
"Patrick Beverly throwing himself into Russ' knee while he calls timeout and bringing him out of the game for two seasons on-and-off due to complications after the initial long recovery... And then the next time they play, feinting doing it again in the exact same situation.  Reggie Jackson playing selfishly during his first years in OKC to the point where the team froze him out during a game and had Kendrick Perkins and Serge Ibaka bring the ball down the court instead of him.  The Morris brothers having a history of violence and dirty plays.  Rondo quitting on the Mavericks.  Serge Ibaka being a genuinely awesome person while also being more wealthy, more talented, and more handsome than 99+% of the world.  A lot of reasons for the Clippers to be the actual villains of these playoffs, and not just the ""love to root against them"" villain that is Trae Young stunting on fanbases all around the east coast.  (OKC still loves you, Serge)"
"Recency bias. A month+ ago, it would be like this for the Sixers:  * Embiid (MVP candidate who might have won if he played enough games), * Simmons (DPOY candidate), * Tobias (idk best season with the Sixers yet), * Seth (literally Steph 2.0), * Maxey (rookie who just torched the Wizards), * Dwight/ Green (who  were just fresh off championships), * Hill (perennial competent back-up guard they managed to acquire for peanuts)  while like this for the Clippers:  * Load Management and Pandemic P * Patrick ""Tricked Y'all"" ""Too Fucking Short"" Beverly * Batum and Reggie Jackson playing heavy minutes  I would only give Luka a pass because he carried that team, got hurt mid-series, kept playing, and still put up godly numbers. But nobody should say Luka's competition was significantly better, just to diminish Trae who also has injured teammates"
"The thing with the Jazz was that their perimeter guys got cooked so many times whether it was PG or Reggie Jackson taking them 1 on 1. Gobert comes to stop them at the rim, then they either take him right on or pass it out to the open guy on the corner 3. But still, i don't think people in the league get scared of Gobert either, yeah he's the DPOY but it doesn't look like anyone actually respects that."
Reggie Jackson in Detroit looked pretty awful. How does he look now? Ben needs to go to a different team.
"Yeah Ayton's definitely going to be a problem this series. There's no chance PG and Jackson straight up abuse him, but I have hope they'll improve over the course of the series. You could tell they just didnt have their legs under them towards the end of the game today. I've never seen Reggie look that tired. He looked like he was out of breath multiple times in the 2nd half. Closing out an emotional game 6 in LA on Friday night then having to hop on a plane to Phoenix in time for tip off at noon on Sunday is a very quick turnaround. Hoping they have a little more in them before game 2 on Tuesday. Since we have no 2 day breaks throughout this series, they have to take advantage of those extra few hours they get due to a day game lol"
Gobert got bodied by reggie jackson in the series
Has anyone else been impressed with how good Reggie Jackson has been playing all playoffs? Dude got paid the minimum contract and is playing like an all star. I think he played better than Jrue holiday so far in the playoffs.
"Probably reggie jackson, payne, and huerter. All three were players who I thought played excellent during the year but just stepped it up to another level in the postseason. Big name guys like ayton and trae were already good.   Watching the clippers I always thought mann should be on the court more often than not, so not really surpsied by him breaking out when they overextended on jackson and pg.  Simmons I thought should never have been an all star since he got in the league and I have never been impressed by as tatum and brown have just dominated him with ease every year.   KD looks even better which is pretty incredible. Another year, another missed playoffs for kyrie. The last 4 years he has only played in 1 full post season and he threw the series  (milwaukee last year on celtics). I rate kyrie a lot lower than most because I have no faith in who shows up when he walks in.  Randle was 2nd team all nba and shouldn't even have been on the roster. Sure maybe 3rd team but you cant have your success because your coach and randle. Its one or the other in my eyes, and clearly thibs was the key this year for that team.  Even though I am a celtics fan and think tatum is top 10, it still amazes me when he plays better than guys like pg and jokic in the postseason. He is a true postseason player. Sucks we couldnt see brown either, he steps it up several order of magnitude.  &amp;#x200B;  kinda a lot but yeah thats what ive noticed"
Ben gave Trae more respect than Reggie Jackson gave Gobert
Reggie Jackson
Payne and Reggie Jackson
Kawhi also was injured. Y’all just got outplayed by Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann
"Bro, what? Lol.  I’m all for PG playing like he has and shutting people up, and Mann has been fun to watch, and Reggie Jackson is a good dude. Other than that, almost everyone on the team is a massive piece of shit or doesn’t really inspire strong feelings one way or the other.  The Clippers are easily the least likable team left. Marcus Morris and his sexist ass and Pat Bev with his well known antics are shitty enough on their own to drive enough dislike to make them the least likable team left. Lol."
Reggie motherfucking Jackson
Jazz wings were letting Reggie Jackson look like prime D rose with how easy it was for him to get into the paint
Reggie Jackson
It's Reggie Jackson and Lonzo ball quite easily
Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson&gt; Ben Simmons
Simmons was like the Sixers 4th best player this series. That'd be like saying Luka faced Reggie Jackson or some shit
“Reggie Jackson” and “lights out” is a phrase I never thought I’d hear when he was on the Pistons. If only those teams had a legit star to run the offense...
Nah. Reggie Jackson.
it's arguably way more embarrassing than getting roasted by Reggie Jackson
"Even if they were bad they were still guarded as stars. If you had Schroeder and Reggie Jackson in their place, Lebron wouldn't had the same spacing"
Reggie Jackson would continue to go off
No way they’d say if they don’t have to. Why take the possibility of Kawhi off the board. They have to dedicate time to practicing for him if they don’t know.   The second they say he’s done it’s more time to focus on PG or Reggie Jackson….which is a wild thing to say as I read it back in my head.
luka had plenty of possessions guarded by lou will and reggie jackson in 2020
I knew Reggie Jackson was everywhere but damn.
"Yea, it was a choke by KD but Reggie Jackson saved him. It was an almost-choke by the Thunder so everyone forgot"
I like pg and Reggie Jackson and Mann and ty lue.  It’s still fuck pat bev tho
"I mean, they started to put Kawhi on him as the primary defender as the series went along. If they didn't want his teammates to go off, they would've put Reggie Jackson as his primary defender, instead."
"The  2014 OKC thunder had top 6 offense and a top 5 defense. The Warriors this year had a top 5 defense and were 20th in offensive rating. When Curry was off the floor, they had the 5th worst offense in NBA history( and thats not even taking into account today's pace). They wouldn't  have made playoffs. Draymond Green already would be useless on offense without a player like Curry or Klay playing offball. KD needs a decent point guard to be at his best. His whole career he had Westbrook,Curry,Kyrie,Harden. In 2014 he had Reggie Jackson who played well as a starter."
"Moore is a better facilitator/passer than Carter, but at this point, I'd like to see Carter and his hustle out there, particularly against Reggie Jackson or Paul George."
"Players get relegated to spot-up shooters with Lebron when they can’t efficiently create / make shots for themselves. Bron tried his best to give DS a chance to run the offense, but at a certain point it just doesn’t make sense to not have the Ball in your best playmaker’s hands when the player who is taking the usage away is a walking brick. DS did have health and safety protocols which count for something, but he was horrible in that series outside those two wins.  This version of Reggie Jackson would thrive playing next to Lebron. The chemistry from last years team was amazing, that’s never a problem for a Lebron team.   It wouldn’t change anything though. If AD was always going to get injured, the series is over regardless. The Suns are really good and it would take adding Steph curry to win against them with Ad injured/the rest of the roster forgetting how to play basketball."
Reggie Jackson is winning FMVP. Calling it now.
"He is, he's just not a very good passer.  Like a better version of Schroder or Reggie Jackson."
"As bad as Albert is, his color broadcasters are all much worse.  At least with Albert there is an unintended humor to him, like watching a bad movie. With the analysts? They're all so fucking boring. Unless he takes Chris Webber and Greg Anthony and Reggie Miller and Grant Hill and Jim Jackson and the rest of the milquetoast crew with him, it's just going to be the same garbage product."
"I don't care about their accolades and I didn't say Reggie is straight up better. I said if you have a contender and you're missing a decent PG, Jackson is better for that team. Russ can't shoot and he's a bad defender. He's also extremely inefficient from pretty much everywhere"
a team with its best player as paul george and second best reggie jackson is not stacked
Trae for sure  Also low key Reggie Jackson has had a better postseason than Westbrook has had in like 7 years
we win the finals with reggie jackson instead of bumass schroder
Reggie Jackson is finally healthy and showing why Detroit gave him the bag. I love it so much
"Dude dunno who tf was talking shit about him this postseason, the guy has been PHENOMENAL. People here barely watch the damn games, Idgaf what they say - I just had 10 people tell me that you can't foul someone to make them shoot FTs unless they're handling the ball, literally 5 days after the Hawks did that to Simmons so many times.  Reggie Jackson would start for like 25 teams in the NBA and would be a top 3 player for more than half of them imo. Exceptional 3 point shooter and decent defender that doesn't turn the ball over and can create a bit for himself. Also he's making 2.5mil per year rn lmao"
Tyler Herro is this years Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson. Performing well for their teams and playing well. Trae Young is inspiring kids and the younger generation. I’m not saying he’s the next MJ but he’s for sure the next “demi-god” for Atlanta
"If Reggie Jackson is your best player, you're gonna tank regardless of young players and whatnot."
"Reggie Jackson, king of LA"
"I like Reggie, he’s got that fan vibe where he just seems to be enjoying the game. And anything is better than listening to Mark Jackson say the same 3 things for 2.5+ hours"
76ers win that series in 5 with Reggie Jackson... let's start there
"&gt; He certainly wasn't a great coach but Milwaukee showed vast improvement from his first season there to his last season there.  This is just categorically untrue. Everything was worse by the end. In his 1st season, he employed an aggressive, blitzing defensive scheme that led to us having the second-best defensive efficiency rating in the NBA. But the whole league figured it out by his 2nd year and he never changed it. Our defensive rating went from 2nd to 22nd to 19th to 25th at the time he was fired in his last season.  He never improved schematically as a coach and had zero answers when things went wrong. He would always just blame ""energy and effort"" (get used to that phrase) and took to blaming the team's youth for his shortcomings toward the end of his tenure (the roster overall was fairly young, but the core outside of Giannis really wasn't).  And he continued to make some of his most brain-dead decisions up until the very end. There was a game about a month before he was fired where we were up 3 with 1.4 seconds left against Cleveland. He instructed Khris Middleton to intentionally miss his free throw so we could avoid the possibility of a 4-point play. I'm not kidding, that's 100% real. Not long before that, there was a game where we led by 4 against Detroit with 10 seconds left and intentionally fouled career 86% FT shooter Reggie Jackson, justifying it with this gem:   &gt; They’re trying to play the game of quick twos to save their timeouts, so we’ll just play the free-throw game with them. I believe that my guys will make the free throws. They miss one and it works. It’s a free-throw game no matter what, but we wanted to send them to the line  He was a dreadful in-game coach from start to finish in Milwaukee and he didn't make up for it by being some phenomenal players' coach. He reportedly wasn't even on speaking terms with Jabari Parker by the end and Malcolm Brogdon barely hid his disdain for Kidd. Giannis liked him, but that says much more about Giannis than Kidd.  Maybe he's learned a lot since then (mostly in terms of player relations, it's extremely difficult for me to imagine him achieving close to competency as an in-game coach) and won't be as much of a disaster as he was here. He wasn't Jim Boylen levels of bad in player management, but I honestly do think this is closer to hiring Boylen than it is a ""shades of gray"" situation like you're saying."
Reggie “Shotgun” Jackson. Each one of his shots feel like a point blank shotgun.
"Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson."
Reggie Jackson style. Homerun or strikeout
Also a lot of turnovers. He's played average at best. I'd say sub-par. Reggie Jackson was their best offensive weapon
Do the clippers have bird rights to sign Reggie Jackson next season?
"I find it funny how Star focused we are in terms of assigning credit. PG has been playing very well, but the roles players have been ABSURDLY good since Kawhi went down.   In the last 5 games, look at their role players TS%. Mann (81%), Beverly (64%), Reggie Jackson (65%), Zubac (72%), Batum (77%), Kennard (63%). Only Morris (51%) and Rondo (53%) are poor.   PG is at 54% TS since Kawhi went down.   Yes, PG has been solid, but the Clippers success is just as much if not more due to the role players playing out of their minds. This postseason, PG is 3rd/4th on the roster in Win Shares despite playing way more than anyone else on the team. Of the rotation players he's 6th in Box Plus Minus, 4th in VORP, 4th in On/Off.   That's not to say he isn't playing well, but let's give credit to how amazing the role players have been."
"Reggie Jackson is beyond ""breakout phases"", as he's been in the league 10 years now. It's more that he's finally being utilized in a situation that suits him really well."
"What's interesting to me is that despite having 25% more minutes played than anyone else, he's only 16th in Win Shares in the playoffs.    He's tied for 3rd/4th on the Clippers alone in win shares. Kawhi (2.7), Batum (1.7), Reggie Jackson (1.5), PG (1.5). Heck, he's 9th on the Clippers in BPM (although a couple of those guys have very few minutes played.   I wouldn't say he's carrying the Clippers. I'd say he's playing well and the overall clippers roster is very deep."
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis Schröder   oh and 1.5 mil vs 15 mil 😮‍💨
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; Dennis Schröder   oh and 1.5 mil vs 15 mil 😮‍💨
it also helps that Reggie Jackson is playing insanely well and Terrance Mann's been the head custodian for Zubac's Cleanup Crew
No thats Reggie jackson
"Green teamers often compare the Celtics to the Clippers. The difference is that Jaylen Brown would be sitting at the end of the bench in LA. Reggie Jackson is so much better than Jaylen, it's sad at this point."
I know reddit loves to shit on the Clippers but what they're doing this postseason is legit inspiring. If you can't feel romantic about basketball watching Reggie Jackson and Terence Mann carrying this team then you gotta stop drinking the hater-ade
"I should be happier for Reggie Jackson than I am, but here we are"
Is Reggie Jackson better than Steph curry?

Reggie Jackson is not scary looking.  He looks like he's about to hack a bank vault with a ragtag crew
He’s 29-75 this series but this sub loves chuckers so much they’ll ignore the fact that he’s being thoroughly outplayed by Reggie Jackson. The only thing George is carrying is his own ego.
"Reggie Jackson regularly has unexpected comebacks. When Brandon Jennings got injured after he came to Detroit, or when he came back in the spring of 2019 and Pistons were winning and had one of their best season of the last decade.  We're only two years removed from seeing the titles like ""Reggie Jackson is almost playing like a player who got paid 80 million""."
"I love the Clippers mentality when down, consistently showing up. I feel really sad for Kawhi, would've loved to see him locked in making plays all over the court(would have been a Finals MVP candidate later on), but I've been extremely impressed with Reggie Jackson, maybe it's because I hadn't seen him play much before this but he shows some real skill under such pressure.   PS: I'm a Masters student and I watch a lot of sports, so for my dissertation I am trying to test a behavioural science concept using sports prediction data. Please spend a minute and put your Conference Finals predictions here:   https://forms.gle/cNAFSS3GEzHPWrHn7"
"you know just about 3 weeks ago i absolutely hated the clippers with such a passion. like it was so intense. and then after kawhi going down, watching them just keep coming back, terrance mann going off, reggie jackson playing like prime mj at times, I'm lowkey rooting for these dudes to get to the finals."
"You don’t watch the games. If you think that Kennard and fucking RONDO, both of which barely play, are out there isoing and making their own shots then you’re just brain dead. mook can make his own shot but it’s extremely inefficient as it’s usually turnaround fadeaway baseline jumpers. The only people on the team who can iso and make their own EFFICIENT shot are Paul George and Reggie Jackson."
Reggie “The Zit” Jackson
&gt;	His true shooting is %58.3. league average During the REGULAR season is %56.1.  wow that’s about 2% above average. Insane   Reggie Jackson has a true shooting of 65.6% this playoffs.   And guess what? Reggie Jackson is still only 8th in true shooting on the Clippers this playoffs. PG has to get more shots for his teammates
"Reggie “MR. “Regi ""Bobby 'Big Government' Schmurda"" gigas” June” Jackson"
 If Kawhi is healthy Mann probably doesn't produce the way he has. Everything before the Kawhi injury is proof of that. Does Paul George go back to Pandemic P. Does Reggie Jackson step up.
"The suns might not give him enough touches and the leadership/coach should be telling him to be much more aggressive to get touches. However he doesn’t want the ball the way he needs to. Watching him run pick and roll where he hesitates then rolls like an 86 yr old grandma is the most frustrating thing. He takes away his chance of getting the ball on most roll plays. He needs to pivot and move fast with the dribbler but never does. The dribbler looks over and he’s not there.   Midway through 4th early in the possesion Ayton has Reggie Jackson on him, he could post up and seal him easily. Instead he stands on the baseline."
is it just me or does it seem like reggie jackson literally never misses during the 4th?
Counterpoint: glasses Reggie Jackson
"Bro, it’s a screen strapped to his face. Not everyone becomes goggles Reggie Jackson"
"The only players who can CONSISTENTLY create their own shot now that Kawhi is gone are PG, Reggie.  Batum, Morris, Mann CAN do it but they look very awkward trying and are more comfortable getting set up from someone else like PG, Rondo, Jackson.  So I don't blame PG for trying to create too much at times.  I'd rather have him shoot 25+ then have Morris, Batum shoot too much."
nah reggie jackson has won a playoff game
2 words... Reggie Fucking Jackson
"If Reggie Jackson was known to be able to perform at the level he's performed at in these playoffs, he would not be making 2.3 million dollars this year."
Pretty certain Reggie Jackson is a mostly known quantity though.
Is he even the biggest breakout on his own team? Reggie Jackson has been way more impressive imo.
"I get he has ""leadership"" and veteran ""presence"" but I wouldn't want him giving Reggie Jackson or Mann advice to dribble into the lane and probe but do nothing while in there. Just as I wouldn't want Boogie giving Zubac advice on how to post up. I want Rondo &amp; Boogie to clap next to Balmer and not get a technical by leaving the bench after celebrating a Zubac rim run dunk or coming to the defense of Beverley when he gets into a stare with Crowder."
"When they had literal Blake Griffin on the roster? When they had Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, and Andre Drummond???  Yes. Absolutely. They just were really bad at it."
"Reggie Jackson's and Terence Mann's overall offensive rating is still higher than PG13's. In fact, PG13's offensive rating significantly drops when Reggie Jackson is off the court. It's more of a team effort than PG13 leading the team.  https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=202331&amp;VsPlayerID=202704"
"MR. June Reggie ""Bobby 'Big Government' Schmurda"" Jackson"
High because Reggie Jackson is shooting like Steph Curry every single game this postseason
It unleashed the full power of Reggie Jackson.
The Clippers didn't trade for Rondo to be a scorer. They traded for him to be the PG in the half-court that they needed last year and this year during the regular season. Everyone saw how much of a difference having Rondo was for the Lakers last year. The only thing that could make Reggie Jackson better than Rondo is him consistently scoring 20+ points which is exactly what he's doing
Nobody is paying Reggie Jackson anywhere close to what Jaylen Brown makes
"And the strange thing is that it’s not Paul George that’s going off, it’s the role players like Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann, Beverley, Morris, Kennard who have largely stepped up their play this postseason"
"Was obviously not just a one-man show, what with Reggie Jackson and Ivica Zubac stepping up, but PG was sturdy as they come today on offense."
non-contract year reggie jackson will disappoint you
"Reggie Jackson has a higher on off court rating than PG13. Terence Mann has a similar on off court rating.  As you can see from your own statistic, PG13 being off the court means they have a better defensive rating. Does that mean PG13 is a bad defender?  https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612746/onoffcourt-summary/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=DIFF_OFF_RATING&amp;dir=1"
Reggie Jackson is one bad man
"Sure 22 pts on 15 shots isn't horrible. It's not excellent, as people are trying to make it seem.   But PG isn't only taking 15 shots. He had 27 pts on 26 shots tonight. That's not good.   He's had some excellent games, sure, but he's definitely had some horrible ones. Reggie Jackson has crazily enough been a stud and one of their most consistent players, and Morris, before this series where he's hurt, had been killing it too. Nic Batum may be one of the most understated pieces on this team too.   Call it what is is: Paul George has the highest ceiling and has potential to play up to it on any given night, but his volatility has been masked by other dudes on the team playing well above what is expected of them."
I think it's pretty bad if they cant win game 4. But who knows. A reggie jackson injury or paul george injury can make this entirely different.
"I recently watched an episode of Beef on youtube that talked about Reggie Jackson. You wonder what his career could have been in a different place. Then again, he's making the most of if now."
"Reggie ""Bobby 'Big Government' Schmurda"" Jackson"
"it's important to note because it shows how the opponent's defense is. if reggie jackson has a higher ts% than PG13, that says something, and it also says something about the opponent's defense.  btw pg13's defense hasn't been great imo. mavs killed them on offense. mitchell played super well."
"Reggie Jackson just found out about how much money Dennis turned down, and he took that personally. He wants that 2016 Bismack Biyombo special."
This is a hard carry by Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann as much as it is by PG.
I don’t think anyone expected Reggie Jackson to play like this. They probably expected Rondo to be above him
Booker had a worse game tonight than Reggie Jackson has had all playoffs lol
The Suns backcourt getting outplayed by Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson is the last thing I expected. Did pat bev really just score 1 on 1 on Mikal Bridges in the paint?
"2ubac really made it hell on the Suns to get to the hoop, him being out there bodying everyone up and providing size inside really ignited the initial run to put them ahead big, and Reggie Jackson turning into Michael Jordan in the 4th kept them there."
Saying he led them to the conference finals is really diminishing how well Reggie Jackson and Terence Mann played. The role players stepped up way more than Paul George did.
reggie jackson will never let u guys loose after the first two games
What is with these interview questions? Just saw an intense game and Rachel Nichols asking PG13 about being besties with Reggie Jackson? I want THAT job. 🙃
"The advanced stats have never like Sexton that much, even offensively, given how much he chucks. Seeing Reggie Jackson in the playoffs is a good proxy for what Sexton can be but at a big salary number, no thanks."
"Prior to this game, he's been averaing 17/3/3 on 50/42/93 splits all playoffs. Heard it from the cast in game 1iirc and have been checking every game since lol  He's fucking balled out hard. Tonight 23/1/3 with 2 steals on 9/17 FGs  Reggie Jackson for the Clippers really turned out to be what the Lakers expected to get in Schroeder"
Reggie Jackson has been playing like a Finals MVP hotdamn 😤😤
"Booker and Paul combine for 10-40 from the field, Reggie ""minimum contract but actually max player in the playoffs"" Jackson continues his bullshit, and I'm surprised it wasn't a 40 point win."
Some team is going overpay big time for Reggie Jackson
Pat Bev and Reggie Jackson. That is all I can say
What a weird way to spell Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is being clutch this off season he needs a pay raise
Watching Reggie Jackson just reminds me how fucking good okc is at drafting
"I've never paid much attention to Reggie Jackson before the playoffs, now I'm a fan. He's been doing very well. Kind of the same with Trae. Never really paid attention to the Hawks, but this playoffs Trae solidified himself as a playoffs legend and during his first playoffs too!"
You mean Reggie “Steph Curry” Jackson?
"Top 7 offense, top 7 defense, best record against +.500 teams all year.  On a 9 game win streak before these last 2, yeah, pretty weak lol.  How about you give some credit to Reggie Jackson and Paul George who are playing at their absolute peak rn? A coach who’s pushing all the right buttons?  I know you the clips but have some pride bruh"
" ""*I been Reggie Jackson with the shot. Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Jackson with the pot*"""
Is Reggie Jackson the greatest Reggie Jackson in sports history?
"Star, no?  Good role player and starter, yes.   Also fuck Reggie Jackson"
Lamo Reggie Jackson is killing it for sure but he does not get those shots without Paul George. Even at 35% he's still commanding the best suns defender / double teams creating space for his role players.
OP forgot Reggie Jackson?
"shout out Reggie Jackson, man that Clipper's nice"
"Everyone is missing the point the dude was trying to make.   Sometimes a team play with better ball movement, more desperation, more energy, *without* their star, at least in the short term (Suns w/ cam Payne).  Bringing Kawhi back doesn’t necessarily mean the Suns get ‘molliwopped’ as OP implied. Mann wouldn’t be playing like this, Reggie Jackson wouldn’t be looking like a top 5 pg in the league. It’d be a completely different series, which I admit we’d probably be the underdogs in."
"Reggie ""goggles"" Jackson will be the GOAT with 17FMVPs"
Lol this is a subtle way of telling us that Reggie Jackson was born in Italy
"I think so.  I am firmly in the Clippers Hater Brigade, but even I'm starting to kind of root for them.  The Bucks/Hawks/Suns/Mavs were the 4 teams that would make a dream conference finals for me this year, as those are my 4 favorite teams to watch.  Clippers being the odd man out and the ""villain"" taking out the Mavs again just added to my hatred.  But man, their resilience in these playoffs is winning me over. Reggie Jackson is one of the most insane stories in recent playoff memory. And PG leading the league in playoff minutes, having to do so much on both ends of the floor, with Kawhi out, it's a god damn herculean effort."
"Don't let PG's incredible 41/13/6 on 15-20 shooting distract you from the fact that Reggie ""minimum contract btw"" Jackson continued to play like an all-star with **another** efficient 20+ pt game."
Reggie Jackson easily. He's looking like he stole someone else's skill entirely.
I've been respecting them all playoffs. I wish the Lakers had a Reggie Jackson on the team :/
REGGIE BIG GOVERNMENT JACKSON. Been my favorite player on the clippers
Reggie Jackson is playing great. Kuzma and Dennis combined for less than him I think.
"The way Reggie Jackson is playing, Reggie Jackson is to 4th quarter playoff basketball what Reggie Jackson is to 9th inning playoff baseball."
"I actually want the Suns to win because of my Clippers hatred and even I think they are looking very suspect right now, even in their wins  I've had Suns fans talk about how good Reggie Jackson is playing right now and he certainly is, but that is absolutely nothing compared to the Kawhi the Mavericks had to face"
Reggie Jackson still playing tho…
"the clippers supporting cast is better than the lakers supporting cast though, lebron didnt have a reggie jackson on his team"
Step down from Reggie Jackson to Alex Caruso
I love Reggie Jackson but watching his post game I’m reminded he talks like Dave Chapelle doing his white people voice.
Hell of a game by PG and Reggie Jackson. Is this what a Morris revenge game looks like?
"They’re not wrong. Paul George and Reggie Jackson have to be historical AGAIN for them to even have a shot. Don’t see it happening.  I will say — game 2 officiating in those last 3 minutes changed the momentum of this series. Also, had the Clips just made 2 freaking free throws in that game , we’d be having a different conversation rn."
"Reggie ""Miller"" Jackson  Paul George ""Gervin"""
Reggie Jackson activated Jarvis in this goggles in the fourth. Big Government bailed us out again!
Who the fuck sits their best player in the first half to play zone defense with a wonky big man lineup in 2021? Ty motherfucking Lue that's who. That shit was beautiful to watch  And what the fuck did Marcus Morris eat for breakfast god daaamn. PG and Reggie Jackson having another great night too. I'm never tolerating PG slander ever again
"During the first round of the playoffs, the biggest reputation-riser was Luka. In the second, Booker and Trae. But you have to say that over the scope of this whole amazing playoffs so far, Paul George and Reggie Jackson have deservedly reversed a TON of long-standing preconceptions many of us had about them."
Where the fuck did Reggie Jackson come from
You guys are seriously choking to Playoff P and Reggie Jackson lol
Reggie Jackson put the shoes on from Like Mike and all of a sudden became prime MJ
If he didn’t have Reggie Jackson I’d be worried he might die out there. Dude is hard carrying the Clips this run
Reggie Jackson bailing the clippers out harder than republicans during a economic recession
Reggie Jackson getting paid this summer
"Reggie Jackson really decided he'll secure his bag this off season  And what a game from PG13, I can't believe he's still able to have this kind of game after how much he's played and had to carry on his shoulders. Can't help but wonder how much better they'd be with Kawhi right now"
"The Suns just can't get into an offensive stride to save their lives. Dumbass plays and horrible shot decisions. It's horrifying watching them play such a slow lazy brand of basketball every since Game 3 while the Clippers play like the damn 2018 Warriors with Reggie ""Steph Curry"" Jackson out there"
Reggie Jackson is finally playing as good as Reggie Jackson thinks he is
I’m still more scared of Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson playing like prime LeBron this postseason
Reggie Jackson about to get the bag in the offseason
"Pandemic P showing how its done! Always be wary of a guy with two first names.       **41 points on 15-20 FG, 3-6 3PT, 8-8 FT, 13 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 steals**     Oh and those plays by Reggie Jackson in the 4th quarter sealed it. The Clippers just raced away to a dozen lead after that."
"REGGIE ""MR. JUNE"" JACKSON"
Reggie Jackson saw Paul George going off in the third quarter and then said “my turn” entering the fourth.
Why is Reggie Jackson good now lol
reggie jackson needs to get paid!
"Shout out Reggie Jackson, always got to rep for fellow Colorado players!"
Apparently not when noted rim protector Reggie Jackson is in the area.
because it's 2x Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard  Reggie Jackson will never scare me more than that idgaf
Reggie Jackson borderline outplaying Booker has been very enjoyable to watch.
"I still have the Suns in 7, but respect to PG, Mann, Batum, esp Reggie Jackson and even DMC. You'd have to say if Kawhi was healthy this would be the Clippers first trip to the Finals. I guess that would be too much craziness for one season, even this one."
Reggie Jackson is going to look good playing for LA next season.
New York loves guys named Reggie Jackson
it's time to staart betting reggie jackson finals mvp at +5000
Why do the Suns look so trash tonight? They get momentum get a few stops but can't close the gap. I thought the pushoff P foul was your turnaround.  Then Reggie Jackson happened
Reggie Jackson 3
"I’m sick and tired of these commentators man, we need some Jefferson, Jim Jackson, Hubie and others, not jvg, mark, and Reggie"
OKC would have won a title if they kept Reggie Jackson instead of Westbrook
Nah Kawhi going down allowed PG and Reggie Jackson to start going off. With Kawhi out they looked way worse. Who knows how it would’ve gone
That miracles name is Reggie Jackson
Imagine losing to reggie Jackson and pat bev. I’d be miserable
It turns out Reggie Jackson is a max player lol
PG maybe scoring now. But reggie jackson was the one that was hitting shots when the Clippers needed it most.
KEEP. REGGIE. JACKSON.
"I mean Chris Paul's shoulder was pretty jacked up in the Lakers series, he was fumbling dribbles and basically couldn't shoot 3s at all. Game 2 became super close despite the lack of CP. When they lost AD, the Lakers got thoroughly throttled.    Also, while this Clipper team lacks Kawhi, the roster is pretty talented. PG is a multi-time All NBA guy, Nic Batum is technically supposed to be making 27 mil, Reggie Jackson was on a pretty big contract, Kennard was putting up big numbers on the Pistons last year,  Marcus Morris was averaging 20+ on the Knicks, multiple teams were bidding for Pat Bev 2 years ago, etc.   Suns are good."
Marc Jackson is on Reggie Miller and Chris Weber level of bad.
Devin Booker’s horrific defense. Did nothing to slow down Reggie Jackson lol
Damn Reggie Jackson really be Steph out here
Reggie Jackson is contractually obligated to play for a team with blue and red/orange colors. So who's it gonna be? Philly? Washington? The New England Patriots?
Does no one remember Reggie Jackson cooking the Grizzlies when he was on the Thunder and Wesbrook was hurt and I forget who else? Dropped 40 to win the series and did it most of that series.
Marc Jackson literally the stupidest announcer of all time. Worse than Reggie
Reggie the best member of the Jackson 5
Reggie “mr June” Jackson
MAY REGGIE JACKSON GET AN INJURY!
Why trade for Dame when you can get Reggie Jackson.
"I'm new to basketball, is Reggie Jackson always a God or just tonight?"
Reggie Jackson has been playing like crazy idk how you don’t think next man up isn’t a thing
Who are you and what have you done with Reggie Jackson?
Where were you when Reggie Jackson reincarnated as MJ?
what team is gonna be dumb enough to give reggie jackson a ridiculous bag this summer?
Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schroder wishes he was
Can't wait for reggie Jackson to come down to earth with another team.
REGGIE JACKSON AIN’T NO JOKE!
Reggie Jackson is on a minimum?! Thought it would be a MLE
Reggie Jackson going to get paid
Reggie Jackson just hit three home runs.
Reggie Jackson best PG in west
Apparently Reggie Jackson is the best player in the NBA now when did this happen?
"I've known adventures, seen places you people will never see, I've been Offworld and back… frontiers! I've stood on the back deck of a blinker bound for the Plutition Camps with sweat in my eyes watching stars fight on the shoulder of Orion... I’ve felt wind in my hair, riding test boats off the black galaxies and seen an attack fleet burn like a match and disappear. I've seen it, felt it.  But this Reggie Jackson shit...."
Reggie fucking Jackson. Lowkey equaling Booker this series. Unbelievable.
Reggie Jackson looks and plays like a create-a-player with unlimited attributes in an NBA 2K game sometimes
Reggie “Real Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson” Jackson
Reggie Jackson this playoffs is LIT! Wow
Reggie Jackson is like lowkey one of the most skilled players in the league.
How did Reggie Jackson not make all NBA?
Lol Reggie Jackson is owning the suns
Reggie Jackson earning himself a bag
**CUT THE CHECK!**  – Reggie Fuckin Jackson
Reggie Jackson takeover is underway
"I gained a ton of respect for the Clippers (except Beverly, he’s a fucking bitch whose personality and play style are a literal health risk to other players) They are probably the most tough team mentally and physically and they fought through a lot of adversity. Major props to PG and Reggie Jackson especially"
"Watching the Clippers flame out yet again tops them both. Paul George's +/- was team worst -25. Pat Bev -16. This is a team who got lucky because Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann had a decent game. Otherwise, they shoulda been gentleman swept and on vacay last week."
"Those comebacks, PG switching between playoff and pandemic P each game, Reggie Jackson being clutch, Mann stepping up, Pat Bev being Pat Bev...Clippers were so fun to watch this year despite their injuries."
Man Reggie Jackson is legit.
Off this series I actually lowkey became a Reggie Jackson fan. He played very well and deserves whatever contract he gets.
Jackson on the Knicks wouldn't be a bad fit especially since they've been running the offense through Randle which frees Reggie up to be more an off-ball guard.   But at 120 million... that would be bad and I'd be surprised if any organization came close to offering that to him.
"No problems dude, I got no issues with legit competition, Reggie Jackson crying in the post game broke my heart, that dude has heart"
"Reggie Jackson crying in the post game interview.   I gotta say, kudos to the Clippers for having INCREDIBLE heart. That team was outmatched in talent, but made it close sheerly through heart and willpower. What a team."
Good for Reggie  Reggie Jackson in NY sounds right
S/o Reggie Jackson that wasn't easy and you can tell he is a true competitor good luck next year
Reggie Jackson getting paid after this playoffs.
Never thought a Reggie Jackson interview would make me emotional lmao
Reggie-ual L. Jackson
I hope the Clippers reload with Reggie Jackson and take another shot next year.
Suns fan here.....much respect and love to both PG and Reggie Jackson
"No Reggie ""big Government"" Jackson bailout this time.."
Reggie Jackson without glasses…. Boiii you scary!
Reggie Jackson is a great dude. Damn...
Damn look at this emotion by Reggie Jackson a player who steps up and actually cares about winning. And here we are stuck with Dennis..pain.
Reggie Jackson is a good dude. I'm happy that dude balled and is going to get paid.
Reggie Jackson can wipe those tears away with all the bags of money some team is gonna throw at him! 🤣🤑
Reggie Jackson going to make me cry 🥲
George leveled up in these playoffs as did Jackson - amazing shooting by Reggie. Hats off to both of them. Pat Bev proved he's a used diaper with that cheap shot.
I like Reggie Jackson
I became a Reggie Jackson fan this post season man
"We always call him Reggie ""anything"" Jackson, because more than anyone else you never know if he's goat Reggie, or trash reggie"
"Not gonna clown them this time. Finally made the WCF, and did it with Kawhi and Serge injured. PG had 2 statement games against the Jazz and Suns, Reggie Jackson turned into Dame, and Terrance Mann had a coming out party. Batum, Zubacs, Kennard, and lot of other players had their moments. And Kawhi was having a historic run before his knee was fucked.   Felt like PatBev played really well for his standards, but I'm still going to clown him for being an asshole.  As I was watching this series, it felt like whoever made it out of the West was going to win the Finals. Now it's time to see if that's true."
"why? because the media said so? playoff piss had one supernova game, game 5, and now he 'played his heart out'. if there is a person that would not receive a drop of slander, its reggie jackson"
All I'm gonna say is... Reggie Jackson has become a top 10 fave player of mine. He has been AMAZING this series and the Jazz series.  Hope Clippers reward him with the contract he deserves!
"That's nuts.   Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, and Boogie in spurts played way above their means a lot this series. Reggie Jackson was arguably the Clippers' most consistent player this playoffs."
He has the  third most playoff  games shooting 25% from the field in NBA history. Aside from game 5 he was his inefficient playoff self every game. Even with the pretty stat lines he was shooting terrible. Reggie Jackson was carrying. He’s still in the same boat he was always in. He didn’t improve or decline. He’s just “Playoff P”.
Things I learned during this playoff series.  Ty Lue is easily a top 5 coach.  Reggie Jackson should probably get a max contract.  Terrance Mann should probably get $10M a year.
"He and Reggie Jackson (and maybe even Mann) are possibly the only one who showed up consistently to support Kawhi. They can definitely take and should take pride in what they’ve achieved this season.   That being said, this was a pretty sweet victory for the Suns and I’m super pumped to see them in the finals!!"
"nah clippers played solid all playoffs. PG redeemed himself a smidgen. Reggie jackson earned himself a huge bag. They can use kawhis injury as excuse to say they coulda won it all.  Overall clips had a respectable run, which after last season, they desperately needed."
Reggie jackson
Props to PG (pushoffs aside) and Reggie Jackson for their play in the playoffs. The former definitely improved his reputation whereas the latter is def gonna get paid.   That said let’s go Phoenix!
"A few thoughts on the series:  - The Suns offense looked really stagnant at times, but obviously they pulled through   - Super impressed with the Clippers role players. Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, and even Terrence Mann play really hard and looked great out there  - That CP3 is still doing this at this age is CRAZY"
"Huge respect to Terance Man, Reggie Jackson and Ivica Zubac.  Go get your bags gentlemen."
Remember literally the last 24 hours when someone was claiming that Reggie Jackson is clearly better than Chris Paul now.
"Get fucked Pat Bev. Mad respect for Ty Lue, Paul George, and Reggie Jackson, though, they were all great this series (and these playoffs)."
"Fuck pushoff P, Fuck Marcus ""I can't function without my brother"" Morris and most importantly FUCK PAT BEV. Reggie Jackson is a baller though. Go somewhere else and get paid Reggie"
Fuck pet bev ! I like pg:/ fuck Kawhi! Fuck boogie! Fuck Solomon Hill! Fuck reggie Jackson (for choosing Clippers over us) Fuck skip bayless ! Fuck markeif Morris (for being the ass twin) and s/o to ty lue for his rotations !
Easy when Reggie Jackson isn’t playing the 2nd coming of Michael Jordan
Ballmer needs to do some illegal things to try and retain Reggie Jackson. He's been lights out all post season
Reggie Jackson was the guy who didn't play well tonight that they needed to.
Props to the Clippers for their play without Kawhi. Really enjoyed watching Reggie Jackson ball out
Clippers better get Reggie Jackson his bag in the off-season 😤😤😤
"GG Clippers. Well played, especially without Kawhi. Reggie Jackson is cool as hell. PatBev is a bitch."
Get rid of Beverly and extend Reggie Jackson
"Man I feel bad fo Reggie Jackson, dude balled out all playoffs"
priority #1 for the clippers this off season gotta try and retain reggie jackson.
Reggie Jackson got abused all day by CP3 lol
Fucking dirty ass team. Reggie Jackson is cool I guess.
Reggie Jackson hates money with the defense he’s playing
"As much as I like Reggie Jackson, I dont want to see Patrick Beverly's ass in the finals."
(except my sweet boy Reggie Jackson)
I know the spotlight will be on Paul George but Reggie Jackson couldn’t find his magic today
Nephews after game 5 were really saying Reggie Jackson is better than CP3
Reggie Jackson has been ON FIRE all series and playoffs... but Ayton has made him miss like 4 times this game... for those that have not seen Ayton play. That is Ayton's strength... he can guard shooters at the 3pt line.
#BRUUUUUUH CP3 GOT HIS ANKLES BROKEN THEN BROKE REGGIE JACKSON ANKLES
Yeah kinda didn’t believe Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris were worldbeaters lol
iS reGgIe JaCkSoN iS tHe ThIrD bEsT pLaYeR lEfT iN tHe PlAyOfFs?
"I can give PG a pass, he ain't that guy. BUT. Reggie Jackson is a transcendent superstar, why is he not carrying tonight?  /s"
Putting Reggie Jackson in a tough spot to come back
Season on the line I want NICK BATUM and REGGIE JACKSON taking shots back to back!
George gotta go to the Reggie Jackson school of high layups
For real tho Ayton has affected a whole bunch of clipper 3s. All those Reggie Jackson misses have been trying to shoot over Ayton
Reggie Jackson and PG playing like ass
Reggie “Libertarian Government” Jackson
This is the Reggie Jackson that we’re used to seeing
"reggie jackson hitting everything, I'm thinking they'll go 9-12 with 3s in the fourth."
"Can't wait for Terrance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and Marcus Morris destroy us next quarter"
Reggie Jackson picked a bad time to remember he wasn’t Steph Curry.
Kawhi bothers me way too much and it started AFTER the Raptors won the Finals that year. Paul George is annoying and Reggie Jackson is a baseball player
Clips going to lose this because Reggie Jackson is playing like Reggie Jackson again
You live by the Reggie Jackson you die by the Reggie Jackson.
Fuck ~~Reggie Jackson~~ Pat Beverley
"Of all these players, I bet Reggie Jackson is the best at poppin’ &amp; lockin”"
I think if Ayton helps there you get a wide open Reggie Jackson 3
These playoffs have given me so much respect for Reggie Jackson
this is not the game for reggie jackson to scrub it up
"Reggie Jackson wants 100-120M in FA, but is so inconsistent on both sides of the ball... Ridiculous."
Reggie Jackson is cold right now
Do you guys think Reggie Jackson will communicate that he wants 100-120 million?
Who the hell is letting Marcus Morris be Michael Jordan in the midrange and Reggie Jackson as Steph Curry pleas stop
The fact that Reggie Jackson is outperforming Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday these playoffs makes my blood boil lol
if Reggie Jackson had hit that shot smh lol
If the Suns are playing this good and we're only up by 3 were fucked because as soon as we cool off Reggie Jackson will take over and we're done for
"I’ll ask again, who is maxing Reggie Jackson"
In one post season Reggie Jackson worked himself a bag
Reggie Jackson is who Dennis Schröder wants to be.
Reggie Jackson is literally the best player left in the playoffs
Is Reggie Jackson the best player in these playoffs?
Just got out of Thai prison is Reggie Jackson the goat
Reggie Jackson is one of the best guards in the NBA right now. Crazy.
"Booker continues to be unable to guard literal Reggie Jackson   Devin ""next Kobe"" Booker, as Suns fans call him"
Reggie Jackson is what Austin Rivers thinks he is
Reggie Jackson has been balling out bro.
Reggie Jackson putting up actual all star numbers throughout an entire playoff run is one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen
Reggie Jackson gon get paid
Reggie Jackson did the impossible: made me like the Clippers
"I didn't step into the post game thread, but by god was this a cathartic ass beating.  After going up 9 and then double digits in the 3rd, the refs were gifting the Clippers free throw after free throw -- and that was while the Suns were far behind on the FT and foul disparity. We went up 17 and then Monty failed to call a timeout until the 10-0 run and thank god we have Chris Paul.  I have only respect for Reggie jackson -- and some respect for Paul George (He abused the fact that nobody calls his off arm extension to the extreme this series) -- but I am so happy that we will never again see Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, Demarcus Cousins this season, almost so much that my relief of not playing against them and risking injury is greater than the happiness that the Suns are in the finals for the first time in my life.  Noticing the tides turning after game 5 on this sub and hten immediately flipping as Bev gets ejected was amazing."
"He put Nader in to switch onto Reggie Jackson and Pat bev, just to give them a different look. And Abdel is the only dude on the team that seems to want to drive to the basket. Like Mikal drives too, but he drives to the middle of the paint, not to the rim"
"Reggie Jackson, my love."
"Kawhi left the Raptors partly because he didn't think we were good enough to repeat. Paul George looked really good as a first option, but early in the playoffs when he had to play behind Kawhi, Kawhi had to go God mode to put away the Dallas Lukas. They'll also be losing their third option in Reggie Jackson. There can definitely be merit to him concluding that they wouldn't be good enough.   I don't think he leaves because of the home factor though."
They didn’t have Jeff green but they did have Reggie Jackson in 2012 which is interesting. I’m thinking they win at least one ring but it would’ve been tough competing with golden state.
I thought watching Pujols hit three home runs in the World Series was the closest I’d ever get to seeing Reggie Jackson perform in the postseason live.  I was wrong.
"Jackson routinely hit shots that I was like “why are you taking that, you are Reggie Jacks- oh shit nvm”"
"there's only so many of those teams, though, and he's competing with (i guess) reggie jackson, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie...."
Reggie Jackson deserves a lot of credit for having a 1-off in the playoffs this year.
That’s enough. But This batman/robin shit is cringe as fuck. Why can’t a teammate get credit for their contributions and not have shifty labels. Should we call Reggie Jackson the Cyborg of the clippers? Should Mann be wonderwoman? This shit is just for media clicks.
"As a Thunder fan, any team that has Beverly or Reggie Jackson is an automatic no from me. Both of them on the same team, and I actively cheer against them every game. (I know Reggie has been fine lately, but dude was a pariah on the Thunder)"
Every semi contender in the NBA will have interest in Nic Batum for the minimum and those who can sign him for up to $5-6 mil per year also will inquire about him. He was the 3rd most important player on the team until he just ran out of gas completely in the WCF.  Cousins is just gonna get the vet minimum somewhere. Reggie Jackson will get overpaid but if its Steve Ballmer doing it then it's fine for all parties involved.
"Yeah as a Pistons fan, my knock on him was that he always tried to play hero ball. Reggie Jackson is not good enough to lead a playoff team alone, yet he played like the game was in his hands all the time. He's adjusted really well to the clippers lineup and has really made the most of his role. He always put the work in while on the Pistons and I'm happy to see him doing well and getting recognition from other players and fans. Miss the Shmurda memes in the Pistons sub."
I heard Simmons ask Rusillo who he thinks will get paid more this offseason   Reggie Jackson or Dennis Shroeder.  and I think we all know its going to be Jackson.
Reggie Jackson might have just reinvented himself as a deadeye. Obviously he shouldn’t be a primary option or ball handler (so he would be a SG I guess? Off ball PG?) but he’s absolutely good enough to be on the court for 20-25 minutes per game.   Starter depends on team needs I guess.
So you can go as far over the cap as you like to sign your own players as long as you have their bird rights. Since Reggie Jackson signed a 1 year minimum contract twice in a row they have his “early bird rights” which means there’s a limit to how much they’re allowed to go over the cap to sign him. According to ESPN the maximum they’re allowed to offer him is a contract that starts at $10M per year
"I'm not sure whys he's surprised to be getting criticism  He shot 44%FG/34% 3pt... That's hot garbage 🤮  Dude was clearly struggling to handle the minutes load post Kawhi injury. His efficiency was terrible, at times he was chucking, and his playmaking left a lot to be desired  If anything the real person that stepped up in Kawhis absence was Reggie Jackson"
"Beat LeBron, mvp jokic, Paul George/on fire Reggie Jackson  12-4 in the nba playoffs   Didn't tank to avoid Lakers"
"I believe Bobby Marks tweeted the most the Clips can offer Reggie Jackson is something like 2 years 20mil total, with no option on a third year. Surely, he can get more than that on the open market   https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1409578623263248386?s=21"
"But I think the Clips would have immense difficulties in retaining Reggie Jackson. I mean, some team's gonna give him a 19M/yr or something like that. If they could flip Kennard, yeah, they could."
Not unless Norris Cole makes a comeback ala Reggie Jackson
"Idk i’d argue this, if you’re not following the players closely it’s a nice way of sorta getting up to speed on players relations with each other - i remember watching Reggie Jackson v Westbrook and now being a lot more intrigued whenever id see Jackson play"
He also broke Booker’s fucking nose two games ago. Makes me think that might have been intentional too. Either way this guy has no place on a respectable team. Ballmer should just bounce him from the team himself and extend Reggie Jackson.  Dude has major mental issues.
"I’ve seen this take a lot and 100% disagree. Reggie Jackson came off a Vet Minimum and look how he performed, 10X better than Schroeder.  The Lakers already have THT as a backup plan who they  have to pay anyway and they can easily roll the dice with THT and an additional backup PG in free agency.   I’d be absolutely shocked if gets anywhere near 100M from the Lakers."
Ballmer should bounce him from the team. No respectable team would want a guy like that representing them. Bounce Bev and extend Reggie Jackson.
"Eh, they have a really deep squad. PG, Reggie Jackson, and Marcus Morris aren't slouches."
He’ll probably get around the same kinda contract Reggie Jackson gets which will be 10-12 mil annual
"Pat Bev, Morris, and Cousins ruin the team for me. Mad respect to Reggie Jackson and PG."
Reggie Jackson is probably the only likeable guy on this team. Him and Serge Ibaka
"Reintroducing Microsoft Word’s “Clippy,” as Reggie Jackson in his Clippers jersey"
"Marcus Morris, Boogie Cousins. Reggie Jackson is cool though."
Dennis Schroeder was just getting paid 15.5m from LA this past season. Reggie Jackson is a very similar player so his deal should be in that ball park on a 2-3 year deal. Luke Kennard is currently on a 3 year 41m dollar deal. Lol Reggie WILL be making more than that
Reggie Jackson where??
"I think they're in a very good spot honestly. They'll re-sign Kawhi for the max, so before any other moves they've got almost a full team returning. The early Bird rights on Reggie Jackson should be enough to keep him, and then they still have the MLE, the bi-annual exception, and about 5 million in trade exceptions. Plus a first rounder. They really shouldn't be discouraged at all. A healthy rotation of PatBev, Jackson, PG, Leonard, Mann, Kennard, Morris, Zubac, and Ibaka is really nice before they add anyone. The MLE could easily replace Batum or improve on their backup wing situation."
"As you mentioned, Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum may be gone and if that's the case then they're kind of fucked (more with the Batum thing - I don't think there's another bargain-bin wing available that can replace his production).   I'd love to see Rubio on the team but he's slightly overpaid enough to the point where it's hard for the Clippers to salary match unless the Wolves want Luke Kennard or something (maybe there's a 3-team trade somewhere).  I still kind of think they should go with a budget playmaker. If they can't retain Reggie Jackson, I literally think they should go for a PatBev/Eric Bledsoe swap and sign Elfrid Payton to a vet min. The issue with both of those guys though is that it kills their 5-out spacing when they go small (but hell they might already lose that if Reggie and Batum walk)."

"Nearly everyone on the Clippers earned a good amount of respect with this year's playoff run. Lue big-time, Paul George too, Reggie Jackson for sure. But fuck Pat Bev, he's the only thing the Clippers have to be ashamed of after this playoff run."
Now I know when Reggie Jackson started wearing googles.
We’ve seen this before. Reggie Jackson goes off and some team takes the bait on a big contract in free agency. Then he slides back to reality and many regrets are had.
"No more than 10 million. This is still Reggie jackson. He had a great playoff run, but I don’t trust him to do this consistently."
Reggie Jackson deserves a max contract more than Ben Simmons lmao
"Rondo was ass last year for us in the regular season, but luckily for us Playoff Rondo showed up. We were looking at new guards through buyout because of this and Reggie Jackson was one of those guys. Remember we also tried to get Darren Collison to come out of retirement too. In the end we went to get Dion Waiters who sucked for us sadly."
"he choked though, reggie jackson and morris showed up for him"
"Reggie ""🌈Pride Threes"" Jackson"
"[this article is how he signed with the clippers,](https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-26/reggie-jackson-clippers-revival-nba) basically he was staying at his brother house and began to love basketball again so he called PG"
"Proud of my Clips, especially PG. He’s still a bit inconsistent but we legit wouldn’t have made it this far without him. He really stepped up big when Kawhi went down. Hasn’t really had a break either, but he putting everything out there no matter how tired he is. Hopefully we can go further next year. Pls somehow let us keep Reggie Jackson, dude also balled out   PS: Fuck Pat Bev though. That was a shitty bitch ass move on CP3."
"There should be slander, and they would be worse next season. The thing is they talked way to much previously, they were pampered by the refs and PG13 still cannot make clutch fts, and they still use injuries as excuses. Wait, I forgot Beverley lost control ridiculously, plus their owner's antics are just too much.  Reggie Jackson was their best player, not PG13, Zubac was their key piece and once they lost him they had nothing to do in the playoffs. They are using all the excuses, but hey, you're seeing the total opposite of what I'm seeing, but you're saying that the ones who don't agree with you should not express their opinion, funny."
"Been a Reggie Jackson fan since his days in OKC, really enjoy his game"
"Outside of rebounding the mostly young and inexperienced Suns were significantly better in every category.   AD being injured didn't cause Schroeder to go 0-9 or Lebron to completely throw in the towel on defense. Let's not get started on Drummmond. The other ""championship"" role players went missing in action too.  Must suck to go through a whole season thinking you're a shoe in for a championship only to get slapped with reality. Injuries happened and they suck. Did they effect then outcome? Probably.   But even still; losing AD wasn't the reason the Suns blew the Lakers the fuck out in games 5 and 6.   Reggie Jackson just showed more resilience than the whole Lakers team combined. Reggie fucking Jackson."
"&gt;It's not like they can't just sign someone else to fill that spot. Do you even know how free agency works?   The better question is do *you* know how free agency works, because I don't think you do. Once Reggie Jackson leaves you guys will still be over the cap (unless Kawhi leaves 😂 then maybe you won't), so you won't have any cap space to sign anyone. You'll have the MLE of about $5 million, but you'll probably need that to try to re-sign Batum, unless he gets offers bigger than that, which he might. After that you'll have the vet minimum. Good luck with that 👍"
"I'll bet Reggie Jackson gets more money than Rondo or Kennard got 😂 Now, oh wise Raptors fan, tell me how losing Reggie Jackson isn't gonna matter next year? 🤡"
If you give Reggie Jackson 120 million for one good postseason run you deserve the ruin that that bring you
"I hate how Pat Bev's shit is going to take away from how the rest of the team did. PG playing his heart out without Kawhi, Reggie Jackson being damn near automatic, Terance Mann developing into a legit 2-way player. Shit on PatBev but don't let that distract you from how the rest of the team did. They deserve some respect"
Reggie Jackson was easily the most likable clipper of the series. I’m a suns fan and had fear when that guy was open from 3. He got his buckets and played good ball.
Mad respect to PG and Reggie Jackson on their performances this playoffs.
Lakers fans will now propose to trade Denis Schroder and a 2nd for Reggie Jackson.
"I seriously doubt he'll be back with the Clippers next year. They need to make some roster adjustments, especially with Reggie Jackson most likely gone, and Beverley's $15 million expiring contract paired with their 1st round pick or their 2028 pick is probably about all they have to offer anyone, cause I doubt they'd move Mann or Zubac."
I think Jazz fans have nightmares from Reggie Jackson more than anyone else on the Clippers (maybe Mann for that one game)
"Are you talking about Kawhi or Reggie Jackson? Cause early Bird rights don't mean anything for Kawhi, but for Jackson it means the Clippers can't offer more than $10 million per year, and he's sure to be offered much more than that."
"Reggie Jackson took years off my life when he got the ball, dude was such a competitor and the type of guy you respect to core"
"Little late to the thread but I wanna say props to PG, Reggie Jackson and Ty Lye for keeping up the good fight against the Suns. Both teams made this a phenomenal series!"
"Dude there absolutely cannot be PG slander. The man played more minutes than anyone else in the playoffs by *several games worth* and that’s a fact. Poor dude was gassed worse than a Hummer on empty. He had some questionable actions but nothing that came close to Pat Bev or Cousins.  You guys fought us with a hard, worrisome intensity and that Reggie Jackson postgame broke my heart. If you come back full strength I’m absolutely terrified to face you in the finals again. It fucking sucks but we’ve been in a playoff drought for ten years so I get it, trust me.  I’m sorry this is how it had to end but you guys gave it 100% and there’s nothing to be ashamed of. You have all the respect in the world."
Cam Payne and Reggie Jackson.
You’ll take your Reggie Jackson and you’ll like it
"PG played so well I bought some PG5’s. I really respect Reggie Jackson too. Dude balled out this series. He gained more points with me with the post game interview sincerely thanking his teammates for saving him. Too bad we didn’t get a chance to see Kawhi, I saw him play live once for San Diego State and have loved his game ever since."
"Broke Book’s nose too. I know it was accidental, but he had a ton of cheap shots this series. This last one was just the cherry on top.m  And he better be remembered for this. That was straight up embarrassing. Imagine being PG or Reggie Jackson, going 120% every game to keep your team in the game, and that asshat decides to do shit like that. I’d be so fucking mad."
You don't think losing Reggie Jackson would be a huge blow to the Clippers next year? They can replace his minutes with Kennard or Rondo 😂
"Is inefficient scoring, turnovers and disappearing for key stretches included in everything?  Reggie Jackson was keeping them in it, but had a bad shooting night game so Clippers are done. Morrison and Cousins had the best game 6’s (in my opinion)"
"&gt; The Clippers were the best team in the post season without injuries  How do you figure that? They were down 0-2 in each of the first two rounds before Kawhi got hurt. You feel like they were just killing teams until Kawhi went down? It didn't look like that to me. You're saying if *every* team was fully healthy then the Clippers would have been the clear favorites? Cause that's what this is about: will Kawhi look at the Clippers and think they're gonna win next year if he comes back. Ibaka just had back surgery and might miss all of next year, Reggie Jackson is almost surely gone in free agency, and Batum might go as well. Do you think it's a guarantee Kawhi looks at what's left and sees a title favorite? He might, but that's not for sure.   And I'm not trying to ""prove he's gone"", I'm just raising the very real possibility that he could weigh his options. If there's a better situation out there for him, you don't think he explores it? My guess is he's probably coming back, but the dude is a complete mystery. He absolutely might leave. Who knows what goes on in his head. He's absolutely a different dude."
"Respect to PG man, him and Jackson played their hearts out these playoffs, They two players I was down on completely into the season, but I’ve done a complete 180 on them.   Im hoping we could get Reggie Jackson to come back."
"I say this as a huge Clippers &amp; Paul George hater, what a run this postseason. A complete mental turnaround from last year, which I would bet anything against happening after seeing that meltdown. (Kind of ironic it was my Jazz who had a similar meltdown) Ty Lue went from ‘confused with rotations’ in the first round to a genius just like that, and Reggie Jackson is now a max player!  That being said, Paul George can win 6 straight FMVPs and he will forever be Pandemic P for me, and Pat Bev is a BITCH."
I HAD FORGOTTEN reggie jackson before this post season he showed up hard then a mf   &amp;#x200B;  RESPECT
"I would because fuck the clippers…. But nah. Fully healthy the clips were the best team in the playoffs. The lakers at full strength might have taken it to 7, but damn reggie jackson and even marcus morris were beasts. Dont know if the lakers had a bench dude that could go off like that."
I got a lot of respect for PG Ty Lue and Reggie Jackson. Pat Bev can kick rocks though
"what does reggie jackson mean to you? plus its a team game, to say Paul George is the only reason is pretty ignorant lol"
Xbox Series consoles NBA 2K22 bundle: The Reggie Jackson Edition
"PG, Lue, and Reggie Jackson all massively helped their public perceptions with this run.  Fuck Patrick Beverly."
"super happy for him after how everyone felt about him in Detroit. that said, prepare for the off-season posts: ""did the thunder make a mistake picking Westbrook over Reggie Jackson?"""
"Not before he goes all in, trades for Lebron, Dame, Ben Simmons and then by default KD will beg to join as well.   Super ultra mega squad-   Dame   PG  Kawhi  Lebron  KD  With Reggie Jackson, Ben Simmons coming off the bench.   How could anyone possibly beat them, and how could guys like Lebron and KD resist lol"
"I know, I’m just being annoying lol.   Long live Reggie Jackson"
"I fuck with Reggie Jackson now, dude showed the fuck up this year. Fuck Pat Bev and Boogie though, those dudes are bitter as fuck, pretty much the only reason I didn't want to see the Clippers win"
Ballmer won't have to do illegal anything to overpay Reggie Jackson after he trades Pat Bev and releases Playoff DNP Rondo.
"Reggie ""imma get my money"" Jackson  says thank you clippers for having no other point guards and letting me make more millions"
"Reggie Jackson, Cameron payne, and Austin rivers are about to get paid"
Prove me wrong...cp3 was a net negative on the court his first 3 games back. Book became woefully ineffcient after beverly headbutts him. Do clipper player like morris and reggie jackson go off as much as they did with kawhi even on the floor. Does paul george? Keep operating with these whats if tho..really doesnt matter.
The PG and Reggie Jackson bromance is lowkey one of the best ones in the league
He made Reggie Jackson cry lmao
Reggie Jackson also hired as Senior Product tester for Xbox. Starting salary 18 million a year.
"He might not have confidence that they'll ever have a real shot of winning, especially if Reggie Jackson leaves. He might be able to work his way to Miami to play with Butler and Bam, or maybe he orchestrates something to the Knicks along with some other star the way he did getting PG to the Clippers. He's got a month to figure out what he wants. I'd say the Clippers are the favorites to re-sign him, but you can't ever predict what Kawhi actually wants. The dude is a total mystery."
"Gg bro. Glad you guys finally got to watch your team in the conference finals. Thanks for being chill and understanding why Pat Bev is so disliked. Unfortunate that you guys had the injuries, you guys would have more than likely beat us if both teams were 100%.   Your team is so damn scrappy and Ty Lue is a great coach, impossible to have anything but respect for him. And Reggie Jackson as well. I was moved by his tears. He's a real one. You guys need to find a way to keep him."
"No reason for any Clips slander at all besides Bev.   Reggie Jackson top shooter in the playoffs since Kawhi went down, PG being an absolute warrior, and the rest of the team playing hard and disciplined. Lue with great adjustments too. I honestly was so impressed, especially given the minutes they've played."
"Reggie Jackson is amazing. Nothing but respect for that man, left it all out there.  Patrick Beverly is a clown. The definition of dish it but can’t take it.   Great series Clips. 🤝"
I gained so much respect for Reggie Jackson this series anytime the Suns were trying to pull away or make a comeback Reggie was the one to hit the big timely shots. Dude has worked his ass off and deserves his flowers and coins this off-season
Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann are fine in my book. Rest of the team can be left off the bus though
"&gt; We would of won the whole thing if we were healthy easily.   If everyone else was also healthy? I doubt it. I think you guys would probably have lost to the Nuggets, Lakers or Nets if everyone was at full health. And the reason it'll be tough to run it back is because the most you guys can offer Reggie Jackson is $10 million per year, and he's almost sure to get much more than that. Batum as well might leave cause you guys can only offer him $5 million. You never know what Kawhi might want to do. We'll have to wait and see."
Westbrook is just thankful Reggie Jackson didn't get a ring.
"Yeah watching Reggie Jackson and PG13 going nuts was annoying simply because I was rooting for the Suns. But I like them and I’m glad George redeemed himself after the “Playoff P” memes from the bubble. Unfortunately Bev, Cousins, and Morris Sr make me so unbelievably angry that it dang near overshadows the good qualities of that team"
Clippers deserve respect and reggie jackson needs to get paid
Bro I do not have enough good things to say about Reggie Jackson. he played his heart out and balled out like a mf
"Let's fucking goooooo!  We're a Reggie Jackson signing away from being a top 5 seed with a semifinals exit as our ceiling, which I'm content with in a Kawhi-less season."
Reggie Jackson is available
They had his early Bird rights which meant they could offer him a contract starting at that of the league average (a little more than $10 million per year) just so long as it was a multi year deal. It's the same thing Clipper fans are hoping happens with Reggie Jackson.
Thought this was about to say Reggie Jackson
Still reeling from the fact SVG gave Reggie Jackson 80mill.
"It’s because of the rights. They might be giving him early bird because of his time in the bubble. He can take the 2y deal at 10.5m each, TPMLE, or a minimum. All from the Suns.  That is the same $ Clips can give Reggie Jackson with early bird rights."
Reggie Jackson would be amazing...but he ain't up for grabs lol
Reggie Jackson it is.
Reggie Jackson
Agreed. Is Schroder really going to get twice what Reggie Jackson is?
"Where are Spencer Dinwiddie and Reggie Jackson going? Also, doesn't it seem crazy that Schroder could get $20 million when Cameron Payne is apparently only getting $6 million? I'm really amazed that anyone thinks this highly of Schroder."
But is Schroder the best option for the Knicks? Reggie Jackson would probably be a smarter and cheaper signing.
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
I think you sign Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson will get 3 years 60 mil
There’s been this misconception that we have cap space when we don’t. We have the full $9.5m MLE for FA’s and some sign and trade options. Reggie Jackson would be a major win.
Reggie Jackson and Kelly Olynyk inbound.
KP cannot post up Reggie Jackson successfully or dribble a basketball. He ain’t a star
"Lowry would be nice but he’s a short term fix.  If you are going short term trying to swing Dragic so,show doesn’t hurt.  Derozan is superfluous with Luka.  Luka has the ball in his hands a majority of the time he’s on the court anyway so an off ball shooter and secondary playmaker is more useful anyway.  Honestly Dragic or Reggie Jackson fulfills a similar purpose.  They do need another wing though. Danny Green can’t dribble but he shoots and defends."
I wouldn't mind Reggie Jackson running this team for 3 months before Murray returns
We will take one Reggie Jackson to bring him home.  Please and thanks.
"paying Reggie Jackson a lot of money on a long term deal, you guys have fun with that"
“Reggie Jackson getting the bag from New Orleans is the dankest timeline.” - Reggie Jackson
"Yeah and the Clippers got better too... they added Batum and got a full season out of Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris, not to mention changing coaches, which was the biggest change of all."
"Russ is a playmaker and throughout 2019-2020 they desperately needed one and if not for the highly unexpected breakout of Reggie Jackson, they would have needed one this year too. If Jackson leaves or regresses to his norm next year they'll once again need a playmaker.  So yes, even a regressed Westbrook is a better fit than George. Even beyond that, Westbrook is an actual lockerroom leader too, which the team needed last year."
"No Kawhi, PG will probably miss 15+ games, possibly no Nic Batum or Reggie Jackson. Yeah yall might not make the playoffs"
Cp3 resigns   Simmons gets traded   One of (Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne Lonzo ball Schroeder) Get a BAG and are considered massively overpaid
Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I’d want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) — if not all — of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
"Dwade on a vet minimum? That was an absolute steal and he was playing fairly well if i recall. He wasn’t efficient but he was a solid six man and had a 3.06 net rtg with Lebron off the court and a 3.43 net rtg with Lebron   Averaged 11.2 ppg, 3.9 Rpg, 3.5 Assists on 45% from the field.   Sure, Lebron and Dwade definitely talked in the same way PG13 and Reggie Jackson talked. But those are solid deals regardless"
Eyeglasses Reggie Jackson
"The hard cap is $143 million, so let's say the Clippers trade for DeRozan, here's what that would look like (I'm using Morris and Beverley for DeRozan in this example):  * Paul George - $39 million  * Kawhi - $39 million  * DeRozan - $24 million (the minimum amount he could be signed for to make this trade work)  * Kennard - $13 million  * Ibaka - $10 million  * Rondo - $8 million  * Zubac - $7.5 million  * Keon Johnson - $2.5 million  * Mann - $2 million  * Oturu - $2 million  * **Total - $147 million**  So even if they trade Morris and Beverley for DeRozan and don't re-sign Batum or Reggie Jackson, they'd still be over the hard cap. They'd probably have to straight up salary dump Rondo somewhere also. So do the Clippers really want to exchange 5 rotation players for DeRozan? I doubt it."
"Assuming they can't afford Reggie Jackson, it could be quite a close-run thing:   Beverley, Mann, George, Morris, Zubac.  Rondo, Kennard, Johnson, Boston, Ibaka.   Really, really lacking bigs. I guess the plan is for Zubac, Ibaka and Morris to fill the centre minutes and to go small with the other 4 on the court?"
"&gt;	Why ignore him making a OKC contender?   When they were contenders Westbrook consistently outplayed Durant (in fact: their best team in history took a 73 win team to the brink of elimination with WB pulling all time box score creation with Durant shooting below league average efficiency and averaging a turnover per assist) so not sure how much weight this argument holds.   &gt;	Did you forget his mvp season?  Which is an all time season but he **almost** lost to the grizzlies while being bailed out by Reggie fucking jackson shooting the lights out because Durant became a turnover machine. **in the first round**  &gt;	60 wins, top 5 offense, with Perkins/Reggie Jackson/Martins getting heavy minutes. No wing depth  Again, Durant’s offense cratered the moment he became the primary ball handler and primary focus of the defense."
"I’m assuming Lowry to Miami and Lonzo to Chicago are pretty much done deals so eliminating them.   He hasn’t been talked about much compared to the other FA point guards but i’d LOVE if the knicks signed Reggie Jackson. He’d be cheaper than guys like lonzo and lowry and he can play really well off-ball which is perfect bc RJ and Randle will be playmaking a lot too.   Another guy id love is Gary Trent Jr, i feel i’ve been higher on him than consensus opinion. Solid defender and complete sniper that can also create his own shot a bit"
"One Reggie Jackson, please."
Nah it’s Tyson Fury and Reggie Jackson
&gt;deep down I feel that  Just come out and say it. I think most people here agree: a healthy clippers with Reggie jackson playin go like that slaughters every non-Brooklyn team
Ok that’s because the Clippers had great depth to go along with PG. If they lose Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum it’s not going to be an easy recovery.  Also despite all of your talk of us being a bottom team for the first time in 11 years you guys have had 50 years to only reach the conference final. Your team the definition of a poverty franchise.  Even without free agents wanting to sign here our franchise has been much more successful than y’all which is quite sad
"5 role players for DeRozan is a pretty gross mischaracterization of the total of the situation.  (1) Batum is retainable no one is giving him more than a minimum.   (2) Rondo was in the rotation for the Dallas series exclusively. He was a trade deadline move that ultimately didn't work in Lue's offensive scheme. The likelihood he gets bought out or salary dumped before the new league year isn't 0 anyways.  (3) Thinking about the Spurs why do they take Beverley back and why does DeRozan agree to a S&amp;T giving money back if the team receiving him is gutted of good playoff role players? Bev's an older expiring and the only way he goes to SA is if he's being immediately rerouted to another contender with draft capital (spoiler: there aren't many of those, and they probably don't want Bev anyways). I doubt a team with 5 guards and no size wants to acquire another undersized guard. The S&amp;T would probably be any 2 of Morris, Kennard or Mann for DeRozan to sign him ~18-20 million.   (4) If we're bringing in DeRozan it's because we've decided he should replace Reggie as a ballhandler and are okay with that loss.  Worse case scenario the actual losses of this move would be Morris, Mann, and Reggie. Best case we keep Mann and get DeRozan to sign at a net of less money than the Morris+Kennard contracts so we still have our TPMLE. Now tell me how much sleep you lose at night if all you give up for an efficient 20 ppg scorer and distributor is Marcus Morris, Luke Kennard, and Reggie Jackson. Reggie and Morris are good pieces but if you get an all star caliber scorer back you take that."
It’s up to if Reggie Jackson wants to stay or not.
"&gt;You just named off Morris, Beverley, Kennard, Ibaka and Rondo…..you really think one of those players can’t be traded to clear cap room to sign someone like Demar?  How many rotation players are the Clippers willing to lose just to get DeRozan though? If they traded for him then the hard cap would prevent them from bringing back Batum and Reggie Jackson, in addition to the probably two players they'd have to trade for DeRozan, and they might have to salary dump another player elsewhere on top of that.   The hard cap is $143 million, so let's say the Clippers trade for DeRozan, here's what that would look like (I'm using Morris and Beverley for DeRozan in this example):  * Paul George - $39 million  * Kawhi - $39 million  * DeRozan - $24 million  * Kennard - $13 million  * Ibaka - $10 million  * Rondo - $8 million  * Zubac - $7.5 million  * Keon Johnson - $2.5 million  * Mann - $2 million  * Oturu - $2 million  * **Total - $147 million**  So even if they trade Morris and Beverley for DeRozan and don't re-sign Batum or Reggie Jackson, they'd still be over the hard cap. They'd probably have to straight up salary dump Rondo somewhere also. So do the Clippers really want to exchange 5 rotation players for DeRozan? I doubt it."
"I want a full super cut of every time Reggie Jackson was in a one on one situation from these playoffs. I really felt like he always mot only beat his man, but low key styled on them."
"As I stated above, the problem for the Clippers is the hard cap, not matching salaries. They could do those trades you mentioned, but then they'd be hard capped at $143 million so they'd have to immediately start losing a bunch of other salary. They could start by just not re-signing Batum or Reggie Jackson, but is DeRozan worth them giving up 4 rotation players? And they probably would need to keep going and might have to just salary dump one or two more just to fit under the hard cap."
"What are you even trying to say?  Why ignore him making a OKC contender? Did you forget his mvp season?  60 wins, top 5 offense, with Perkins/Reggie Jackson/Martins getting heavy minutes. No wing depth"
lakers yeah no problem. We will just keep letting the bums shoot open bricks like we did last year. healthy Clippers last year it goes either way. But with no reggie Jackson next year and kawhi coming off injury going into the playoffs suns will beat that ass for sure if they match up.
"Realistically the Clippers can't try a sign and trade with anyone. The hard cap would be almost impossible for them to navigate this year if they did any S&amp;Ts. For it to work the Clippers would have to start dumping salaries elsewhere (and they only have their 2028 1st to offer), and would have to give up on the idea of bringing back Reggie Jackson or Batum. The Clippers salary this year may end up even higher than the Lakers will x so a sign and trade is probably off the table for both LA teams."
"I'm puzzled Turner says that DeRozan is putting the brakes on going to the Lakers cause he doesn't want to take that big of a pay cut, but then in the same article says DeRozan is thinking about going to the Clippers when they can't offer him any more money than the Lakers can.   And look, I know people are gonna be like ""the Clippers can just sign and trade for him"" but no, they really can't. So before you go thinking the Clippers are any better equipped to stay under the hard cap than the Lakers are, [you should really have a look at how huge the Clippers payroll is going to be this year.](https://i.imgur.com/xukgBa5.png) Allow me to do the math on that: that's $134 million just for those 8 players. The hard cap is going to be $143 million.   Now I want you to also consider that this $134 million total doesn't include a few things. For one, it sure seems likely that Kawhi will not opt in for that final year, which means he'll probably opt out and sign a 1+1 for an extra $3 million (exactly the same amount as Paul George this year). This total also does not include the combined $6 million for Terrance Mann, Daniel Oturu, and their new 1st round pick, Keon Johnson. And finally it does not include the salaries of either Nic Batum or Reggie Jackson.   The Clippers total salary this year figures to probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of $160+ million, which is very far above the $143 million hard cap. So no, I don't think DeRozan is likely to join the Clippers, for the same reason he's unlikely to join the Lakers: $5.9 million is probably too little for him."
"No, Lowry is most likely going to the Heat though, he's the godfather Jimmy's son I'm pretty sure. I like Derozan Mavs as well, but honestly I'm actually hoping we get Reggie Jackson, he's shown he is a playoff performer."
Clippers ain’t shit they’re cap is fucked and they are doing all they can to bring back Reggie Jackson
"The Clippers almost surely can't sign and trade for him or offer him the full MLE because they're going to be over the hard cap anyway. The hard cap is going to be $143 million, and just with the guys the Clippers right now have under contract (which includes Kawhi, on the assumption he's staying, but doesn't include Reggie Jackson or Nic Batum or their 2nd round picks) they are at $151 million. They would have to start salary dumping like crazy to get down to where they could offer DeRozan even just a $15 million contract.   So if they can't trade for him and can't offer him the full MLE, then they can only offer him the $5.9 million MLE, same as the Lakers (and doing so would mean they couldn't then offer it to Batum). I don't know why DeRozan would choose the Clippers over the Lakers this season when Kawhi and Ibaka are probably going to miss all of it. If he wanted to ring chase, the Lakers are the much better option."
"Guys picked in the 20s and 2nd round only suddenly become valuable trade chips if they prove they are good players on the NBA stage, and those guys haven't done that yet. So until then their value is exactly what was reflected in the draft. Nobody suddenly will attach extra value to them because the Clippers chose them.   The Clippers could try to put together a sign and trade package for DeRozan (probably sending out Beverley and maybe a pick), but that would hard cap the Clippers. With Ibaka opting in and Kawhi looking to sign a new max deal, it will be very tough for the Clippers to stay below $143 million this year, which is where the hard cap will be. Just as an example, the combined salaries of PG, Kawhi, Morris, Kennard, Ibaka, Rondo Zubac, Mann and Johnson are $137 million. That's without Beverley (who presumably would be traded for DeRozan), Reggie Jackson, and Nic Batum.   The Clippers are not getting DeRozan, sorry."
They can only offer Reggie Jackson $10 million and can only offer Batum $5.9 million. They very well might end up losing both to free agency.
"Will he? Those aren't the only point guards who will be available. Is Schroder considered next up over guys like Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne and Spencer Dinwiddie? I think the market may be very thin for Schroder. But if teams are really targeting him, doesn't that make a sign and trade more likely? I'm not sure which teams want to blow a bunch of cap space on Schroder."
cant wait to see the video from training camp of the clips making him read out loud the article he wrote about reggie jackson in front of everyone
"With Jordan retired, there was a void at the guard position that season   The only guard who scored more than him was Mitch Richmond and his Kings didn’t make the playoffs   Among guards who scored less:  Dumars and Harper who were on bad teams. (20-win Pistons, 27-Win Clippers)  Reggie Miller had a shot but also averaged less rebounds, assists and steals with a worse team record   After that you had guys who weren’t All-NBA material: Jim Jackson, Kenny Anderson, etc.   It was a weak selection but certainly not worst of all time"
Reggie Jackson
"Steven adams used to backup perkins nough said. But Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Montreze Harrell, looney and bell on the warriors lol I just wanted to say random ones"
I dislike Reggie Jackson so fucking much
Reggie Jackson out there looking like A-Train
Reggie Jackson looks like he’s dressed as Falcon for Halloween lmao
Reminder that Reggie Jackson looks like the horny bartender from Letterkenny
Replacing Reggie jackson with Pat bev was the best thing ty lue did.
Reggie Jackson stays trying to make the Thunder worse
"come on boban, you can back down reggie Jackson"
"""There's clearly contact""  Nice Mark Jackson impression by Reggie."
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"Ibaka, Steven Adams, Reggie Jackson, dion waiters is a better supporting cast than most teams with 2 MVP caliber players have. It’s not like they were playing with a bunch of bums"
"By the way, that roster had some pretty good role players on it. Serge ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Derrick fisher, perkins... that's plenty to win with."
He's a discount Reggie Jackson who is himself a knock off kyrie Irving
Reggie Jackson was like “who?”  Who else Reggie?!! He’s staring right at you and talking to you 😂
"They are quintessential regular season players, both of them are too bad defensively to get many minutes. Clippers are much better with Reggie Jackson and Ibaka (if he was healthy)."
Is Schroeder a knock off Reggie Jackson who is himself a discount Kyrie Irving?
I would say Marcus Morris but sometimes Reggie Jackson
"Utah will take advantage of the half-step slow and half-foot short Clippers defense. I expect Gobert to have a big series with seemingly no Ibaka playing. The Jazz defense is also better equipped to defend the Clippers than you may think. So long as the Clippers are willing to take the mid range, the Jazz are fine. You can't beat the Jazz in a playoff series if you let them win the math game because of how often they shoot threes, how good they are at making threes, and how good they are at generating open threes.  Quite frankly, the biggest weakness this Jazz team has is that they don't have a perimeter defender that can match up with quicker guards like Murray and Morant. Unless if Reggie Jackson experiences a career revival, I think the Jazz will be fine."
"Forgetting about Reggie ""Action"" Jackson"
I would definitely feel stupid and embarrassed if I supported my team paying Kristaps Porzingis $30M per year to be the softest bitch in the league who gets bodied up by Patrick Beverly and Reggie Jackson...  Except that’s you and not me. Lmaooooo. You fucking idiots actually thought you fleeced us for some generational superstar when that trade went down and talked endless shit for months. Let that sink in you fucking moron😂. I love this shit.
"doesn't matter what you or I think, his actions show us he doesn't want to see kawhi. He calls for a screen every time he sees kawhi is on him. His ppg mainly from hunting pat bev, reggie jackson and zubac doesn't impress me especially when those 2 are off the court. Meanwhile Kawhi on the other end torching any and everybody on his team and 6'8 little luka won't even step up to guard him"
"It’s gotta be Reggie Jackson right?  12.6 and 4.2 for career, best year 17.6 and 9.2."
Easily.  The Clippers role players are overrated imo. The drop off after Leonard and PG is huge. Who’s their 3rd best player? Reggie Jackson? Lol 🤷🏻‍♂️  Both the Jazz and Suns are way deeper
"The fact that PG/Morris/Reggie Jackson are shooting under 35% from 3, and Beverly has been unplayable, is definitely a concern.    Their offense wasn't even that great last night despite Kawhi carrying, if Dallas made their wide open 3s at their regular season rate it would have been competitive until the end.    If Luka is hurt, they can win with Kawhi/PG carrying. But they can't beat Utah if their shooting is so mediocre, because Gobert will shut off all the offense at the rim."
Honestly the clippers last year were so much better in the first round against the mavs when Reggie Jackson was playing instead of Bev then the next round Doc benched him and they got zero production from Bev again. That one change was the difference to me last year so I’m glad someone had the balls to finally ice Bev hopefully forever
"Kawhi, PG, Reggie Jackson, Zubac, Mann"
"Lue adjusts lineups more aggressively than almost any coach in the league. He spends all year getting guys ready to be benched. Few teams are able to bench multiple starters for playoff series without having guys get upset. Lue has done it for years with regularity. I remember Bill Simmons criticized the clippers for not “having an identity.” I’m like... yeah... but that’s because he creates versatile rosters that hunt mismatches. Imo Dallas is one of the worst matchups in the league personnel wise, but Lue was able to get some guys who could matchup. I doubt few people would think Reggie Jackson and Mann would be the key roster adjustments, but they honestly were."
Leave Reggie Jackson in Dallas pls
"Ah, The Reggie Jackson Game. Yeah, I can imagine that one stuck pretty hard with Grizz fans. So many good playoff games between our teams. Really miss that era."
How much help did Reggie Jackson really need??? Come on refs....
"Shout out to Reggie Jackson too. 14 points in the first quarter and finished with 25 points after clutch free throws. Added 9 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 steal too to finish +13 and highest on the team. It felt like he was the catalyst for all of their success early."
"Oh I agree that he's in the wrong like 90% of the time. But tonight specifically, he definitely got mauled a few times under circumstances that would almost alway lead to a foul call. It wasn't just one direction the whole night though, I mean the foul on Reggie Jackson was nonsense out of nowhere. The refs were just plain bad in my opinion. And tonight that wound up significantly favoring the Clippers overall"
"Oh, some good cuts! Then it's ok, 30 mln for some good ass cuts at 7/4/3. Was he asked to get less rebounds than Reggie Jackson too?  Dude, he earns same as Kawhi. Imagine what you would say if Kawhi had same game."
It also took a career playoff performance by THJ while the clippers supporting cast minus reggie jackson built a whole city from the missed open 3s. I think they were 0-10 from 3?
I was rooting for the Mavs but that 5th foul on Reggie Jackson should not have been called.
You mean it's a bad idea to let Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson switch onto a 6'7 superstar with forty pounds on them without even remotely attempting to avoid it!?
That’s cause Mavs fans whine a lot too lol.  I especially love when a bogus call goes their way like the Reggie Jackson illegal screen and there isn’t a single Mavs flair for a good minute or so.
Reggie Jackson is better then the mavs second best player shut up.  Luka is carrying this roster of garbage
Trade the entire farm outside ad and lebron for reggie jackson?
Luka only doing good because he's going up against Zu and Reggie Jackson lol. Whatever team he is on he would have to matchup hunt .Put a good defender on him and he struggles. Look at his stats on who he is scoring against
Lebron didn’t have Reggie “Goggles” Jackson on his team
Clips sucked outside of Kawhi and one quarter of Reggie Jackson today and won
"Right that’s what I was thinking like get the ball out of this mans hands like a 4v3 at that point would be ok against Reggie Jackson, Batum and the others   Kawhi was just not missing even the step back where Luka got a hand in his face - nothing but net"
Kawhi is having to put up some all-time performances just to get out of the first round. Did you watch the game tn? Him and Reggie Jackson were the only guys who showed up.
Reggie Jackson got tired too after all the carrying he did 😭
Big Gov Reggie Jackson ain't your average roll player
Tough shit. Game went to shit without him. We need him out there.   Go out swinging or who gives af and just forfeit. Tonight was brutal. Esp with Reggie Jackson being cocky af.   The thunderdom is run in off to Mavs.
"reggie jackson is 6'2"" and got 9 rebounds tonight. zubac played 5 minutes and got 6 rebounds tonight. kristaps porzingis is 7'3"", played 31 minutes and collected a grand total of 5 rebounds."
"Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Paul George, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Reggie Jackson."
"of course. Last year, Zubac played every game and Pat beverly, and bench had two or three shit defenders in Lou Will, Harrell, and Shamet, and reggie Jackson.  Bench was all offense.  This year, small ball, all wing defenders in Kawhi, george, Batum, Morris, and Reggie not good D but balling out in playoffs. Bench has Rondo, Zubac, Mann, and lately, Kennard.  More defenders this time"
reggie jackson scored 25 in **this** game so who the fuck knows what'll happen on sunday lmao
You expect Kawhi and PG to play but Reggie Jackson been so damn good. Mavs guard him better or it's gonna be a tragic exit.
"Big game from Kawhi, Reggie Jackson, and PG! They played hard and Kawhi just willed his team to this win. Peak playoff bball. Can’t wait to see what Sunday brings!"
Looking back at this game i hope reggie jackson gets his recognition. He set the tone early on that the clippers are locked in
Whatcha mean he has Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson just casually walking with a defender on his body lmao.  Not sure why Carlisle wasnt getting the ball out of Kawhi’s hands.
Doc Rivers would play Pat Bev instead of Reggie Jackson
"Reggie ""fucking"" Jackson"
Maybe lebron can put on the same glasses as Reggie Jackson and play in the game.. that way lebron can keep lue’s and his own record as well
"This literally has nothing to do with the Celtics, or Tatum. Luka is better than Tatum.  When the game was over, before Luka started stat padding, Reggie Jackson outplayed him"
"Much as I hated the refs tonight  We lost to Reggie Jackson tonight after all  Kawhi was gonna be amazing, PG's been good all series  That kind of blowup in the first quarter by Reggie kept them attached and allowed them to just keep plugging along  And now we're stuck with fucking Game 7  Gg tho"
Guy making the minimum : Reggie Jackson saved the clippers season.
Is Reggie Jackson the 2021 version of Serge in then?
"Yeah watching him do nothing while Luka gets doubled, get beat on the boards by Reggie Jackson at second chance rebounds, and brick the rare shot he actually tries... very frustrating"
I don't know how the Clippers gonna keep reggie jackson and batum but they gotta this off season
When did Reggie Jackson become Horace Grant?? Foh
"Kawhi deservedly is going to get the bulk of the credit for carrying this series, but shout out to Reggie Jackson, man. He has been fantastic and his insertion into the starting lineup changed the series."
When did Reggie Jackson become Horace Grant?? Foh
When did Reggie Jackson become Horace Grant?? Foh
Reggie Jackson is good give him chance.
Reggie Jackson had a better first round series than Russ this year lmao
And Reggie Jackson
Give Reggie Jackson some respect
"the clippers had 4 bench points and won, if anyone besides kawhi and reggie jackson show up it’s a blowout"
haha Reggie Jackson trying to throw the game away
Reggie Jackson outplayed Luka doncic in an elimination game LOL
Lmao Reggie Jackson did the head fling naturally before the intentional foul even came in lol. This shit is becoming a natural motion to all players other than rookies lol
How else is ty lue supposed to scream at Reggie Jackson bum ass
did you not see the offensive foul they called on reggie jackson?
"if you have reggie Jackson on luka, why would you screen"
They just got an offensive foul on reggie jackson wtf? lol
What is Reggie Jackson doing
Reggie Jackson lmao
Reggie Jackson really doesn't wanna play another game
Reggie Jackson reminds me of 2019 FVV tonight
Reggie Jackson is one dumb mf
Luka was fucking thrilled to get Reggie Jackson on him there
Reggie Jackson lookin like xray from Holes
Reggie Jackson had 14 in the first quarter lol
Obviously the dynamite point guard duo of Patrick Beverly and Reggie Jackson.
Fucking Reggie Jackson is all I have to say.
4 out of 84 points so far for the clippers have been from the bench  and this is a team that *STARTS* reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson looks weird with the goggles.
Why are people upset about the Reggie Jackson call. Even if it was a soft offensive foul call he stepped out of bounds anyway
Reggie Jackson isos will be the death of the Clippers
Lol fuck Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson is not similar in size to Morris or kawhi
Why exactly is Reggie Jackson allowed to scream in the refs face like that and not get a tech?
Reggie Jackson really committed an offensive foul and then stepped out of bounds anyway lmao
Reggie Jackson disagrees.
"Beyond Kawhi and an extremely inconsistent PG, Clippers just aren't that good.  Reggie Jackson is basically their second best player right now, and they're giving the corpse of Batum way too many minutes."
Ty Lue wild disrespect of the Mavs second unit playing both Reggie Jackson and Kennard at the same time defensively lol
Reggie Jackson has legit been great this game. Even has +6 over Kawhi's +1 in a game they generally trailed
It’s the kawhi/ Reggie Jackson show for the clips rn
"If you told me Reggie Jackson would score more than Luka today, i would bet my house on a Clippers blowout"
Reggie Jackson carried them through the first quarter.
"if clippers lose this game, pg13 bout to get meme'd off planet earth.  fucking reggie jackson is outperforming him. LOL"
Reggie Jackson did massive work in the first quarter
I always liked Reggie  Jackson .. he should have never move to Clippers
Clippers on the brink of elimination rn and the only help Kawhi is getting is from goddamn Reggie Jackson
Kawhi and Reggie Jackson have been outstanding this game
This series is basically who has a stronger back Reggie Jackson or THJ lol
Replace Paul George with Reggie Jackson in that Clippers graphic foh
Y tf Reggie Jackson playing like prime Klay Thompson all game
The Clippers need a third star. Kawhi and Reggie Jackson aren't enough on their own.
It’s kawhi and Reggie Jackson vs the mavs right now
Reggie Jackson is balling
"That's because Reggie is being overly physical with the fouls and seems to be kinda targeting Luka's shoulder.   Fuck Reggie Jackson, he's a bitch."
Reggie Jackson having the game of his life and this is still a close game
"Gotta stop sagging so much on Reggie Jackson, he’s hot right now"
Reggie Jackson having the game you’d expect PG13 to have
"Kawhi slow to get up goes in, Reggie Jackson clotheslining Luka comes out. Can’t explain that."
Reggie Jackson is the best player on the floor for the Clippers. Who would have thought?
Reggie Jackson vs Boban. Top tier matchup
The battle of superstars THJ and Reggie Jackson.
Lebron bout to recruit hard for Reggie Jackson
reggie jackson carrying
Reggie Jackson has drawn quite a few fouls from just falling over lmao
Obligatory fuck Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson the past couple of games though...
Reggie Jackson is easily the 2nd best Reggie Jackson in sports history
Reggie Jackson is what we wanted shroeder to be
"Reggie Jackson with all that gear on, looking like a MyPlayer lmao"
Reggie Jackson really looks like if Steve Urkel played in the NBA
WHAT ARE THESE CALLS  They called the foul because Reggie Jackson is a clumsy fuck
Maybe the Bulls should sign Reggie Jackson
REGGIE JACKSON BEING CLUMSY IS NOT A FUCKING FOUL
Reggie Jackson falls over and gets a foul. Just ref things
Bruh Reggie Jackson is so fuckign bad lol
horrible balance by reggie Jackson on that 3
“Let’s just switch Reggie Jackson onto Luka and not fight through screens or go under” -ty lue
Mann doing what Reggie Jackson did G6
KP hesitating with Reggie Jackson closing out smh
Reggie Jackson going up to boban just looks hilarious. And I’m like half a foot shorter than Jackson lmao. Humans are crazy
Stop Reggie Jackson and Dallas wins
Time for another huge Reggie Jackson game lol
"Reggie Jackson incoming 47 point game, then he gets ejected for attempting to score 50"
"Mr. Leonard was on god mode. Also Rick is pretty stubborn, not going back with Bobi lineup when you’re team needed possible easier buckets or telling your players to double Leonard and let other Clippers beat you. Like shit game 5 you gambled and it worked in your favor, daring Reggie Jackson to beat the Mavs."
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
as opposed to KD who was leading *checks list* Reggie Jackson and 38 year old Derek Fisher  2019 Harden also lost in the 2nd round against the Warriors after KD got hurt
"Tbh they were some bad calls on reggie jackson ,almost fouled out"
20 points lmao. Reggie Jackson had 25. PG was out performed in a do or die game by Reggie Jackson and Tim Hardaway JR 😂. Dude hasn't been worth a quarter of what was given up for him. He's dogshit. Him and Lue are the only reasons this series is even close. I stand by my statement. Kawhi should move on.
"I thought the only reason they r still in the series is cos he took a gamble n busted out tall ball, forcing them to either put zubac in so luka can feast on the mismatch, or go small w Morris n lose the rebounding battle while they hv to double boban in the paint n he can kick out to a shooter. W boban he's forced to play zone but only reggie Jackson is making the 3s other than their 2 stars. Boban is limited w his mins cos he isn't conditioned for it, he rarely gets played more than 20mins. I quite like the chess match, but it's boiling down to the kawhi luka duel. Whoever steps up more wins"
"The rest of the team has been cold for most of the series though, with the exception of Reggie Jackson. Mavs can probably expect that to continue."
The best Reggie Jackson
They tried that in game 3 and 4 and got burned so hard. KP tried to post up rondo and Reggie Jackson and just ends up bricking. It's definition of inefficient offense.
"Yeah, but he's shooting at least 10% above that average from everywhere.  I'd be interested to know what percentile that puts him in.  I'm also wondering what happened to the rest of the Clippers offense (excluding PG and Reggie Jackson) that was so potent during the regular season for them to go so cold during an entire series that they need this kind of ridiculous carry job from Kawhi to make it a 7 game series."
"LOL.. Did you watch the game? He had the most turnovers for Clippers. Kawhi carried them the whole game and got a lot of help from Reggie Jackson. Just because he's playing better than he did in the bubble, doesn't mean he's playing at his best.   He gotta be the number one or two scoring option tomorrow and play like he did all season. Luka and co. won't be an easy out."
I think he meant Reggie Jackson
"Since he was born in Italy, could Reggie Jackson have played for the Italian National Team?"
Yep I don´t like Reggie Jackson´s game but he has been great for LA since he became a starter. Batum is really good too because he brings that all positions defense.
"Must be looking at a different still image, cause in mine he's about 4-5 feet away, same distance as Reggie Jackson is from Tim Hardaway on the other wing"
"I thought It went both ways. Luka had an offensive foul on Kawhi, hit him on the head with his off arm that wasn't called. Reggie Jackson gets called for an offensive foul for hooking with his off arm."
And Marcus Morris has gone from shooting 47% from 3 to 34.5%. Everyone other than Reggie Jackson and Kawhi forgot how to shoot a damn 3.
He can get better. But the occasional dumb plays can linger forever. He can potentially be Reggie Jackson level.
How dare you disrespect Reggie Jackson
"Exactly. Those games were indication that luka knows that it's an inefficient play. It's not like KP post all the way in the basket and drags the double team away from the perimeter to pass out. That man only knows how to turn around jumper when he has rondo or Reggie Jackson on him. He has no moves to ""include him"" in the offense. You can't run screens for him cuz they laej PG or kawhi next to him. He has to show the effort to move and legit get open or the term is play with ""urgency""."
"The problem Lue has is this:  For realistically 1.5 positions (point guard and the minutes pg is out or playing the 3), Lue has to fit in these players: reggie jackson (playing amazing), beverley, rondo, mann, AND kennard who is playing well. What is he supposed to do?   You have to play jackson 25+ mins since hes playing incredibly well. Rondo needs minutes. How can you possibly bench mann or kennard after what theyve shown? And that leaves you with bev. There just simply arent enough minutes to go around to keep all them happy/play them all in any given game. I like the idea of trying different things but at some point youd like to figure out your best rotations and go with it but everyone he throws in there is playing well enough to deserve more mins but theres none to have!"
"It's tough to find anything that works for both sides.  His contract is 2 more years (1 guaranteed year + PO in 2022-2023), it makes the most sense to play out next season with him and then see what the Celtics can do when he's on an expiring deal.  The only trade that could make sense would be a deal with the Clippers if they decide they need a better PG (yes, Kemba is better than Reggie Jackson, Rondo &amp; Pat Bev).  You can get there with Kennard, Rondo &amp; Pat Bev's deal.  If I am the Celtics I am also looking to get Zubac included in the deal and moving Tristan Thompson to the Clippers.  I am not sure how much that deal excites either side, so again it's probably still more likely that Kemba plays for the Celtics next year and then the team takes another look when he's on an expiring deal in 2022."
Jazz are worthless without Mitchelle 45 they getting blown out and lucky for clippers they have rondo who steps up in playoffs and reggie jackson plus kawi defense will shut down michelle (thier goes thier offense) clippers are better jazz has michelle carrying them just like Mavs have luka carrying them inorder for any team to win they need 2 or 3 superstars to win Clippers in 6
"That play and your explanation is a microcosm of the whole problem with the Clippers. They have these two star wings, yet they are content to let their opponents choose the weakest link on the Clipper's roster to make the critical plays. On defense, they've got Kawhi and PG, yet it's Reggie Jackson checking Luka in the key moments of the game; on offense, they let Morris take the most important shot of the game. It's maddening."
"Ty Lue has Kennard, Reggie Jackson, and old ass Rondo running around and you wanna blame Kawhi and PG lol.  The clippers are full of defensive liabilities. A few players in the rotation isn’t gonna save that. Dallas simply lacked the talent outside of Luka and THJ to exploit it. Is Porzingis even a top 5 offensive player on a fully healthy Jazz team?"
Probably but if he doesn’t have the trust of the coaching staff it doesn’t matter.   Also I wouldn’t put him on the court if I’m going to have Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard give me something on offense.
Never understood letting Carlisle go during that time. Reached the conference finals in 03-04 before losing to the Pistons. Everything after that seemed like it was out of Rick's hands. Malice at the palace derailed their season after that. Reggie Miller decides to retire and Ron Artest decides he no longer wants to be there after screwing over the Pacers. Your best players afterwards was Stephen Jackson and a developing Danny Granger. Both Peja Stojakovic and Al Harrington didn''t even last a year there. It's a surprise that Rick Carlisle was even able to get them into the playoffs.
Reggie Jackson is not drawing doubles from 35 feet lol
Don't do this to yourself. Don't try to believe Drummond will turn into a good player. We did this for years and it never happened. Reggie Jackson drew plenty enough attention off him and it didn't make it any better.
"Neither is great at generating their own look the way someone like Luka or KD is, and they're both generally pretty gassed by the end of games which makes it worse. It's harder to get separation when your legs are dead, and even when you do you're probably going to miss. There's also a confidence issue, sometimes Kawhi will want the last shot(Game 6 against Dallas) but he usually doesn't demand it the way a few other guys do.  Reggie Jackson is probably their most clutch scorer, which is why he was the one who hit those massive 3s at the end of Game 7 to seal it."
Reggie Jackson fouled out trying to guard Don.
"He was a fucking general tonight.  I'll have to re-watch it, but I'm pretty sure he called off an ISO when he saw 5-foul Reggie Jackson out of place and in a lane to draw the 6th.  45 for 45."
"I like kawhi, reggie jackson, and rondo"
"I’m not gonna go back and watch the whole game.  But that happens maybe 2-3 times.  Luke  kennard got cooked.  Reggie Jackson got cooked.  Rudy Gobert played just fine.   Like you said he’s gonna get scored on, beat in some of those situations that’s not getting cooked."
Ibaka? Maybe Reggie Jackson from the ones getting mins rn
Exactly. If kawhii or pg aren’t scoring for this team who is? Marcus Morris? Luke Kennard? Reggie Jackson? This team is built off of those two dudes scoring and commanding so much attention that it opens up the other guys for easy shots. If pg continues to play like this on the biggest stages he cannot be our second best player on a championship team. He’d be a great third option though.
Wtf? Kawhi isn't likeable? Reggie Jackson seems cool. Ty Lue is a meme. Luke Kennard is a gr8 underdog. What are y'all talking about lol
You mean the one where he let Luka cook Morris and Reggie Jackson for six games before finally showing some spine?
Has anyone seen Reggie Jackson and Daniel Kaluuya in the same room together? Jus sayin
Reggie Jackson got smacked in the face and got no foul  And Donovan gets touched and foul  You can't be this bad at reffing
"Reggie Jackson fouling out gives LA a better chance to win, change my mind,"

"reggie jackson should be in the game not rondo, he can't shoot."
Why is Reggie Jackson barely playing? The dude is consistent offense
Reggie Jackson is the second best player on the Clippers now
"There have been a few silly calls and outright incorrect ones (Gobert block / charge, Kawhi falling over himself, the lane violation, one of bogey's post ups on reggie jackson didn't seem like jackson fouled), but overall I think this has been a game that the refs haven't taken over too much which has been pretty good."
reggie jackson be like [gets called for a foul for existing]
Those two fouls on Reggie Jackson were weak calls imo
Reggie Jackson getting screwed on some of these foul calls
"Nah, I was typing that before the shots, for the foul call on Reggie Jackson. I didn't see a thing."

*Be Pat Bev  *Talk a lot of shit and get paid  *Workout in Tims on the beach because youre tough like that  *Watch Reggie Jackson take your job

"Reggie Jackson has been a fuckin flamethrower for a week lmao. You’d think you’d wanna put a hand in his face, but what do I know?"
So I’m guessing Reggie Jackson took pat bev spot?
"Give this guy all the upvotes. I'm voting for you to replace Reggie Miller, Steven Jackson, Steven A. Smith, Max Kellerman and Jeff Van Gundy. You're better than all of them combined."
When Reggie Jackson is the leading scorer on a team with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard....it ain't good.

Idk why the Clippers stopped passing to Reggie Jackson after he made those two
Just got in how does Reggie Jackson have 27 points?
Damn Reggie Jackson really leading his team in points.
"Imagine having two max players, and a 10-16 Reggie Jackson, and letting pat bev take it to the rack and shit late in a big game."
Reggie Jackson u friccin moron
"If the Clippers lose this series, it will be because nobody beyond Kawhi Leonard and Reggie Jackson can hit a three. In general they're not as good of a shooting team as the Jazz, but man have their shots been wide open more often than not."
REGGIE JACKSON CAN'T WIN WITH THESE CATS
"The Clippers have 2 stars and a smoking hot Reggie Jackson, why is anybody else taking shots right now?"
This is what happens when you let Reggie Jackson outscore your 2 superstars lol

Reggie Jackson is underrated!
"If this isn't the time for Reggie Jackson to bust out the Bobby Shmurda dance, I don't know when it would be"
Reggie Jackson has such a punchable face for some reason

2nd best Reggie Jackson of all time
Clippers second star Reggie Jackson stepping up
Reggie Jackson&gt; prime MJ
J Cole gonna name drop Reggie Jackson in his next album now
Where were you when Reggie Jackson ascend?
When did Reggie Jackson transform from the dude playing with Russ that couldn’t shoot to this?
what happened to reggie jackson  he isn't this good before
Reggie Jackson is the best player on the clippers
Not sure what you do when career bum Reggie Jackson turns into Steph Curry
"Reggie Jackson was not the primarly playmaker nor ballhandler in either that Russ-less playoff team nor in today's Clippers.  KD averaged 35.5ppg and 6 apg during those games without Russ, and Reggie averaged 4 assists."
"Durant was primary ball handler, averaged 6.7 assists during that period (more than Jackson)  Also it was Reggie Jackson lmao, he was 23 and a 6th man"
Reggie Jackson played starting PG when Westbrook was out with his injury.
"Reggie Jackson, i wish i had his confidance, the dude isn't afraid of the moment"
Reggie Jackson and Dennis Schroder are 2 feathers of a bird.
And Reggie Jackson. Fuck that dude
"Reggie Jackson is the best player in the world, don't @ me"
Reggie jackson is a shooter tho.
reggie jackson
Ahem. Fuck Reggie Jackson. And pat bev while I'm at it
"I think it was game 5, thunder vs Clippers. Thunder get a steal that leads to a fast break, Reggie has the ball with Durant to one side and Westbrook to the other, drives into Matt Barnes instead and almost turns the ball over.  That play pretty adequately summed up Reggie Jackson back then."
"No I just have nothing else to reply to you about. Reggie’s always been a good player, but you sound like a clown by saying you’d rather have him than Westbrook. Shooters are easy to find, elite slashing playmaking point guards are not. He’s literally exactly what you need at the point guard position, a guy that consistently gets to the rack and facilitates. Unless you seriously think Reggie Jackson is going to be the starting point guard of a championship team, to that delusion I have no reply."
There is legit no situation I’d take Reggie Jackson over Westbrook. Westbrook as your fifth best player is the most disgusting lineup in nba history by an order of magnitude
"I did, and I certainly wouldn’t call him a great defender, that he’s had playoff success, or that he takes good shots. Yes, he shoots open threes. Every player does.   Youre batshit insane if you think Reggie Jackson &gt; Russell Westbrook lmao   I’m one of Reggie’s biggest fans by the way. I truly believe he’d have been an all-star PG if not for his injury. Now he has the same balls-to-the-wall extreme confidence without the same skill to match it."
I know rondos getting DNPs I said he’s washed? When did I say they were losing games and were a bad team? How did you get any of that from my comment? I’m just saying westbrook is an upgrade over Reggie Jackson
"do you not know what ""toxic"" means or what? if the players who actually were there in the locker room with him every day say he was a nuisance, why are you determined to go all ""akshually"" like you know better?  &gt; Adams felt the Thunder “weren’t clicking on the floor” and viewed Jackson as a selfish player.  &gt; When the trade deadline got near, we knew Reggie wanted to leave,” Adams wrote. “And because we knew he wanted to leave, we wanted him to leave as well.   &gt; Why would we want to work every day with someone who wanted to be somewhere else? When he was finally traded to the Detroit Pistons, we forgot about him pretty quickly because we had new guys to welcome to the team.”"
One of the clippers biggest weakness’s is an actual play maker (rondos washed) and this man would rather have Reggie Jackson than the league assists leader that also happened to be PGs point guard his MVP level season lmao
"nah reggie was very toxic about it. [steven adams wrote about it](https://247sports.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/Article/Steven-Adams-blasts-Reggie-Jackson-in-new-book-120411022/), everybody on the team was fed up with jackson's bullshit"
"this was so long ago, it's ridiculous to bring it up now as a knock against reggie jackson as a player right now"
"He is but at least his takes are about actual basketball analysis compared to, say, mark jackson or Reggie fucking Miller"
"I hate this Reggie Jackson slander.  Why wouldn’t a 22-24 year old player not want to be a starter? He was averaging 20ppg with Russ sitting. The Pistons were 14-6 until hurt his knee and wasn’t the same.  He’s playing great now as the off-ball guard on the Clippers. Current averaging 16ppg on a title contender hitting big shots in the playoffs, and is likely to get a bag in the offseason as a result.  Sure Russ is a good player, but acting like Reggie needs to kill his ambition for Russ’s feelings is stupid."
Depends on what you’re looking for I guess. Reggie Jackson isn’t taking the wizards to the playoffs
"Guys are saying those fights are the reason Pg wasn’t trending on Twitter but how come I saw Clarkson, Ingles and Reggie Jackson trending.   Nba Twitter don’t like when that man has a good game 😂."
This is why I hate Reggie Jackson and forever will. Low IQ shot chucker who thinks he's a star when in reality he's a mediocre backup
We've never seen Russ not have to be a focal point of the offense. He has never had 2 big stars to defer to. Thats kind of a bullshit comparison.   It also conveniently ignores all the amazing playoff performances he's had. He probably has more playoff wins with 30 plus points than Reggie Jackson has playoff wins in general.
Fuck Reggie Jackson. Dude bailed on his team when they needed him most. Such an injury riddled season for the Thunder. They missed the playoffs by one game that season.
reggie jackson is shooting like a million percent from three
Replace Reggie Jackson with Russ and Clippers get worse
Reggie Jackson actually played really well when Westbrook was out.  He was scoring. 20 ppg when Westbrook didn’t play.
"He made incredibly difficult shots throughout the game but the Clippers were often hard doubling him above the 3 point line and he would still look to score rather than find the open guy.  Without Conley they still have a lot of shooting around him and the Jazz are at their best when the ball is whipping around the perimeter and defenses are in constant rotation.  He made a bunch of tough shots but he could have made the game much easier for him and his teammates.  If the Clippers were sticking Reggie Jackson on him and hard doubling when he makes a scoring move, they could have looked to have Mitchell try to score on cuts and other quick hitting off ball actions before the Clippers have time to double"
"Yeah, he's not wrong to think he's better than Alex Caruso. Now do I think he'd have been more effective for the Lakers if he ran the bench unit and Caruso started? Yes, absolutely. But people  are acting like he pulled a Reggie Jackson wanting to start over Russ."
There was a season in Detroit where Reggie Jackson/Andre Drummond PnR’s were pretty lethal. I am being serious
"Reggie Jackson single handled kept the Clippers in game 3. When we were bulldozing them 30-11, he hit 8 points in sequence that sparked their comeback. If Pat Bev was still starting, it is very much likely that the Clippers go down in game 3 and the series ends in 5.  This would be good for the Jazz, because our ceiling against them would be losing in 6, with Luka going nuclear 2 games."
Reggie Jackson is proving he is good.
My opinion on Reggie Jackson is totally different now.
Am I the only person on earth who knew Reggie Jackson then Bobby Shmurda and not the other way around.
Reggie Jackson has been playing like Steph Curry the last few games I watched him.
U think the clippers are garbage outside of PG and kawhi? Didn’t Reggie Jackson have 29 last game?
Reggie Jackson
i love it when reggie jackson turns into steph curry
I'm more impressed with Reggie Jackson. Dude has been unbelievable the last two games.
"i posted this in the game thread but once again some insane context about reggie 'the third curry brother' jackson:  &gt; lmao the craziest thing about reggie doing this shit is that he was a fucking awful shooter for a long ass time  &gt; Dude came in shooting 21% on 1.4 3PA, and this season has been at 43.3% on 4.2 3PA.  &gt; He literally more than doubled his 3pt% *while tripling his 3PA*  Mad props to him for coming up big at important times for the clips"
Reggie Jackson balled tf out in that first half. Really hoping this series goes 7.
I’m honestly at a loss for words for Reggie Jackson putting up this kind of efficiency lately. Someone is going to regret giving this guy a substantial contract.
Reggie Jackson and Paul George?
luke kennard and reggie jackson are the kings of timely shots
“Passing? Never heard of her” - Reggie Jackson
"Why wouldn’t you factor health lol. Especially for 2 guys that always got hurt. Nothing else matters if the main stars aren’t playing  Current clippers have plenty good depth players. Reggie Jackson is going off. The entire team has been one of the best 3 pt shooting team in the league.   But yea I agree the lob city clips did have a more balanced starting 5, but they were never healthy."
Reggie Jackson is doing for the clippers what Rondo did for the Lakers during last year's playoffs
Reggie Jackson
"reggie jackson wears those goggles cause he is on fire, it helps him see through the smoke"
Reggie Jackson is too. $2.5 million? I didn't watch you guys during the regular season. Did he do this a lot?
If you told me Reggie Jackson would be a difference maker in a playoff series I would ask what hybrid you were smoking.
Reggie Jackson is tho 👀
The Clippers have to hope that Reggie Jackson never regresses back to his mean
Reggie Jackson doesn’t  miss lmao
who the fuck is reggie jackson man
Reggie Jackson is great
Lol Reggie Jackson literally squeaking his shoes to try to get Donovan to miss the ft
"As a 2nd grade teacher, Reggie Jackson might be one of my new favorite players"
respect reggie jackson.. from Mr. October to LeGoodRoleModel
Stop showing me how awesome of a person Reggie Jackson is. It makes me uncomfortable to like a Clippers player.
They making me like Reggie Jackson
"A team is more than two players. I would take the Lob City Clippers over the Kawhi/PG Clippers. The duos are similar caliber but Lob City had DeAndre and Redick as well, and typically a quality bench. Who's the third best guy on these Clippers? Marcus Morris? Reggie Jackson? It's an enormous step down in talent after the top 2."
I’m taking 2021 playoff Reggie Jackson over any player in NBA history
Would you rather have Schroeder or Reggie Jackson?
"Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson"
clips carried by reggie jackson and nic batum just like everyone predicted

reggie jackson
Reggie Jackson
Gobert really just sat there to let Reggie Jackson finish on Donovan.
Reggie Jackson went Super Saiyan for the playoffs wtf
"Ooof, Reggie Jackson should not be able to get all the way to the basket on the last possession. If I were Snyder, that would be what I'd be the most mad about at halftime."
Reggie Jackson was the one cutting into that lead not PG. PG started taking over when they had that 8+ point lead
Reggie Jackson is so fucking ugly
I voted Reggie jackson
Rudy was covered by Reggie Jackson for 15 seconds last possession. Fucking find him Donovan.
Kawhi focusing on defence now that Reggie Jackson is Steph Curry 😳
crazy that without batum and reggie jackson I think the clippers would get swept in this series
"Reggie ""Mario Chalmers"" Jackson"
The Jingles/Reggie Jackson duel we all anticipated
Don't let Reggie Jackson shoot 3s challenge
a zillion dollars in all-stars contracts on the clippers and its reggie jackson on his near-minimum contract coming up big
The Clippers better hope that Reggie Jackson doesn't turn back into Reggie Jackson if they want to win this series
I ain't wanna hear shit about Kawhi-PG vs Mitchell-Gobert showdown  This is Reggie Jackson vs Joe Ingles and you cannot convince me otherwise lol
Who would you rather fuck? Reggie Jackson or Pat Bev
Reggie Jackson &gt; PandemicP
"Kawhi is gonna get carried by PG and Reggie Jackson during the first 3 quarters of the game, then he is gonna turn it on a little during the 4th quarter and end up with 28 points. Everyone is gonna call him the ""Clutch God Terminator"" of basketball and forget how ass he was the rest of the game. I've seen this movie before."
The common denominator? Reggie Jackson
God I cannot stand Reggie Jackson. He's like that thorn in your side. How has this fucker gone hot as flames in the playoffs?
Now I know how how fans of other teams feel when Niang hits a bunch of threes. You’re fucked of Reggie Jackson is shooting like that.
Reggie Jackson and Joe Ingles are the two best players in the NBA
"Reggie ""Steph Curry"" Jackson"
Reggie Jackson for the Clippers right now is what the Lakers thought they would get with Schroder
Reggie Jackson is the greatest player of all time. I can see why the Clippers were hyped up.
Reggie Jackson trying to secure that bag this offseason.
Hornets about to max Reggie Jackson
Does Reggie Jackson get the max this offseason?
Does Reggie Jackson get the max this offseason?
MFer thinks Reggie Jackson is better than Schroder hahahahahaha!
Let's be honest here: Reggie Jackson might be in the conversation for FMVP this playoff
Reggie Jackson really just dribbled the entire shotclock and stunted on these hoes lmao
Lakers should offer Reggie Jackson the same contract Schroder turned down.
Wait Reggie Jackson wanted to retire at 31?
Reggie Jackson is only on a one year deal? Boi about to get paid!! Hawks Pick up the phone 👀👀
Reggie Jackson: Throw your damn money at me

Reggie Jackson trying to get paid lol
how do the Clippers luck into Reggie Jackson and the Lakers sign the sixth man of the year who then puts up goose eggs
"Reggie jackson the next great point guard of all time apparently, wtf happened to this dude since the start of the playoffs"
With how this offense looks. absolutely no reason not to at least try and go to rudy/favors when they get pat bev or reggie jackson on them.  Coach them to get deep position and find them or force help and hit the 3. why the fuck not
"It's too bad bc I really respect Kawhi a lot, and I want Reggie Jackson on the Lakers next season."
Lol Reggie Jackson asking for the ball
Reggie Jackson is just warming up
"Reggie Jackson is overdue for his shot cooling off, but Marcus Morris is overdue for his shot heating up. Something's gotta change right?"
i mean this comparison might be even worse than OP's bad take.  the difference between hakeem and embiid is not nearly the difference between reggie fucking jackson and jordan.
I never watched Michael Jordan but I’m pretty sure Reggie Jackson is better rn
Would you rather pay 2.3m for Reggie Jackson or 41m for WB.   If the comparison is like that? I’m taking Reggie any fucking day lmao.
I would take RWB over Reggie Jackson without hesitation lol.
"If you’re associated with the Lakers or Bulls, Reggie Miller automatically hates you. He’d probably try to beat up Phil Jackson if they ever met."
I love the Jazz but I gotta put some money on the Reggie Jackson Clippers at those odds
"Coaching can win you championships or make you advance in the playoffs if you have a decent team. What makes a *bad coach* is someone who has theoretically the better team but loses to a lesser team. ( Doc Rivers choking with last year's clippers. You gotta give credit to Ty Lue for making the adjustments to come back from 2-0 alongwith Kawhi, Reggie Jackson stepping up)"
Sign reggie Jackson for a super max
"Your team is very very goofy    You have these slow starts, your +40% from 3 shooters are almost all underperforming except for Reggie Jackson and every shooter you play seems to massive increase their 3pt fg%. I think Clarkson has actually doubled his pull up 3% from 25% against Memphis to 50% against you."
"I agree with all your points except the Luka one. He was asked to do way more than Kawhi was, and it's not like Kawhi was the one that single handedly beat him. Marcus Morris, Terrence Mann, and Reggie Jackson all had great performances in their wins. Kawhi obviously had the phenomenal Game 6, but the Clippers as a whole outperformed the Mavs."
"Definitely both. And you're right, 35 and 33 points is 2021 Lakers territory lol.   It's not like they didn't have any playmakers either though, so it is kinda baffling how they could be so bad. Kawhi and George were both pretty limited in that regard early in their career, but at this stage, Kawhi's definitely above average and George is solid. Lou Williams was more than capable of setting others up, and Reggie Jackson isn't bad as the 4th playmaking option, but yeah, they also didn't have a top-30 playmaker in the league either. Just a bizarre set of circumstances, fit, chemistry, and choking I guess."
"Kawhi has Paul George, who by now should not count as ""a lot more talent"", at least not enough to counter the Mavs' depth. Their starting center is gone, and beyond that who is their third best player, Reggie Jackson?"
"Ayton is the biggest surprise for me, definitely acquitted himself well and has been exactly what the Suns needed.   Reggie Jackson also went from last guy on the bench to a pretty important player for the Clippers and is one of the reasons they are still alive in the playoffs.   And last but not least is Cameron Payne, what a story.  Really helped steady Phoenix when cp3 was hurting against LA"
"Cp3, Reggie Jackson, Norm Powell, Gary Trent"
Reggie Jackson
"Give Paul George, Nicolas Batum, and Reggie Jackson the respect they deserve."
The '11-'12 Thunder: PG: Westbrook / Derek Fisher / Reggie Jackson SG: James Harden / Thabo Sefolosha SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Serge Ibaka / Nick Collison C: Kendrick Perkins
Reggie Jackson
A lot of good answers here but Ayton is surprising me in these playoffs and Reggie “Steph Curry” Jackson
Reggie Jackson wow I never watched him before but dude has embraced the pressure
2011-2012 Thunder:    Prime KD   Prime Harden    Prime Westbrook    Prime Ibaka    Prime Perkins    Prime Reggie Jackson   Prime Derek Fisher    Prime Thabo Sefolosha
Reggie Jackson was the point guard then.
"What's the question? He played with prime Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, and Serge Ibaka. They all had double digit PPG."
"I think a full season of Gordan will be really good. But, I think a secondary playmaker and scorer off the bench? See if they can snag Reggie Jackson off the Clippers. Jokic does so much on offence and ya Murray will help but you can never have too much creation."
"I don't think you realize how unlikely our Game 5 win was.  Yes, PG is a very good player and stepped up as a first option.  But without the guy that is very clearly our best player on both ends we are heavily dependent on Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson.  Those are two names that you don't associate with consistent performances.  I think this series goes 7 and it would take a miracle for LA to get a second win in SLC without Kawhi."
"Reggie Jackson and Russell Westbrook hate each other. but I suppose so did Reggie and Ibaka, and they could squash the beef"
"Reggie Jackson is the new ""not this guy""  https://youtu.be/WK7lIjFsGvg"
Yea the lord and savior Reggie Jackson in the clutch shall save the city of Los Angeles.
I'm watching Reggie Jackson &amp; Marcus Morris go off every other game for the Clippers though. Even guys like Austin Rivers will win you a game every now and then.  I can't believe how ass he's been on both ends.
"Even so, the 2013 Thunder were probably the best iteration of that team ever. It was literally the only time post-Harden when the Thunder had 3 good players surrounding KD and Westbrook, especially perimeter players. Between Ibaka, Kevin Martin, and Reggie Jackson with Sefolosha being competent, this is legitimately the only year they had an actually good rotation, even with Kendrick Perkins, Nick Collison, and Hasheem Thabeet playing center for them"
"All of this shit is solved if Porzingus just got like 10 reb/game against the Clips. We'd beat the hobbled Jazz and put up a fight against the Suns in the WCF.  But no, mans gotta get boxed out by Reggie Jackson ugh"
"I said this elsewhere, and I’ll paste it here:  As hard as it is for me to say, because I’ve always been a huge Carlisle supporter, this might be a good thing. The Mavs roster wasn’t great this year, but it wasn’t THAT bad. They made the fifth seed in the West, and they have a first team all-NBA player.  KP played the worst basketball of his career this year, and in the playoffs he was non-existent. All of our “Rick Carlisle Reclaimation Project” guys, Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Dwight Powell, did NOTHING all series long. They, and especially Jaylon Brunson, looked absolutely unprepared and scared of the big moment in the playoffs. That’s on the coach, plain and simple. It’s not like the guys haven’t been in the playoffs, they all had before! If your team is unprepared, that’s on the coach.  People said KP was in the corner by design. Carlisle has doubled and tripled down on NOT using him as a post up player, or even trying. The KP we saw in the playoffs is who Carlisle wanted him to be. This team is filled with Carlisle guys and the result was the same as last year: first round exit. Yeah, KP’s game sucked this year. But again, who is that on? Coach him up! If he won’t post up, and that’s what you want him to do, sit his ass on the bench and tell him to go lift some weights after the game. You’re the coach, he’s the player.  An extra hard-to-swallow pill is this: Rick got outcoached by Ty Lue. Ty made adjustments, sat starters, went deep in his bench when he was on the ropes. He went and played Reggie Jackson big minutes because he was killing us. What did Rick do? Nothing, he just kept letting Luka play iso ball. No set plays to get his other shooters going, no getting the ball to KP down low. In absolute fact, one could argue Rick lost us the series by sitting Luka when the Mavs were up big in quarter 1 of game 3. We had to foul to get Luka back in the game because the Clippers melted a 20 point lead in like 5 minutes. That, again, is on the coach.  The Mavs were NOT great this year, but they were a solid team with plenty of useful guys that have done things elsewhere. But in the playoffs, they looked like Luka and the Washington Generals. If Rick’s plan was to out-talent the other team, then why do we need Rick? Even I can tell Luka to “go be great”.  The Mavs need a change of scenery. So thanks for 2011, I’ll always love ya Rick, but it was time for a change."

"It’s ok Rick, I’d leave too if I had to watch KP get walled by Reggie Jackson in the post one more time."
Glasses Reggie Jackson aint fucking around
"Yeah, that's just too small. The Clippers ""small"" lineup is still big, outside of C. It's basically a bunch of long 6'8"" guys plus Reggie Jackson, who's 6'3"".    They can't rebound that well but they can still defend bigger lineups."
Would love Reggie Jackson on the Lakers. Serious upgrade over Dennis. Seems like a low maintenance low ego guy.
I mean Reggie fucking Jackson was hunting for the 1v1
That’s not the point I’m making. All I know is that the dpoy should be getting hunted by Reggie Jackson in pivotal playoff games.
&gt;I feel like Reggie Jackson was more of a difference maker than Rondo was.
"Wait….you do know that Reggie Jackson was cooking Gobert too, right?"
Without Kawhi they definitely are depending on some sort of combo of Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris which is gonna be interesting to watch for the rest of the playoffs.
"I think you guys are fine with Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, and Mann. Just need to manage their rotations well."
Reggie Jackson is having the time of his life every time he gets gobert switched on him
I wonder how many r/NBA nephews understood this was a reference to Mr. October and fellow Reggie Jackson
"Lou will, who is one of my favorites ever, sadly just didn’t have a lot of room to play with Reggie Jackson and Kennard."
Lmao he took Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond to the playoffs what the fuck do you people expect a coach to do
whats with everyone saying Reggie Jackson? I think he's totally normal looking.
"Reggie Jackson, Draymond and Boban in the Top 5. Reggie probably in the top 5 all time."
The tyrone Hill award? Reggie jackson is super fugly. Wjen i think of a human funion i think of him
"Hmmm, idk. I think Reggie Jackson is very handsome"
Julius Randle and Reggie Jackson
"The guy was really good for the Pistons when we first got him, but he was plagued by injuries and could never quite get right after that. However, he still thought he could play like he did when he was healthy and eventually drove most of our fans insane, myself included. He thought he was a first-option kind of guy and he played hero ball and directly led to many of our losses over the last couple of years because his level of confidence did not line up with his level of health.  With all of that said, he was very nice when I met him, and you can tell his passion and excitement for the game is there. His first game after we traded for him, he got so worked up and nervous before the game that he threw up near the team bench.  If he had been consistently healthy the last few years, the Pistons would be a very different team right now and Blake/Andre would both probably still be here. I'm happy to see him finding some success in Los Angeles. The Suns are the #1 team I'd like to see win it all this year but if it's not them, I'd be happy to see the Clippers find a way to get it done. I like Reggie, I love Mook, and of course my guy Chauncey winning another ring as an assistant coach would be dope.  (On a related note, the only thing I truly hated about Reggie Jackson is that after we retired Chauncey's jersey, he didn't change his number the next season. When we retired Ben Wallace's jersey, Stanley Johnson changed his number at the start of the next season from 3 to 7, but Reggie stuck with #1. Ugh.)"
I said a few week ago that Reggie Jackson plays like how Dennis thinks he plays
"Quin Snyder did adjust last nigh  His primary ball handler is injured and his star player is on one-leg (which was clear with the way Mitchell's shot was off last night). More than that. His defensive adjustments last night turned the Clippers into a jump shooting team in the 2nd half, which is what you want   The Jazz couldn't knock down good looks, for whatever reason, but defensively they did a good job. Donovan's is just not as good with Gobert in the pick n roll - part of me believes it's his desire to drive first and kick later. They had a few good plays last night but Conley turns Gobert into a real threat on the offensive end more than Mitchell can.   Do people not watch the games between the two halves? It's clear Quin adjusted as best he could and Mitchell's injury was clearly more debilitating in the 2nd half. Clippers played great, no doubt. But the Jazz should not be discouraged that Reggie Jackson was the guy late in the game and needed to knock down some tough shots to get the win.  Also I think Morris' ability to dominate the post was impressive. Seriously, just big boying the Jazz on some plays."
"Reggie Jackson suddenly looks like an all-star point guard. As a jazz fan, I swear every playoffs there is some random role player on the other team that torches us the whole series and plays out of their mind. Last series it was Dillon Brooks, this series it's Reggie Jackson."
Was Kawhi Leonard holding back Reggie Jackson and the Clippers? Coming up next on Undisputed…
Yeah but you didn't have to deal with Lou Will or Reggie Jackson so it's pretty much a wash.
"The recency bias is crazy. Yes, Simmons has been trash the last two games but has accomplished more in this season than Reggie Jackson has in his whloe career. You're a dumbass if you truly think overwise."
\*Reggie Jackson = the worst lead ball-handling offensive player in NBA history
Reggie Jackson &gt; the worst lead ball-handling offensive player in NBA history
"Morris, Reggie Jackson, Batum and Paul George have given the clippers way more than any of the Mavs roleplayer have bar THJ and DFS. In game 7, Luka and DFS went 9/16 from 3 while the rest went 1/18. With most of those 3s being open or wide open.  Moreover the clippers bench could actually hold a lead. Whenever Luka sat down the lead evaporated. Take Game 3. Luka sat down for 3 minutes and a 19 point lead evaporated. This same thing happened over and over again that series, in smaller examples."
Reggie Jackson getting paid this summer. Just a lil bit.
"The ankle was in late fall 2017.... He started having knee tendinitis issues that derailed his potential in the fall of 2016, start of the season. He's never been the same, and what we're seeing now is ""as healthy as he's gonna be"" Reggie Jackson. He'll never be ""healthy"" in the sense of achieving the athleticism/burst he had before he started having knee issues."
Reggie Jackson &gt; Simmons
 Damn I’m a Reggie Jackson fan now.
"As much as Kawhi went his MVP mode, the major reasons that we lost were Reggie Jackson keeping them alive in Game 4 and Terrance Mann being a general pain in the ass G3 and beyond. Subtract both and we would be eliminated last night to the Jazz, losing in 5 with dignity."
"Just like I’m the king on the microphone, so are Reggie Jackson and Moses Malone."
"Great game by PG and Reggie Jackson, oh and Morris deserves needs some respect put on his name too."
"Reggie Jackson, one million dollars, ya feel me? Holler"
People are pretty confident the Clippers are going to win up 3-2.... I’d say it’s more likely that Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris throw up duds the next two games and Mitchell dominates.  Don’t like the sixers odds but they’re #2 because the bucks are done
Mr. June nickname is a perfect call by Ian Eagle as long as you know the ORIGINAL Reggie Jackson was Mr. October.  [Mr. October Reggie Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDMYVtzHGuI)
"reminds me of when morris told reggie jackson to make quicker decisions, if you wanna let him go let him go  and look at how fast reggie switches here, morris must be so proud  I bet he's yelling like good job reggie from way under the basket"
“Reggie Jackson has been Mr June!”   he’s top tier
Inb4 people start saying glasses Reggie Jackson is second coming of Michael Jordan lol
It’s fucked cause he seems to be getting a lot of the blame. Like what is he supposed to do when the guy guarding Reggie Jackson is getting crossed up over and over and he has to make a choice on who to guard.
Reggie Jackson be like 😎
fucking this. Mann and reggie jackson are hot? leave them in and keep feeding them
Reggie Jackson gained a lot of confidence and is playing like an all star. Dude makes tough shots.
Aka Reggie “Big Government” Jackson
Can't even stop reggie jackson from driving in the paint
"He has no half court offense. He can't score off a pick and roll because people will just go under the screen and he's forced to pass once they block the lane.  He should be setting screens as a rim runner, but they have no good point guards. A dude like Reggie Jackson would make them a title contender"
Ty Lue always looked unprepared and somehow rights the ship. Took advantage of the 7 game series and gets his role players involved. Reggie Jackson playing like his prime self now
"Lakers should have traded for Lowry, but it's not like it would've made any difference if AD was injured and Lowry leaves to get paid by Philly or the Heat this off-season. Contrary to popular belief, we needed Harrell to do some regular season lifting once Lebron and AD were out. Even if he was unplayable in the playoffs, the goal we had in mind for signing him turned out to be true. KCP literally balled out the entire season last year, and people were calling him the perfect type of 3&amp;D player you want next to Lebron. Reggie Jackson is going to get paid after this year as well. But you reply completely avoided saying anything about Lonzo, Ingram, and Hart. All players who are still heavily criticized by the Pelicans fanbase as inconsistent. If we still kept them, you would be saying that they're all busts lol"
Reggie “Mr June” Jackson
"Man Reggie Jackson has proved himself before he’s solid, Mann is the surprise"
Literally abused by Reggie Jackson. he doesn't deserve any of his DPOY for this
You forgot Reggie-ment Jackson!
They get blown by any time PG or Reggie Jackson wanted. The problem was giving up 81 in a half and the defense right there is really bad. If the Jazz manage to pick up some legit perimeter defenders with length they'll make the next step but rn they arent ready
"After the Mavs series, it's actually shocking to see the Clippers get away with so many minutes for Reggie Jackson and Pat Bev on the floor at the same time. No excuse for Utah to not be keeping up some scoring intensity."
Yeah like anyone is going to stop those floaters. It’s like saying Simmons and Thybule suck defensively because trae young scores 30 on them. Reggie Jackson was just playing out of his mind.
I thought Rudy actually did as good of a job as you could as a 7 footer against speedy guards (Reggie Jackson was just unreal with his high off glass layups). He also had 7 offensive rebounds.  The problem for the Jazz in this game were the turnovers from their stagnant hero ball offense. Clippers were **31-4** in Points off of turnovers in this game. That is unacceptable and how you lose which is exactly what happened to the Jazz.
Reggie Jackson has been clutch as fuck this series
yea nobody can stop reggie jackson
"Gobert’s contests at the rim were charmin soft, he had Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann routinely going at him and he was barely contesting."
Ah yes facu campazzo = Reggie Jackson. Clippers are a better team and wcf will be competitive
"&gt; Use Conley and Mitchell  That’s exactly what the Clippers did. They switched those two on PnRs for either Paul George or Reggie Jackson. Then Rudy had to come off his man from the corner because those two constantly got blown by and muscled over. Rudy never sat mid range, he was constantly moving from his man to help those two who were getting their asses handed to them. Hence why I’m annoyed that he was literally the one guy rotating. You are talking about a bunch of stuff that never happened."
"It was a combination of Doc, Kawhi, and PG choking. PG especially since then seems like hes grown and plus Reggie Jackson with shades being the best PG of all time has helped a lot."
"&gt;""[Jazz] showed they are a finals team""  &gt;""Reggie Jackson can't win with these cats""  r/AgedLikeMilk"
mf is making 40 millions to get cooked by reggie jackson it's his fault
"Well, they have 4 other players who can start playing better defense. That would be good. Honestly, Gobert is awkward at times, but he can go out to the perimeter. It's just that the rest of the Jazz can't stop anything going to the rim. Donovan Mitchell got bodied by Reggie Jackson in an ISO. That's going to keep happening without Gobert covering for him in the paint.  And Jokic actually isn't all that bad stepping up at times either, I think he just started running out of steam in that Suns series, had to do too much on both ends."
"Gobert averages 3 OReb and 6 FTs in the clippers series. That's not terrible, but definitely not enough to prevent a team from going small. And then they didn't neutralize his D, they straight worked him.   Snyder needed to do something! Switch him, if he can't use those 8 foot arms to bother a Reggie Jackson 3, then what's he doing out there?"
No but we don't credit any success he had with LeBron for some reason. Because unlike any other good coach he's only had success with really good players. Or Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann.
They need this version of Reggie Jackson
"He isn’t fine though, every playoff he gets hunted for switches constantly by perimeter players or never closes out on shooters when he’s supposed to. You can’t just chalk it up to “oh this is just a mismatch for Gobert” because then every fucking team is a mismatch for him. This isn’t the 70s, centers kind of have to give a shit about contesting perimeter players instead of hoping they’re stupid enough to drive towards them at the basket. Speaking of, that’s exactly what Reggie Jackson did all night yet it worked, if he’s supposed to do 1 job which is defend the paint and he couldn’t even do that this series, what’s exactly fine about him?"
"Yeah, agreed. I think the Jazz lost confidence in their defense which is why they kept him inside this game (in previous games they had him switch on the perimeter sometimes). But then the rotation never gets to Gobert's man, so he starts trying to cheat and have it both ways. None of it ends up working.  Then the cherry on top is Reggie Jackson saying, ""fuck yo rim protection"" and just going at him."
"Gobert can cover the perimeter of they want him to. He did full switches earlier in the series and was good on them. But it means the Clippers get a free layup on wherever Reggie is going against, so they tried to keep him in instead.  And yes, his offense is a big problem. That's undeniable. The Clippers were guarding him with Reggie Jackson at time and had the chances to switch but didn't."
"reggie jackson doing all this on a vet min contract, this shit should be worker's exploitation"
"Honestly, although he wasn't even close to acceptable tonight, the reason why they lost was because of the lack of adaptability in roster and defensive game planning. Rudy Gobert plugs a lot of holes for Jazz players who can't contain for shit on the perimeter, or even provide help rim protection. He's always existed on an island and the Jazz are where they are despite that.  Regardless, if they put all their chips on him standing in the paint and other teams 5th man missing open 3s, they're going to get burned a lot. It's the playoffs, and outliers become a regular occurrence in big moments. Now if Gobert chases perimeter players, what does the Jazz actually have in rim protection? Is Bogdanovic going to slide in? Do they play Favors as a 4, have 2 non shooters on offense and 2 slower bigs rotating in the half court? If they take Gobert off the court, are the rest of the Jazz players going to step up and not hide behind Gobert's rim protection? I saw Donovan Mitchell get bullied by Reggie Jackson in an iso, that would become a regular occurrence.  Jazz are locked into a player who plugs too many holes on defense and can easily be jump shot into oblivion. The only 3 options going forward are a) hope to god small teams just miss their jump shots all the way to a chip b) get some new creativity in defensive coaching with or without Quinn and c) trade Gobert to make an adaptable roster and risk having all the Jazz perimeter players exposed on defense."
I don't think that was the thought process though. Offense was clearly not the problem. They were making history from 3 every other game. It was the fact that this was legitimately the best he could do. Reggie Jackson legitimately stared down every body on the Jazz to set up a rhythm 3 or blow by and was successful seemingly every time.
I hate how I became a Reggie Jackson fan
They somehow gave him the Tony Allen treatment. It's one thing to have your center help away from him. But the Clippers were happy to leave Reggie Jackson on him at times.
I mean mark Jackson said it during the game he should of had Rudy guard pat bev or basically anyone who wasn't pg/man/Reggie. Quinn didn't adjust
"Or have guys who can keep their man in front of them or be able to be a disruptive help defender. The jazz players other than O’Neal are just useless on defense, Reggie Jackson was just lining them up and teeing off"
rightfully deserved. i will now refer terrance mann and reggie jackson as the splash bros
It’s not jokes if it’s true. Paul George is a choker. The reason Clippers won was Terrence Mann and Reggie Jackson with a side of Ty Lue. PG really can’t claim these wins.
Yeah I guess we don't have Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann alone outscored the Jazz 34-22 in the 3rd quarter
"Yeah, don't think many centers can do better, but those centers will make them pay on the other end. You can go small against jokic, but it will be a zero sum gain. If you don't have someone to defend him, then there's not much of a point going the other way around. The fact that Gobert has no offensive game, means you can put a Reggie Jackson on him or play really small."
I think they actually match up against the Suns well. The Clippers are a bad matchup for them and most teams when PG isnt stuck in his own head. Of course Kawhi being out should have negated that but then Mann turned into Kawhi and Reggie Jackson decided he was a top 5 pg in the league.
Ok that makes sense thanks man. So basically an interior defensive specialist is pointless when your team goes so small that it’s 5 3pt shooters standing around the perimeter . Plus I’ll point out as others have that he didn’t even play interior well as Reggie Jackson seemed to get whatever layups he wanted..   I also am starting to get the argument that he shouldn’t be a DPOY if he has such a glaring weakness (especially when small ball is the meta in the nba today) and can become a *liability* on the defensive side at all.
Exactly... have people seriously forgotten about his failures? Just because Terrence Mann and Reggie Jackson played out their minds??
"So, can anyone tell me since when is Reggie Jackson a superstar?"
Reggie Jackson completely dominated the DPOY. That is something that nobody ever thought would be muttered.
Reggie Jackson was a running joke the least half of the season and most of round 1 then all of a sudden he becomes kawhi 2.0
Reggie Jackson went at Gobert in the paint with confidence like 3 times in the 4th and I couldn't believe what I was seeing lmao.
I was downvoted to hell saying he’s an overrated defender in another post. He’s the best rim protector since Dwight but he is so awful outside the paint. I mean Reggie Jackson isn’t even afraid of him. Harden and Steph probably give Gobert nightmares every night
"Yeahp, in Utah they'll have nightmares over either Reggie Jackson or Terrance Mann considering they'll still show hate to Paul George considering he gave it to them every game"
Rudy being the defensive player of the year and getting destroyed by Reggie Jackson and with Mann corner 3s. Unbelievable
dude couldn’t post up Reggie Jackson and was trash at crashing the boards. I can’t really blame them for not trusting him to take a bigger part of the offense.
"Clippers’ role players just keep getting better and better. From our first round series, and the second round, we’ve seen Reggie Jackson, Batum, and now Mann step up and have career games! The last 2 games without Kawhi, PG played like the max contract superstar that he was! Damn i honestly think you can get to the finals ngl. Suns v Clips gonna be good"
"Reggie Jackson turned into Michael Jordan in the 4th, he was fucking fearless"
"Yeah, y'all have Fred VanVleet by committee: Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann, Nic Batum, and some Luke Kennard."
its okay we saw terrence man and reggie jackson run a layup line on him instead
"He wasn't bad all series, but he was -24 this game and getting clapped both at the rim and on the perimeter by T-Mann and Reggie Jackson."
"Reggie Jackson, Terrance mann, Patrick Beverley, list goes on and on. I'm glad he got paid tho, that franchise never gonna win a ring with him, most annoying fanbase in the world, they even disrespect their own players, said gobert was better than Mitchell lmao"
Reggie jackson is the best guard in basketball rn
Reggie Jackson &gt; John Stockton
What's happening when reggie Jackson takes it straight to him back to back and gets 2 clean banked layups?   What's happening when Batum is tapping rebounds out from behind him?   What's happening when Mann is going straight at him and jamming it?   His rotations were terrible. It's obviously the scheme's fault but he was late OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Maybe hedge the paint a little more next time?
atleast its trae young and not reggie jackson or terrance mann destroying your top defensive player
Reggie? Na more like loud pack Jackson! 🔥
Reggie Jackson is on the minimum and has been hugely impactful all playoffs for the clippers
"fake 1 seed, got skull fucked by reggie jackson and terrance mann lmaooo"
I swear that Reggie Jackson goggles is some Iron Man gadget. He can see the optimal trajectory for every shot.
LOL I'd love it if that's what actually happened. https://www.thefocus.news/nba/why-does-reggie-jackson-wear-glasses/ apparently he thinks they help him hone in on the basket
Especially to my boy Reggie Jackson. Like if it was KD or smt it’s reasonable but cmon now
Dude got dragged out of the paint by Batum and let terrance mann and reggie jackson run a train on him
Reggie Jackson punked Rudy gobert for like the last three games of this series. Wasn't afraid to challenge him at all. Made it look super easy even compared to kawhi and PG challenging rudy.
I mean Reggie Jackson and PG went at him over and over again in the 4th and got layups out of it
"Props to the clippers for making the open shots and not giving up at halftime, they deserve to win the game. But this comeback is on the Jazz coach Snyder.  Keeping Gobert in the game for so long as the lead slipped away due to open 3 pointers in the corner from Mann or Batum on just about every possesion....  It's a baffling decision and I don't understand why the Jazz didn't match up with a Conley, Mitchell, Clarkson, Bogdonovich, O'neale lineup. If Conley couldn't play that many minutes in his first game back then play Ingles instead.  The clippers didn't play Zubac hardly at all in the 2nd half, so there was no need for Gobert's rebounding and rim protecting. Even if the Jazz guards gave up contested lay ups and 2 pointers, that would be a more difficult comeback for the clippers than giving up wide open corner 3s.  Just about every clipper highlight from the 3rd quarter is Mann or Batum hitting a 3 pointer with Gobert's outstretched arm barely in the frame.  Moving forward, the Jazz need another impact player off the bench who can play the 5 in against other team's small ball line ups. (A Robert Covington or Draymon Green type of player.) Or a big man who can stretch the floor a bit on offense at the very least (A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player, though preferably someone a little younger.)  The Jazz have a good team, they just don't have a flexible line up to match up against other team's playstyles. Compare them too... the Clippers, who have players like Cousins, Zubac, and Rondo. They have Morris, a guy with decent size who can stretch the floor. Reggie Jackson and Luke Kenard who can stretch the floor and give a spark off the bench. All players with a specific skill set that is useful in certain matchups and specific situations."
"Yeah they really couldn't miss. Inside or outside. Reggie jackson had those two crazy high bank floaters going at Gobert. And when Pat Bev hit that second last three, pullup contested from the left wing, you knew the Clippers were fated to win."
Reggie jackson and pat bev were HUGE in 4th qtr
Been a long time clippers fan since game 5. Reggie Jackson is now my favorite point guard in the league and PG is suddenly very likable. Oh and MAMA THERE GOES THAT MANN!
"On what planet are the Jazz locking down the Clippers without Gobert, when the entire reason they were getting open 3s is because Gobert had to help at the rim when the primary defender got beat 1on1.  With no Gobert, those Reggie Jackson drives are uncontested layups rather than passes to the perimeter."
Gobert got scored on by Reggie Jackson at the rim and had Pat Bev splash a 3 in his face in the clutch. Most fraudulent DPOY ever
"Yeah we should, except Reggie Jackson played out of his mind all series and Terance Mann just dropped 40. Jazz should have played better defense but when a whole team shoots like 80% for a long stretch it doesnt matter who they're missing."
I thought I heard something about glasses Reggie Jackson is a top 10 player of all time. No shame in losing to him.
Pulling Gobert out to the perimeter is one thing but Reggie Jackson also kept driving at Gobert in the paint and either scoring or kicking it out.  What happened to Gobert's reputation as a rim protector that supposedly scares off players from driving?
"Mann and Reggie Jackson deserve all the plaudits tonight, stepped up so much since Kawhi went down"
"How Gobert gonna let Reggie Jackson and Mann turn him into bbq chicken, that’s crazy."
Gallo vs Reggie Jackson you mean.
Reggie Jackson was really great. He was the engine of the offense the entire second half and they couldn't stop him from getting into the paint.
It was hilarious watching Reggie Jackson just completely disregard the DPOY being on the floor and slice into the paint time after time
Reggie Jackson the Gobutt Killer
"Most of the series as well as most of this game I agree with you, but today down the stretch he kinda was a problem for them. Reggie Jackson, PG, and Mann were just attacking him and scoring layups on him. And on top of all that he couldn't even secure rebounds that well, the one thing he should be able to do against a small lineup. I don't think Gobert necessarily got exposed but he had one of his worst games. Some of it due to his play and some of it due to the Jazz scheme/lack of perimeter defenders putting him in bad spots"
Isn't that their system to funnel things to him? Isn't that what he is good at?   I didn't see him doing jack in the second half at the rim ? Reggie Jackson ate him alive   So yea. It's his fault.
Reggie Jackson has been so good in this series. Loved his performance in every game! 🔥🔥
"Reggie Jackson, Mann and Ty Lue coaching made this Clippers a more likeable team.. Congrats Clippers!"
"Yes, the clippers lineup with **checks notes** an old batum, morris, reggie jackson, terance mann, and paul george is revolutionizing small ball. Yes. The original lineup of death here. Nobody ever won 3 championships with this type of lineup. Or 73 games. New basketball here, folks."
Idk but Reggie jackson was smoking someone down there
Reggie Jackson took it off the fucking top of the backboard twice on him after directly driving to the rim. Mann grandson’d him. Fraud.
"imagine losing to Terrence Mann, Reggie Jackson, and Nicolas Batum. Rough series for Utah fans"
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭  Fuckin r/nba. I’ve been screaming Rudy is overrated fir a few years now.   #It is a guards game.  The best defensive player in the world and you’re undone by Reggie Jackson and Terrence Mann.
"if gobert is not getting important rebounds or stopping reggie jackson from scoring in the paint, what they paying him for? LOOOOL"
"To be fair, regarding Rudy being scored on in the paint, Reggie Jackson briefly became the greatest point god in Clippers history."
1. Terrance “MJ without the luck” Mann 2. Nic batum 3. Reggie Jackson  4. Kahwi or however you spell it
"Ah yes so basicially the wide open 3s weren't his fault, the Reggie Jackson layups right in his grill weren't his fault, and not being able to score on undersized players also isn't his fault"
"""We realized that we couldn't guard him with Luke Kennard or Reggie Jackson, so we had to make an adjustment from the last round."""
Not gonna happen... Or atleast highly unlikely.  The Clippers have star talented shot creators... Nuggets had Jokic but even he is not a front face shot creator like George and even Jackson has been.  I think Reggie Jackson deserves max contract just based on his last few games lol. He absolutely was the difference against Jazz.
"He wasn't 3 and D last year, but he was able to consistently hit wide open threes all playoffs for the Lakers. I'm not expecting him to be a Reggie Jackson type shooter obviously"
Lol keep thinking Booker got lucky hitting those tough shots like the Lakers. Meanwhile I expect Reggie Jackson and Mann to revert to their mean soon so yes I got the Suns
And you’ve proven you don’t know what you are talking about   Yes Reggie Jackson averaged 9.2 ASTs in 27 games after being traded to the Pistons   He averaged 6 on the year lmao
Oh really? You’re a dumbass if you think giving Lowry a large multi year contract at 36 is better value than Reggie Jackson right now at 30.
We needed Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson to hit their corner threes :/ PG drives were coming up empty too often
Reggie Jackson is super under rated around here. The guy tore Jazz apart.
give credit to reggie jackson for stepping up to be the 2nd option behind PG.  he keeps this up and clippers can make a strong push
that's Reggie Jackson to you sir
Maybe this is a hot take but Batum is the 3rd best player on that team once Reggie Jackson cools down from being unconscious(which who knows maybe it wont happen the rest of the postseason and he stays doing this).
Reggie Jackson outta gas
Reggie Jackson is a straight up NBA 2k Park Player
Where was this Reggie Jackson last series??
Nice finish Reggie Jackson
The duality of Reggie Jackson  Also the Suns are fucking legit
huge defensive play by ayton to force reggie jackson to make that pass
is reggie jackson a FA this summer?
"Man everyone was talking real loud about the bubble being a sham because Murray, booker, and warren got hot but fucking Reggie Jackson and Cam Payne are playing like steph curry"
Cam Payne vs Reggie Jackson who is the real GOAT
Lakers probably don’t want the hard cap that comes with a sign and trade either.   I think you’ll see them target guys like Reggie Jackson instead.
"Reggie Jackson is legitimately the best guard available in FA behind CP3 if he can continue playing like this. Problem is he has already gotten a max in Detroit and severely underperformed, is this the new Reggie or just a temporary hot streak?"
"If you had asked me before the playoffs who was going to be better: Reggie Jackson or Dennis Schroder, I would have been wrong"
As a Grizzlies fan I still have nightmares about Reggie Jackson lighting us up in the playoffs

Reggie Jackson lowkey being a floor general out here
There’s a difference between MJ and Reggie Jackson/ T-Mann but I see where you’re coming from lol
Plot twist: Clippers sign Reggie Jackson to a max while letting Kawhi walk
Has Reggie Jackson always been playing this good or he just turned a monster this postseason?
Kind of feels like this clips team is playing better without kawhi. PG is playing more free as a focal point which he hasn’t had since his indy days. Also helps that Reggie Jackson is stepping the fuck up and hitting his shots.
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; Russell Westbrook
Reggie Jackson is unbelievable
You just lost to Reggie Jackson
How does zubacs miss that lmao Atleast Reggie Jackson is playing like Zeke with a 3 rn
"Reggie ""Italian Stallion"" Jackson"
"It’s great to see Reggie Jackson finally showing his full potential these playoffs after the way Russ, KD and basically the whole Thunder organization went out of their way to try and stop him from shining on OKC. Reggie’s getting the last laugh rn"
How the fuck did Reggie Jackson happen?  Teams that sign these under the radar dudes that play like prime Klay Thompson are obviously going to be a problem.
Reggie Jackson is exceeding all our expectations
The Knicks are gonna overpay for reggie Jackson this summer and he’s never gonna play like this again. Just watch
Glasses Reggie Jackson is a bad motherfucker

Reggie Jackson needs a max contract
Reggie Jackson is a legit co star right now
Goggles Reggie jackson is a +10 to all attributes
Knicks gonna throw the bag at Reggie Jackson this off season.
So was Reggie Jackson just blind while playing in the NBA? Did someone not tell him he needed glasses?
"Dude I’m really liking the clips right now. Reggie Jackson going off, playoff P is back. Showing heart without Kawhi."

"He missed his rotation when Reggie Jackson drove a few possessions ago, but he's been rock solid on both ends overall."
Cameron Payne &amp; Reggie Jackson are both point guards who have come off the bench most of their career but can outplay a lot of starters
When did Reggie Jackson get so good? I remember him always being mediocre
Reggie Jackson gonna get paid dude
Nobody will convince me that Reggie Jackson **didn't** Space Jam someone for these playoffs

they're getting reggie jackson mismatched onto ayton but they dont involve him in the offense
DEANDRE HAS REGGIE JACKSON IN THE POST WHAT ARE YOU DOING

Who was supposed to be on Reggie Jackson? Because I promise you it wasn't Ayton  Edit: BOOKER WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING GUARDING ZUBAC UNDER THE BASKET WHEN AYTON IS ALREADY THERE?
Reggie Jackson might as well be Klay Thompson on offense out there man
Reggie Jackson has been a revelation this post season
Finals MVP Reggie Jackson
Has Reggie Jackson even had one bad game in the playoffs this year
Never knew Reggie Jackson was MJ
"You do realise that he’s gone to the locker room during half time &amp; has been helping scheme for the Suns coverages yeah?  Like PG, Ty Lue, Reggie Jackson iirc have all said he’s been helping them at HT &amp; been very engaged while on the road messaging coaches during the game passing on his analysis."
"While the clippers would be better, I don’t think Reggie Jackson would be playing nearly this well. He’s been on fire."
"I mean, look at the Clippers roster right now. Kawhi’s out. Morris is playing but clearly not healthy. Aside from Reggie Jackson, who else can create shots for this Clippers squad?"
Unbelievable Reggie Jackson slander. The man hasn’t even retired yet and his name is in a hall of fame.
"Be real, man. Playing with LeBron and AD is a better situation than playing with PG and...I don't know. Reggie Jackson won't be there next year. Zubac can't even play every series. Clippers have a lot of aging role players. That's not the issue. However, like you said, cap space is the issue.   To get Kawhi, the Lakers would have to have Leonard agree to a sign-and-trade and give up AD. On the surface, sure. But, does it really makes the Lakers better? LeBron can still be great, but he's at the point in his career where he needs a #2 that can stay healthy, can get his own basket and who has proven he can perform in the playoffs. AD only checks two of those boxes. But, if we're being honest, so does Kawhi."
He’s been the second or third best player on the Clips at least these last two games behind Reggie Jackson and George. He’s the only thing keeping Ayton close to in check.
Right but Kawhi would take shots away from someone. Reggie Jackson would probably suffer while Kawhi was on the court
"lol wat?  the review clearly showed Reggie Jackson reaching in and making contact with Booker's arms... the referees should have called a correction and gave the foul on Reggie.  That foul sent Booker to the bench, fouling him out."
Reggie Jackson has been absolutely unstoppable since Kawhi has gone down. Look at his stat lines.... just has been great.
Reggie Jackson: 15/3/3  PG: 24/9/6  Delusional boy
"Man I didn't get to watch this game, and I acknowledge that sometimes a game is about more than the boxscore - but Holy SHIT the suns shot 36% from the field on only 86 attempts and STILL WON. Booker and CP3 went TEN FOR FORTY and still won.  Given the above and also the fact that they are up 3-1, it's hard to imagine anything but a suns finals appearance at this point.  Have loved everything about this team all season long and I can't wait to see how they comport themselves on the biggest stage.  Clippers have also been amazing, gritty, and almost a complete 180 from Doc's team a year ago LOL, really impressed with Ty Lue, PG and Reggie Jackson.  Honestly can't wait for the finals regardless of who makes it! Haven't even mentioned the Hawks who are incredible for this stage in their development and have a bonified superstar at the helm.  Just an incredible all around postseason this year!! Grateful for it"
"Ya Reggie Jackson is the GOAT tbh. Once hes hot, theres no stopping him. 7'0 Wingspan PG demigod."
Don't forget they are beat the great Reggie Jackson... all skill.
"Actually, they made the right call on the wrong person... It should have been a shooting foul on Reggie Jackson, before Booker collided with Pat Bev, regardless if he was in defensive position or not. If they called it on reggie jackson for grabbing Bookers arm, then there wouldnt be a need for a challenge."
"Future is bright for the clippers, Terrence Mann is legit, and the team is deep. Only question is Reggie jackson this summer"
"PG was gassed.. but what I could not understand was why does he still have to chuck 3s.  Even Reggie Jackson, just chucking 3s so early in the shot clock?!?! There was that Suns timeout okay when CP3 lobbed for Ayton and got an easy basket. Why did Tyronn lue not do something similar?   I know hindsight is simple but I am feeling bummed man.. this is a great team with a great coach but just dropped 2 big games. ☹️"
"I agree with that take tbh... They called the wrong foul, and if it was a shooting foul in Reggie Jackson instead of a Blocking foul in Pat Beverly, then the challenge probabaly wouldn't have succeeded... Have seen the refs make makeup calls all series long.  Even the refs adjust when they know theyve made mistakes... Thats just a reality with referreing in general."
"Lmao, how the hell is Reggie Jackson is more blue collar than Kyle Lowry?           &gt;	superstar attitude.   Superstar attitude &gt; being an actual allstar apparently.            Kyle is also Jimmy Butler’s best friend."
"Remember the Pistons game when y’all played your scrubs, down 10 with 3 to go, and came back with a Reggie Jackson winning 3? Clippers got this trust"
"Not to mention we'll probably lose some big players on our current roster. Reggie Jackson is likely going to be given a sizeable contract by someone. No idea what sort of contract Batum garners, Beverley's probably traded and who knows what happens with Ibaka."
"Most teams need a third guy, it’s not easy to get them.  If Kawhi was playing, I doubt they would go 0-12 anyway, so Reggie Jackson can’t play that 2nd guy role."
"""We also spent 6 minutes looking at a Pat Beverly foul and failing to see the obvious Reggie Jackson foul first and then overturned the call."""
"Nah he's chill. PG and Reggie Jackson have been really great in post game interviews all playoffs, even in losses. They'd be pretty good studio guys."
Reggie Jackson has been amazing. But they really have zero offensive fire power.
"It has a chance, but right now it’s gotta be 2011. Kawhi, Kyrie, Butler, Klay, Kemba, Bogdanovic, Vucevik, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, etc."
"Cp3 since coming back : 11 - 41  Also conveniently forgot Ibaka lmao. Reggie Jackson has been playing better than CP3, let alone what Kawhi would've done. Just accept the fact that the suns are barely squeaking by the Clips without two of the starters."
"I just don't think Jackson has that grit in him like the Heat want. But, with Dragic's age and Oladipo possibly missing next season, he might secure the bag with them. Got to watch that attitude though. Miami doesn't play that me-first BS and Reggie can go off on his own."
If you a GM and paying Reggie Jackson purely off these games you dumb as hell
I don’t think Reggie Jackson is going to get paid as much as you think he will. Think to yourself as a fan: would you want your favorite team to be paying Reggie Jackson $18 million a year for the next 2-3 years?
reggie jackson’s been great this playoffs but giving up reggie jackson shots for kawhi leonard shots still seems like a great exchange for the clippers. plus reggie was doing this with kawhi playing
well they also missed a foul on reggie jackson in the same play booker got called for a charge on beverly
"reggie jackson was the only player in the game with more than one 3 pointer made, as he shot 2-9. geez louise what an ugly game"
"reggie jackson is wearing the googles to hide his true power, it might be time to unleash"
"At one point, Zubac was barking at Reggie Jackson for the ball. Can someone explain this to me? I don’t get why he was barking for it!"
He got carried by Reggie Jackson
Yeah but now he has an arguably better player then Bron in Reggie Jackson so I wouldn't count them out.
"They would acknowledge the action of these fouls without actually calling them fouls, instead they call it “good defense” “getting physical”. Nobody is talking about the no call on reggie jackson that took Booker out of the game. These announcers flat out acknowledged the foul and I guess they magically forgot about that at the end of the game. Nobody can say that having booker on the floor wouldn’t have increased yalls’ odds of winning. But these announcers wouldn’t acknowledge that.  Heck on the Cam Payne play, he was getting fouled blatantly regardless if the ball went off of him. They sure didn’t mention anything about that. Smh"
"They couldn't sweep us so no, that wasn't happening. Reggie Jackson just wouldn't be scoring as much"
They got calls down the stretch too. Booker fouled out on a Reggie Jackson foul. Free throws.
Booker fouled out on a play where Reggie Jackson reached in and held his arm. They reviewed it and overturned it. Was awful on both sides.
Refs hate Devin Booker.  His 5th and 6th fouls were bullshit and should have been on Reggie Jackson or a non call.
He and Reggie Jackson are holding down the Clippers honestly
Reggie Jackson was their best offensive player what
Bruh the Clippers got plenty of calls in the fourth. Too many calls if we’re being unbiased. Refs didn’t make PG not know how much time was on the clock and turn the ball over. Refs didn’t make PG miss free throws and differ to Reggie Jackson who shot like 9-21 or something like that. Let them keep crying Suns in 5.
Reggie Jackson but definitely not Demarcus Cousins
"Don't know why everyone is complaining about the low score. I felt it was just as intense as any other game, perhaps even more so since the value of each possession was greater. The fourth quarter felt like the fourth quarter of the 2020 All-Star game, but in a playoff environment.  You don't need to score *x* amount of points in a game, you just need to score more points than the other team to win, and winning is all that matters in the playoffs.  Also, these Clippers are growing on me. Especially Reggie Jackson, Ivica Zubac, and Terrance Mann."
Reggie Jackson is the destroyer of dreams
"he just said doubters of reggie jackson should apologise and say ""i'm sorry mr jackson"" that's quite funny ngl"
Reggie Jackson and Paul George combining for 13/44 from the field 3/18 from three that was hard to watch.
"Man that was tough to watch. Reggie Jackson is a real starting PG though hope he hits the spotlight in a big way soon, he deserves it."
Reggie Jackson standing around instead of boxing out CP3.
Honestly everyone was awful this game. Ayton and Reggie Jackson were the two best players in that game
why is reggie jackson standing there
reggie jackson 4 point shot to send it to OT
"The refs have been absolutely fucking atrocious tonight, particularly in the clutch.  First, Booker is clearly fouled by Reggie Jackson but they call an offensive foul.  Then, Mann is clearly hacked on a made layup.  Then, the ball goes off of Payne's hand.  Just awful officiating."
people here are hilarious acting like an out of bounds call robs the Clippers the game while Booker got fouled out because they decided to ignore Reggie Jackson fouling him
Foul on Reggie Jackson. He had his arm across Bookers body that whole drive
Booker got an offensive foul for a layup where Reggie Jackson fouled him. Makeup call FOH clippers fans.
Reggie Jackson is gonna send this to overtime
makeup non call for missing reggie jackson foul on booker.
Reggie Jackson is going to hit a 3
What about reggie jackson hacking him?
"I don’t understand why the obvious foul from Reggie Jackson was not called. Agree that Beverley got position, but it was after Book had already been fouled."
Refs can’t even see a Reggie Jackson shooting foul in super slowmo. Don’t expect too much.
"Nope, if they didn’t call the earlier Reggie Jackson foul on Booker, then they sure as hell won’t call this"
This and the out of bounds overturned call in game 2 just totally ruin the spirit of the original calls. Reggie Jackson fouled him before the charge even happened
How isn’t that contact on Reggie Jackson a foul?
Bruh. Is Reggie Jackson John Cena?
Hmm….Definitely feel like that should’ve become a foul on Reggie Jackson but okay
Reggie Jackson fouled him dude
reggie jackson fouled book
Can they change it to a foul on Reggie Jackson?
Is Reggie Jackson not fouling the entire time he’s driving? 😂
"If it's rigged for the Suns, foul on Reggie Jackson.  If it's rigged for the Clippers, foul on Devin Booker.  If it's not rigged, then we all have to accept that sometimes basketball games just don't go the way we want and that's not okay."
No big deal on Reggie Jackson fouling lol
Def foul on Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson fouled him before the charge
Foul on Reggie Jackson regardless of if it was charge or block
“Unless they say that Reggie Jackson fouled him first”… come on Jeff you know they’re calling this in the clippers favor.
"Looks like good positioning to me. We'll see if they give reggie jackson that foul but, come on, we know how it's going to go."
"even if that wasn’t a blocking foul on bev, Reggie Jackson definitely fouled him"
Reggie Jackson 100% fouled him
It’s a foul on Reggie Jackson before the charge guys
Pretty clear reggie jackson fouled him first
PG is a fake ass star. You have to run your offense through fucking Reggie Jackson because PG shys away from taking the hard shots
Why does Ayton not post up when Reggie Jackson is guarding him?
Please god don’t let Reggie Jackson take another shot
"&gt;I feel like Reggie Jackson should be the 1st option in the 4th, not PG  PG/Reggie Jackson have the same number of pts, PG just took a few more tougher shots, but he got to the lines 15 times, and grabbed 15 rebounds + 5 more assists.  DUDE is tired. So is Reggie Jackson. This has been a grueling series. I love it."
Could the Clippers maybe have another gameplan aside from having Reggie Jackson chuck up 3s and contested floaters like he's the franchise player smh
Reggie Jackson still complaining
who would’ve thought that the clippers’ dynamic duo would be Zubac and Reggie Jackson
Reggie jackson is returning back to his normal form
What a pathetic play by Reggie Jackson
Reggie Jackson wants to get paid
What’s with this Reggie Jackson hero ball shit?
I can imagine Reggie Jackson getting a BAG from a lot of teams
So Reggie Jackson just decided to peace out for 4 seasons and then decided to care about basketball again in these playoffs?
[Reggie Jackson is once again proving he's simply the best player in the league.](https://i.redd.it/x8isf15hpf371.jpg)
"Reggie Jackson like ""Y'all gonna pay me Mmm Mmmm *Mmmm*, y'all gonna pay me"""
Reggie Jackson is like the only likeable guy on the Clippers. Hope he gets a big contract with another team.
Glasses? on  Government? BIG  Reggie? Jackson
"""A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.""  -- Reggie Jackson"

When the fuck did Reggie Jackson decide to turn into Michael Jordan
"CP3 and Booker is incredibly overrated. Up 3-1, at home with a chance to make the finals you trail the entire game and let Reggie Jackson, an OKC reject wearing an undershirt and a mask dominate you in the 4th. Actually sad TBH."
