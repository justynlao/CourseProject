"This was 5+ years ago I think but someone actually ran the statistics, and IIRC Jeremy Lamb was the most statistically average player of all time."
"&gt;Not like he already had great teams around him, good enough to be up 3-1 on the warriors  They still traded their 3rd scorer and never replaced him with anything close to the level they needed. KD was always mad that it was just him and Russ doing everything, and I'm sure that shit got tiring.  After trading James Harden they tried to replace his production with Sefolosha, Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Reggie Jackson, Dion Waiters, Roberson, DJ Augistin etc."
jeremy lamb
"If I remeber 2k16 correct Jeremy fucking lamb and anthony Randolph run the league. Giannis is d league, and luka is 61 overall as a euro player it 17?"
"Not sure if you’re trolling or not. KD honestly might’ve went back to end it but the fans handled it so poorly it probably soured that idea for him. I understand losing a superstar sucks, but the dude still balled the fuck out for your team for 9 seasons and made OKC relevant. And if you want to be mad at anyone for him leaving, don’t forget that the front office traded JAMES FUCKING HARDEN for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and two picks."
"In hindsight, I'm glad we traded harden for jeremy lamb and Kevin martin."
Shabazz Napier   Kemba Walker   Jeremy Lamb
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
"OKC didn’t trade him for nothing. Jeremy Lamb was a decent prospect, Kevin Martin wasn’t washed up yet, and they got two first round picks. Not worth Harden, but they at least got something in return. It just didn’t work out so well."
"You're willfully ignoring my point.  It's not a ""convenience-for-my-argument-thing"" when you're talking about separating guys who are entering free agency all NBA and are going to make 30+ million dollars (like Kemba) and good role players who're going to sign for around mid level contracts. Kemba's contract was only going to fit in one of a couple places and even fewer places when you're talking about adding a $30 mil. salary to a team that's already competitive before you get there. Boston was able to make him fit because Kemba wasn't actually in free agency for very long, he signed and traded with Charlotte to go to Boston so Charlotte could get Rozier back.  The nature of the salary cap means max guys don't fit in as many places because they're signing for contracts with bigger numbers like JJ Reddick, Serge Ibaka, Kent Bazemore, Jeremy Lamb, etc. etc. A team with 2 young all stars like Boston has with Brown and Tatum *should* be attractive to these role players that could make a difference. These guys aren't signing with Boston though. And I have beach front property in Kansas to sell you if you think that these lower-mid guys aren't signing with Boston for any reason besides Ainge's history as a GM"
"Yes, and he only played there until he was 22 because the GM in question chose to trade him for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Alex Abrines and Mitch McGary (the final three being future  picks at the time of the trade)  If we're going to laud a GM for his picks and team-building ability, we should probably also consider their bad moves too.  Picks aren't everything."
Maybe I worded that weird. Just meant everyone in the locker room was kind of fed up with his shit. They moved his locker from next to KD and Westbrook to next to Jeremy Lamb and Perry Jones Lol
"They won't. But regardless of where those picks land, I don't trust Houston to draft well. That was just one example of poor drafting. Before taking Yao first overall, their next best draft pick was Sam Cassell in 1993 at 24... Then you have Rudy Gay (at 8, which is actually pretty good). Aaron Brooks (26th in 2007), Marcus Morris (14th in 2011), Mirotic (23rd in 2011), Jeremy Lamb (12th in 2012), Royce White (16th in 2012), Terrence Jones (18th in 2012) (They had 3 picks, 1 lotto and 2 just out and Lamb is decent and the other two didn't last long in the NBA), Capela (25th overall in 2014, which was decent but not really franchise-altering).Martin was drafted by the Kings, and I'm not quite sure the circumstances. Was he taken knowing that the Rockets were going to acquire him?  It makes sense to judge them because we already know how good Simmons is. You're wagering that a front office with a poor draft record over the last 20+ years is going to do something with those late first round picks. You're being optimistic hoping that those three superstars opt out and leave Brooklyn, an organization that's been on an upswing over the past 5 or so years.  I appreciate the optimism, but it's objectively a worse trade than any package involving Simmons because you have guaranteed All-Star talent. Drafting at almost any position is a tough wager, and hopefully some of those guys pan out, but I would be a little worried that they don't. I also think Simmons, at age 24, could have been a pretty valuable trade piece in the future if Houston decided to move him. He's a #1 overall pick."
...Jeremy lamb?
No question Jeremy Lamb
You motherfuckers (Jeremy Lamb specifically) stole a 60 win season from us
*ghost of Jeremy Lamb smiles from rafters*
"Regardless of your opinion on Turner the point is if Boston had accepted a Turner trade they'd have to give up less assets for a Barnes trade.  There was no way an asking price of Oladipo + Turner was going through - it would've probably been something like Oladipo and Jeremy Lamb. So a Harrison Barnes trade would've been Turner + salary match + a first round pick.   The salary match in that case could've been someone expendable like Semi versus instead of someone like Nesmith/Langford. On top of that, you'd have whatever extra guy you'd get back from the Indiana trade."
They'll start them both eventually. Caris is more of a 2/3 and TJ more of a 3/4. Jeremy Lamb will most likely be the first wing off the bench once Caris is back to full minutes.
I mean Jeremy lamb killed us too from behind half court
Tony Snell is the new Jeremy Lamb
"Gerald Henderson, Jeremy Lamb, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Paul Pierce. What a weird group. I’m sure I’m forgetting some names"
Jeremy Lamb kills the hawks too lmao
The Jeremy Lamb of the Hawks
"Tony Rudy ""Jeremy Lamb"" Gay Snell"
"Move over Jeremy Lamb, there's a new Raptor killer in town"
"Tony ""Jeremy Lamb"" Snell"
they traded for Jeremy Lamb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This had me so confused because I thought I missed some random trade from the Pacers. We have a Kelan Martin and Jeremy Lamb... I was like wtf did we make another move with Houston?
Jeremy lamb has the goat game winner
"Didn't think there would be anyone else more trash on the court than Jeff Teague today, but Jeremy Lamb is proving me wrong"
"The thing is he does a lot of little things on the court too. He's an absolutely fantastic screen-setter and appears to do many things to free up open shots for teammates. Even when digging into what everyone on Indiana does, I think Sabonis is the best player. Brogdon also has a negative +/- and Turner has been negative the past two years, before being positive now.  Another thing to remember is that Indiana is one of the deepest team in the league  when healthy. Even with Warren and Levert injured, their bench has TJ McConnell, Jeremy Lamb, and Doug McDermott. Probably why for the most part, they will have lot of players near even."
Jeremy Lamb
Last year there were 28 players over 40% from 3 with George Hill at 46% at #1. So far this year there are 53. 8 players are shooting better than 46%. Joe Harris is at 50.5%. Jeremy Lamb and Bobby Portis are at 50%.
"52 players are shooting &gt;= 40% from 3 this year. Thats over 11% of the players in the league at any given time and the least anyone in that group has attempted is 64, but thats Jeremy Lamb who has only played 17 games. Then you have another 28 shooting within 2% of that. And less than half those guys are consistent starters.   That 80 players (~18% of the league) at 38%+ with over 24 of them who have started less than 10 games this year and many more between that 10-18 range which would still make them role players (minus the guys that are there due to injury). I don’t think lockdown bench defense is easier to find"
"Jeremy Lamb looks like he's on the other side of a crank bender, my god."
Why does Jeremy lamb look like he hasn’t slept in 4 months wtf
"Oladipo traded for no one(levert hasn’t played). Warren hasn’t played, Jeremy lamb missed a bunch of games. And let’s oladipo was no where near an all star when playing and I think he missed a couple games too"
"Pacers dealt with a lot too. Missed almost 50 games from their starters, levert issue, oladipo dead trade, 6th man Jeremy lamb missing a bunch of games, warren whose a top 4 scorer has yet to play."
I mean you're acting like it's crazy but players get fucked up by botched chase-downs. It's how Danny Green took out Klay and how Terence Davis fucked up Jeremy Lamb. Not saying they should be banned but they can very easily end up in injury.
"&gt; Pacers have 47 missed games from their starters  ORL has missed 80 games from their starters.  &gt; Aaron holiday whose their 6th man misses several games too  Holiday has been healthy all year (29/29 GP), you're probably thinking of Jeremy Lamb.   Still nowhere close to the MASH unit down in ORL, where they've had to start Dwayne Bacon 20 times."
Jeremy Lamb clutch shot against Raptors.
Jeremy Lamb over the raptors. So many disappointed fans with their hands on the head.  https://youtu.be/5xvxWEx0sK8
Why does Jeremy lamb look like he was just gangbanged?
"Jeremy Lamb is a Pacer now, not a Hornet, so nothing to worry about."
"Wait, we would get notorious Raptors destroyer Mike Scott in the deal?  We just need to get Jeremy Lamb and we'll be unbeatable."
That 60 win season's elusive as fuck.  2017-18: 59 wins  2018-19: 58 wins (we were 2 Jeremy Lamb game-winners away)  2019-20: The season is shortened in what seemed like our best chance to get 60 wins.
"Lamb, Lost it, has to fireeeeeeeee  OH MY GOD!!! JEREMY LAMB WINS IT!! UNBELIEVABLE!  (so sorry I had to)"
"Wrong. Jeremy Lamb is, I know because I have him on my fantasy team lmao"
Add Jeremy Lamb.
Jeremy Lamb and Ish Smith. Payton Pritchard is gonna join the list pretty soon.
The raptor game maybe? Idk but i just remember that jeremy lamb hit like a buzzer beater from half court
Jeremy Lamb is the current raptor killer
"Jeremy Lamb looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks, dude needs a nap"
Right - No matter what insane numbers Giannis puts up he wont be anywhere near the MVP because the media gets tired of the same person. I got shit on when I said this last year.   Wrong - I thought Jeremy Lamb was done after his injury.....Thought Jamal Murray was going to be the next big thing i still dont understand how he was playing like the bubble and now hes just a regular person again.
Jeremy Lamb should be on a contender somewhere
Jeremy Lamb in shambles
I thought Jeremy Lamb would be a Klay Thompson like player and be a terrific third star in OKC when the Rockets traded him. Boy was I wrong. Overestimated his shooting ability and didn't consider how his body type lacked functional strength.  He looked awesome his freshman year at UCONN. So smooth.
Homer take but the Pacers have a very underrated bench when healthy  PG: Brogdon / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell   SG: LeVert / Jeremy Lamb  SF: TJ Warren / Justin Holiday  PF: Sabonis / Doug McDermott  C: Turner / Goga  Goga's the only raw guy.
Where the fuck did Jeremy Lamb come from to be putting up these numbers? God damn
I'm really happy for Jeremy lamb making it back from the injury the way he has. honestly he seems totally forgotten about.
We look like trash; there isn't much more to say about it lmao.  Jeremy Lamb ISOs hurt my brain.
"NBA 2k14 killer right here. Ty Lawson, Jarrett Jack, Rodrigue Beaubois, and Jeremy Lamb the squad right there"
"I mean, I think sometimes teams just get hot. We shot abnormally well against y'all and then turned around and got 16 of 29 dumped on our heads. When Jeremy Lamb is launching deep heat check threes that drop you know it isn't your night."
Jeremy Lamb guarding Kyle Anderson. Slo Mo vs Slower Mo.
Jeremy Lamb is not bad and is in that draft too.
Zach Lowe has said this for years now that the $$ and them not giving him like $5 mil more on his contract is oversold as the reason why he got dealt from OKC.   This situation certainly didnt help and like Lowe had said the word had been that the intel on Harden that OKC gathered during his time there wasnt stellar. Nothing serious but stuff that just added up over time. But probably the biggest thing was they just didnt think he was ever that amazing and never foresaw this. At the time they thought that Kevin Martin could give them like 75-80% of what Harden did and they really liked Jeremy Lamb. That was at the end of the day what drove the trade.   It's a sliding scale really. How much you are willing to put up with stuff you dont like about a player is dependent on how good you think he is.
Jeremy lamb for his game winner
"They had a fluke finals appearance last year after beating the Pacers without Sabonis and Oladipo coming off injury along with no Jeremy Lamb. Then, beat an injured Milwaukee team, where shocker, Bledsoe and everyone besides Middleton shit the bed once again. They then played the Celtics who lost by 3, 5, 3, 12, with a hurt Hayward. Cakewalk to the Finals where they were exposed as the frauds they are."
Norman Powell must strike the same kind of fear into Bucks fans that Jeremy Lamb does to us
I believe the last time we had two exciting rookies was Terrence jones and Jeremy lamb and maybe even Royce white
"You have to factor in that it was guaranteed that Oladipo was going to be out last season, so it didnt even matter. Its not like the team expected him to be there and suddenly he wasnt. He was always going to miss those games. This years injuries are unexpected and the team has to work around them with the exception of Jeremy Lamb. That would be my argument for why this year has been worse"
Jeremy Lamb and Ish Smith
"Terry Rozier, Jeremy Lamb and that’s all that matters."
Hell of a game by Jeremy Lamb.
"Well, there’s Kobe, LeBron, Steph, maybe Vince Carter the way he did them dirty  Shoutout to Jeremy Lamb too"
"Every single game it seems like some random is going off, but the one that comes to mind over the past couple of seasons is Jeremy Lamb. Dude was hitting half court shots on us like they were nothing."
"Wait, Jeremy Lamb played? Nice."
"The man, the myth, the legend Jeremy fuckin Lamb."
"Where did the info come from about Jeremy Lamb being from Henrico, Virginia? Looking at his Wikipedia page, nothing about Virginia is mentioned anywhere, and being from Henrico, i feel like i would have heard about him being a local because we sure as shit hear about every other athlete who's from around here every God damn day!"
"We can’t even go 5 games without another injury to one of our main guys. 13 games in and we are already down: Victor Oladip: (traded for Caris Levert), Caris Levert: Out for an indefinite amount of time due to a mass on his kidney. TJ Warren: has been out all but I think 3 or 4 games and won’t be back for the next 2 months or more. Jeremy Lamb: Out since last year with a torn ACL, he should be returning soon. And now the latest one, Myles Turner(leading shot blocker in the league and a top 2-3 candidate for DPOY): fracture in his hand, out anywhere from a couple weeks-?              We literally can’t EVER stay healthy long enough to see how great we could be. Our top 8-9 guys can stand up to any teams 8-9 guys but we can’t ever see it because multiple players are hurt at the same time"
"We don’t have LeVert, TJ Warren, Jeremy Lamb, Myles Turner"
Jeremy lamb
Pat Bev getting in my head on how he’s talking trash to our team down 3 starters and Jeremy Lamb lol.
"Pacers are definitely top 5 in the East. Fun fact: we’re 3-0 without Dipo and 5-4 with him. Our flow is actually much better when he’s not playing. Not having the extra body will hurt, but we should have Jeremy Lamb back in the next couple of games."
Jeremy Lamb returning will be huge for them...that defense is impressive either way though
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ I summon the ghost of Jeremy Lamb ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."
"2k14's still pretty solid for me lol. It does mean I have a hella outdated sense of NBA players though.  ""Where'd Jeremy Lamb end up? Dude's a *beast*"""
"The framework of a deal was in place, Simmons and Thybulle were expecting to be dealt. If the Rockets had asked for Maxey in September, the deal would've gone without a hitch. For Simmons and Thybulle to expect a trade, and then at the last moment Maxey needed to be included or the deal was off, just smells fishy. You can say a lot of things about Morey but he's no fool. This would be like if Morey refused to include Jeremy Lamb in the original Harden deal. Young players are cool and all but stars are the only thing that matters in the NBA. Morey of all people knows this."
I remember that Jeremy Lamb game winner. Now that was an insane shot
"I'm inclined to agree with you. For what it's worth, both Caris and Vic aren't great from 3-point land. I'm also worried about Caris' defense (although we did wonders with TJ Warren).   Finally, the best games he's had is where he's had the ball in his hands with the greenlight to run the offense and I'm worried he won't get that in the starting lineup. Do we run him as a super sixth man once Jeremy Lamb and TJ Warren return?  There's part of me that would've liked to run the gamble with Vic getting back to form because I do think Caris is a solid player but worse than Vic. I completely understand why we did this move though."
Jeremy Lamb
"Bubble MJ, Jeremy Lamb, and GOATga. I can go on and on."
"You really gotta look at this from the perspective of 2012. Even then this is still not a great take, but it's a lot more reasonable than people are making it out to be.  Kevin Martin had been a borderline all star level player for several seasons, from 2007-2011 he averaged 22.4 points per game on 60% true shooting. He had a relatively down year in 2012, but he was still only 28 and the Thunder were ready to contend right then. Jeremy Lamb was a lottery pick a few months earlier and was an extremely recognizable prospect as he had been the number two guy on a championship just a year earlier his freshman year.   These guys were not viewed as scraps like they are today, the perspective at the time was they were getting a player who could at least somewhat replicate Harden's production in the short term in Martin, a pretty decent prospect in Lamb, and two future firsts. Obviously with hindsight we know that Martin's 2012 wasn't just an anomaly and instead the start of his decline, Lamb never amounted to much until several years after he had left OKC, and that Harden immediately was an All NBA player.  As someone in that thread put it too, compare *that* return to the package Dwight Howard, a legit top 3 player in the league who was 26 years old, fetched just a few months earlier."
&gt; Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin for a fucking 6th man?   Never heard those names before.
Lol that's def hindsight 20-20 talk. Kevin Martin was 1 season removed from 23PPG on 60% TS and Jeremy Lamb was a lottery pick.
"&gt;OKC is getting away with robbery here. Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin for a fucking 6th man? Why?? This pisses me off so much, and I'm not even a Rockets fan.  Some people need to watch games before they try to speak with this confidence."
I wish Jeremy lamb was here to hit a buzzer beating game winner
OKC has little value to him. Didn't wanna pay him and thought they could replace his production with Kevin fucking Martin and Jeremy Lamb. His home is Houston. He's led the team for years and we were the first to go all-in on him.
"The Rockets didn't develop Harrell (7 pts, 3 reb avg in HOU) or Morris (2 pts, 1 reb avg in HOU).  And Jeremy Lamb never even played for the Rockets. That's like saying the Pacers developed Kawhi."
"""Caleb Martin is the next Jeremy Lamb"" - JB probably, as he force feeds him 35 minutes"
"Clint Capella,  Montrez Harrell, Jeremy Lamb, Marcus Morris, all in the past 10 years"
Jeremy Lamb 😩
"McDermott, The Holidays, and Jeremy Lamb are pretty good ""6th mans"" to have."
"smdh disrespecting Jeremy Lamb, the centerpiece of that deal"
They'll be very good when they get TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb back. Caris Levert is going to fit in nicely. I think Oladipo had some chemistry issues. He still thought he was the man even though he wasn't. Malcolm Brogdon is officially the leader of this team now.
"Wait is your math off or something. from 2024 to 2027 I expect the Nets to be picking in the Top 10. We control their picks every one of those years. That’s 4 years of lottery picks at least. If the expectation for the Rockets was to turn around and compete right away with the return from this trade that was never gonna happen. It’s gonna be a long time till the rockets are back in championship contention. But this deal was far from getting fleeced. Getting fleeced is trading James Harden for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and Cole Aldrich."
LOL Not really. This is Jeremy Lamb trade all over again. At least Rockets got 9 years out of Harden. Still fleeeced
"Oklahoma City for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and two first round picks  It’s why Presti got all those picks, to get Harden back"
Thank you Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb for the last few years
"If those cheap bastards just went into the luxury tax for harden they would be one of the greatest teams ever. Three mvps just entering their prime.  But na, Jeremy lamb time"
"Mike Scott, Jeremy Lamb"
When is Jeremy Lamb coming back? I feel like he’d help with the bench depth
Jeremy Lamb memes probably
I doubt Presti wanted to trade Harden for Jeremy Lamb. Ownership is who makes the luxury tax call.
"I'd love to see Kardiac Kemba go off when it counts again. But is that the role the C's want him in? I see him on this team being a 2nd/3rd option along with Brown and Tatum as the man.  Kemba had to take over at Uconn, a freshman Jeremy Lamb wasn't really helping. And had to take over in Charlotte, but he needs to find his role here"
"-I thought we were talking about the regular season finishing order so I don't think one teams ability to step up in the playoffs is pertinent  -Yeah, they swept the Pacers with the Pacers' best player not playing in any of those games, with a worse coach, and with Oladipo playing like a shell of himself.  Oh, and with no Jeremy Lamb.  Sure, the Pacers finishing 6th or 7th or 8th (lol who is going to pass them to make them finish 8th???) are possiblities but I think the info we have to work with right now points at the most likely outcome being that they finish somewhere in the 3-5 range, maybe 2nd or 6th."
"&gt; So really only Toronto and the Wizards are the two that will be noticeably worse than the Pacers.  I mean...it's possible but I'm not really sure how you can just declare this  -The Bucks are probably going to be better than the Pacers, sure  - I honestly think the Nets are the best of the rest and with KD looking stellar in his return, I think it's very likely they are a top 2 seed once the pieces really have time to gel  But beyond that???  -Sixers are the team I think are next in line, honestly.  I would put them over the Pacers at the moment but at the same time, the Pacers were a better team last year in terms of standings and now they have gained more back in health than the Sixers, iirc, and are clearly an improved team from last season when they placed ahead of Philly.  Philly is improved too and like I said, I think the Sixers would be my pick for third, but you certainly can't make a confident statement on why either team will place higher at this point  -Celtics are pretty good and could easily be a top 3 or even top 2 seed but like...the Pacers almost beat them 2 out of 2 times head to head this season (yes you could say the Celtics almost won both games as well but still).  Kemba will be out a while and this team is less balanced than the Pacers otherwise.  Once again, another team i miiiight put over the Pacers but I think they are squarely on the same tier as the Pacers and the Sixers and maybe the Nets.  As for the rest?  -Let's not forget that the Pacers finished ahead of a pretty healthy Heat team last season.  And what happened since then?  The Pacers got a new coach that dramatically overhauled the team's style of play, Victor Oladipo came back and looks like a borderline all-star for the first time since early 2018, Jeremy Lamb is due back, and the Heat...stayed pretty much the same?  The Heat had a great run in the bubble but I think the bubble favors a great shooting team like them.  I'm more inclined to look at the regular season where the Pacers  finished ahead of the Heat with no good verison of Oladipo and very little Lamb (albeit with more TJ Warren but still, he won't be out that long and it's a net positive in terms of injuries) and coach who appears to have the team playing better than last season.  At the very, very least, I don't see why the Heat are definitely above the Pacers at all.  -I get you have to be a loyal supporter of your Hawks and probably watch their games and know what they're capable of but...yeah I see no currently discernible reason why we should expect any reasonable likelihood of them finishing above the Pacers barring injury.  Especially when their losses thuss far includes the likes of the Hornets, Cavaliers, and the Knicks, 2 of whom the Pacers already beat handily.  Sneaky team but really no reason to expect them to JUMP an improved Pacers team"
"Are the results not significantly better too?  It's a small sample size but they have improved from 19th to 4th in Offensive Rating, while only dropping from 6th to 11th in defensive rating, and that's with Aaron Holiday playing a lot more minutes and TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb, better defenders last season and this one, playing less due to injuries.  All told, the difference in net rating this season is over 7 (good for 4th in the league), while that number last season was under 2, good for only 13th.  Sabonis is having a career year, Brogdon is having a career year, Turner is having a career year, Justin Holiday is having a career year, and Oladipo is playing the best he has since before the injury.  I'm not sure where you are getting these ""11th"" numbers from?  EDIT: I see now that I'm looking at adjusted rating, which takes into account opposing defenses, which to this point, the Pacers have played several of.  Even so, our unadjusted net rating is 6th in the league at over 6, compared 12th in the league at just over 2 last season."
"Even with the success the Pacers have had, TJ Warren only played 4 games injured and is out indefinitely, and Jeremy Lamb has yet to return from his injury last season"
"TJ Warren is having surgery and Doug McD just twisted his ankle last night and lord only knows where Jeremy Lamb is so...hopefully but lord it is it frustrating  If we underperform this year in playoffs this could be it for this squad. Dipo, Doug, and TJ McConnell are all on contract years and Warren and Lamb both will be next year"
"I'm one of the biggest fans you will meet. I want, desperately, to believe this, but losing TJ Warren was big. This team does struggle to score at times, and Brogdon is playing above his head right now. Oladipo is still trying to find the player he was two years ago.      But it is possible. Jeremy Lamb should return this season, who is another ball handler and long defender with the ability to score (assuming he is 90-95% of who he was before his knee injury, and supposedly Warren has a chance to return this season, also.      If Turner is a legit defensive player of the year candidate, Sabonis and Brogdon continue their All Star level play, and Oladipo finds consistency, this team will be a very tough out no matter who they play."
"A stellar performance from Malcolm Brogdon, who is playing like an All Star these last few games. Vic didn't have a great shooting night but he was still aggressive and made the effort on offense. Myles Turner continued his epic defensive run to start the season with 8 blocks, including a clutch collab block with Sabonis in the last minute of the game which helped us seal the win.   The Pacers were able to weather the storm each time the Rockets were able to close the gap after the Pacers had built a lead. John Wall was unstoppable, and he got to the rim with ease all night and was getting basically any layup he wanted. This surely would have been a different game if not for Harden's frankly terrible (by Harden standards) performance. There was no aggression from him and he took very few of those stepback threes you expect to see him take, although he did finish with 12 assists. We had 3 or 4 guys defending him all night, so those different defensive looks may have confused him or disrupted his scoring game, but I think he just didn't have it going for whatever reason last night. The Rockets bench also played very poorly.   The Pacers' biggest issue right now is rebounding. They are not a good rebounding team, and they especially give up way too many offensive boards. That is not sustainable for the season and isn't a playoff-winning formula, so they will have to get that sorted out. The Pacers rebounded better against the Rockets, but they played a team which is also a bad rebounding team, and the Rockets also used a small-ball lineup all night which may have had something to do with the Pacers' better rebounding performance.   All in all, things are going really well for the Pacers at the moment. They're winning games, and they're doing it while still missing some key players in TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb. Doug McDermott, who has been really productive at times for us, also went out injured on Wednesday. Despite our injuries, our starters are lighting it up with great performances, bolstered by role players stepping up on any given night, like Justin Holiday, who finished with 20 points last night."
Jeremy Lamb against the Raptors is easily the craziest game winner ever
"Remember Morey got James Edward Harden jr. for what?  Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb,  and 2x FRP."
"Robin Lopez is the classic Scott Brooks ""let's play the washed up vet over the unproven young guys"" like playing 40 years old Derek Fisher over Jeremy Lamb and Kendrick Perkins over Steven Adams"
"Cause three years later Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Martin and a couple late first round picks (even one that becomes Steven adams) looks weak compared to the leading scorer in the league. So they’d rather wait it out and maximize the return"
Prince + a few mins work to meet the necessary salary range. People forget we’re paying Prince 12m/year. You only need to hit like 15m to match.  Sixers could do the same with Danny Green who makes 15.5m. Danny Green + Mike Scott = 20m.  Pacers could do Jeremy Lamb + Doug McDermott as filler.  Suns could do Dario Saric + Jae Crowder or one of them + Jalen Smith + a few mins
Is he the same guy to call the Jeremy lamb shot?
fuckin Jeremy Lamb
"Also... ""allegedly fleeced"".   How was trading guys on the verge of retirement for two perennial All-Stars not a fleece?  Like does KD signing with Brooklyn mean that 37-year-old Garnett is now a better asset than 22-year-old Tatum?  Maybe she means Boston would rather have 36-year-old Pierce instead of 24-year-old Brown?  The Warriors have a better record than us right now so I guess that means they won the 1980 trade where we swapped Joe Barry Carroll for Robert Parish and Kevin Mchale.  OKC actually won when they traded James Harden for Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams."
"Also, could be an amazing year for lottery teams that have had shit luck (Detroit, Orlando). I searched up the past draft picks for the rockets... the last lottery pick for Houston? Jeremy Lamb, in 2012, pick 12. They haven't even selected a guy in the first round since 2015, where they got Sam Dekker."
"As a raps fan, i cant even watch the Jeremy Lamb half court game winner against us. I know this shot makes Sixers fans sick to their stomach"
"Which ones specifically?  Jerami Grant developed in okc from a end of the bench guy to a starting power forward. Terrance Ferguson had a decent sophomore season and then fell off a cliff after Russ left.   Most of the other ""young guards and wings"" didn't really amount to much after playing with Russ so idk how that would be hampering their growth vs. Just be bad. Perry Jones III - not in the league, Huestis - not in the league, Roberson - developed into an all nba defender but couldn't shoot, Jeremy Lamb - I guess he's fine but like meh the Thunder gave up on him for a reason, Alex Abrines - not in the league, Cam Payne -  having a renaissance with the Suns but his broken foot is what hampered his growth.   I would list any young young guards or wings from the rockets last year but there weren't any. So who is the young guard or wing that has been hampered by Westbrook?"
I wonder what impact he would have on a team like the raptors. Maybe some crazy game winners and losing to Jeremy lamb and dj Augustin who knows
"This has to be higher up. WB had what, 1 elite scorer teammate on each variation of the roster (PG, KD, Harden) and the rest were pretty much okay role players (at the time) that didn't really compliment WB's playstyle at all. E.g. non-shooters like Roberson, or during the Rockets tenure, who probably had the most complimentary players next to Russ, but they had no true big after Capella left even tho one of Russ's main weapons on the offensive end is the PnR into the lob. Other examples are Kyle Singler, Reggie Jackson, Jeremy Lamb, etc.  What WB needed next to him to get maximum efficiency from him were lots of shooters (for his kick-out drives), and an athletic big who can be a defensive anchor in the paint and is a huge lob threat for the PnR action. Not people like Schroeder, who also needed the ball to be effective, or Terrance Ferguson who is an inconsistent 3pt shooter at best. He needed 3pt specialists like Kyle Korver to make up for his lack of pressure on the perimeter."
"Bro if you can get Jeremy Lamb looking at you like that, you should probably shut up and walk away."
"I mean would you tank with Oladipo, Brogdon, Sabonis, Warren, Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb, and then later Levert"
"This is such an odd video.  Like this guy is going in on him.    Even other players like jeremy lamb come in like ""u better calm tf down man"".  He's not even the head coach.  Like you would think goga insulted his mother or something."
Respect to Jeremy Lamb for standing up for his teammate.
They could get a huge return for each of there players.  Caris LeVert.  Malcom Brogdon.  TJ Warren.   Sabonis.  Myles Turner.  Jeremy Lamb.
Lol Jeremy lamb was looking at him like “ who raised you ? What the hell is wrong with you ?” Lmao
Yeah Jeremy lamb was just like stfu bro lol
Except for Jeremy Lamb
Poor Jeremy Lamb just trying to calm the coach down/stand up for his teammate and he gets a mouthful.
Jeremy lamb didn’t like that at all ... coach looked out of control .. not a good look for them at all
My favorite is Jeremy Lamb with that “damn you’re outta your mind right now” look on his face at 0:40.
Jesus how many buzzer beaters does Jeremy lamb have goddamn
"Holy shit that's a huge paragraph.  &gt; I really don't think it took hindsight to see that the core and not the coach was the reason for the mediocrity.  Uh, no. This is still wrong. You've just exposed the fact that you've never watched the Pacers properly.  Of course, if you give any team LeBron, they're probably going to the finals. Nate was an incredibly mediocre coach. No rotations, no mid-game changes, no time given to young players, Turner had no place in Nate's game, bad timeouts, no passion, ""we just gotta execute"" every post-game interview, ISO offense every possession, no 3s taken at all, no ball movement, a collapse every 3rd quarter.  Another point, no one cares about the first round exits. We cared that we got swept over and over. Last year's Heat were pretty weak, they weren't in a groove going into the playoffs and we had a super hot Bubble Warren. We may not have had Sabonis but as we perform best with only Turner, it shouldn't matter. Spo made adjustments all game, because he's a great coach, and countered everything Nate did all game. You know what Nate adjusted? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The same lineups at the same timings every game, the same offense, the same defensive style, etc. and it fucked us. The series was predicted to be 6-7 games.  And no, don't bring up the Bucks, after a rough performing series they really kicked it up a notch against Milwaukee.  Reminder that even the Magic won a game against the Bucks.  &gt; coaches criticised the firing. They don't come out often and say that.  [Yeah, coaches totally don't always back up other coaches, I bet it's not even notable or a well known fact.](https://twitter.com/ByTimReynolds/status/1366542471505846278?s=20)  &gt; Every team has injury troubles this year  Before Oladipo was traded, we played 4 games of a full starting lineup. 4 starters, and 3 whenever Oladipo was out, possibly less. Caris was out, recovering from cancer, over 24 games (officially) as a Pacer. That's 3 starters for over a quarter of a season. Since Caris has started playing, we've had 3 starters out 6 times and 2 starters out 7 times. We've even had only Caris being uninjured once.  Don't forget the injuries to Jeremy Lamb and Doug McDermott, who are meant to be leading our bench.  Out of the last 23 games (games Caris has played), we've had every starter but TJ Warren 9 times. That's 14 games of injured starters."
"I mean Brogdon/Caris/Warren/Sabonis/Turner isn’t a bad starting lineup by any means   But... Warren out for the whole season, Caris out for over a month (joined late but they had dipo before), turner out for over a month (huge for their defense) with players like jeremy lamb just coming back as well  I don’t know if it’s time yet, caris and sabonis hypothetically should get better, maybe they flip turner or warren if anything though"
7 years of unprotected picks is a lot bette than Jeremy lamb and Steven Adam’s
"Jeremy Lamb already hit a shot like that, and won the game lol. I mean, he was closer but still..."
Had that shot went through it'd be par with Jeremy Lamb and Devin Harris' GW's.
"Bro, exactly. I got back into basketball partially from playing 2k11 with my brother. I was always the bench mob Bulls but I only played Brewer or Korver at SG pre-rip. Brewer at least had his defense, Bogans the Ultimate Irrelevant. Honorable Mentions- Dante Exum, Thabo Sefolosha, Jeremy Lamb, Andrea Bargani"
"If it’s against the Raptors, Jeremy Lamb"
Uh....since when does Jeremy Lamb play power forward? Wasn't he drafted at SG?
Would a Kemba for Malcolm Brogdon/Jeremy Lamb work? The Celtics could through in a pick
"I like Jeremy Lamb vs Raptors. But might not be as good as this one, idk"
"Lmfao I’m not backtracking, it’s clearly Jeremy Lamb"
jeremy lamb is at 96% but a little shy of the min fta
"Westbrook last year, Chris Paul this year.   People act like Chris Paul replacing Rubio was magic, but if CP3's backcourt mate was like, Jeremy Lamb instead of Book the Suns would be where they were.  And they weren't even bad last season, Book ""on his own"" won one less game than Dame."
"""Sir we've got three rising stars whose rookie contracts are up soon. What do we do?""  ""Uhhh...Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb are good, right?"""
"When you have the best steals guy in the league, the best shot blocker, Domantas Sabonis being a legit all star caliber player, 6th in the league in points per game while 2nd in assists, 2K legend Jeremy Lamb, and you STILL have a losing record in the Eastern conference?!  Yeah you gettin fired."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Jeremy Lamb
"Kevin Martin and the picks that became Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams.   What has gotten lost to history is that Harden had to be traded because the owners were cheap. They could have been able to afford Harden had they not traded Jeff Green for Kendrick Perkins, who was given a very fat contract extension to be basically unplayable. That trade was the beginning of the end for OKC.   In an alternate universe they don't make that trade, they extend Harden and win a couple of titles."
"You mean how he kept his job, Steven adams and Jeremy lamb ?"
"That's exactly how markets work. No one was ever getting absolutely ridiculous hauls with 5 years of picks for stars players until the Anthony Davis trade set a new market. Andrew Bynum a first and a second were enough to land Dwight Howard.  Houston got Harden for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two firsts and two seconds. Kyrie went to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Ante Zizic and a first. The crazy pick heavy trades for PG, Westbrook and Harden only came after the AD trade set the market. It isn't a reach to think that teams may have been overvaluing and that the market may correct itself based on another trade."
I think they really need a Jeremy lamb. And i happen to know where they could find one.
Jeremy Lamb bc he fucking carried on 2k with his shooting when he was on the thunder
"They are just emulating big personalities of the recent past like Jeremy Lamb, Jeff Teague and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson."
Based off this video alone I assume that Jeremy Lamb is one of the most clutch players in the NBA
"Yeah, I always half joke with the Harden trade because back then, it looked like a reasonable trade with the situation we were in. While Kevin Martin was not as good as Harden, it looked like enough for a team that made it to the finals the year before. Harden was good, but him becoming the player he is today is on another level.  It is unfortunate how badly it worked for OKC from Kevin Martin’s regression, Jeremy Lamb not panning out, Adams being an old fashioned center at the worst time, McGary’s weed problems, Abrines with his mental health, and our playoff luck with injuries and that 2016 choke. Now compare that with how good Harden became and it sets up the franchise for the “worst trade in history”.  If Harden stayed, we could have had more success but he might not become the player he is today."
"I know, imagine if the team traded Harden for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and a late lottery pick instead 😂"
Jeremy lamb Rodrigue Beaubois and Ty Lawson are like the father son and Holy Ghost on that game
honest to god KD and Westbrook would have a combined 10 shots while Jeremy Lamb jacks up 20 threes a game
How much is Jeremy Lamb getting paid?
2k14 Jeremy Lamb was the funniest thing ever. Every single time I played the thunder Lamb always took the most shots.
2k14 jeremy lamb
Or Jeremy Lamb. Not that impactful but gotta make the injury list longer so our win looks that much more impressive
"well the pacers are missing tj warren, myles turner, jeremy lamb, and caris levert. Theres no sugarcoating it we just suck and we choked hard."
"&gt; TRob over Dame, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyes Leonard, Jeremy Lamb      Literally any of those players would have been better. And I'm not even talking about the post-lottery picks like Draymond, Middleton. Look at the rest of the 2012 draft, there are literally a dozen players outside of the lottery that were probably better."
"In this man's defense, if you google Jeremy Lamb clutch, he has a surprisingly big ammount of highlights. Who knew."
Tony Snell and Jeremy Lamb turn into Reggie Miller against the Raptors
"Alright, i’m tired of this. The guy said “Robert horry wasn’t just any ol role player. That man hit multiple clutch shots over the years. 7x Champion” I was taken aback that all he mentioned was “multiple clutch shots” so I made the joke, saying it all it takes is mútele clutch shots it’s not hard to make the hall, using a random guy like Jeremy Lamb"
danny green was clutch af in 2013 and is just the closest thing to a robert horry like player we got. and what clutch shots has jeremy lamb made 😭😭😭 a meaningless shot that was all luck in a regular season game? i’m just confused by your joke cause it makes no sense lmao
Joke doesn’t make any sense tho lol. Horry is 100% not a HoFer but the comparison to Jeremy Lamb makes no sense lol has not hit a single clutch shot that mattered while Horry has been a contributing player in 7 championship runs with multiple championship defining shots. Jeremy lamb has played on like 10 playoff games and ain’t done shit.
Hall of Fame benchmark: Multiple clutch shots. Jeremy Lamb is now a first ballot hall of famer
Neva lost----&gt; Neva sauce----&gt; Lamb sauce  Jeremy Lamb is LaVar Ball's illegitimate son through Gordon Ramsay?
"Presti is a good GM, and has recently put the Thunder in a great spot asset wise for the future ... and he's made some good trades with Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Paul George, etc....  But goddamn, he could have had Durant, Westbrook and Harden in their primes on the same team had he just given Harden the contract he wanted.....  Instead he traded Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two 1sts and one 2nd.   Oh and then KD left 4 years later.  ...... man, imagine if that core had stayed ...... the Warriors dynasty maybe wouldn't have even gotten 1 ring in the 2010s."
Go ahead and send us KPJ for jeremy lamb.
I know that this has been rumored for a while but if we're seriously considering this I'll have to off myself.  Why pay EG 18M a year to be an injured 6th man when Jeremy Lamb can do that for half the cost? Fuck.
"I did a write-up a while back about the opportunity of exploring a CJ trade because I do think that's a plausible idea for Indiana. This trade though is giving up way too much for CJ though.  Here is what I had:  Indiana gets: CJ McCollum, PJ Washington  Portland gets: Jerami Grant, Jeremy Lamb  Charlotte gets: Domantas Sabonis  Detroit gets: Zac Collins, 2021 and 2023 first round picks from Charlotte  https:/np.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/nxwkr5/oc_a_fourteam_trade_between_indiana_portland/"
"Give me Gerald Henderson, Jeremy Lamb, and Rudy Gay if they’re playing the Raptors all day."
"Unrelated, but I still can't believe we didn't do Hayward for Turner, a first round pick, and Lamb or McDermott. We basically did Hayward and two seconds for Evan Fournier. Jeremy Lamb alone isn't much worse than what Fournier was for us on offense (and is fairly better on defense). I understand that it was a bet on what the market would be at the deadline (and that technically it's not over, as there's $11M remaining), but man does it look bad."
"The Harden OKC -&gt; HOU trade was a good trade for OKC. Harden would not have developed in OKC as he did in HOU. That trio simply was not sustainable long term.  During the 4 years after the trade OKC made the west finals twice and in the 2 other years Beverly injuring Westbrook ruined that run and their 2015 season was riddled with injuries. IMO, Heat win 2013 regardless. Spurs still win in 2014. 2015 OKC could have won it all if it wasn’t for injuries and 2016 they probably should have won. By 2015, there’s no way Harden would have still been cool with being a 6th man and I just don’t think the 3 of them could have made it work successfully.   Steven Adams was a great fit for that team. Mitch Mcgary, Jeremy Lamb and 1 season of Kmart were big misses, no doubt, but I’d argue Harden’s absence allowed all 3 of them to reach their full potential and I don’t think a player as good as Harden would have thrived as a 2nd/3rd option early in his career. Value wise, Harden for those players is insane but I think the trade worked out better than most give credit for, even if it just opened room for KD/Westbrook."
Kuzma for Jeremy Lamb? Struggling...
Jeremy Lamb would be good bench scoring for Philly.
For a Simmons /Brogdan + 1st to work capwise  the Pacers need to add 8-10 mil in salary.   Either Jeremy Lamb is added of perhaps Justin and Aaron Holiday to make it fit cap wise.  Another possible but unlikely trade could be Simmons for Brogdan and TJ Warren
We were probably trying to make the sixers take Jeremy Lamb to match salaries and that drags it down a bit.
With Jeremy Lamb or Justin Holiday they do
"I think it's common to break bone or tear muscle along with the ligament, which presumably would hurt. That's what happened with Jeremy Lamb."
"Sabonis and something (13th pick, Jeremy Lamb &amp; Holiday Bros, ect.) for Dame &amp; maybe something (Zach Collins, future pick, ect.)."
"Jeremy Lamb, a name I've come to hate with a pssion 😒😒"
Jeremy Lamb is in Indy tho?
Still will always remember Jeremy Lamb skyfucking Toronto for that ridiculous game winner lol
&gt; This is reparations from trading James Harden for Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb.  And what's crazy is it's the same GM! Presti really has been a stalwart there.
This is reparations from trading James Harden for Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb. We did get Steven Adam’s from one of the draft picks but we still got robbed
Terry + PJ + 2nd round pick for Turner and Jeremy Lamb?
"Did y'all not see him at the FIBA tournament? He really hurt Team USA with his inability to create for others and his poor shot selection. Fact is, Kemba has always been overrated because he played on a terrible team, so his stats looked better than he actually was, because he was all they had. Literally Jeremy Lamb and Jeremy Lin were two of his best scoring teammates in Charlotte.  Playing alongside other good players has exposed his true talent level, both at FIBA and in Boston."
"It will when there's a trade that breaks in the middle of the night and all the players involved have food related names like Dwayne Bacon, Tacko, Jeremy Lamb and the Curry's."
"What? No? No one made anyone lowball Harden but owners. Point blank. You think the guy who drafted Harden wanted to dump him for Jeremy Lamb? Sometimes it’s a job, your boss gives you a directive, and you just do it. Sucks. OKC’s lack of titles isn’t because of the Harden trade. They had opportunities even outside of that. The stars never aligned. Sucks."
"They also turned Harden and KD into Stephen Adams, Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Martin, Alex Abrines, and Mitch McGary"
"What is amazing to me is he turned Harden and KD into Stephen Adams, Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Martin, Alex Abrines, and Mitch McGary"
I thought Jeremy Lamb was going to be what Beal is now
"I disagree.  OKC was looking at their team and saw they only have money to pay either Ibaka or Harden. Serge was a starter and a good one so they picked him.   The real mistake was trading James for Kevin Martin then not resigning him either. Letting Jeremy Lamb rot on the bench for years was a bad call too.  Harden never would have became what he is now if he stayed as the sixth man in OKC. He wanted the pressure of being the top dog and he got it in Houston.   His career would have been way different had he stayed in a bench role. And when you look back, he made the best decision for him and his family. Can't fault him for that."
It's like nobody has ever heard of Jeremy Lamb before.
Jeremy Lamb?  Jordan Poole?  Jrue Holiday?
"Royce White , Marcus Morris, Jeremy Lamb, Terrence Williams, Terrence Jones"
Fucking Jeremy Lamb always cooks us. I'll be seeing that half court buzzer beater in highlight videos for years to come
"Ish Smith, Jimmer Fredette, Lance Stephenson, Mo Bamba, Aron Baynes.  The perfect storm of Lance going off for 25 in a half, Jimmer making every open 3 and having a somewhat favorable matchup on defense, Baynes and Bamba catching every lob and getting every put back and Ish getting you 12-16 could beat a team that overlooks them but should lose every other game they're in by quite a margin.  Bench could feature: IT, Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, Jeremy Lamb, Bismack Biyombo."
Jeremy lamb is the one that hit the half court game winner right?
"Mike Bibby, Gerald Henderson, Drew Gooden are in the Hall of Fame.           For active players there's Jeremy Lamb, Payton Pritchard may also be on his way."
"&gt;You can get a better return for Harden.  We asked for Klay and Beal lmfao.  &gt;You can get a more playable than Kanter for a first round pick  Where was this energy when our Adams/Kanter line up help us beat the 67 win Spurs? Or when it helped us go up 3-1 vs the 73 win Warriors. I'll just answer for you bro. It was non-existent.   &gt;You can get a better player than Waiter for another first round pick (maybe not I actually liked Dion)  He played really well for us though?  &gt;You can get a better return for Jeff Green/Not extend Kendrick Perkins before seeing he's not the same than before the injury)  We got Kendrick Perkins so we can contend with the best team in the West at the time, the Lakers. You can't put Jeff Green on Bynum or Pau. Jeff Green would have been unplayable.  &gt;You can have a good coach that's actually gonna let Jeremy Lamb develop instead of playing a washed up Caron Butler in front of him  You just came at us for not getting better role players and then we got one in Caron ... but now you're saying we should have developed Lamb over Caron. Lamb got better as his FGA went up because he needed that for his development. You can't have guys like Russ/KD on your team and worry about giving Lamb more shots.  I'll agree with the coaching.  &gt;Or a coach that could actually play Ibaka at center in the match up when it's needed unlike Scottie Brooks.  I wish this happened but this was pretty unheard of before 2016. He played 16% of minutes at center with us (2016 being his last year). The league started to change with switchability. His % jumped to 56% at center post 2016."
"You can get a better return for Harden.  You can get a more playable than Kanter for a first round pick  You can get a better player than Waiter for another first round pick (maybe not I actually liked Dion)  You can get a better return for Jeff Green/Not extend Kendrick Perkins before seeing he's not the same than before the injury)  You can have a good coach that's actually gonna let Jeremy Lamb developp instead of playing a washed up Caron Butler in front of him  Or a coach that could actually play Ibaka at center in the match up when it's needed unlike Scottie Brooks.  &amp;#x200B;  Presti has been amazing at trading since 2017, he was pretty bad before that that's all I'm saying."
"Yep, he holds the record with being traded 4 times during the summer of 2015. First Orlando traded him to Memphis for Janis Timma. Then he was traded two more times that day from Mephis to Charlotte for Matt Barnes and then from Charlotte to OKC for Jeremy Lamb. Finally a few days after that he was traded from OKC to Toronto for Tomislav Zubcic and then he got waived by Toronto and never played in the NBA again. Ariza has been traded more times overall, but the most he was traded in a single offseason was 3 times before the start of this last season."
Jeremy Lamb against the raptors

I still have nightmares of Jeremy Lamb. Why he always pop off against us
Young Raptors avenged us for those Jeremy Lamb buzzer beater losses.
Jeremy Lamb 6 man
Jeremy Lamb and Gerald Henderson off the bench
"Always partial to the Pacers:  TJ McConnell, Chris Duarte, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, OShae Brissett"
"&gt;  Jeremy Lamb  I was convinced OKC had to play him more and he would have been the next big thing for them. Not superstar, but more like Oladipo."
Jeremy Lamb last year is such a good answer for this. He put up 10 PPG on 59% TS but was still somehow unplayable.
Usually any dude who scores over 10ppg but utterly refuses to play defense.  Like Jeremy Lamb or Oubre types.   Maybe even someone like Lou Williams
"They traded Jeremy Lamb, Kenyon Martin(two players who were pretty valuable at the time) and two FRPs  They had an idea"
"I watched one our games against y'all on your broadcast, and your broadcasters are incredible. I think they were talking about Jeremy Lamb, and the play by play guy (I'm assuming Collins) said he was ""tougher than woodpecker lips."" I could not stop laughing, so many amazing calls like that"
"I haven’t looked forward this much to a Rockets summer league since 2012: Terrence Jones, Jeremy Lamb, Royce White, Donatas Motiejunas, and Chandler Parsons.    Between Green, Sengun, Christopher, and hopefully Garuba, I’m excited to see all of them both individually and together."
We'll trade you Jeremy Lamb
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
As people have explained - draft pick trade  Also if anybody wants to take Jeremy Lamb holla at ya boi Pritchard
"1. We're not doing much; as you can imagine we're looking to run it back more or less with a competent coach in Carlisle.   We drafted Duarte who's immediately going to be a rotational player. We lost Dougie McBuckets but signed Torrey Craig to help with the front court minutes and Oshae Brissett had enough of a promising end to the previous season that I could see him getting more minutes. We also retained TJ McConnell and will probably look to move Jeremy Lamb.  2. I guess I'm high on the Raptors because I think FVV is a solid guard. I think their lineup is pretty solid as is except for the fact that they're missing a center.   I'm not high on the Celtics though to put them in Tier 2 - they've continued to bleed talent over the past few years  4. I guess they're going to keep Simmons. If that's the case, they'll continue to be a solid regular season team and probably cap out at ECSF.  6. You're right. The East isn't as stacked as the West but a lot of teams in our conference have made major upgrades to their roster and fighting for playoff seeds is going to be difficult for any of my Tier 3 teams. Not looking forward to it."
"I think you're overrating how much 9 a season is... Even if you don't think Caruso is very good, he's still probably worth 9  Tristan Thompson, Jeremy Lamb, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood. I clicked through a bunch of teams rosters and excluding rookie deals these are the guys making 9-10 million. 9 million is not every day starter money"
this mfer did it two times during our championship season. If Jeremy Lamb was on the Magic we might have lost in the first round.
Jeremy lamb is getting more than double this rn lol
"&gt; So wait, $9.5m for McConnell?  My god man, that's George Hill/Deandre Jordan/Serge Ibaka/Larry Nance/Jeremy Lamb money.  But really, I'm fine with it.  McConnell quickly became a favorite of mine."
Jeremy lamb? Watch out Toronto
I think Jeremy Lamb snuck in and torched a bunch of rookies
Not terrible....but do you honestly think sabonis and lamb make this team a strong contender? As a warriors fan I’d honestly be more excited to keep the young talent and see how it goes....Jeremy lamb doesn’t get me riled up.
"Right now if I’m the warriors I’m on the phone with the Pacers offering Wiseman, Wiggins, and Kuminga for Sabonis, and Jeremy Lamb"
Hey Jeremy Lamb was once one of the key pieces in a trade for James Harden!
Maybe Jeremy lamb maybe kemba
"Even with Ross and Delon, they were packaged for Ibaka and Gasol which led to the chip.  The only player drafted after Ross within reason you can argue for is Drummond and with JV already on the roster (and JV being better than Drummond) it was the right pick. The ten picks after Drummond were Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Royce White, Tyler Zeller, Terrence Jones and Andrew Nicholson. Getting Ross is a W for Masai and the Raptors.  With Delon, he was drafted 20th so getting someone who was a first guard off the bench player is a good return on that. The players drafted after him in the first round were Justin Anderson, Bobby Portis, Rondae, Tyus Jones,  Jarrell Martin, Nikola Milutinov, Larry Nance Jr, RJ Hunter, Chris McCullough and Kevon Looney. Other than Looney, Delon is good return based on the picks after, I don't consider this a miss.  Bruno was a miss no doubt though. But hey, we got the Raptors 905 built up because of him so in the grand scheme of things it worked out lol  So yeah, **basically** (key word basically) all our picks have hit. Other than Bruno we haven't missed a pick."
Jeremy Lamb to the sizers confirmed.
"I think it may be more difficult than you’d expected. In 2012, we had the 12, 16 and 18th pick, and there was so much chatter about us trading up in the draft, but in the end we drafted Jeremy Lamb, Royce White and Terrence Jones."
as a big uconn fan I think he will pan out as maybe a slightly better jeremy lamb. A serviceable starter that will give you around 12-15 a game
Jeremy Lamb works who I dont think was the issue for Indiana to give up
"Maybe you should be the GM since you know a lot lmao. Ibaka was always key to the Thunder especially during the Spurs series. The James harden trade was not all that bad at the time considering they got 2 FRP, a solid starter in Kmart and they believed jeremy lamb to become a slightly better eric gordon. Prime eric gordon averaged 22 ppg which is very good"
So basically Jeremy Lamb
"Yeah I can't imagine Presti trading one of the greatest shooting guards for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and 2 middling first round picks."
“James Harden for Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin because we didn’t wanna give Harden a max extension” sounds like exactly something your gm would do tbh
"Kemba: career being derailed by injuries   Jeremy lamb: career derailed by injuries  Shabazz Napier: went from lebrons favorite rookie to a journeyman, currently playing in russia  Rudy gay: old but doing his thing   Amida Brimah: got a 2 way deal   Drummond: lol  Bouknight: on track to be our first lotto pick since lamb and first top 10 since kemba"
Did they tell him to trade him for Jeremy lamb too
"Jeremy Lamb game winner in the ACC, 59 wins versus 60 wins in an otherwise perfect season. I’m still salty about that one for sure."
"Spitballing here - Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb (salary match) and our first."
"Old, overpaid, has missed half of the past 2 seasons due to injury.  Why pay EG nearly 20M a year to be an injured sixth man when Jeremy Lamb can do that at half of the cost? And that's not even including any assets that may be traded."
"Jeremy Lamb? I dunno, I fucking hate and love the off-season."
"Yeah but Jeremy Lamb is on an expiring while Gordon's signed for 2 more seasons and is super overpaid, which is why he's negative asset"
I hardly saw much love when Jeremy Lamb made that ridiculous half court shot to win the game against the Kawhi Raptors
Jeremy Lamb. Thought he’d be what Beal or Booker is now.
"Jeremy Lamb, owner of the Toronto Raptors."
Jeremy Lamb is still 2k14 god
Jeremy Lamb has entered the chat.
"Time to trade Khris Middleton for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and Steven Adams because you can't be a luxury tax team in a small market."
"One Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and a Kevin Martin rental"
"You’re right, it’s easy enough to work around though. Either Charlotte could send a large salary back (like Plumlee, given they’d then have a young big man rotation of Kai Jones and wiseman), or some assets could be swapped around. Like this  Pacers: Wiggins, Kuminga, moody   Hornets: TJ Warren, James wiseman, Jeremy Lamb  Warriors: Hayward, Myles"
"Sixers get: Hield, Brogdon + Kings first  Kings get: Simmons, Jeremy Lamb  Pacers get: Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell"
Jeremy Lamb is honestly one of my favorite players and I’d love to see the spacing he would provide Luka
"I met Jeremy lamb when I worked at academy in 2014. He was with his (very hot) girlfriend and was buying an electric jeep giant toy thing, which I came to find out was for him to drive around his house. His gf tried to get me to talk him out of buying it lmao."
Jeremy Lamb
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
"Well if we are doing hypotheticals, I'll take Westbrook, Harden, KD and someone like Ibaka and Thabo (if he is a free agent). Ill get Reggie off the bench with Jeremy Lamb."
"Irrationally? No clue. Rationally? Lebron, Jeremy Lamb, Mike Scott (they all killed the raptors when they played us)"
Just trade him for Malcolm Brogdan and Jeremy Lamb and call it a day can we just get this shit over with
"I can’t think of any trade that makes sense. Maybe Indiana for a package around Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb? Then they slide Brogdon to the 2, Sabonis to the 5…. Idk"
"Biz went all the way to midcourt and was going to chest bump Jeremy Lamb, but only Monk ever gets talked about lol"
"&gt; Dragic doesn't have much trade value at all, you think the Raptors are going to somehow flip him for Turner?   I'm sure you'd be getting picks from Toronto... plus he's an expiring [meaning you open up more cap quicker than you would with Turner]- plus you can use those picks to acquire simmons [if necessary].  &gt; Why in the hell would Pacers trade 3 starters for two players who don't want to be there, who definitely would not make the team better. Clearly you don't follow the team much, because Jeremy Lamb has been relegated to the bench and is pretty washed up. Lamb is 29, Holiday is 32, and Dragic is 35, but you think this team gives us higher upside lmao.  well it really depends on how you feel about simmons.... most would agree he's the best player in the deal, and you essentially add a young co-star pg/f to your young star C. You start Dragic/Lamb/Holiday because they can all shoot 3's at a high clip. You have two plus distributors in simmons/sabonis to give them the ball... and then you have Levert to carve up 2nd units.   Warren and Brogdon are both 28 [Brog will be 29 soon] and have a combined 0 all-star / all-nba appearances between them, while simmons has several. Trust me when I say I'm not the biggest simmons fan [can't believe I'm defending him right now], but this is the type of move you make to advance your team and build for the future. Buying low on a young star is rarely a bad idea..."
"There are so many things wrong with this trade. Dragic doesn't have much trade value at all, you think the Raptors are going to somehow flip him for Turner? Why in the hell would Pacers trade 3 starters for two players who don't want to be there, who definitely would not make the team better. Clearly you don't follow the team much, because Jeremy Lamb has been relegated to the bench and is pretty washed up. Lamb is 29, Holiday is 32, and Dragic is 35, but you think this team gives us higher upside lmao."
Jeremy Lamb buzzer beater against Raptors?
"i mean i think OKC deserves whatever shit comes after trading away Harden for absolutely nothing.  imagine if the Celtics traded current Tatum for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and two first round picks?  and Tatum may likely never be quite as great as Harden.  if Ainge did that he would've been chased out of town, but Presti got a pass for some reason.  it is by far the worst trade any GM has made in my lifetime."
"i just imagine if danny ainge traded Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown after 3 seasons for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and a couple FRPs.  he wouldn't have stepped down as GM, he would've been absolutely chased out of town with pitchforks.  and the Celtics will be lucky if Tatum or Brown becomes anywhere near as great a player as Harden.  to Presti's credit, i do think he is particularly good at evaluating college talent.  but that is where his good qualities as a GM end."
Reminds me of Westbrook and Jeremy lamb... these guys are so into it that the slightest thing is a provocation lol
"Or 1 of them gets traded for a Jeremy Lamb, another for a sophmore Dipo and another leaves for free agency."
Jeremy lamb. I’m a NC native who went to a shit ton of hornets games but I’m also a die hard OKC fan. Love rooting for the hornets and Jeremy lamb always did well when I saw him. That half court game winner was just the icing on the cake
"Speaking of people who traumatized my Raps, may I present Jeremy Lamb"
I’ll give you Jeremy lamb and a lamb gyro for Simmons
Jeremy Lamb was traumatizing
"&gt; I want to know why you think I said he was a 40% 3PT shooter.  I never said you said that, but you called him a great shooter, and 40% from 3 would pretty much be the lowest efficiency you could plausibly consider a great shooter. That would put him about par with the likes of Nicolas Batum and Jeremy Lamb.   &gt;You’re basing your argument off of his free throw percentage. So answer the question, could a hypothetical 40% free throw shooter be a good shooter in the league?  Oh, so we're down to a *good* shooter now. But no, a 40% free throw shooter would not under any circumstances be considered a good shooter."
Genuinely surprised that the it isn’t Gerald Henderson or Jeremy Lamb for the Raptors
"Hoping someone can put together an All BBQ-IQ NBA team post here. Maybe taking into account weight, bbq related antics (ie Lemon Pepper Lou), bbq related name (Jeremy Lamb? Okay that's a stretch), hometown... Just throwing out some ideas."
"5-10 years is on the generous end too, and would be considered a solid career imo. If you can string together 5 years of starter-worthy production you're already in the top percentile of players. 10 years is near outlier status.  Punters/Kickers excluded, the average professional NFL career lasts ~2/3 years across the board, with some position based variance of course.   It's fucked that it's just *how it is*, and how the salaries are non guaranteed.   It's the only sport where the question ""do we actually pay our best player?"" is something debated by orgs and fans on the regular, often leading to a ""nah fuck that he's already 25, we'll draft another"".. Shits cold.  Agree with ya on the personalities part, but feel that is equal parts NBA marketing their players, and it being a smaller group of guys who's faces are exposed (usually).   I can be next to Darius Leonard in line and have no idea unless he happens to be vein enough to wear his jersey while out. Someone like Jeremy Lamb though? Instant recognition.."
2K14-15 Jeremy Lamb is a walking bucket. For some reason he’s like the best shooter in the game.
Jeremy Lamb
Have nothing but love for Jeremy Lamb - he's done an admirable job of keeping the 2-guard position locked down since Oladipo.  Unfortunately though we have an absolute logjam at that position and I do think we'll trade him. It'll probably be for something like a second rounder though.
I'll never forgetting Jeremy Lamb being the 2k13 my career demon God
I played against Jeremy Lamb in HS and he absolutely shitted all over my team. Wasn't even fun.
"I remember a few years ago someone posted how statistically Jeremy Lamb was the quintessential average player, even down to his height lmao. Glad to see he was able to remove that 'bust' label early on in his career."
"When Jeremy lamb hit that game winner in Toronto. I was in a lecture at uni and across the room like 5 different guys all jumped up at the same time, everyone was looking around like wtf just happened??"
"honestly other than harden i don’t know if we have many quality candidates. jeremy lamb, oladipo or kevin martin probably"
Jeremy Lamb
UConn fan here. I predicted both him and Jeremy lamb would disappoint at the nba level. They both were always moping around the court looking disinterested and sadge. They also never seemed to really care or go full on 100% during games. They also displayed absolutely zero leadership skills and led a team that started the season ranked #4 in the country and fresh off the Kemba walker chip to unranked and out of the tourney in the first round. Their attitudes always sucked.
Jeremy Lamb...

"Or they beat the Spurs if they get a better player for 2 first round pick.  Kanter was useful in one playoffs series in 2 seasons in OKC, they trade a first round pick for a guy who couldn't play in half his playoffs series.  And Dion was great at the start of the series against the Warriors, that's all he did in OKC, he ended up not even giving them more than a Jeremy Lamb would've"
"I remember being so hyped after drafting jeremy lamb, royce white, and terrence jones"
"I’ll take that off your hands for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and a future first, let’s do that deal ASAP"
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.  Klay - 16.6 PER / 5.3 Win Shares / **-0.3 BPM** / 1.2 VORP  Kemba - 21.7 PER / 7.4 Win Shares / 4.2 BPM / 4.4 VORP  Klay was the third option on a team with 2 top 5 players. Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
At 0:08 Anyone notices AD left Russell hanging again like what Jeremy Lamb did to him? Lol.  The Lakers definitely has a team issue.
"So you're wondering if Jeremy Lamb would would become a goat after a million years ('cause he'd likely kill himself after such a long life, or be killed due to being some fucking wild ever living being).  Nope, not a chance. Even playing a million years at his current level, not a chance in hell. I think an empty door frame has a better chance at containing someone then he does. I wouldn't complain if he was given everlasting life, seems like a good enough dude, as long as he's not with Pacers during that time. He'd likely bounce around and play for all 1,237 NBA franchises by that time, but no, never a GOAT."
People in this sub just change who they think is better on a game by game basis. In this thread they're really acting like it's not close between them lmao. Like they're comparing LeBron and Jeremy Lamb.
"&gt;	Why would another team give up a guy who is better than Ben and a bunch of picks/extra players?  Why do people always post dumb takes like this?  Kawhi was traded for Derozan and Poetl, Kyrie was traded for an injured Isaiah Thomas and a lottery pick, Harden was traded for Levert and a bunch of picks (and Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb before that), and if we want to go back a decade Pau Gasol was traded for the rights to Marc Gasol (who was an unknown 2nd rounder at the time) and Kwame fuckin Brown.  If there’s a team desperate enough to get something back for their star player, they’ll ask for anything back if the trade market isn’t there."
"Jeremy Lamb also has a stake in the Raptors, Middleton owns the Celtics"
Employing Jeremy Lamb on your basketball team in 2021 will do that.
They turned out that way because they traded James Harden for Jeremy fucking Lamb
I think Jeremy lamb is better than Bradley veal
LeBron hasn’t gone off against the Raptors since 2017-18 season. They’ve owned his ass since then.   Jeremy Lamb is who the Raptors fear most.
jeremy lamb had a halfcourt buzzer beater on the raptors in the last game played at scotiabank arena before the bubble lmao
"there's generally a Charlotte wing that wrecks us too. Gerald Henderson, Jeremy Lamb too"
"On the contrary, I thought he was a good pick at the time, particularly when looking who was selected immediately behind him. In order, from the ninth pick onward:  * Andre Drummond  * Austin Rivers  * Meyers Leonard  * Jeremy Lamb  * Kendall Marshall   * John Henson   * Mo Harkless  * Royce White  * Tyler Zeller  * Terrence Jones  Drummond showed lots of promise early in his career. I still remember, maybe one of his first preseason games, when he was out there being a massive presence on both sides of the floor, eating rebounds, active defensively, and [then he did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28SAm0RsNk&amp;ab_channel=PissStains). It felt like we'd landed a monster who'd be capable of anchoring the franchise.   And truly, when he only did the things he was build to do, he *was* an asset. If he just dunked basketballs, always made his presence felt defensively (blocking shots, affecting shots, knowing his rotations and making those rotations, throwing keen outlet passes), ran the floor, and gave 100 percent effort, the entire franchise would have been better off. He'd do that at times in the mid-2010's and we'd see some solid stretches of team basketball as a result.   But at some point, it became clear that rotating on defense wasn't really a thing he was all about, that he was never going to develop a post game—even a rudimentary jump hook that he could hit at an average clip, that he was going to want to start shooting 3-pointers and taking players off the dribble before shooting floaters through their chest. By the end, all the most toxic elements of his game completely overshadowed his positives (clearing the glass, finishing lobs).   By the end, his game was basically the basketball personification of hubris."
Do Jeremy lamb next pls
"This is such an oversimplification. He didn't value over Perkins over Harden. He valued Perkins over Harden. He valued Perkins (or Ibaka), the extra cap and financial flexibility of not having Harden's contract (which becomes important when you're about to pay Durant and Westbrook both the max), and what they got for Harden in the trade (2 1sts, Jeremy Lamb, and a decent win now player in Kevin Martin) over Harden and what they could have gotten for Perkins (or Ibaka) (probably one mid-1st rounder and a bottom of the rotation guy).  To be clear, it was horrendous. But it wasn't valuing Perkins over Harden. There was a market for Harden that didn't exist for Perkins."
A La Jeremy Lamb
Jeremy lamb makes me cry
I'm hoping we can still pull of a trade for Dragic. Or use our trade exception to get Jeremy lamb.
see that’s the thing our true second unit being some kind of comp of McConnell - Duarte - Justin Holiday - Torrey Craig - Goga/Jackson  with Oshae Brissett and Jeremy Lamb still behind them but in the mix - we’re a DEEP team   however it’s gonna be a mixed bag of injuries as it always is so not sure what the second unit will be
"A team that just made the finals with a budding young star due for a rookie extension and his team is trying to nickle and dime him. I think I seen this somewhere before… so I guess Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and a future first for Ayton then"

"I don’t think there is a disparity, no. We’ll see what happens. The comparison to a Charlotte team with a supporting cast of Jeremy Lamb/Batum/Dwight Howard’s ghost is pretty insane to me though. Maybe that’s just me being a homer but, again, we’ll see how the year pans out"
"The Thunder traded Harden for for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, a pick which became Steven Adams.   In 2016, they had a lineup of Westbrook/Roberson/Durant/Ibaka/Adams"

"Of late, the straight up hate on Jeremy Lamb and that he is absolute trash, shouldn't be in the NBA"
Jeremy Lamb
It’s the 2k influence coz istg Jeremy Lamb was Supernova Klay everytime I played against him in MyCareer
I was certain that Jeremy Lamb would become 75% of what harden was (this was like 2015-2016)  And I was certain Perry Jones would turn into a star
Draft.net had Caris as Jeremy Lamb. Keep in mind that these are comps of how they'd compare IN the NBA.
"Cam Payne has the tiniest head in the NBA, with some competition from Jeremy Lamb"
Perhaps checking for a chasedown so he doesn't get his shit wrecked like Jeremy Lamb or Klay.
would you also be interested in the return of Jeremy Lamb 👀
Jeremy Lamb
"I think Scottie Barnes makes Siakam expendable.  One trade I've been kicking around is Siakam for Sabonis + Jeremy Lamb. Raptors get a center, Pacers get off of the two-big experiment with a proper 4."
Siakam for Sabonis and Jeremy Lamb I wouldn't mind that
"Don't listen to that guy, Kemba was clutch as fuck for the minutes of games, but had way too much defensive pressure on him to take the final shot because everybody in the building knew nobody else was going to take the final shot for Charlotte. Then Jeremy Lamb happened"
"Seems like he's gotten through to them finally. The starters are actually putting forth effort, which had been a problem.    Few games ago he benched the starters the entire second half and put in deep bench guys like Jeremy Lamb and Brad fucking Wannamaker. Seems to have lit a fire under those guys."
Kelan Martin is the new Jeremy Lamb 😐
Jose Calderon made his first 84 free throws in 2008-09 on his way to setting the record for best FT% in a season (98.1% on 154-of-157).  Micheal Williams made 83 straight to end the 1992-93 season as part of a 97 make streak that is the longest in NBA history across multiple seasons.  Tony Snell set the record for most free throws in a season without a miss with 32 in 2019-20. Jeremy Lamb is now tied with Stephen Curry (also 2019-20 when he played just 5 games) for the second most in a season without a miss.
"Dude instantly shoots the ball (and scores) if you're even 1 cm away from him and it fucking pissed me off everytime I had to guard him on OKC in NBA2K14 since I kept getting ""Allow Man to Score"" if I couldn't outright block his 3 pt attempt in MyCareer. Forget guarding KD and Westbrook, my number 1 priority in that game was to make sure he didn't even get to *touch* the basketball or at least wear him out by forcing to bring the ball up from the inbounds and to constantly pressure him at halfcourt. I could live with anyone but him scoring  And if Chris Smoove loathed everytime he had trouble guarding Jeremy Lamb (in 2K14 and 2K15) you know it's really bad 🤣"
"A lot of these guys go nuclear because their teammates struggled that night and the star had to put everyone on their back.  In Kemba's final season here, he scored 40+ 7 times, one of them was the 60, the others were between 40-47 points, all of them highly efficient: https://i.imgur.com/NwYPyj8.png. We were 1-6 in those games because no other Hornet could consistently create their own shot. Jeremy Lamb was our second option.  KD rarely has to go supernova like that because he's almost always got a second star next to him, sometimes a third star too. He's also just absurdly consistent."

"no, kyle lowry was traded for a 1st round pick.  the 1st round pick that was essentially the centerpiece of the james harden trade (that became steven adams).  forbes had nothing to do with it.  morey knew he had the decent players and good contracts to make a trade but that he would need a shiny piece of potential for any big trades.  thus he got that pick.  it was part of a years long strategy of treading water while waiting to strike on an available star, and he got his chance with harden.  morey and the raptors both got exactly what they wanted out of that trade.    as for the harden trade, you are undervaluing 22 year olds who, while having a bad finals series, just had a huge WCF and have already proven to be hyper-efficient scorers who can create for others.  that's like gold in the nba.  and you aren't supposed to trade it.  in okc, morey found a team that seemingly had to trade it for financial reasons and pounced before others could.  kevin martin was a good player 2 years before the trade, but, just as this season, the league changed how they called certain fouls that martin was the master at drawing, and his free throw attempts plummeted his last year in houston.  and so did his other numbers.  28 year old kevin martin who's career was forever altered (his PER/WS48 never recovered) is not a big thing to let go of in a trade.  3 mid-1st round picks is not a big deal to get someone with the potential of harden.  it's the classic trading of 4 quarters for a dollar.  you always do that in the nba.  even if he never became an mvp, that 66 TS% harden had his last year in okc was a huge indication that this was a young player who just needed more shot attempts to possibly reach all-star production.  it was a good trade if he just did that.  that he lived up to that and more shows why no team should ever give up a player like that without a king's ransom in return.  because sometimes mid-1st round picks turn into jeremy lamb (didn't become a starter for 6 seasons) and mitch mcgary (out of the league after 2 years)."
"I think the height of Eric's hype would be the Jeremy Lamb game winner against the Raptors, and it seemed like he was actively pacing himself down to avoid it."
Would you settle for a lightly used Sabonis and the shell of Jeremy Lamb?
"OKC got 2 firsts, just drafted rookie Jeremy Lamb (12th overall pick that year), a second round pick, and Kevin Martin.  Essentially, OKC got 3 firsts and Kevin Martin. That’s not a fleece for a 6th man that wasn’t expected to be anything more than a quality starter.  A fleece is like the Raptors getting Kyle Lowry for Gary Forbes in a trade with the Rockets. Hmm, wasn’t Morey the GM that did that trade? Looks like a trade where Morey got fleeced given Forbes never played for Houston."
"It’s strange and definitely surreal. Especially at first, it kinda struck me that I was just a few feet away from my childhood hero and one of the most known people on the planet.  But he’s also, in some capacity, a fan of the Hornets hoping to see them win, just like me and most of the building. It’s cool to have something like that in common with someone so important, if that makes sense. Especially since that’s not something we share with most of the overall population. Now it’s sometimes just like “Oh, MJ’s here tonight”, but I still kinda reflect on how amazing that is.   We usually sit in section 103, which is right behind him and a little to his right if you’re behind him. Last game I went to (last Friday against the Knicks), I was in row H about as close as I’ve been to him. He went up to the box after the first half, but it was cool sitting that close.   I went up to the locker room tunnel after a Jeremy Lamb game winner once to dap guys up and he walked through, probably six feet away from me. He’s not much of a fan dapper, but I’ve grown to understand his position on that lol.  Sorry for the book! Just thought I could share some cool perspective and I’m kinda blowed rn"
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
Seeing Kemba and Jeremy Lamb talking post game hits different as a UConn fan
"Today's shitpost trade  Blazers get: Caris LeVert, Jeremy Lamb  Pacers get: CJ McCollum"
Off-topic - I'd do a CJ trade for Caris LeVert and Jeremy Lamb
What about Jeremy Lamb vs Raptors in 2019?
Yeah but Jeremy Lamb has a 7 foot wingspan…
"I don’t think you thought this through. Who to trade for? What star is available?   No, Ben Simmons is not a superstar. Dame or Beal would be the dream but they don’t want out.  Neither is KAT nor does Minny want to move on from him yet.   Another thing is salary matching, Wiggins is the only contract that they use as salary match so the guy netting in return has to be of that value.  Also fit, does that guy they trade for even fit with what they try to do?   Let’s say Brandon Ingram, ok he’s a better scorer and passer than Wiggins but they actually need Wiggins better defense and actually reliable availability over Ingram who’s a poor defender and often miss games due to injuries.  Even the lesser guys like Myles Turner and Christian Wood as names get thrown around don’t make sense.. because salary matching, and value in return doesn’t move the needle to be a significantly better team. Wood can’t defend a PnR, Myles is inconsistent and a weak rebounder. Wiggins are far more important than Myles Turner plus Jeremy lamb in return"
"Jeremy and the Raptors  Lin did damage during the start of the Masai era. Plus was a part of the Linsanity highlight reel.  Lamb...well, there were half court buzzer beaters within the span of a month."
"Would Indiana consider a package built around DLo for Myles Turner? Could look something like:  **Minnesota trades:** D'Angelo Russell, Jaden McDaniels and 2024 FRP.  **Indiana trades:** Myles Turner, TJ McConnell and Jeremy Lamb.  It gives Minnesota their stretch 5 and a point guard who will simply *facilitate*, while allowing Indiana to move Brogdon to the 2 and have a pure PG in DLo. Also gives them a solid option at the 4 next to Sabonis in McDaniels.  **Minnesota:** McConnell/Beverley, Beasley, Edwards, KAT, Turner with Beverley/McConnell, Lamb, Okogie, Vando and Reid off the bench.  **Indiana:** DLo, Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis with Duarte, Holiday, Craig, McDaniels and Goga off the bench."
I'm realizing that I don't have a clue what Jeremy Lamb does
"18M is overpaid? For a starter? Look, we have Jeremy Lamb making 10M, an injured TJ Warren making 12M. TJ McConnell, our backup PG is making 8M...  This really isn't overpaid, you just haven't seen what salaries are at now."

Does the name Jeremy Lamb bring anything to mind?
"Rockets turned Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, Mitch McGary, and Kevin Martin into Oladipo and a few picks ;)"
Which begs the question - why is Jeremy Lamb part of this club? What did we ever do to him that he feels the need to regularly shatter our hopes?
"Derozan and Casey have become #RaptorsKillers. They're a part of the Jeremy Lamb club, what a turn of events."
"1. Harden trade, nuff said. (I’d like to see the alternate universe where it’s OKC and ORL built around picks and JJ Redick who would’ve been great on those OKC teams, and the cascading effect on ORL/HOU/Lob City LAC without Redick)  2. Rescinding the Tyson Chandler trade - I put the Harden trade first as a hat-tip to consensus, but this one kills me worse.  3. Jeff Green over Joakim Noah. I’m not a fan of Noah really but he would have been a great C for those OKC teams and it prevents the Perk trade.  4. Draft misses - Byron Mullens, Cole Aldrich, Cam Payne, Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis, TFerg (over Anunoby ugh), trading Eric Bledsoe instead of just keeping him, Perry Jones  5. Promising Giannis to bring him over immediately instead of asking to stash him a year, and then taking him over Adams and Gobert over Roberson  6. Re-signing Kevin Martin instead of letting him walk, and moving on sooner from Jeremy Lamb and PJIII  7. The Perk trade"
He did that shit to us *twice* that year. Jeremy lamb unironically cost us a 60-win season.
that jeremy lamb buzzer beater against the raptors was special
"We saw him at his best year after year. The rest of the cavs were not good enough to come out of the east without him. Y'all heard about LeBronto but I still hate Mark Jones for coining it (among other reasons to hate him). Raptors fans respect LeBron, Giannis and Jeremy Lamb"
jeremy lamb dont you dare
"in case y’all forgot about the jeremy lamb game winner i did, here’s a link https://youtu.be/5xvxWEx0sK8"
"The name Jeremy Lamb gives me PTSD for a different reason, dude was Curry on crack in 2k14."
I was having lucid Jeremy Lamb PTSD flashbacks.
that jeremy lamb over glen rice with dwayne bacon story made me slightly uncomfortable
Got PTSD from the Jeremy Lamb game winner when Cole Anthony took the shot 😭
"If Jeremy Lamb shot that, it probably would have gone in again."
Last possession gave me ptsd of Jeremy Lamb
Jeremy Lamb PTSD on that last shot lmao
Jeremy Lamb nearly entered the chat at the end
Jeremy Lamb single handedly robbed us of a 60 win season
I was terrified we were gonna get another Jeremy lamb
Jeremy lamb over siakam flashbacks
Suggs is probably gonna be mad aggressive really looking forward to seeing if Suggs become the most recent addition to the raptors killer list next to the likes of the greats..  Gerald henderson and Jeremy lamb
I could see that for the Pacers although I’m sure they’d want more. Lopez is older but much better helping a team on the boards and he can attack a mismatch if really needed. DiVincenzo can replace Jeremy Lamb when healthy and gives them some athleticism on the wing.
