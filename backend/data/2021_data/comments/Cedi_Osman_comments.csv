Add Cedi Osman to the mix
"For anyone curious this is what is expected, at the moment it is expected for Cedi to be at the 4, yes.   *Yes.*  And SexLand is expected to start but I'm not even gonna express excitement for the come back this time, because each time I expressed excitement I saw the lineup be changed right after haha  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (8-9) | [](/DET)Pistons (4-13) ---|---   D. Garland |Delon Wright  C. Sexton  |  W. Ellington Isaac Okoro |   Saddiq Bey Cedi Osman |   Jerami Grant A. Drummond |  Mason Plumlee  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (8-9) | [](/DET)Pistons (4-13) ---|---  L. Stevens  (GTD) |    B. Griffin  (OUT) M. Dellavedova (OUT) |    K. Hayes  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |      L. Nance(OUT) |"
Agreed cedi osman looked like kd against the nets
"The Cavs are far from the worst team this year, they could legitimately be in contention for the eighth seed. Also, that offensive ranking doesn’t really mean much because Sexton, Garland, and others have missed a ton of games. Hard to score when you’re relying on Cedi Osman to create offense."
CEDI OSMAN
Exactly this. All this hype on KD having high FG % but all you have to do is compare the Cav players to the Nets players and its clear as day.   Cedi Osman basically scored half of KD and played equally 50min and is a solid +18 which in turn is 9× more efficient on the court than KD who got 38 points and 12 rebounds  You can't make this shit up lol
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter  Larry Nance JR. gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Cedi Osman yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Austin Carr hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
\+ Cedi Osman = Mansexland!
Petition to call Cedi Osman Big Cheddar
May I offer a rebuttal? Cedi Osman
Hahahhah honestly exactly what I was thinking. Since when has Cedi Osman been this good in the nba?
Cedi osman has quietly been getting buckets
Cedi Osman with 50 minutes and 25 points!
Cedi Osman flirting with a lebron
hey so did cedi osman. put some respect
The fact that Cedi Osman played the second most minutes in this game and it was only 6 seconds less than Harden is the most interesting stat on this page
Cedi 'Lebron James' Osman
Cedi Osman is the greatest (and my favorite) basketball player of all time.
"The King just got a game off of the Durant super team. Kyrie also put up some monster numbers as the number 2 scorer on his team! Kevin Love, Dellavedova, Jeff Green, Cedi Osman, and Larry Nance were there as support as well."
"Oh fuck yeah. Send him to Cavs for Larry Nance, Cedi Osman and KPJ"
YOU GOT OWNED BY CEDI FUCKING OSMAN
"I mean, any team led by Colin Sexton and Cedi Osman is gonna take a miracle to beat"
They really gave Cedi Osman prime Collin Sexton
"Cedi ""LeBron James"" Osman with 25/7/7"
So that’s why they call LeBron the Black Cedi Osman
"Nets can't hold Cedi ""White Lebron"" Osman"
Cedi friggen Osman
Picked up Cedi Osman in fantasy right before the game holy shit
Imagine trading for harden to just to get washed by Cedi Osman
Should we trade Harden and KD for Cedi Osman?
Cedi Osman clearly the best player in the nba
"If the Nets can beat Andre Drummond and Cedi Osman, who else in the East has a chance of stopping them? The answer is no one."
"Garland is out so just Sexton coming back, sad.  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (6-7) | [](/BKN)Nets (9-6) ---|--- C.

What happened to Cedi Osman? Wasn't he supposed to be a big deal?
Cedi Osman may be the worst player in the NBA
Because fans are incapable of understanding that a once great player can be broken past the point of no return.  This move is really only interesting because of the name involved.  Substitute any other wildly inefficient 12/5 guy who can't defend and nobody blinks.  This is a lot closer to acquiring Cedi Osman than it is to acquiring the player formerly known as Blake Griffin.
"&gt;Is Cedi Osman empowered?   ... what?  &gt;Current Contract  &gt;Cedi Osman signed a 4 year / $31,120,000 contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, including $24,400,909 guaranteed"
Cedi Osman is Macedonian I think
Cedi Osman isn't even the 2nd best player on his team.

*Cedi osman has entered the chat*
Cedi Osman. Looks like Kyle Korver on fire one day and then Giannis the next.
Cedi Osman found that one out the hard way last night.
"I mean, the valuation of NBA teams would not require billionaires if it weren't for the popularity/skill of individual NBA players.  The league had to build over time on both ownership and player sides to develop into its current state.    To this person's point though, I think organizations are important, owners less so.  You can swap in and out ownership groups and so long as there's capital and good management, the difference is much more negligible than if you swap out current NBA players.  You can bet that, conservatively, the top 60-70% of NBA players in the league are literally the best people at their job on the planet.  You can't say the same for the owners.    So, on one hand, is Cedi Osman more important than Dan Gilbert? No. But if you're ranking the most important people associated with the NBA, then the top spots probably are individual players, with LeBron being far and away #1."
I really like Cedi Osman. Dude's game is just so smooth.

Cedi Osman. Really thought he would be able to develop into a nice starting wing that could average 13/5/5 with some decent defense.  This is not what has happened and it doesn't project to happen anytime soon. At least he's a handsome boi.
Kevin Love is a model but Cedi Osman is not one. I love Cedi tho
"East All Stars, gotta keep the padawans (especially Cedi ""The Sultan"" Osman)."
"Cavs say hello lol   We had a 3-4 game stretch where both Garland and Sexton were injured, then Exum went down, and Delly has been in concussion protocol since before the season started. At one point we ran:   PG: Cedi Osman (a small forward)    SG: Dean Wade (a power forward)   SF: Thon Maker (a power forward/C)   PF: McGee   C: Drummond   needless to say we didn't win that game lol. but the defense wasn't actually that bad!"
Cedi Osman channeled his inner Anderson Varajao and got absolutely yammed on.

"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
Cedi Osman
"We can get any salary to match with the Wiggins contract, it’s just about a star becoming available.  Idk for Oubre, Cedi Osman was rumored I’d rather have him for 4 years than Oubre for 1. I would take a 2nd round pick for Oubre at this point, better than him walking for free"
"He might be my least favourite player in the league, maybe Cedi Osman. 3-D wings with no 3 and no D, just chucking up ugly bricks every game."
And who has a better story than Cedi Osman?
"Every time I watch Cedi Osman brick another fucking shot, or see the Cavs offense become so stagnant it actually looks as if mold is growing on it, I just close my eyes and hear ""BLOCKED BY JAMES!"" in my head, followed by, ""CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOUUUUUU!"" and I am okay."
yeah theres a difference from telling lebron james to fuck off and telling cedi osman to fuck off
"Kuz has little brother syndrome,  like I want to give him a noogie. Simmons and oubre have that ""older sisters' boyfriend"" vibe.   Cedi Osman has sneaky excellent bone structure too"
Not my Lord and Savior Cedi Osman
"Ah, Cedi Osman. The guy people would prefer to Jaylen Brown..."
"Cavs: Garland, Sexton, Okoro, start like every game and we’re drafted by us.   Then we have Cedi OsMan (draft night sign and trade), Dylan Windler, 26th pick.   If you count undrafted players who we picked up and play for us: Mathew Dellavedova, Lamar Stevens, Broderick Thomas, Dean Wade.   Aside from Delly, all these players get decent minutes too"

"Cedi Osman is single-handedly keeping us in the conversation for the number one overall draft-pick, so him /s"
I think Cedi Osman has a higher ceiling
Turkey:  1. Hedo Turkoglu 2. Mehmet Okur 3. Omer Asik 4. Furkan Korkmaz 5. Enes Kanter 6. Ersan Ilyasova 7. Cedi Osman
&gt; Northern Macedonia: &gt;  &gt; Osman  Cedi Osman is Turkish-Macedonian but plays for the Turkish national team. I would consider him turkish than Macedonian
very likely but does that invalidate my point that Love got to play with Lebron in Cleveland which helped him achieve the Championship and that Sexton played with ..... Larry Nance jr and Cedi Osman.
"TJ McConnell, Cedi Osman, Terrence Ross"
There isn’t as specific one because role players pop off against us often. Cedi Osman comes to mind.
Yeah they got him for a second rounder for a reason lol  The cavs would be fleecing a team if they were able to just give him away. Nobody is paying 28 million dollars for him and giving up a draft pick just for him to become a free agent next year.   But then again the cavs aren't the best at making smart contract decisions based on how much money is tied up in Drummond and Love plus the new contract the Cedi Osman just got for... Like no reason.
Again. This doesn’t answer the question. Would Cedi Osman do the same damage as AD?
Cedi Osman &gt; Larry Bird  Nerlens Noel &gt; KG  And Michael Carter Williams plays the closest to Paul Pierce’s game we’ve ever seen  Edit: Also Payton Pritchard &gt; Lebron

Cedi Osman
Cavs culture/ locker room sucks  He’s the best player on the team.  Should he be passing to Cedi Osman and Okoro to create their own shots?

"He mentions Cedi Osman, so this isnt 2015 it's 2018. Jeff green was also only on the cavs in 2018. I mean KLove wasnt trash in 2018 but I think it's pretty fair to say that he had fallen off a bit by that point.  &amp;#x200B;  In 2018 KLove was a 2nd option on 17.6/9.3/1.7 on 46/42/88 and like 61.4TS%. Which are decent numbers but no where near 26/12. And really below the level of what i'd think you need in a 2nd option for a team which was pretty much ass outside of Lebron and KLove.  &amp;#x200B;  And just in general 2018 cavs = garbo is a pretty common take. imo it is pretty fair to say that it was one of the greatest carry jobs of all time."
"the lost meme Cedi Osman is just chilling at the bottom. 47.5% TS, 36/30/75 splits, owie."
"If Cedi Osman becomes Larry Bird, we might make the playoffs"
Probably a bum. Never heard of him. I only remember when Cedi Osman carried the 2018 cavaliers.
"KD, Bird, Dr J, Cedi Osman"
Cedi Osman omg
"like cedi osman in the picture with lebron, durant, and kawhi?"
"Right away from the first paragraph of this study I see a glaring flaw.   Implying that people love Cedi and hates Tristan because of skin color just sounds like someone took a glance at this sub but never actually spent time here.   Cedi isn’t a well liked player because people actually like him as a player, he’s a meme. People meme about him but a great player who’s talent is indescribable because he’s a meme. Same with Alex Caruso, people don’t actually like Caruso as a player, he just became popular because you would never expect a guy who looked like that to be a basketball player. They’re shitty players who people like to joke around about because they’re white as shit.   People aren’t actually following Cedi Osman as he rots on the Cavs bench and pay attention to his game by game performances lmfao. He’s a meme."
"Wow so much to say  1) The most vibrant outfit is Devonte Graham dressed all in black wearing a bright  puffy vest...how is that the most vibrant outfit in the NBA? I see fucking middle aged suburban women rocking that shit daily  2) The freshest pregame outfit is Blake Griffin in a pair of sweat shorts with a black long sleve shirt and some Joradans on. Meanwhile Deni Avdija's worst outfit is...shorts and a t-shirt with a pair of white sneakers. So apparently the voters in this poll are both impressed and offended by the most basic shit you can wear pregame? Talk about schizophrenic.  3) Meanwhile one of the hardest to pull off outfits is...Deandre Ayton in...a denim jacket and jeans with a black shirt. Dudes come on that shit is so basic how can you not pull that off.  Or Cedi Osman in...a white jacket with a hoodie and skinny jeans. Like what?  4) Apparently LeBron James wearing a denim jacket and black jeans is...edgy? Ummm ok. Seems pretty basic to me.   5) Back to vibrancy. Josh Jackson is the most vibrant in the NBA rocking....a flannel shirt, beanie, black tee and black skinny jeans. Have these people ever been to Portland or Seattle or Brooklyn? Or like..any rural area? Jeans, tee, flannel and beanie isn't vibrant it's fucking basic fall clothing. Also apparently just wearing a bright hoodie with black pants makes you vibrant?   I gotta stop now but this shit is wack dudes."
Somebody on our sub posted Kevin Love + Cedi Osman for KP + Josh Richardson. Seems like one of those trades that would be equally horrible for both teams.
"I don’t think he’ll leave. I was curious where he *could* go though, cause I hate the Lakers (not a LeBron fan either tbh) and it’d be funny.  -	Mav’s would be the best option, they’ve got cap space, a good coach, shooters, and a young star. He runs the risk of being called a snake since the Mav’s beat his old Miami team.  -	Miami has cap space too, and he could frame it as a “returning to his roots” kinda situation. I’m not sure how much better their roster is than the Lakers though.  -	Knicks have max cap space and need a playmaker. NY would also be good for his advertisement and investment potential -	Portland might be the best option legacy wise. They’ve never won a title and even non Blazer fans want Dame to win one. Dame would also be the perfect compliment to current LeBron.  -	The Cavs wouldn’t be the worst option in the world. They’ve got a bad record, so it wouldn’t look like he was just aiming for a “hardest road” situation. Despite this, the team is reasonably built to be a good fit for LeBron. SexLand can definitely make shots at the very least, and Larry Nance Jr and Jarrett Allen are good defenders. They’d need to dump salary though either by packaging Love with good draft picks or trading a combination of Taurean Prince, Larry Nance Jr, and Cedi Osman.  -	The Pelicans would be a hilarious option, and might be my favorite option. They’ve got two young start already in Zion and Ingram, and could potential keep Lonzo too. They’ve also got a ton of picks to facilitate trades and clear cap with.  -	The Raptors would be an out of left field option. LeBron may view it as a good way to boost his international brand.   How I’d rank them:  1.	Of all these options, the Mav’s seem like the clear cut winner. They’d probably need to find a way to dump Porzingis though, so that they can re-sign Hardaway Jr and have room for LeBron, but that seems do-able.  2.	The biggest knock on Portland is I don’t know enough about their Cap Space situation to know if they could manage to sign him. I’d imagine that it wouldn’t cost a ton to find a way to offload CJ’s cap space though. Dame would be the best possible fit next to old LeBron of almost anyone in the league though. It’d also look the best for his legacy since the Blazers have never won and Dame is universally liked. The other big negative is their porous defense.   3.	The Knicks wouldn’t necessarily be a good fit if he wants a guaranteed ring. However, it would look decent for his legacy. The team would be decent around LeBron if they could re-sign Rose too. Rose, Barrett, LeBron, Randle, Robinson is a decent lineup especial when you figure they’ve got all they’re picks available to find other pieces.  4.	The Pelicans would be hilarious but could turn really deadly, really quickly. Especially since the Lakers picks the Pelicans own become prized trade capital id LeBron just decides up up and walk. Ingram plus lotto picks could probably net them Beal or LaVine which couldproduce a Lonzo, Beal/LaVine, LeBron, Zion, Hayes lineup which could be very deadly."
It’s Cedi Osman number now 😤
It varies per time in the season:   Seeing Sexland bench and both Drummond and Javale McGee try playing point guard was a pretty low point in the season.   1: The patented Cedi OsMan blowing a lay up  2: Cedi OsMan attempting to run point and bricking a 3  3: Sexland blowing a wide open 3 to miss a contested floater
Oh my god y'all make me crazy. Cedi Osman does that when he plays for us all the time. Does that mean the refs are biased towards him?
"Cedi Osman, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood"
Surprised Cedi Osman wasn’t on here lmao.
"How is Cedi Osman not on this?  I just picture Love’s type of production, except all year long and less complaining in the media."
How did Cedi Osman not make it? He is definitely out of the league after this year lol
"Ngl, I think the major flaw with this is that you took ironic praise for a guy like Cedi Osman as genuine. Nobody thinks or thought that Cedi Osman was actually carrying Lebron, they were saying that sarcastically because Cedi Osman is a mediocre player and Lebron was clearly carrying that Cavs team."
Kelly Oubre Cedi Osman D'Angelo Russell Kyle Kuzma Serge Ibaka
Pretty sure that’s Cedi Osman
I view players that are so bad they don’t get minutes as better than the players who do get minutes and you can see them actively ruining the team with each brick they throw up.   With that being said. Cedi OsMan kills me since he is the bottom of the league in FG% and gets significant minutes

Cedi Osman.
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
i mostly agree but i think he would be really really good on a good Philly team. Who is he to pass too? Kevin Love? Cedi Osman? lol
It’s pretty. Easy though. Cos his weakness is that he isn’t a true playmaker.   But like. 4 assists is fine in a team that doesn’t really play with a lot of movement. I’m sure if there were scoring options he’d pass to them. And tbh. As of right now. If I’m him. Im not passing to Cedi Osman.   If I had a guy producing like Sexton. I’d be very happy with him
"Any veteran bench player at mininum wage would be much better than shitty Cedi Osman and Damyean Dotson, and Delly will be missed for what he did for the Cavs when they contended but same time good riddance, cause he looks completely washed and his offensive game is completely nonexistant except passing.  The only good bench players on my team were suffering mad injuries like Larry Nance Jr who had a great defensive year, and Tarean Prince off the Allen trade was like the only productive bench player, and Wade before becoming a rotational piece was a G-league player filling in garbage minutes.  So 24M of Cav's cash for the bench suffering injuries and 11M cash on guys shitting the bed. And haven't even added in Windler who again suffered injuries and only played 31 games out of the total 137 games in his first two season. Add another 2M invested for another injured bench players.  So what's more of a waste. A Sexton max or an inconsistent bench currently wasting 35-37M on their cap."
Making roster decisions based on fit is what you do when you're a playoff team with championship aspirations. We're currently a bottom 5 team in the league with maybe 5 true NBA players on our roster.  You want to trade away 1 of them for a guy who had a meh rookie year and Cedi Osman with worse hair?   Yikes.

"&gt;But it still might be closer than it seems because marginal US players are more likely to be in the NBA than non-US players, and not all the top 500 are in the NBA.  I actually agree with this, as much as international scouting has improved, I get the feeling that there's still a lot of guys kicking around the upper tiers of European basketball who could have been nba players but just slipped through the cracks. Of course this is more my gut feeling than a data backed hypothesis.  I would be really interested in a closer look at the topic of basketball in ex-Yugoslavia. My casual count has put the total around ~~17~~16, but I might be missing some, and this includes an iffy one in Cedi Osman.  Serbia: Bjelica, Jokic, Marjanovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Smailagic, Pokusevski  Slovenia: Doncic, Dragic, Cancar   Croatia: Bojan Bogdanovic, Samanic, Saric, Zubac  Bosnia: ~~Bender~~(overseas this season), Nurkic  North Macedonia: Osman (born there, plays for the Turkish NT)  Montenegro: Vucevic"
"I would do that if I was the Cavs, but cap space isn't that much of a need for them, big-time FA's are not coming here.  To me - drafting Mobley is hope #1, getting rid of Cedi Osman is hope #2, and finding someone to take Love off our hands - not really for cap room, but just to move past the whole saga - and I'm a fan of his, but he needs to go.  Sexton is a nice scorer, but he's not worth 30M a year, if he really is looking for that kind of $, then now would be a good time to move him.  I'd like to re-sign Allen."
Who doesn't love Cedi Osman.
"Add relatively unknown white bench players there too. If all these years of watching Cavs taught me anything, Cedi Osman gets called for these a lot."
Boogie smells of small dick energy. Boogie just butt hurt that CP3 gets paid more for insurance commercials than Boogie gets paid to play basketball  I’m a Cavs fan and it’s hilarious that Boogie makes 5x less money than Cedi Osman
Always thought Cedi Osman was Israeli for some reason.
"I’ve got a better one, Raptors trade the 4th overall pick, all of their future first and second round picks, and Chris Boucher for Cedi Osman and a second rounder."
Cedi Osman betta than everyone on the Flippers.
Nah Cedi Osman betta than him
I'm super excited how this young Turkish team will perform :) especially how Sengun will play against nba stars.  I hope they give korkmaz more of a facilitating role because cedi osman seems a bit off and takes way too many threes with bad percentages. Ilyasova also could still run hot like he usually does for the national team.   Nevertheless the loss of larkin will be crucial why I'd favor Canada in their group
Cedi Osman makes 8 mil it’s not a big deal
Cedi Osman top 50 is surprising
guy on deepest team in the league has a better +- than a guy who’s best wing is Cedi Osman and Dean Wade    sextons shots go in the basket more often than murray’s
Ben Simmons  Andre Roberson  Cedi Osman  Carmelo Anthony  Enes Kanter   Coach: Doc Rivers   Good luck.
Owner is serbian basketball agent Misko Raznatovic  &gt;He represented or represents many former and active NBA players:  Džanan Musa  Mirza Teletović  Dario Šarić  Ivica Zubac  Ante Žižić  Jan Veselý  Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Joffrey Lauvergne  Adam Mokoka  Goga Bitadze  Paul Zipser  Vassilis Spanoulis  Pero Antić  Omar Cook  Nikola Peković  Marko Gudurić  Nikola Jokić  Nenad Krstić  Boban Marjanović  Cedi Osman  DeMarcus Nelson  Deron Williams  He reresents also like 40+ euroleague players
"Cedi Osman is actually Turkish, the country that used to be the Osman (Ottoman) Empire"
"3 for Cavs.  K Love, Nance, Cedi Osman."
Top 5 Turkish players.  1. Cedi Osman 2. Mehmet Okur 3. Alperen Şengün 4. Ömer Asik 5. Ersan Ilyasova
"I’m not going so far as top 5, but in that 2018 Lebron does it all Cavs year, I fully accepted his impending departure because we had Cedi Osman on the rise. Whoops."
"This article right there means when you see a player from Turkey on second round, get him. Mehmet Okur, Ersan Ilyasova, Omer Asik, Cedi Osman, Zaza Pachulia, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nemanja Bjelica..."
Cedi Osman along with Love
"Alternatively  'The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ricky Rubio, Cedi Osman, Dylan Windler, Damyean Dotson and their top-29 protected draft picks for 2030/32/34.'"
"probably a more efficient teammate than... Cedi Osman, Dotson, and Brodric Thomas, and rookie Okoro pre-May"
especially a worse version of last season's Cedi Osman in Brodric Thomas
Only if Cavs icon Dwyane Wade is introduced by teammates Cedi Osman and Derrick Rose
"Cedi Osman, but only when he is playing point guard."
Cedi Osman
I would would turn on Cavs games to watch Cedi Osman...😐
Example: Cedi Osman
Hedo Türkoğlu  Cedi Osman  Furkan Korkmaz  Mehmet Okur  Ömer Aşık
"Lonnie Walker had a great summer league campaign, l think he still has promise but... he was like MVP or very close to it.  Carsen Edwards had 30 or 40 a couple years ago, again he is still young so maybe one day he can be a solid role player.  Cedi Osman is another guy, great player in European, superstar in the SL but average in the NBA."
Cavs win the playoffs. Cedi Osman FMVP.
"Exactly, remember Kuzma? I like the dude, think he’s a good player, but compare how much he’s talked about to idk, Cedi Osman? Korkmaz? House? TJ Warren outside of his bubble performance?"
"What even is a forward at this point. Because you cannot tell me that Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Cedi Osman all play the same position."
"Ah yes, the elite 2018 Cavs Super Team. LeBron, Kevin Love, and Cedi Osman."
"2019 Cavs had Sexton, Cedi Osman, Rodney Hood, and Kevin Love."
CEDI OSMAN
"No, Cedi Osman is not available."
"Okay fine: you got Larry Nance Jr, Taurean Prince, Cedi Osman and a protected future first."
I know right?! Clearly Dame is going to request a trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers to play with Cedi Osman... I believe Abbott over Dame because I think Abbott actually is Damian Lillard in disguise.
"Larry Nance, Taurean Prince, Cedi Osman, and a top 10 protected 2022 1st."
"Cedi Osman on the line did not look alright... idk if something was up with him health wise, but I have never seen anyone shoot penalties in any sport ever before where I was THIS sure that he was gonna miss. That guy's face was so pale green."
"Counter:  Spicy P, Vanvleet and #4 for Kevin Love. I'll throw in Cedi Osman to make the money work.  Deal??"
Best we can do is Kevin Love and Cedi Osman
Cavs will trade Cedi Osman and Kevin Love for Oubre and Wiggins
Lol no chance. He’s got both LA and being a Lebron teammate going for him. When was the last time someone posted about Cedi Osman on here?
Khris middleton is like 3x better than Bird. Bird today would be Cedi Osman likely
"Their 18/19 top 5 minutes getters were Cedi Osman, Collin Sexton, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, and Rodney Hood  Only Hood was even close to being a returning starter"
He averaged 9 and 2 on a team that just blew up their roster because the rotation was bad. 15 percent seems generous. Dude is like Cedi Osman in Lebron’s last year with the Cavs right now.
LMFAO 2015 warriors got taken to 6 games by LeBron and Cedi Osman LOLLLLLLLLLLLl
Cedi Osman has definitely flown some rebel alliance missions.
I’ve watched Cedi Osman maybe one game and have no idea how he plays lol
"Cedi Osman once came to my school couple of years ago and I asked him who was the hardest opponent that guarded him. He told me it was Kawhi and Derrick White. He also told that White looks like a clean/baby faced dude, but is very agressive and dirty on defense lol."
Cedi Osman
Do you remember Cedi Osman hype?  *Pepperidge Farms remembers*
"Dont worry, replaced him with *checks notes* Cedi Osman and David Nwaba"
what if i told you that Cedi Osman has been by far the cavs best wing for 3 years and he also is their backup point guard and power forward?  valentine needs to thank the cavs for suckin
"I know /s but I’d be so pissed if they trade Sexton for another guard lol. They have guards and bigs for days. Right now the wings are Cedi Osman, Isaac Okoro (I think he fits better as a guard, personally) and now Denzel Valentine. If they trade him, it needs to be for a wing."
"No one is salty the Lakers got him. His shooting still sucks and he has a chance to get buried on the bench because he’s unplayable with Russ. He’s practically Cedi Osman 2.0. He’s a quality role player at best and if you see potential superstar or the future of the Lakers you are severely overrating him. Now since he was taken mid second and some second round picks don’t even play I can see him climbing to late first. But heck, you’re even taking Keon Johnson and Shariffe Cooper over him. Also if the Lakers had the chance at 22 to take THT or Duarte they would’ve taken Duarte. Now the Rockets? They probably would go THT."
"It implies that his game is supposed to be exactly X, and since he isnt that player, then he isnt a valuable player.  Which points to the REAL issue.  The Bulls mismanaged and misused Lauri forcing him to be exactly one thing without letting him play HIS game.    Situations like that hinder growth, and even players that would develop the ""expected"" skills, generally wont because they cant get their feet underneath them.  Now, I cant guarantee the Cavs will do a lot better, because potentially something similar has happened with Cedi Osman, but I can guarantee that the worst place for him to be is in a franchise that wont let him grow his own play style.    Right now that's what the Cavs are all about - growth and developing an identity."
"Not to dismiss any of the authers work but as Turks, we all know Ersan is not actually Turkish. It is a common knowledge. We do this all the time, Mirsad Turkcan who is an other ‘Turkish’ nba player was Bosnian(might be somewhere else). And I am pretty sure Cedi Osman is also from some baltic country, Macedonia I guess… How we pull this sh.t off is, ottoman empire used to own those lands, for 400 years or so, so if a person have muslim parents and some connections to ottoman empire, we claim they are Turkish. I am not talking about legal court, I am talking about how is it explained to the public. So yeah, Ersan is not born in the borders of Turkey, I don’t think anyone would object that in Turkey."
"Cedi Osman. Good, smart player who is better as an 8th guy on a good team than a 5th or 6th guy on a bad team."
"The only ""small contract"" we have (that isn't Okoro or Mobley) that is big enough to match Simmons' $33 million is Cedi Osman. Is Morey going to take Sexton + Rubio + Osman for Ben Simmons?"
Fucking Cedi Osman. Dude is king of wild inefficient movement
Kuzma was getting cooked by Cedi Osman lol
Cedi osman
"I mean, we've got Isaac Okoro, the glass-boned corpse of Dylan Windler, and a lightly used Cedi Osman. That's technically a wing rotation, by the broadest of possible technicalities."
The Cavs offer Cedi Osman
"I totally get not being interested in Murray. There are teams I think he’s a good fit for and there are some like the 76ers where I think he’d be an awful fit. Though I’m not sure how good he is as a halfcourt facilitator so that could change my mind.  My sense is he’s a below average 3 point shooter and an incredibly inefficient scorer overall. His 50.9% ts this year tied with Russ’ for 180th highest of the 189 guys who played enough to qualify for the bballref leaderboard. Only ones with a worse ts% were Aaron Holiday, John Wall, Cole Anthony, Darius Bazley, Dwayne Bacon, Theo Maledon, Cedi Osman, and Elfrid Payton. His ts% was highest in the 2020 season and it was still only 52.4% I do know he’s a way better midrange shooter as well as a better shooter from the line and further from the basket than Simmons.  Brogdon’s a different story in my opinion. And I’m not even all that high on him but I think he’d work better for you guys than Simmons does. And there’s a fair few other guys I’d say the same about even if they’re not as good players in a vacuum."
Someone told me 538’s rapid metric says Cedi Osman and Andrew Wiggins should be paid the same…..  So yeah. Probably don’t trust it.
"The Cavs have done a great job with player development in the last several years.  Collin and Darius are examples of that.  I don’t know if Okoro will get enough time this year though to really prove himself.  Cedi Osman didn’t develop the way we hoped but idk if that’s on the team, the guy never developed a reliable shot.  He was a 31st pick anyway."
I really don’t care about Cedi Osman. More so it’s funny to find someone who dislikes a bench player so much
The only reason people care about the Cavs is because it's LeBron's hometown team.  They have everything your average lottery team has but in a less exciting way.  They have a couple dynamic guards that could drop 30 any given night... but they're Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  They have a fancy rotation they go to for the nerds to get excited... but it's just Lauri Markkanen starting at SF.  They have a meme player that people like who's actually a solid NBA pro... but it's just Cedi Osman.  They snatched a franchise changing player via the greatest draft class in recent memory... but it's a bigman.
He’s gotta collect his 8 mill a year…..someone was trying to tell me wiggins was worth 8 mill a year and my counter was “Cedi Osman makes 8 mill a year”
cedi osman does absolutely nothing well and has gotten starter level minutes for 3 seasons and is still playing a decent amount this year
Man is it nice to not have Cedi Osman be the ONLY healthy wing on the team.
"On the Cavs, Cedi Osman (while I love him) is bleh in every area of the game."
Cedi Osman fans are pretentious jags
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
"Barnes is expiring, Hield is someone they want to get rid of and Kevin Love though trash would be a good piece for them, they'd also get Cedi Osman otherwise the trade wouldn't work who is a decent piece and can atleast be an ok defender and that 2028 LaL pick could be worth something at some time"
"Lakers receive; Barnes and Hield, Kings receive: Kevin Love, Cedi Osman 2028 unp LaL, Cavs receive Russel Westbrook"
"""of course I can throw in Cedi Osman and Lauri Markannen"""
"Really fun game.  Takeaways:  Cavs:  - Mobley is a fucking beast. First NBA game and dropping 17/9/6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense? - Jarrett Allen is a force in the paint, and with Mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future. - Cedi Osman giveth and Cedi Osman taketh.  - Darius Garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness. - We're suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation. We're either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers, there's no in between lol  Grizzlies:  - Ja Morant.  - Desmond Bane looked incredible today.  - Melton was on fire, but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter D  - Did I mention Ja Morant?  - Glad to see Ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately.  - JJJ had a rough game offensively, especially inside, but made a huge impact on D. Dude is so good.  All around fun game!"
"Just got out of a Thai Prison, is Cedi Osman the best player in the NBA?"
"Oh no, what will they do without Thon Maker, Cedi Osman or Nick Richards?!"
You’ll take Kevin love and Cedi Osman and you’ll like it
Have taken a look at the list of players who make 8 million? Not sure how fivethirtyeight is coming up with that number but it is not a realistic one for market value. Unless you think Wiggins is a comparable player to Cedi Osman which is not very smart.

"&gt;My guess is that Sexton can be frustrating to play with because he’s a combo guard on a team that can’t score and his first instinct is to get buckets.  He's the best scorer on the team, by far. What's he supposed to do, defer to Cedi Osman? Clear out so Dean Wade can iso?  This is like a mini-version of when people were criticizing Kobe for not passing to Smush Parker and Kwame Brown enough, or acting like Iverson should've given up shots to George Lynch and Tyrone Hill.  Sexton should be looking to get buckets, because someone's gotta score if they're gonna win a game once in a while. In Sexton's 62 games last season, he averaged 29 pts on 19 FGA when they won, and 22 pts on 16.5 FGA when they lost."
"Gentleman, a short view back to the past.   Five seasons ago, LeBron told us ""two points isn't two points, I'll explain later"".  Five seasons later, Jimmy Butler told us ""I'm stupidly locked in"".  And during a game, I don't remember what game, Kevin Love yeeted the ball at Cedi Osman.  Question for you both, is the NBA too soft today with foul calls every other play? Is it too hard to defend?  What are your wishes for the future concerning foul calls during games? Less jumping into the defender on 3 point attempts, more? Or less and more whining to the refs?"
"Don't hit it too hard, he'll get injured again and probably punt Cedi Osman amid a tantrum."
I think its more telling that Lonzo wont try to finish over Cedi Osman lmao
The Cavs would play him for 14 and give the rest to Cedi Osman because they don't know what they're doing with their current roster.
Cedi Osman
Simmons trade value just went down to Cedi Osman and two 2nd round picks.
This is without Collin sexton AND our best shooter Cedi Osman 😈

Is Cedi Osman the Turkish Lebron?
**For readability:**  Evan Mobley   Darius Garland   Jarrett Allen   Lauri Markannen   Collin Sexton   Isaac Okoro   Ricky Rubio   Cedi Osman
"oh really? u a big cedi osman guy?  edit: looking at the stats, it’s closer than i thought. Mostly based that take on last season."
"Let's hear any possible evidence for why Malik Monk is ""easily better"" than Cedi Osman."
They’re both average to above average starters. Way above “replacement-level” imo. Also malik monk is easily better than cedi osman
They're both replacement-level to slightly above replacement-level players.   Its like asking if Cedi Osman or Malik Monk is a better player.
Evan Mobley Darius Garland Jarrett Allen Lauri Markannen Collin Sexton Isaac Okoro Ricky Rubio Cedi Osman
"Hey it's cool to be positive, keep it up! What does that have to do with this:  &gt;If more than 1 of our 5 top players played tonight we would have won.  Garland played. And if you don't think Garland is a top five player on your team and Cedi Osman is the real difference maker...  &gt;That is~~n’t~~ crazy to say  To sum up...  &gt;What you said shows how little you know."
"Or Cedi Osman tonight. We would've had to have 40 point games from Rubio, garland, and love to win either of those games . Just wasn't happening, but they damn sure showed some heart"
Don’t forget Cedi “Turkish LeBron” Osman
"&gt; but isn’t erdogan and the incumbent government a giant POS too?  Gulen isn't the opposite of Erdogan. Gulen wanted to be Erdogan but got beaten by him.   I can't find a direct example for USA but if i had to it would be like saying Trump is the opposition against conservatives. He just wasn't able to garner power.  Seculars in Turkey are the opposite of Erdogan. NBA players like Mehmet Okur, Furkan Korkmaz, Cedi Osman would be the actual opposition of him."
"Its not a mirror but its close. I do feel this Lakers team is better than what the Cavs had. Crowder, Lance, Clarkson, Cedi Osman and Rodney Hood were too inexperienced unlike the current Lakers. I do feel that if Lakers have everyone healthy they can beat anyone in the playoffs, even the Warriors."
Can Cedi Osman stop destroying us?
"Oh so we are gonna lose, ok, thanks stupid Cedi Osman"
What are the MVP odds on Cedi Osman
Tatum was hot garbage today. Dude could only make a shot after tackling cedi Osman and making sure he was wide open
My lord and savior Cedi Osman
2 words.....Cedi Osman
"Cedi Osman is an enigma, at times he looks like he should be a superstar, at other times he looks like he shouldn't be on an NBA roster."
"Cedi Osman is who I thought Alex was, mostly a meme guy who played alongside LeBron. Boy was I so wrong."
That’s 2022 MVP Cedi Osman to you. Don’t take the next prime minister’s name in vain again
Scottie Barnes and Cedi Osman would end up higher than Bill Russel
"The duality of Cedi Osman. You either get Lebron lite or you get SF Westbrick.  Also, unrelated, but Lamar Stevens does not belong in the NBA."
You telling me you don't want 30 mins of the Cedi Osman experience?
"Just saying, the Cavs have two literal male models in Cedi Osman and Kevin Love, plus Ricky Rubio who’s a beautiful man, and then Jarrett Allen looks like the lead in a 70s detective movie about a murder at a disco. Honestly Mobley and Markkanen aren’t too bad either, it’s just DG and Collin kinda letting the side down there."
"My teams biggest strength is star guard Ricky Rubio  (Actually our defense is generally strong enough that we survive poor shooting nights) the cavs actually look pretty deep right now but I would be really surprised if that lasts.  Cedi Osman and Ricky Rubio have been incredibly strong…. I would be surprised if that lasts.  Our weakness is that when our offense breaks down, it really breaks down.  The Cavs have had several occasions where they score a handful of points while an opponent scores like 20."
"Not finishing, handling. Dude goes right 95% of the time because he has no ball control with his left hand. He’s like cedi Osman in that regard."
BLOCKED BY OSMAN. CEDI OSMAN WITH THE REJECTION
Did you say my lord and savior Cedi Osman is not a lock in? How dare you
"Evan Mobley, Jarret Allen, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Dylan Windler, Issac Okoro, and Cedi Osman (For now)."
I mean no one on the Cavs is really a shooting specialist. You know shit is bad when Cedi Osman is your best shooter.

"He's not good. His value is in being a high energy guy. His skill set along with his size doesnt make him a fit on a good, deep NBA roster. Our wing depth is just that weak right now. Okoro is hurt, and a bit undersized when he is out there. Cedi Osman just got a DNP-CD in *favor* of Lamar Stevens, Denzel Valentine was our big wing free agent signing and he can't seem to crack our lineup, and Dylan Windler is a total question mark who's just getting back from his third injury stint in as many years.   Were not starting Markkanen just to be quirky. It's a necessity thing too."
Cedi Osman 😔
Maybe the Lakers should trade LeBron and AD for Cedi Osman and Kevin Love 🤔
