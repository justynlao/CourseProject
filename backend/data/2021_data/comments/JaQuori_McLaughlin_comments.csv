The guy who impressed me the most for the Warriors (not counting Kuminga and Moody) was JaQuori McLaughlin. He's got talent and poise and I could see him becoming an effective NBA player.
Warriors:  \+Justinian Jessop (2020 2nd round pick)  \+Jaquori McLaughlin (E10 contract)  \- Jordan Schakel (Plays for Kings? summerleague now)
Justinian Jessup and Jaquori McLaughlin.
They got JaQuori McLaughlin
Man NBA players used to be called Brad Miller or some shit and now I'm watching JaQuori McLaughlin play. Also watched Kenyon Martin play and now his son.
The score is nice and everything but the real story is that we got 1:28 of Gabe Vincent vs. JaQuori McLaughlin. I donâ€™t even know if two UCSB players have ever shared the floor together
