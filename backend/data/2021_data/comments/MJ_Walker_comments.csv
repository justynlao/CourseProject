"I truly believe as an FSU fan, they would have won the NCAA tourney had it not been cancelled. Senior PG in Forrest (on the Jazz now), two lottery picks in Patrick Williams and Vassell, a great supporting cast w/ MJ Walker etc, and the entire team played so hard especially on defense.  Probably would have been a one-seed. An all-time what might have been... They were absolutely dominating teams."
"Rodman was a hired gun who had his best years playing with the Bulls biggest enemy (at the time). I have a real hard time ranking him on an all-time Bulls list.   I have a soft spot for guys drafted by the Bulls (Noah, Deng, Butler, Grant, Hinrich) which is why they’re ranked.   Chet Walker at #7 is questionable, but I was surprised to learn he’s #3 in WS and WS/48 in franchise history. He helped anchor some really great Bulls teams in the early 70s with Sloan &amp; Love. Up until MJ, those were the best years in franchise history."
"He dominated the league until he got ""sick"". Even after ball, he's a freaking billionaire now. He's not only won, but dominated in every aspect of life. Even as a dad, his kid is a lil different, but is also a huge success. Dude people hated him cuz he was black and Bird was white Jesus; they hated him cuz he got hiv; they hated on him when he did the MJ video ""Remember the Time""; they've hated on Magic since he was here at State. But he's done nothing but make every one of his haters eat their words. The guy rebuilt the Lakers back to relevance. Do you think any other GM could have got Bron AND AD to LA? Granted he traded away his team but it paid off in spades. He made the craziest trade in my life time. I've seen crazy trades like the Cowboys and Herschel Walker trade, bit I've never seen a team trade not only leverage their starting line up but their future in all their draft picks as well. There was like 8 or 9 assets going to New Orleans for 1 player. Who coulda been a 1 year rental. He did whatever it took. And after he secured the greatest player of this generation from his hometown. Bron coulda went anywhere, especially the Knicks, and had more commercial success. But magic sold him on L.A. and Showtime. I truly believe Magic resigned the way he did cuz the Lakers were gona get shit dir how he did it, tampering and all that. So instead of having the Lakers take the hit, he took it cuz he could afford it. And it legit rolled off his back like water off feathers.   The Lakers got their guy and they won a ring. Regardless what batteries in the next 5 years they're ahead. I'll bet every team, not named Brooklyn, would give up their next 5 years for a ring this year. Like spend 5 years at or around .500 of you gave them a ring this year. They'd all take it.   So Magic is a winner there in my book. Had Palinka got the trade done giving up less than Magic offered originally, id say he jus planted the seed, but the trade was exactly what Magic said. Ya he did it with no regard for people's feelings, especially the young guys, but you gotta remember the NBA he came from, which was brutal. I mean if you watched the Jordan documentary, the Bulls  had Michael Jordan and they were like you're opinion don't matter were trading Scottie. If they did that to the biggest asset in the league, not jus the team but league, as they didn't care,  they absolutely won't care bout people like Lonzo Ball or Kyle Kuzma.   I can say with absolute certainty that Erving Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard to ever play the game. And that's from a Bad Boys Pistons fan. I know its blasphemous, but i think even Zeke would concede that.   If you're too young or jus never seen it, do yourself a favor and YouTube the Bird v Magic rivalry, cuz that will, ever be duplicated. Never! Im not trying to exaggerate, its seriously the best basketball you will ever watch. Period. Nothing comes close. The closest we ever came to since then was the Shaq and Kobe Lakers vs The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili San Antonio Spurs. But that still doesn't even come close, cuz Bird and Magic met in the finals in college and the NBA. Whenever they met or was all on the line. And both dominated their conferences with great teams. Even with freaking Kareem and James worthy and them boys on that team, Magic was Showtime! You watched cuz of Magic and what crazy shit you were gona see..."
"Midrange is dead today. The same problem Bulls would have guarding 7 screens on top of the key, Dubs would also have trying to guard a dude that pulls up as soon as he sees an opportunity, and is super-mega-efficient from there.   You can actually see how modern defenses are confused by mid-range jumpers that Lonnie Walker, Bogdan Bogdanovic (Hawks), or Kyrie often take, people freeze on those. Modern defenses guard for 3pt and for cuts, people are almost not taking mid-range jumpers at all and defenses ignore that possibility   MJ would feast on that."
"Despite the flair, Dirk is my favorite player and the Mavs were kinda my team in the early/mid 00s (living in Alaska nowhere near any teams, I was kinda in limbo between the MJ fandom as a little kid before settling on the Jazz when Boozer went there). So I definitely get it, lol. Got my Dirk jersey and saw Walker hit a game-winner at a Mavs@Sonics game that year."
"Legit no one is disrespecting KLove. I was purely comparing 2018 Kevin Love to 1995 Clyde Drexler, why are you changing the subject? Booker has sample size of 6 games bro, wtf are you even trying to prove here? You want to dive into ""empty stat"" (which I never said this was a case) players who take a deep dive in all statistic categories when they join a contender? Here is a list: Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, Melo.  Find my quote that says ""Lebron made his teammates stats/play better""? Are you just pulling shits out of your ass now? So you can squeeze some comments out?  &gt;Sure you can bring up the finals team Lebron went up against in 2018. The difference is Hakeem won.   &gt;   &gt;Also, the 1995 Magic are the only team who can say they Beat MJ Bulls in their prime.  Uh, yes you are comparing Hakeem's opponents to Lebron's, and it is embarrassing even trying to deny you are not. What the actual fk am I reading here?  No one acted like that, you just hate him so much and keep thinking this way. Whole 2016 Cavs roster did the job, every single member contributed. Stop it.  Stop hating, it is so embarrassing to read, very cringe."

"The draft lottery isn't rigged, and the Bobcats land Anthony Davis to pair with Kemba Walker.  Or we just draft some one not named Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  Or we accept that Celtics offer of four first rounders instead of taking Frank Kaminsky, aka a tall white guy that MJ loves so much.  Or a well-known one, the Hornets don't *trade Kobe Bean Bryant away*. Of course,big not, he would've ended up in New Orleans once they moved,bso technically he still wouldn't have much Kobe history in Charlotte basketball"
A lesser known player that’s insanely athletic is Lonnie Walker.  It almost looks like he glides like MJ when he runs with the ball.
"Many stars and hall of famers in the NBA never had and and don’t have the special skills or work ethic that would be required of them to make it that far if they were under 6’4.  A lot of pro hoopers hit the genetic lottery and had they not hit the genetic lottery they would be just another sucker like us. Basketball due to its above the rim nature shows this fact more glaringly than a lot other sports. This isn’t a knock on basketball ball players work ethic in general as it’s obvious the amount of running, weightlifting, skill development and mental toughness required to be exceptional at it but more just a fact when I look at careers like Andrew Bynum and Antoine walker. At 6 foot those dudes would have been bums that got bumped off the court in a heartbeat playing pick up ball. No athlete in history could ever top the work ethic of a MJ, Kobe, Ray Allen, Bill Russell, Steve Nash etc. Players like them worked harder in their sleep than most old school baseball players but sometimes basketball gives us an Oliver Miller and it just becomes so glaringly obvious that their genetics for height are the only reason they made it."
The Kenny Walker Flattop with the shaved lines on the side was the best NBA haircut ever I think.    2nd is the MJ shaved head- also rocked well by Vince Carter.
"If you want 'who had the best top talent' then 84 takes the throne with MJ, Charles, and Hakeem all going within top 5 picks.   Top 3 of Kobe, AI, Nash is a tier below MJ, Charles, and Hakeem.   But if you want 'which class was the best overall' then I think 96 easily takes the throne: Kobe, AI, Nash, Ray Allen, Camby, Marbury, Abdur-Rahim, Peja, Jermaine O'Neal, Big Z, Antoine Walker, Derek Fisher... Not to mention the undrafted Wallace.   Think from a GM's perspective - if you had a pick within top 5, you'd of course love 84 or 03. But if you just had a first rounder just in the lottery or outside the lottery? 96 takes it no brainer.   What makes a draft class good isn't just the top, but how deep it is."
MJ with Kemba Walker.
"This is a really weird comment, but I’m convinced this guy used to have a YouTube channel and uploaded a video called “NBA Gay Moments”. I promise that was the title. I have some distant memory of some commenter asking whether he was MJ Walker the highly touted young basketball player, and the person behind the account saying yes. This was like seven years ago"
"I’d love to be in the room when someone told MJ Reddit thinks Antoine Walker is beating him one on one, tho"
"He actually did hold his own against NBA players as a 16 year old sophomore.  &gt;He talked about crying when Jordan retired in 1993 as a nine-year-old who idolized MJ, and then recalled being a 16-year-old sophomore phenom who ended up in a pickup game with Jordan, Antoine Walker, Jerry Stackhouse, Paul Pierce, Penny Hardaway, and a number of the baby Bulls in the early 2000s.

"I picked the first player that popped into my mind without thinking twice, obviously I don't think Reggie Jackson is the greatest Piston of all time:  Mavs - Dirk   Nuggets - Jokic    Warriors - Curry    Rockets - Harden   Clippers - CP3    Lakers - Kobe    Grizzlies - Conley   Timberwolves - KAT   Pelicans - AD    Thunder - Westbrook    Suns - Nash   Trailblazers - Lillard    Kings - Bibby    Spurs - Kawhi   Jazz - Mitchell    Hawks - Young    Celtics - Tatum    Nets - KD   Hornets - Walker    Bulls - MJ    Cavs - LeBron    Pistons - Reggie Jackson    Pacers - PG    Heat - Wade    Bucks - Giannis    Knicks - Melo    Magic - Eric Gordon   Sixers - Embiid   Raptors - DeMar    Wizards - Wall"
"I personally don’t care for downvotes. People will downvote for whatever reason.   I just think it’s funny we take these stories and twist them as if Rich Paul is the decision maker of everything his client does. Why aren’t we talking about other agencies? What do other agencies do different than what Klutch Sports does?  He’s probably the most notorious agent in the NBA since probably David Falk, the agent most people associate with to MJ. Apparently, he had a lot of influence, especially during the 1999 NBA lockout and the least notable 1995 NBA lockout. Some of the biggest names in basketball at the time (i.e., Dikembe, Mourning, Juwan Howard) were involved in the negotiating committee. Even the NBPA President, Patrick Ewing, was a Falk client. He had other big names like Iverson, Marbury, and Antoine Walker.  Anyway, that’s besides the point. In the end, agencies have been around for decades. It’s just more recently that players use some of these agencies to gain more power in managing their careers the way they want it to be. The agencies have power, but the players are the ones who can determine how it’s being used. Sure, if what happened to Noel is true, then it’s really bad for Paul and Klutch. Otherwise, we’ll just have to see how it plays out. I’m on the outside looking in, but I’m not gonna make quick judgments until there’s more info."
Who are Jared Cunningham and MJ Walker?
"I remember part of the reason Antoine Walker went broke is tried to gamble like MJ, except MJ will make money in perpetuity until he dies so he can gamble whatever he wants. Toine's well went dry pretty fast."
MJ would average 40 ppg in today’s league…. and Antoine Walker would average like 75.
