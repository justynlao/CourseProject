"DC as a big city should have winning on it's radar. Every big city wants to have a winning sports team. Fortunately DC already has winning sports teams, just not in Basketball lol. But the annoying thing is that DC has the potential to have a great basketball team. Clearly two cornerstone players are here but right now the whole roster is a mixture of being a rebuilding project with pieces that want to contend. It's not right. It's a shame Atlanta absorbed such a high amount of FA last off season. Maybe someone changes their mind and decides to play in the nation's capital but really why bother when there are warmer cities that have cap space and the other north east cities are clearly contenders while DC just bumbles along with some of the best offensive players in the league.  Some of this has to do with just a bad FO though, like yes some of the young guys drafted have potential and some of them not showing their full ability falls on the coaching staff but good lord the supporting pieces, like could DC have made a better decision around what makes sense when you have a great offensive weapon already? Like yes bringing in Robin Lopez is supposed to boost defense a little bit but would it have been better to have taken Matisse Thybulle instead of Rui where Matisse looks like a defensive beast. Of course Rui still has potential and all that but man what is a guy like Raul Neto supposed to bring? A plug and play offensive player that is undersized and cannot do much else? Like is having him in addition to Ish Smith. Oh man and of course the year after we extend him Bertans the ""Latvian Laser"" is now shooting 32% from 3. Like wow if his production stays down low this long then that's an awful contract for a player that no longer has any upside."
Raul Neto
No Brazilian supermodel Raul Neto for this game
"tbh the only 'bad' losses have been to Chicago/Orlando and maybe yesterday with the hawks.    12 losses  - 5 were there ones mentioned above ... 3 of them were very close games though.  - Losses to NOP/HOU/SAS .. we were missing half our roster.  - Loss to MIA we were missing Westbrook/Beal and Bryant tore his ACL a couple minutes in.  - 2 Losses to 76ers were close ... Embiid became unstoppable .. and some bad offensive execution  - Loss to Celtics ... was kinda bad too since they were missing some bigs  ---  Overall a few key issues  - Scott Brooks is a moron.  - Offensive system consists of give the ball to Beal or Westbrook and watch them do something.  - Defense sucks to, players aren't great ... but coaching is pretty weak here.  - Rotations seems pretty bad. Brooks insists on playing 2-3 PG lineups. He also often decides to play Westbrook with Ish Smith, Robin Lopez, and Jerome Robinson for some reason.   - Lacking a good defensive big. Bryant was good offensively .. but clueless on defense. We actually looked better on defense with Lopez.  - Bad defenders in general.  - Westbrook is bad, focuses too much on rebounding and doubling  - Beal is AVG in my opinion, but sometimes looks disinterested in defense when the team is doing bad.  - Hachimura is a bit clueless on defense at times.   - Advija has good instincts, but he's still a rookie .. and slow at times.   - Bryant is just bad at defense, makes a highlight play every now and then.   - Most of our bench players are just bad at defense too ... Bertans (can only shoot 3s), Ish Smith / Raul Neto  (just too small), Matthews ( good effort, but a bit frantic)   - Lopez is good at times, but isn't athletic so ... can be a problem.   - Bonga is a decent defender ... but doesn't get playing time, fouls too much though"
I was getting Raul Neto flashbacks.
"Pfffft! If anyone is getting a go, it‚Äôs the GOAT üêê  *checks notes*  RAUL NETO!"
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
Did you see his teammates?? The starting lineup was Raul Neto Beal Isaac Bonga Jordan Bell and Robin Lopez... who else is supposed to fucking shoot lmao
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
"half our team is missing ...  although for some reason brooks played the other starters with Beal ... left our better offensive players on the bench    ... and played Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez with Russ ...  not sure how he hasn't been fired yet ..."
"People will say the Wizards, but we really should have expected with Scott Brooks as the coach.  We've been close down the stretch in pretty much all of our losses, if Brooks didn't put out brain dead lineups through the game it would help. Somehow thinks Westbrook will be good with Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez on the floor.    and TBH only the 2 losses to the magic/bulls each have been bad early in the season, were even unexpected. We've played a lot better since then.    Having close losses to the 76ers (2x), Celtics, and Heat (w/o Beal, Westbrook) .. aren't really bad losses."
"On our own teams? Well westbrook has supposed me negatively, Beal (as always), Raul Neto, and avdija have been playing well"
I'm not sure of your point? It's not ideal but he's still pushing the ball attacking the defense. Of course we'd want the percentages to be higher. Like...are you advocating for Raul Neto?
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
Raul Neto SZN
Raul Neto
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
Nah... It's already been said that BB was part of the decisions multiple times.   You're absolutely right... Shake was not this good at the beginning of last season. Although..... We had Trey Burke. We gave him almost no playing time and BB decided he wanted to keep Raul Neto instead.   Burke could've easily fit into the role shake occupies now. It's exactly what we needed... A ball handling guard that could create his own shot.
Probably not by much. Can‚Äôt coach a good offense when Josh Richardson and Raul Neto are the only guards on the team
"raul neto, bruno, felicio and didi in australia"
Don't forget Raul Neto - can't have enough 5'10 PGs on the court at the same time!
Did you just say Raul Neto is better than Russell Westbrook
"This might be the worst hot take I‚Äôve seen all year, Raul Neto is not very good"
Raul Neto
"Watching their games this year has been fascinating and infuriating   Entirely too much Jerome Robinson and Raul Neto (although Neto has been good). Especially when Brooks plays them next to Russ. Zero spacing.   Davis Bertans has basically been this team‚Äôs 8th option when everyone is healthy. I don‚Äôt think the front office signed him to that deal for him to be cast aside.   Troy Brown has disappeared, along with Isaac Bonga."
Not to mention it's one of the most appropriate ones to abbreviate given how long it is and the unique abbreviation. Big difference compared to calling Andre Drummond AD or Raul Neto RN
"I would actually love to hear your reasoning behind this comment. What has made you think he's awful? I have a feeling you're the kind of guy who checks the box score for a guys pts/reb/ast and makes a quick and firm judgment on their performance without checking their minutes, fg% or looking at the context of the game etc.   There's absolutely no excuse for playing him 15 mins in games like the Celtics one, where they were down 27. How can you play fucking Raul Neto over your lottery pick rookie who is better/bigger/stronger."
"Raul Neto is the best player on the team, trade everyone build around him"
There‚Äôs Raul Neto and Garrison Matthews
"Wiz winning this trap game with no Beal, Westbrook or Bryant against full strength Miami.  GOAT RAUL NETO AND GARRISON ‚ÄúMIAMI DESTROYER‚Äù MATHEWS GOING OFF TONIGHT!"
Why are we getting cooked by Raul Neto
The GOAT Raul Neto üêê
"Bro, no matter how much you may dislike Westbrook, how are you gonna tag this as ‚Äúserious‚Äù then suggest Ish Smith and Raul Neto are better than him lmfao. This is next level shitposting"
Raul Neto is handsome af  that is all
"We need an above average IQ coach and our roster would be fine. We‚Äôve got one of the best distributing point guard in the league and enough shooters to fill out the rest of the lineup. The problem isn‚Äôt any of the players, it‚Äôs the dude who plays Russ with Raul Neto and Ish Smith, the dude who sits Beal for a long stretch while he‚Äôs got 57 points in 3 quarters, the dude who loses us games is Scott brooks"
"Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Westbrook being in right now gives me aids cmon brooks"
"Brooks, no one wants to see Raul Neto."
Wiz undefeated in 2021!  WE ARE GOING 67-5! YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!  Also RAUL NETO IS THE GOAT üêê
Wizards are undefeated in 2021. We‚Äôre going 67-5.  They are just preparing for the meteoric rise of the GOAT RAUL NETO üêê
"CP3 and Kyrie can do a ""fake"" post up when the guy guarding them is a Raul Neto type and are unstoppable at it  Dragic used to post up a lot with Slovenia, never really did it in the NBA but he's skilled down there  Jrue is good at it really physical.  And then there is Russell Westbrook who basically scores everytime he actually uses physicality in the post, but loves his dirk fades and his face up bank shots way too much to be consistent down there  EDIT : ony the point guards here"
"Man, these dudes have also been claiming RAUL NETO is better than him LMAO"
Raul Neto is the GOAT! Wash your mouth out!
"Who the fuck is on the floor right now?? You have Jerome Robinson, Westbrook, Raul Neto together? With Bertans at forward?  Bruhhh"
"My favorite part is how many of these players the front offices cast aside because they got bored with waiting.  Jerami, Richaun, TJ, TLC  I get it though, we just really needed Raul Neto and Amir Johnson"
Wizards are 1-0 in 2021.  You‚Äôre in for a World of trouble Brooklyn! The Trophy is coming to DC courtesy of the GOAT üêê*Checks notes* RAUL NETO
"I've been watching the games and it feel like he's a totally different player than last year. It's really confusing to me why Russ suddenly takes so, so many mid-range shots (he's actually knocking them down at what feels a reasonably high %). Last year whenever he got matched up against a small guard, or the Rockets were in transition, Russ was basically guaranteed to attack the rim. Now even when he does drive, he passes out quite often.  Different system aside, as in, even when he's presented with similar opportunities, Russ is playing very differently than last year. Even looking at his teammates, Beal sure seems to have no problem attacking the rim, nor does Raul Neto."
"He has the worst head coach in the league, and probably the worst defensive roster in the league too. When Russ is on the court with Raul Neto, Ish Smith, Troy Brown, and Thomas Bryant for stretches of time.... How are they expected to score more points than they give up? Whatever Russ and Beal do at one end is immediately negated at the other end. They're what people thought the Hawks would be this year on defense lol"
"Honestly it kinda has to do with lineups sometimes.. I only follow occasionally when other games are on commercial but I‚Äôm seeing rotations of RW, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Jerome Robinson, and Robin Lopez???? Like Beal, Hachimura, Bryant, Avidja, Bertans are ALL on the bench. You‚Äôre telling me Brooks can‚Äôt rotate a couple of these dudes to play with Westbrook? I swear I‚Äôve seen RW/Smith/Neto a handful of times and I‚Äôm just... so confused."
"Deni looked amazing on both sides of the ball, great to see. Raul Neto deserves every single minute that Ish Smith gets. Thomas Bryant looks great on offence, but might be the worst defensive center I‚Äôve ever seen. And the team looks way better when Bertans is hitting shots and Rui is doing what he does."
You can have Cade.  We already have the GOAT üêê *Raul Neto*
Raul Neto
"Damn, Westbrook has had too much help and instead decides to ignorantly play ‚ÄúWestball.‚Äù  The Wizards have so many weapons in their starting lineup like  Raul Neto Garrison Matthews Rui Hachimura Alex Len"
John Stockton passed it to Karl Malone to get 15 assists a game. Russ did it with raul neto. üêêüêê
If Raul Neto is your 5th best player then you‚Äôre probably screwed
"Again, you are making things up.   So yesterday he broke the record. After breaking it, he put up 10/11/6 in the fourth quarter. Was he still chasing numbers then too?   He didn‚Äôt average a triple double with fucking Harden because Harden was the playmaker and they used Russ as a scorer. Did he average a triple double? No. Did he average 27 points? Yes. He wasn‚Äôt the primary ball handler and his job was too capitalize off Harden getting doubled and then run in transition. Why would he need to put him gaudy assist numbers if they have an elite playmaker already. They made it farther because they had James Harden and Kevin Durant with elite roleplayers. Not Beal and Raul Neto.   Do the Wizards have another elite playmaker? No.   And Westbrook with KD became an immensely better passer between the years of 2017-2019. Not to mention pace.   What makes your argument even worse is the Wizards we‚Äôre trash at the beginning of the season. Westbrook was NOT averaging a triple double, he averaged 22 6 and 6 in the first month of the season.   Yet now, when he‚Äôs averaging 23/14/14 in the last month, they just happened to go on a crazy win streak?   Everything is telling you you wrong and yet you still refuse to believe it. Like y‚Äôall have to understand there are people who are consistently watching these games."
"Subtle? it was a completely different game, the NBA looked ""weird"" not because they were bad but because it was different.  Obviously some guys would flourish but Raul Neto being a HoFer is wild."
"Lmfao this is what I was thinking, like imagine Raul Neto was like ‚Äúwe got guys hurting their tailbones to keep up with Beal‚Äù people would want him executed"
He could have played like prime MJ or like Raul Neto in the playoffs. It still would have nothing to do with the mvp race.
Raul Neto one of the cutest guards in the league bow down
With alex len and raul neto starting üíÄ
Daniel Gafford Davis Bertans  Raul Neto  All these guys are pretty important to why the Wizards are hot right now
Raul Neto???
Where‚Äôs Raul neto :( carried the wiz tonight
"Lmaooooo y‚Äôall lost to us when Beal was playing like trash, Russ fouled out and Siakam had 40+ and was getting whatever he wanted??? That was the makings of a SoWiz game and by the grace of Robin Lopez and Raul Neto we won that shit lol"
"The rest of that team is dogshit, they have raul neto starting"
If only they could play Ish Smith and Raul Neto in Russ‚Äô place. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be at the top of the East instead.
Everybody says he's the prettiest player but people have you even heard of Raul Neto smh
"I like Raul Neto, but Len has proved time and again he can‚Äôt be in the core rotation of a successful franchise."
Raul Neto is good filha da puta
Raul Neto is top 25 in defensive RAPTOR.
Raul Neto revenge timeline confirmed?
"They aren't but the Wizards still start Raul Neto and Alex Len. I'm not shitting on the Wizards. They just don't have a great roster outside of Russ, Rui and Beal.  We both know this."
FUCK RAUL NETO
"| Brooks had drawn up a play, but when the huddle broke, he looked at the clock. He had 50 more seconds before the horn blew. He called Westbrook over. ‚ÄúRussell,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat do you think about this?‚Äù Westbrook had other ideas: Put big man Daniel Gafford in one corner, ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôre not going to switch off him,‚Äù Westbrook told Brooks. Then put guard Raul Neto in the right corner. Story continues below advertisement  ‚ÄúThat gives us a better chance to get a good shot out of this,‚Äù Westbrook said. ‚ÄúAfter the game, I thought about it,‚Äù Brooks said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòWow, it‚Äôs totally changed.‚Äô Sometimes, he‚Äôs coaching me.‚Äù"
"&gt;Russ averaged 22 on 36% in the playoffs against Dame, while Dame had 33 on 46%  Yeah but Russ also averaged 9 rebounds and 11 assists. Him being able to get his teammates involved is why he didn't get swept, unlike Dame against the freaking Pelicans.  &gt;Or the fact that Dame ts% is 60 this season while Russ is 50%  Westbrook is shooting 43.7% on FGs this year, Lillard is shooting 43.3%. You're just cherrypicking true shooting because it favors players who jack up a bunch of 3s.  &gt;Dame 20-11 in clutch games, Russ 14-14.  Well Westbrook has to play with Raul Neto, Alex Len, and Davis Bertans as role players. Lillard gets Powell, Covington, and Nurkic as role players so obviously he's gonna have a better record."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4. Jakob Poeltl 5. Joel Embiid 6. Myles Turner 7. Mike Conley 8. Derrick White 9. Alex Caruso 10. Rudy Gay 11. Nicolas Batum 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Andre Drummond 14. Jae Crowder 15. Larry Nance Jr. 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Isaiah Stewart 18. Khem Birch 19. Raul Neto 20. Nerlens Noel  A few oddities (Gay, Drummond, Neto) but overall not that bad.  -  ---  -  And then here are the 20 players with the highest **BBall Index D-LEBRON** (min. 1,000 minutes):   1. Rudy Gobert 2. Myles Turner 3. Clint Capela 4. Robert Covington 5. Nerlens Noel 6. Matisse Thybulle 7. Jakob Poeltl 8. Alex Caruso 9. Larry Nance Jr. 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo 11. Brook Lopez 12. Draymond Green 13. Joel Embiid 14. Ben Simmons 15. Tobias Harris 16. Jae Crowder 17. Andre Drummond 18. Kent Bazemore 19. Nicolas Batum 20. Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
Wizards have a chance with Raul Neto
Both teams.  Wizards would be shit with Klay and no playmaker to get him the ball. You think Klay drops 37 in a quarter with Raul Neto passing to him?  Warriors don't move on from Klay for an aging Westbrook.
"I mean we're currently running Russ, Beal, and Raul Neto 1-3 so it wouldn't be much worse."
"We‚Äôll never be able to really tell when he plays next to Alex Len, Ish Smith, Garrison Matthews and Raul Neto.   Currently there‚Äôs no way to tell his value as a first or second option because the Wizards haven‚Äôt put a decent roster around him."
"Or Raul Neto, Garrison Matthews, Ish Smith, Alex Len  By the way, 2 of these players start for the Wizards and the other 2 play rotation minutes for the Wizards"
Y'all sleeping on mid goat Raul neto
Love Raul Neto.
"i haven't seen the Wiz on this win streak, but are they seriously winning with a starting lineup of Alex Len, Anthony Gill, and Raul Neto?"
The Wizards' Big Three Era is here.  Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal.  Daniel Gafford.  (shoutout to raul neto he been fire these last games)
"and how is he ignoring the team success? has he not led an empty OKC team to the playoffs? he is now taking the fucking Washington Wizards with players like Garrison Matthews, Raul Neto and Alex Len to the playoffs  everybody is talking about Curry winning MVP when GSW has 4 more wins on the season than Wizards. nobody is talking about Westbrook because he made triple doubles the new everyday normal, he is that ridiculous  &gt;he would just benefit greatly from better shot selection.  it aint that bad, it's just a narrative constantly being thrown around from casuals and haters. man is leading the league in clutch fg%"
"With Alex Len and Raul Neto in the starting 5, no less"
"Thomas Bryant, Bertans, Hachimura, Garrison Matthews, Raul Neto. Any of them."
"Gobert is actually really good friends with Raul Neto (former Jazz player, currently with the Wizards). Gobert even came to Brazil with Raul in the offseason a couple of years ago."
Can we get some Raul Neto appreciation?
"ah yes, the shootout everyone was expecting coming into tonight: kelly oubre vs raul neto"
"Lets not hate on Beal now. ik wizards are the 11th seed, but Beal has been outstanding. Yes westbrook has the ability to carry the team, and he still has it, but when you look at this team, its supporting cast is worse than the 2016-17 Thunder one. I mean cmon' really? Raul Neto as your backup PG? And obviously Thomas Bryant is out for the rest of the season which is A HUGE blow to the wizards he was doing really good. Along that with Covid and you cant really say Beal is the least impactful scorer"
"That you should put some respect on the name of Raul Neto, clearly."
"I don't trust these all-in-one metrics. Last year Kyle Lowry was ranked 12th. This year he's ranked 94th, between Rudy Gay and Raul Neto. What am I supposed to make of that?"
"Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Raul Neto, Harden"
kuzma (chaos)  kevin love (i think he's engaged but he looks like every bachelor ever)  terry rozier (all-nba best smile)  raul neto (self explanatory)
"Hill would be great but I assume he will have other suitors as well. Ben is the only PG in the rotation and he's really a point forward. We're starving here.  PGs the Sixers have had in the Embiid/Simmons era: TJ, Fultz, Point Jimmy, Raul Neto, this season literally no one"
There's also a willingness to actually rotate the guys on the bench instead of sticking with one guy who's clearly ineffective with Doc here. I remember Brett's incessant need to shoehorn Raul Neto in there.
"I have been saying this. We payed Raul Neto and Trey Burke more money combined than TJ makes. In all seriousness, the 2020 sixers were in dire need of a good locker room guy/leader and TJ could‚Äôve done that. He had more pull over Joel and Ben than Brett Brown."
Move over with this Oubre shit it's Raul Neto
I love Raul Neto
How can u watch that game and say that he had a great game?  Raul Neto just had a better game and more impact with way less shots and smart plays
Raul Neto &gt; Campazzo Brasil&gt; Argentina
raul neto fan club
awesome play. love me some raul neto.
I think you mean Jazz legend Raul Neto
Raul 'Bandito' Neto
Lakers are making the Sixer reject Raul Neto look like Gary Payton lmaooo
Dudes getting bullied by Raul Neto Lmao
THT flexing like he didnt just block Raul Neto
That boy Raul Neto is going for 40 I just know it
"The biggest thing tonight was that he was really good on defense, possibly the best defender on the wizards team tonight. Managed to keep dame locked up. Never thought I would say that lol  And if anyone is wondering dame went on his big run when Raul neto was mainly guarding him"
He currently has a negative on/off. Which should be criminal when his backups are fucking raul neto and ish smith.
Raul Neto robbed
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."
Why would somebody stand up the chad that is Raul Neto
If this happened I could definitely see Beal giving Raul Neto awkwardly long hugs before every game.
"It‚Äôs worse when you look at the scoring. They only won those games because of defense, and Raul Neto is clearly not 15 points better defensively than Westbrook, who has actually been solid since coming back from the injury on that end.   But hey, it sounds good"
"Why don‚Äôt people just add context?  In the games they win without Westbrook, it‚Äôs because the other team scoring goes down.    Against the Heat, they held them to 100 Against the Sun, they held them to 107 TWolves, 109 Bulls, 101  They won all those games because of defense/teams being cold.   If you think Raul Neto is 14.7 points better than Westbrook on defense, which he isn‚Äôt, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you"
We already have the GOAT RAUL Neto üêê   This isn‚Äôt amateur hour!
So the Wizards need to play Ish Smith or Raul Neto more right? Who takes Westbrook's minutes if playing him is making them lose?
"People give Brooks all kinds of (deserved) shit but IMO a lot of this falls on the GM.  Why in the world did we sign a FREE AGENT Raul Neto when we already had Westbrook and Ish on the team. Having Neto inserted into the rotation blew up Troy Brown Jr's development as a ball handler, and now Deni's. Makes no sense to stunt your young players like that for a player as irrelevant as Neto."
"Man it takes big balls to watch his team play every game, if I were in your shoes I‚Äôd straight up give up on the team until next season &amp; he‚Äôs gone  It infuriates me that he plays Ish Smith - Raul Neto - Westbrook together and I‚Äôm not even a wiz fan"
Cause developing Raul Neto and Ish Smith is clearly more important
Raul Neto managed to screw up both offensively and defensively all in the span of less than 10 seconds
"Lmao that Raul Neto Flop and the end, got crossed over, felt a bit of an elbow from Trent and concurrently was shot by a sniper."
That was a nice punch he threw on Raul Neto
Raul Neto trying to play/act like a fool on both ends
If only Raul Neto was guarding him smh
Raul ‚ÄúFish‚Äù Neto
I have a hard time getting behind rotation complaints when the guys we are suggesting to play more are Raul Neto and Garrison Matthews
"Wizards not named Russel Westbrook, Raul Neto, or Robin Lopez had a combined eFG% of 28.95."
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
"Any serviceable ball handler or wing would do wonders for this team, when Raul Neto is arguably your 4th most important player you are fucked"
"The Celtics. As a sixers fan I find it funny when Celtics fans bring up the fact that they swept us in the playoffs last year when we didn‚Äôt have Ben Simmons, Brett brown was our coach, we had al horford starting, and our bench was Kyle oquinn,James Ennis, mike Scott, and Raul NetoüòÇ"
"My 5 favorite players are all on the Jazz, so just for fun, I'll compose my team from other franchises:  PG: Raul Neto   SG: Ricky Rubio   SF: Malcolm Brogdon   PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo   C: Steven Adams  Greek Freak carries this team to a playoff position in the East, but there's probably not enough shooting for a playoff run."
"1) Isaac Bonga (he is in the dog house)  2) Garrison Mathews  3) Jerome Robinson. Lol, he should be cut  4) Deni Avdija. Goofy looking European dandy who gets no respect from the refs and is oblivious to NBA foul drawing tricks as a rookie, and thus is much less effective than he should be    5) Raul Neto  6) Rui  ...  15) Davis Bertans"
Fuck.  What title you winning with Raul Neto as your 4th best player
How many wins do you think the Wizards would have without Westbrook? Raul Neto is their backup PG
"This is not only an embarrassment but a very dangerous precedent if they let it happen.  Post all-star break literally every team with good players should find a way to 'sit them down to examine the players behind them'.  Wanna see Bradley Beal?  Sorry Raul Neto might be a developing rotation player in a few years.  Wanna see KAT? Naz Reid needs to work on passing out of the post, come back next season... and so on."
"Simmons was our only PG on the roster unless you want to count Raul Neto. We had to play Alec Burks 30 minutes a night. If you think that the Sixers still get swept if Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt get hurt, you‚Äôre being irrational."
"Is that your argument now? That you beat the TJ McConnell 76ers once and then again when Ben Simmons was out and their only PG was Raul Neto?  Keep bouncing around, I'm sure you'll find a decent argument if you stay at it long enough."
Shit defence and maybe shit lineups  Doesn‚Äôt he play with fucking Ish Smith and Raul Neto for significant parts of the game
Raul Neto the goat PG
Raul Neto is having a quarter
"Raul Neto was born in Brazil, Lopez's parents are Cuban."
You do realize that half the population of brazil and cuba has european ancestors? In what universe is Raul Neto not white?
or raul neto lmao. one is cuban one is brazillian.
Raul Neto is literally the best player in the NBA dude
The GOAT **RAUL NETO**
Where tf is Raul Neto?
"No point making comments like that when you don't watch the team.    The team lacked depth last year. We were starting players like Raul Neto (at SF) and Alex Len in the playoffs ... we actually had 0 playable SFs after Avdija got injured.    Didn't acquire stars, but got much needed quality depth  - Not a fan of Dinwiddie ... but he led a much worse Nets roster to the playoffs.  - KCP/Kuzma still played important roles on the Lakers championship team ... they're solid role players  - Harrell is 1 year away from winning 6th man of the year ... he was part of the Clippers team that made the playoffs with no stars."
"1. If your star player doesn't want to leave, you probably don't trade him 1. Some teams their goal is to make the playoffs. 1. Probably a 8-10 seed, but IMO the team is still better than last year   - Scott Brooks being gone improves the team a lot ... he single handedly lost many games last year.  - We started Raul Neto in the playoffs last year ... Regardless of what you think of Kuzma ... he's better than Raul Neto ...  - Actually we started a lot of players ... who aren't going to be in the league next year or .. are bench warmers like ..... Alen Len, Mo Wagner, Jerome Robinson, Isaac Bonga, Garrison Matthews ... etc. Depth was a big problem.      I actually think Wizards are set to be a pretty good regular season team ... Players like Harrell (Clippers) /Dinwiddie (Nets) were able to play major roles on mediorce rosters that got to the playoffs ... now they get to do it with a player like Beal.   There's promising young players on the roster like Hachimura, Avdija, Gafford, Bryant, and Kispert ... so its more about consistently winning. Like the oldest player on the roster is 28 ... there's plenty of room to grow."
"I mean Raul Neto has a career average of 5.6/1.5/1.9 - there are guards that are his size that are top guards now and in the past (cp3, Trae, AI, Nash, mark price, etc) - this take is hot but doesn‚Äôt make sense"
"Warriors won‚Äôt win a championship again with their  core 3  Zion will have a better season than AD in 2021-2022  Eric Bledsoe isn‚Äôt hot dog ass like everyone in this sub thinks, but he‚Äôs definitely still a lower tier PG  Although I feel bad for Kings fans, I want the Kings to be bad every year just so the league has a punching bag  Lakers should retire George Mikan‚Äôs number   If Raul Neto was 3 inches taller he‚Äôd be a top 7 guard   Take Jamal Murray off Denver and his production and stats would take a big hit"
"We started Raul Neto at SF in the playoffs against the 76ers ... Bonga was healthy and got 0 minutes ... should say enough.  He is 21 though, so its still possible for him to improve. He was much better in 19-20 than in 20-21."
"You won't joke about this when you remember that Scott Brooks is now one of your coaches.    It's allllll fun and games until you look up and see Troy Brown, Westbrook, Raul Neto &amp; Ish Smith all playing together [actually happened]."
Easy answer.  I‚Äôll take **25 time MVP RAUL NETO** üêê
Don‚Äôt do the **GOAT RAUL NETO** like that.
"We will give you **checks notes**   The GOAT Raul Neto in return for Dame‚Ä¶.  Wait‚Ä¶.no actually, we‚Äôre good. Can‚Äôt trade the 25 x MVP for Dame."

"These models just don't work for defensive stats.   For example, according to RAPTOR Raul Neto was a better defender than Ben Simmons last season."
"I understand everyone loves Kemba and he was special in Charlotte, but he was never better than Westbrook. Rose before his injury, yes, but that Rose is long gone. The sum of current Kemba + current Rose isn't better than Westbrook + Raul Neto or basically any other backup PG.    Yeah, WB can't shoot, bad shot selection, bla bla bla. He is still a solid player that the Rockets gave up the farm for just two offseasons ago."
"His percentages with the Wiz are completely irrelevant. The sample size is too small.   He is also really not a good defender at all, despite having good size.   Also playing 15 minutes for a Wiz team that had no decent option at SF, especially after Deni went down is not some achievement. If he was even half decent, he'd have played a major role for us since we were hungry for a 3&amp;D wing. Instead, Raul f'in Neto was a better option at the starting 3 spot.  Lastly, he can't stay healthy to save his life.   I guarantee you that not even the Spurs will be able to turn this kid into a positive value NBA player."
"You idiots clearly lack reading comprehension, I didn‚Äôt say Kuzma=Ingram max him. I said Ingram  became a max player when he stopped playing with Lebron. And that Kuzma could redeem himself next year in a new setting.  Y‚Äôall literally act like a heliocentric offense has never stifled a players performance before. Kuzma clearly has the tools to be an nba player and now he‚Äôs going to an offense that managed to make Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Davis Bertrans, and Daniel Gafford look good.   Talk y‚Äôall shit bruh. The fact that I‚Äôm defending Kuzma against Laker fans says all you need to know about current Laker fandom. Y‚Äôall might be the most toxic fan base in the league right now."
You forgot Raul Neto
Raul fucking Neto dude
Not even the prettiest player in the NBA   Have people not seen Raul Neto smh
I love this because it‚Äôs not Raul Neto.
"Well, Brussino, Deck and Vildoza should still handle at least another Olympic cycle, as well as Campazzo. I doubt Argentina will challenge for a medal in Paris, but at least they will be in Paris.   Try being in your neighbor, where your players are either retiring (Garcia, Huertas, Varej√£o), refusing to play in the NT (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, RAUL NETO) or just won't gain minutes because our dumbass HC hates the local league (Georginho, Gui). If we qualify for the WC it will be a victory, Olympics is an impossible dream."
"Too early to call it in. We‚Äôre getting Frankie, Patty or Raul Neto. And of course RICHAUN HOLMES"
The GOAT **RAUL NETO**
"2013 had Raul Neto, Peyton Siva and Ricky Ledo which is not a good second round. You're welcome."
"Compared to George Hill's corpse, Raul Neto, the Markelle Fultz experience. It can't be overstated how down bad we are here"
I raise you the real GOAT **RAUL NETO**
I raise you the **GOAT RAUL NETO** and the Brooklyn Nets killer Garrison Matthews.
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards‚Äô season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  ‚ÄúThis is not a run-it-back team,‚Äù he said.  Now, it‚Äôs official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday‚Äôs NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won‚Äôt become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook‚Äôs outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose r√©sum√© includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he‚Äôs done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team‚Äôs culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal‚Äôs closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards‚Äô preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what‚Äôs now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming ‚Äî especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie‚Äôs incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn‚Äôt all. The Wizards‚Äô Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards‚Äô list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer‚Äôs free agency class is rich with capable point guards ‚Äî from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte‚Äô Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it‚Äôs confusing, but that‚Äôs not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They‚Äôre adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford ‚Äî though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it‚Äôs difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
"Lakers missing rebounds with Drummond, AD and LeBron?  Ahahahah... come on bro, don't do this to me... I'll love seeing Westbrook and Drummond fight for uncontested rebounds thinking that makes them a valuable asset in winning games yes. Ahahaha, unbelievable.  I will somewhat grant you 'assists', though. Lakers need other on-ball playmakers outside of Bron, but Westbrook brings too many negatives elsewhere it's not worth the investment... You're telling me the Lakers couldn't trade for or find someone like Rondo on the market without giving up everything in the process? I'll take Raul Neto from the Wizards before i take Westbrook... Not as good of a playmaker but not as many sabotaging weaknesses."
"They‚Äôre upgrades for the Wizards and are all going to be able to do more given a bigger role. Washington‚Äôs bench was Ish Smith, Raul Neto and Robin Lopez in the playoffs."
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
He's a SG or sometimes an SF depending on the lineup.  We literally don't have ball handlers and passers lol...Ish Smith and Raul Neto are our free agents and they are both 3rd stringers at best.
SF Raul Neto üòÇ üòÇ just Scott brooks things
"Raul Neto, Alec Burks"
"Otto Porter will definitely be better than people think he is when he is not making ridiculous money. This will now be called the Nic Batum effect where a lowering of a salary, role and expectations combine with a fresh start to make a player better. Only 27 years old  Elfrid Payton will be solid guard depth for a team, maybe the knicks again. He is only 27 and scored 10 points a game every year since after his rookie year  Luke Kornet in the right situation could serve a Boban, but with a 3 point shot role of limited minutes and high efficiency on a low salary. Only 26 and he is 7' 2''  Raul Neto will succeed as a backup guard if a team has some players who can shoulder the offensive load."
"You didn‚Äôt include the **Raul Neto** equation.  Wherever the GOAT goes, that team will win. Biggest offseason ever for the biggest Unrestriced Free Agent ever!  He carried my shit Wizards from 15th to 8th in half a season from the bench. Imagine if he was given a starting role?  That team wouldn‚Äôt lose a single game."
&gt;free up opportunities for the Wizards‚Äô young players  Ish Smith and Raul Neto? Because off the top of my head they're the only other ballhandlers on that roster
"That's because they replaced Ish Smith and Raul Neto, two 6'0, basically vet-min players with Westbrook.  Westbrook does provide ""value"" when he's replacing literal trash."
&gt; Raul Neto  The Prodigal Hombre returns
"Raul Neto can also dribble the ball up the court, and competently run a second unit in the regular season.   There are plenty of players that could take the strain of LeBron that don‚Äôt cost 44 million dollars. Lakers need to use every bit of their resources to create the best 7-man unit for late playoff rounds. Best way to do that is with shooters who actually willing to defend."
The money doesn‚Äôt line up there. More likely it‚Äôd be Simmons + Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle + a second round pick for Beal + Raul Neto or something like that
"You guys dont even like Russ lol. I really dont see the wizards game plan here. They have russ and beal plus a bunch of OK role players in rui, and gafford but the rest of the team is awful. They played guys like Raul Neto, Robin Lopez and Ish Smith who wouldnt even see floor time on a normal playoff team.   Theres no substance or end goal for the wizards besides a first round exit. And if a team is offering you kuz+THT and then for Beal picks with a young player along with the incentive to develop your young guys deni, rui, gafford, kuz, Bryant THT, your pick this year and next year you do it. Tell me please how thats a bad deal instead of settling for the 7th or 8th seed you are so gungho about?"

Raul Neto rebounding for him. Glad to see he's keeping busy.
PG: Raul Neto  SG: Paul George  SF: Kelly Oubre Jr  PF: Maxi Kleber  C: Sergi Ibaka
"We had a sequence of competent, honest-to-God teams. Oscar is a european God, all-time scorer in the Olympics and, although this doesn't mean a lot, a personal idol of Kobe. He was selected to the Nets, but chose to play in Europe due to the prohibition of NBA players defending their NT (what also pushed away other Euro stars). After him, we had a decent generation, led by some players with moderate NBA success (Nen√™, Splitter, Leandro Barbosa, Varej√£o). We more often than not played 2nd fiddle to Argentina, and we are far from being a powerhouse like we are in soccer and volleyball, but we don't suck. This generation is yet to establish, and I believe a Georginho/Gui Santos/Raul Neto squad will be able to lead us to Paris in 2024."
"Everyone felt their absentees, but ours were worst because our depth sucks. We had to trot 41-years old Huertas because since Raul Neto decided to stay resting in DC, he was our only ball handler with international experience. Not being able to play Didi when Marquinhos retired was bad, but our wings actually stepped up big time. Then again, we would be slaughtered if Schroder and Kleber plays for Germany.   Yesterday's defeat rest solely on the shoulders of Petrovic, who had a hot Georginho, one of the best players locally, and decided to sit him and run an almost retired Huertas and a Benite that was bricking everything."
"About Brazil, yes. First Oscar hard carried us, then we had the Nen√™/Barbosa/Splitter/Varej√£o/Huertas generation, but we never really contested anything. We ranged from participants to chokers, but we never had a true shot at anything. I mean, our biggest men basketball moment, outside of some success in the 60s, is either beating the US in the 1987 Pan-Americans, when they sent a college team (but David Robinson was on that team, so there you go) and not being humiliated by the Dream Team in 92. We have some success in Pan-American games, but even those are secondary. I mean, the best US players in our last 2 Pan-American golds were Ellington (2007) and Brogdon (2015). Argentina also usually sent mixed teams, while we went with our full strength.  Our women's basketball has a slightly better Olympics history, with Paula/Hort√™ncia generation, but nothing beyond this.  We will dive into a painful rebuild, now. Our local league has some good players, that Petrovic either decided to ignore (Lucas Mariano), to rot on the bench (Georginho) or was ignored (Gui Santos, who wants to enter this year's NBA Draft). It also doesn't help that our best NBA player in the NBA, Raul Neto, isn't a huge fan of being in the NT. Unless something change, our ceiling is a group stage elimination in Paris 2024."

"Wizards lost their starting center for the season and then were still going with a 3-center rotation.    They started Raul Neto at SF in the playoffs.    Zach Harper:  ""I predict they'll draft a slow-footed center [Sengun]"""
"Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, Raul Lopez, Raul Neto, Raul Ibanez"
"Raul Neto will always be loved in Utah. I feel like Jae Crowder gets a lot of love from us. I feel like Rubio will always be liked here, but that might just be me."
At the end of the season raul neto and beal/russ were injured but there was hardly any news on neto even though he missed a few games
They have the MLE. I'd rather spend 5m on TJ Mcconnell or Raul Neto then 30m on Schroder.
"I knew I was forgetting someone, I love Varej√£o. One of the few that always brought his A game to the national squad and the only NBA-based player that chose to defend us in the Pre-Olympic tournament (Raul Neto and Didi decided to decline and focus on next season. I mean, they are not a lock for a roster spot, so I understand, but it bums me a lot and basically kills our chances to qualify for the Olympics). Need to fix that."
Raul Neto. Nuff said.
Beal/Westbrook/Hachimura are iso players who excel at midrange ... adding another to that doesn't seem like the best use of resources.  But obviously Derozen is better than having to start Raul Neto. Hopefully Advija can take a step forward next year. He definitely showed signs at times of developing into a good player.
I think we'd be a lot better if we didn't have Raul Neto starting at SF :l    .. Westbrook/Beal is kind of a rough pairing though .. because they both coast on defense and are pretty ball dominant. And Hachimura is kinda the same.
"Ben Simmons has real problems but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a hot take to suggest he could add some value to a shake Milton, Josh Richardson, Alec Burks, Raul Neto rotation."
We‚Äôve gone all in to invest in our Superstar player and champion of DC.  *Raul Neto* üêê
Maybe like a worse Raul Neto.
"Not only Simmons had a terrible game 5, today he is the definition of low effort.  Just trade this fucking bum for Raul Neto"
Lakers aren't cute enough to share the same court as the Wizards.  I put Raul Neto up vs any jabroni they got
Okay for some reason I thought the git shit down on the play in . But regaurdless Russ was clutch in that time . His fg % was good for him and he was really playing some team ball while still stuffing the stat sheets . ( shout out Raul Neto too underrated in that run for you guys )
They probably wouldn't have made the playoffs without Raul Neto (or a bunch of other guys) either since their margin for making it was so thin.  People act like they had some massive transformation when they went from 10th the previous season to 8th with a 34-38 record.
"Lol bro Wizards are just a deep team man with Spencer Dinwiddie, Kuzma, Harrell, etc.  Westbrook was starting with Raul Neto at SF and Alex Len at Center.   Gafford was an extremely late acquisition that didn't even start.  I'd say the Wiz now have a real team with depth where the starting 5 are pretty legit.   Wizards didn't need guys like John Wall and Westbrook taking up $45 million of salary. Spreading it across Kuzma, Harrell, Dinwiddie were the right moves."
Well they have a better starting back court in beal/dinwiddie and Raul Neto is a really good backup. Maybe the hawks are deeper though.
"I‚Äôm excited to him in NYC and I think with a different role and 9 mill a year contract he can turn things around, but the wizards game last night made me really believe everything Boston fans have been saying. He got blown by on every defensive possession, he made Raul Neto look like Bradley Beal on offense"

"Beal had a knee contusion in the first or second quarter so he couldn't play. Granted we were playing our bench guys for the vast majority of the game, for gods sake Raul ""Iverson"" Neto dropped a 25 piece on like 10/12 shooting or something"
We were finally able to contain MVP contender Raul Neto
You mean Raul Neto and Kispert aren't starting!
good W by the wizards. also raul neto went wild
"He‚Äôs a huge reason why we were 17-32 to begin with. Idk how you can act like he deserves all of the credit, but none of the blame for them struggling. Raul Neto was giving us much better minutes at the PG spot than Russ was earlier in the season."
"Their depth is mainly from their wings.   Point guards - Dinwiddie is the obvious starter, Raul Neto and Aaron Holiday  are both backups but Neto was already the wizards backup and Holiday will just be pushed down the rotation. He wasn't a particularly good backup PG but he'll be a batter than average third string PG.  SG's - Beal starter (duh), KCP can easily be 6th man too. Kispert is a rookie who'll get minutes but I doubt anything major to start off. Gill is a third stringer so far as a second league player.  Wings - Rui is the obvious starter, Kuzma and Bertans will be getting major minutes and they have completely different skillsets. Deni should also get solid minutes as a backup who was also a starter in half the games he played.   Big men - Gafford is their main big men, Byrant and Harrell would be good big men depth but Bryant is coming back from injury (and who knows how long until he's back in form) so Harrell is basically main backup till then. Todd is a second round rookie who will unless he impresses just be a third stringer.   Assuming Bertans is starting, having KCP and Kuzma off the bench is great wing depth and pretty strong 6/7th men."
"Maybe 12 of us.  But since you asked, here goes  While Russ did do a drag job last season, him and Beal alone with basically no depth can‚Äôt get us past the first round.  Especially not from the play-in.  So we got out of Russ contract and got KCP, Kuz, and Trez back.  Plus with other moves In this same deal, we turned the 22nd pick and a 2024 second round pick into Aaron Holiday and Dinwiddie.  Which is a solid haul for one getting out of that contract which made no sense for our team right now, and getting some young talent or trade filler later depending how this coming season goes.   So if we boil that down, we got out of the Wall contract from 2 years ago, and turned it into what I list.  We fired Scott Brooks and hired Wes Unseld Jr.  Who is a great young first time coach ready to get to work.  Had a pretty decent draft and We are getting Thomas Bryant and Deni Avdija back from injury plus re-signed Raul Neto.  We still have Beals decision hanging out there but something will happen with that soon.   So yea I‚Äôd say the Wizards got better this off season."
"Woah woah woah. Reality check, this roster isn‚Äôt very good save for your trio of big men and Brad - Raul Neto and Aaron holiday are barely nba role players, and are at best the 12th man on a championship team. KCP sucked of the teet that was the bubble lakers, and is simply a role player. Rui hachimura is an empty stats scorer that is probably unplayable in a playoff game due to being a tweener on defense. I‚Äôm not totally dead on Kuz, I could see him putting some things together honestly. Deni is totally unproved. Mr Lazer is unplayable if he‚Äôs not hitting 40 foot bombs."

It would definitely be someone totally random.  Not a star.  Like Raul Neto or Royce O‚ÄôNeale.
"I'm not saying they're good but this is the list, excluded Joel of course, since Ben got mad whenever the sixers tried to sign other point guards.  Seth Curry  Shake Milton  TJ McConnell  JJ Redick  Alex Burks  Raul Neto  Markell Fultz"
When they were starting Raul Neto you mean?
"I am a fan of Raul Neto, so maybe you should fuck off?"
Dawg u dont even know who Raul Neto is. You‚Äôre not even watching the video. Watch the third clip and tell me how Evan Fournier fucks up.   https://youtu.be/BOTGrk3ypN0  WATCH IT.
The Raul Neto disrespect!
The Sixers' backup point guards in this span were Raul Neto and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Their backup centers were Al Horford and Dwight Howard.
"The Latvian Logjam Davis Bertans, Sideshow Bob Lopez and the REAL GOAT üêê *Raul Neto*  No contest!"
"Man the GOAT got robbed, how does he not make 1st Team All-NBA as a lock?  Poor *Raul Neto*"
The fact the GOAT Basketball player isn‚Äôt on these teams is disgusting.  Put your üêê out for the GOAT  *Raul Neto*
"I think that's how it happened, but part of me wants to see how the game is changed if players have to start hanging on the rim as long as someone is under them, so coaches designate someone small like Raul Neto to duck under Simmons when he's on the rim and stand there and the game just goes on 4 on 4. I bet IT can find a roster spot as a specialist that way too."
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
Raul Neto
To be fair this was done mostly against a team that was starting Raul neto
Yeah he should just give it to top 10 player Raul Neto instead. Even in 2017 I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt give Andre Roberson more isos.
At one point the Jazz had Ricky Rubio and Raul Neto as our point guards.    Easily the sexiest PG duo in NBA history.
Lol my posts ranting on Seth Curry defense. I am saying Doc replaced Seth with Raul Neto. Exploit Raul Neto.
I was thinking the same thing lmaooo. He was sure the key to the series was Raul Neto going at curry.
"Absolutely. Raul Neto, Davis Bertrans, and Robin Lopez are the best big three in the league right now. Oh yeah they also have Beal and Westbrook."
"raul neto, man. dude has flair and he hustles hard af, my favorite role player in all the wiz games i watched this year"
COUGH COUGH Alex len and Raul Neto
Raul neto
"I'm glad we got gafford ... but our roster sucks in general ...   We're deciding between starting Raul Neto, Davis Bertans, Isaac Bonga, Chandley Hutchison, Anthony Gill, and Garrison Matthews at the starting SF spot ..."
Don't get why Tobias is getting all this hate. Hes going up against defenders like Raul Neto and Davis Bertans.  What do you expect from the 180 million dollar man?
"If Raul Neto held him to 8/24 then Deandre Hunter may hold him scoreless the entire series, Randle isn‚Äôt loving it so far"
"For the Wizards:  - No Alex Len, less Raul Neto minutes - No more Wizards 3 guard bullshit in the lineup - Hitting threes   - Better Westbrook shot selection - Bradley Beal shows up - More hack-a-Ben  For the Sixers: - Embiid out for series - Sixers cannot replace production of Embiid (see Tobias Harris chuck fest tonight) - Doc Rivers plays Mike Scott more than Dwight - Big men foul trouble - Lakers Danny Green reincarnates  - Ben Simmons continues to go 1-2 from the line every trip  Think I covered everything. This series is over in 5, maybe 6 if the Wizards get lucky."
"This is the key.   This isn't going to work for the Hawks, Bucks, or Nets.  None of those teams have such stout defenders like Raul Neto that they can throw on Tobi to shut him down"
"I fouled Raul Neto writing this comment, he's going to the line for 2 more"
Raul Neto
of course.  even Raul Neto &gt; Steph cmon now
1. Raul Neto to the lakers
"More Ish Smith, Raul Neto and Davis Bertans ain‚Äôt winning them the series mate."
Good practice for our bench mob to get playoff experience from legends like Daniel Gafford and Raul Neto
Remember that post a couple days ago about the key to victory for the Wiz being Raul Neto isos on Seth
Raul Neto not starting? Is that an adjustment from Scott Brooks? The man's evolving before our eyes
I‚Äôd want Raul Neto and a bag of chips at this point tbh
"Once again I respect the amount of time and effort you put into your analysis. Having said that, Raul Neto couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag, with scissors in his hands. If your banking on Neto to make this close you already lost."
"Embiid is very soft, imo this is pretty clear. There was a play were Raul Neto (barely a 6 feet guard who was bullied in the 2 games), Embiid was grabbed by Neto and he fell like a drama queen, it was ridiculous. But the other young players you mentioned, yes, they are pretty fun to watch and they seem to have a competitive spirit. The LeBron generation is pathetic, weak, worthless cowards joining forces. I only hope this new generation don't follow their steps, Giannis already gave a positive example: stay loyal and believe in the system. Also believe in their own talent, good players will eventually gravitates towards Luka and some other surging talent, Luka doesn't need to abandon his team and team up with another superstar, this is a ridiculous move (and I am a Lakers fan, so you can imagine how it is personally conflicting to watch this team nowadays)"
From the wizards I'd throw in Raul Neto  Honorable mention to Garrison Matthews
"i am not a Raul Neto expert, but he did spend last season in Philly and calling him a playmaker and someone who could torch anyone is a huge stretch.    he's a decent backup PG but not a guy who should be featured in an offensive set over and over"
You are under the false impression that Raul Neto can torch anybody.  No disrespect to him but he‚Äôs not that type of player.
Right? OP under the impression Raul Neto can just go off if he attack Curry LMFAO
"You are making this waay to complicated for OP  OP just expects Raul Neto to score 60 if he listens to OP and ""aTtaCkS sEtH cUrRy"""
I‚Äôm pretty sure Seth can D up Raul Neto lol
Then you put in George Hill. Don't need to be hyper-efficient every possession in these early rounds when the talent disparity means that a player like Seth can be hidden.  The fact that Raul Neto isos are being suggested as a solution should tell you why Seth can play his normal minutes right now.
"It‚Äôs hard to simply target a single weak defender (Seth) when your offence just doesn‚Äôt have enough spacing or offensive talent in general. Luka is having success against the Clippers when he targets Zubac or one of the little guards because he is constantly surrounded by 4 shooters, or 3 shooters &amp; a lob threat in WCS or Powell. There also isn‚Äôt a playmaker on this Wizards team that is on the level of Luka.  By ‚Äúattack Seth Curry‚Äù do you mean attack him in PnR or in isolation? Because if it‚Äôs in isolation, then I don‚Äôt think a large volume of Raul Neto or Ish Smith iso‚Äôs are going to pull off an upset on this Philly team. Even if they do beat him off the dribble, again the Wizards don‚Äôt have enough spacing to take consistent advantage against this. Philly has elite help defenders in Joel, Ben, Green, Thybulle, etc. as well.  And in the PnR it‚Äôs much of the same, even if Curry is a liability on D, Philly has elite help defenders and Wizards don‚Äôt have enough legitimate offensive threats to consistently take advantage of it. They are honestly just too outmatched this series."
Scott Brooks plays a playmaking PG Raul Neto as the starter. He's the one who has torched Seth Curry but not given enough plays. Seth has given up 70-100% FG% for all shots.
Westbrook has been trying to attack Simmons and Embiid which is the problem.   My point is that Raul Neto needs to take Seth Curry and force Embiid to help and it opens up easy lane for the 3 centers.  They don't do this right now. Westbrook is struggling mightily as he should against 2 all NBA defenders.
"Yea I rather see Brooks play his athletes to try to just play any defense.  But he sticks with a point guard in Raul Neto. So if you play Raul, you have to use him to attack Seth Curry.  It just sucks that he won't make an adjustment to put a real swing forward like Chandler, Gill or Bonga to just play defense on Simmons or Harris."
Depends on the matchup. I just showed you advanced stats how bad Seth Curry is.  You can't be looking at defensive rating because he's lucky he has 2-3 all NBA defenders.  Raul Neto offense &gt; Westbrook trying to attack Simmons.
"The whole point of Scott Brooks playing PG Raul Neto is to make plays. So if you play him, you use him to attack Seth Curry.  In normal situations, that PG would be a SF like Chandler or Gill.  but Scott Brooks is playing a playmaker in Raul Neto. So you better be attacking one of the worst defenders in the league.  Embiid camping hasn't worked at all this series when Embiid helps it leads to easy layup for the Center."
"Yeah the point of playing him with Embiid is so that he gets help in the paint. Also, I know Raul Neto and I don't think you want your offense predicated on Raul Neto isos regardless of who the defender is.  Advanced stats put Seth as a pretty league average guard, those aren't worth that much and anecdotally he's subpar but I don't think he's terrible.     If you're that confident he won't hit 20 MPG next series will you take a Sixers flair when he most likely does?"
"100% agree. Should be playing bigger defender to matchup with Ben Simmons then.  But if you start Raul Neto, you better be using him to attack Seth.  I think the problem is Brooks or Westbrook or both. How do you not attack Seth with 3 playmakers?"
"I mean, if your game plan hinges on Raul Neto making plays and being a huge difference maker, you‚Äôre probably not in a good way."
It's just time. Wizards don't make adjustments. They play Raul Neto to playmake also. He doesn't even get a chance to score on Seth.
It's just time. Wizards don't make adjustments. They play Raul Neto to playmake also. He doesn't even get a chance to score on Seth.
Even in isolation Seth Curry sucks. You can get off any shot you want.  He is 5.7 percentile in isolation defense allowing 1.27 in isolation. Clearly he is one of the worst isolation defenders where Raul Neto should be attacking him.
"Raul Neto isolations with Embiid in the paint is an appalling offence. The Wizards mainly had the right idea, get the guy who can shoot (Beal) involved in actions that bring Embiid out of the paint so that others can attack easier."
We play Raul Neto as a dominant dribbler and play maker. Otherwise Wizards should play bigger and not play Neto.
https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203552/defense-dash/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season   Clearly he allows higher FG% more than average. Especially in the paint where he gives it up at 70%.     https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=TEAM\_ABBREVIATION\*E\*PHI&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive   He is 5.7 percentile in isolation defense allowing 1.27 in isolation. Clearly he is one of the worst isolation defenders where Raul Neto should be attacking him.     He's not serviceable at all. You'll see in the next round of playoffs. There's a reason he was benched by Dallas.
Raul Neto should be playmaking on Seth Curry. That's why Brooks starts him.
1.	Robin Lopez 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Raul Neto 4.	Daniel Gafford 5.	Rui Hachimura
lmao you're acting like brooks will make any adjustments at all... we'll continue to start raul neto on tobias harris and alex len on joel embiid.
"If they played the Nets, he might have better numbers but they still get swept lmfao   They get swept no matter who they play. They start Alex Len and Raul Neto."
Raul Neto GOAT
Raul neto really threw embiid on the ground lol
Find someone that loves you like Scott Brooks loves Raul Neto
The fact that the wizards are even here while starting Raul Neto and Zach Len speaks to how good Westbrook and Beal are
If he develops his shot I can see him having a Raul Neto like career
Raul neto enters the chat
"They stated Raul Neto bro, it's a sweep"
"Raul Neto played well against the Sixers.    Come on, Marv. That's one of the Sixers bench players."
How dare you underestimate post master Raul Neto
Refs are such babies bruh. Raul Neto complains a lil and gets a tech grow the fuck up
"If we lose a game where ish smith, Raul Neto, and Alex Len are getting playoff minutes imma be pissed"
"5 minutes and it‚Äôs westbrook it‚Äôs not like Raul Neto had 2 boneheaded plays this is your 1B to Beals 1A in the playoffs, Brooks needs to put more faith in him"
"When your rotation includes Alex Len and Raul Neto, your best wing defender is chandler hutchison, and you often run three guard lineups versus the biggest team in the league, you‚Äôre probably gonna lose every game"
Can anyone tell me why Raul Neto is starting?
Why does Raul Neto play playoff minutes  edit- this guy starts none the less
In before Marv confuses Westbrook for Raul Neto
He'll be guarding Raul Neto &amp; Ish Smith - I think he'll be fine.
I've never once bothered to figure out what Raul Neto looks like but I always assumed he was bald for some reason idk.
raul üêê neto
You seem to have missed Raul Neto
There was the other one with Gary Trent but he wasn't the flopper.  I think it was Raul Neto? Trent hit a game-winner right after IIRC.
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
"Why not play Ish Smith even more instead of letting Raul Neto do nothing for 17 minutes? Why not even *try* playing Bonga when you're letting the other teams star go for 50?       Great game for Tatum obviously. I don't see Celtics going much further this year but it always helps to have your young star get this kind of experience. Feel like the next big step for him will be just being consistent in these big games and avoiding those occasional 3 for 17 games and he already seems to be in the middle of addressing that.           As an aside, the Chuck guarantee thing started out pretty funny a while ago, then it started to get pretty tired, and now it's just TNT producers trying to force the joke. Don't even get me started on the sound and commentary during the games yesterday. I remember during opening night of this season there were a lot of complaints about the quality of the broadcasts and some people actually defended it because apparently ESPN/TNT needed some time to get adjusted for the new season. So have they had enough time to figure it out now? I have no idea how to hold these channels more accountable to actually put out a decent product but I don't get why people ever give them the benefit of the doubt. They charge lots of money for one purpose and are unable to do it."
When i saw that Alex Len and Raul Neto were starting i knew it would end up in a disaster
Beal is playing on one leg and they're starting Alex Len at C. With Ish Smith and Raul Neto spacing the floor
Expectations are a lot lower for Raul Neto than for Russel Westbrook
"Raul Neto has been great for us this year, bad take."
It‚Äôs unbelievable to me that with Westbrook and ish smith Raul Neto still finds himself on the court
Why in Gods name is Raul Neto starting alongside Westbrook and Beal
"So many people on r/NBA discussing Westbrook be like: Box score stats mean nothing without context, look at his advanced stats  Bro, no amount of Advanced Stats can explain you having to play with Raul Neto"
Y‚Äôall still have Raul neto?
I heard Neto is doubtful for the play in though due to injury?  Edit: hamstring injury.  https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/wizards-raul-neto-uncertain-for-play-in-tourney/
"We are pretty cap stricken.  That's no lie, and it's going to be tough to overcome that.  Luckily we have Beal &amp; Westbrook as all-stars, then Rui, Bertans, Bryant coming back from injury and Gafford for cheap for two more years.   I would like us to resign Raul Neto but that might prove to be difficult. I can see him getting $3-4 mil.    Realistically, we aren't getting another 3rd superstar at all.  We have to hope that Rui grows to that spot.  More 3&amp;D players is what we need."
I'm talking about the roster as a whole. Outside of Beal and Russ the roster is an inconsistent jumble of players. An argument can be made that Raul Neto or Bertans is their 4th best player.
play raul neto you coward
"Yeah, and who wouldn't average a ton of assists being able to throw to Robin Lopez and Raul Neto?"
Have you even heard of Raul Neto?
**Raul Neto**
Raul Neto deserves a mention
"1. They are playing great defense. No it‚Äôs not other teams just missing shots. They are defending the perimeter tightly and rotating to prevent paint points.  2. They are moving the ball/themselves and making the right play on offense. It‚Äôs not the Brad Beal/Russell Westbrook iso show anymore. Kuz, Gafford, KCP and of course Beal are hitting daggers late in games.  3. The bench mob is the best in the NBA. 6 man of the year (sorry Tyler Hero) Trez Harrell, Raul Neto and the Deni Avdija come in and pound other teams‚Äô benches into oblivion."
"Ricky Rubio, Deni Avdija, Bradley Beal, Kuzma, Raul Neto, and Kevin Love? Nah this gotta be the cutest game of all time."
"Because without him they were being fed by TJ McConnell and Gerald Henderson and Raul Neto, and for a brief few months Jimmy Butler who was the only good non-Ben playmaker the Sixers have had in Ben‚Äôs tenure as a starter."
Raul Neto
Because he‚Äôs literally not good anymore. Got played off the court my Raul Neto. Beaten in the roster by Dalano Banton. Shouldnt give him any leverage. And teams shouldn‚Äôt even want him lol.
Celtics and Lakers are the historical gold standards. I think Raul Neto is the best Brazilian in the league right now. But he plays for the Wizards.
"Raul Neto is definitely the one for my Wizards  He's just a junkyard dog, you can see that he give his 100% every possession, he does not give up on defense despite being the smallest man on the floor most of the times  Tough layups, nasty floaters, fadeaways over guys much taller than him, this dude has a heart that few players have, and he's always hungry  If you want to enter the Raul Neto appreciation club, watch this video: https://youtu.be/FPOd1cKpOgY"
Probably Raul Neto. Dude is an absolute baller. He just gets what he needs to do done. Feel like no one even knows who he is.
"Careful, some poster will tell you that was all Raul Neto."
"Are you referring to the RAPTOR stat? That states Kyle Lowry was -1.1 even though he's known was a good defender. LeBron James was +.6 even though he was considered coasting on defense last season. Luka was -0.8 and no one would say he's a better defender than Lowry and be taken seriously. Jrue Holiday was +1.1. Derrick Rose, Cameron Payne and Raul Neto are all better defenders than him by this metric.  This is why advanced stats aren't the end all be all. They're usually only useful for comparing people on the same team. Which is why Sexton being -0.5 and Garland being -3.0 so far this season is significant. Within their own team, Garland drags the defense down much more. Defenses are way more about teams than individual players. Which is why usually most people on a good defensive team even the bad defenders have good defensive advanced stats number."
Name one Knick cuter than Raul Neto.   I'm waiting.
Raul Neto/Darius Bazley/Dwayne Bacon/Giannis/Shaq
"I could spend some time talking about how Daniel Gafford, Raul Neto, and Garrison Matthews were actually very good players last season, but no one knows who they are so I'm just going to tap out."
"Once again, with this logic I guess Raul Neto is a championship caliber pg"
With this logic Raul Neto can be a starting pg on a championship team
yea I mean we preferred playing Raul Neto and Ish Smith at SF over him in the playoffs ...
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"Whenever Russ was on the bench since they were staggered, that's what happen when you start Russ/Beal with Raul Neto"
Better than the GOAT **Raul Neto**?  Puh-lease!
Raul neto for the nets lol gotta explain that
