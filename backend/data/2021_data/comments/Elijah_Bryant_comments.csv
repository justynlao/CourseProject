"The Milwaukee Bucks are planning to sign Elijah Bryant from Maccabi Tel Aviv on a two-year deal, sources told Emiliano Carchia of Sportando.  The team will reportedly pay a buyout fee of around $500,000.  The Bucks will also waive Rodions Kurucs to make room for the signing, sources told Shams Charania of The Athletic."
He played for the bucks summer league team a couple years back and he looked really good imo. Was very effortless out there and I thought he had a chance to make the team back then even. I'm unreasonably excited about Elijah Bryant
My man Elijah Bryant was robbed of his ROY trophy. He put up 16 - 6 - 3.
Elijah Bryant snubbed
even better sub in Elijah Bryant and Thanasis at the same time very 1 minute
"Bud: ""After playing 41 minutes, we will  monitor Giannis minutes. We want to get more playing time for Thanasis and Elijah Bryant."""
"He would've been benched for Elijah ""40 Career MP"" Bryant so it wouldn't matter anyways."
"This was by far Bud's most inexcusable performance he's had. After all season of experimenting with adjustments and not riding and dying with the scheme I though there was maybe a chance in the playoffs he'd adjust.   But nope.   1) Harden played more than Giannis which is UNBELIEVABLE.   2) The team was making off-ball movement in the first half which made it exceptionally easy for the ball-handler to drive and dish. We completely went away from that in the second half. There was several possessions with Jrue, Giannis, and Middleton where they get the ball at the top of the key, NOBODY moved, and they waited until 5 seconds left on the shot clock to promptly throw up a contested shot.  3) Bud left Brook in the game while he was the reason for 5-6 open threes in a row while he hid in the paint. Bud went big, okay great, so we were at least abusing the only benefit of this and posting him up right? Wrong, Brook didn't get to post up his 6'8 center defender Jeff Green a single time.  4) Bud played ELIJAH FUCKING BRYANT in this game, who has played one NBA game before this playoffs, instead of Bobby Portis or even just Pat in the first half, this allowed the Nets to go on a solid little run when we were streaking in the first half.  5) And to top it all off, KD is going absolutely nuclear, best game of his career. Absolutely HUNTING Brook(who should've left the floor after the first 4 KD mid-ranges) and Pat(who tried his best but was too small) and Bud hides Giannis in the corner on Joe Harris. Doesn't double KD off of Harden who literally looked drunk out there.   I get a lot of people are saying ""Giannis can't fight around screens, KD would probably cook him"". Great, can we at LEAST FUCKING TRY IT. He's obviously cooking everybody else, and you have a DPOY AT LEAST SEE IF IT WORKS. We saw this exact case with Jimmy last year, Giannis never guarded him, he torches. Giannis demands to guard him a year later, absolutely locks him down. I'm not saying he would lock KD down, but that pattern has to make you think ""hey maybe this could work I'll give it a shot"".  For me this is peak Bucks disappointment. I barely came in with high expectations this year, with this current team I will never again expect us to win anything."
Elijah Bryant
Just watched the replay they even had Elijah Bryant guarding Durant at one stage oh lord
In a game where elijah bryant and thanasis got minutes..
"I was really surprised Portis didn't get any run. Also was surprised with the Elijah Bryant sub in non garbage time, even though the result wasn't bad. But it seemed so random."
I didn’t even know we had a Elijah Bryant until last game.
"Yeah lets just let Pat play 34 minutes, play Elijah Bryant, and keep Brook in while he's getting cooked by KD instead of subbing in a guy who was top 5 in 3 point percentage this year who had a poor few game stretch."
Elijah Bryant was on the team literally 1 game this season there’s no way in hell he should’ve even sniffed the floor. You can argue Bobby shouldn’t have played but that doesn’t justify Bryant seeing the floor.
Had to fit in those valuable 4 minutes total for Thanasis and Elijah Bryant.
Had to get those Thanasis and *checks box score again* Elijah Bryant minutes
You're right Elijah Bryant rightly got the playing time today
That stretch where we put in Elijah Bryant who wasn’t even on the team 99% of the year says everything you need to know about Bud.
"Great performance from KD. The man does not fail to impress.  What is up with the Bucks offense in the second half? No PnR? Brook trailing 5ft behind the arc launching 3s instead of posting up? Just running and gunning when we were up 14 instead of slowing the game down and wasting some clock?  Also pretty confused as to why Elijah Bryant, Thanasis and Forbes were getting minutes and not Bobby Portis..."
WHO IS ELIJAH BRYANT? WHY WAS HE IN FOR THE BUCKS? WTFFF
That’s Elijah Bryant he played one regular season game
Why Tf is Elijah Bryant and TA in the game Bud ffs
How the fuck is Bobby not playing over Elijah Fucking Bryant
Elijah Bryant wtf bud I wanna die
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
Weird to use Claxton and Shamet as examples without naming the 6 other healthy guys who play more minutes than them. That’s like saying the Nets shouldn’t be losing to Bobby Portis and Elijah Bryant.
So number 3 is Elijah Bryant and he looks like Justin Jackson not Justin James.  Don't know what went on in my head.
Bud getting way too cute with Elijah Bryant minutes.. just give us Thanasis
Elijah Bryant
Elijah Bryant. Don’t know much about him but he’s more exciting than Teague so he’s got that going for him.
Elijah Bryant
"Elijah Bryant, signed from overseas late in the year"
lmao who tf is Elijah Bryant
"Elijah Bryant apparently played one total game, where he scored 16 points. He is the highest scorer of any player with &lt; 2 games total played."
I wouldn’t mind seeing Elijah Bryant getting minutes.
"Do you mean Elijah Bryant? Cuz that's not Nwora. They look similar in the can though, the Bucks just picked him up"
"Elijah Bryant from the bucks managed to surpass him, after making his nba debut last night"
We've reached the point where I'd rather see Elijah Bryant getting minutes than Teague
Who else? Elijah Bryant?
"People say the Bucks don’t have a “Big Three”, but I’ve always said they’re just looking at the wrong three.  Of course I mean Giannis, Elijah Bryant and Jeff Teague."
"Shout-out to Elijah Bryant, not giving up any points."
"Need more Elijah Bryant in game 3, noted"
*Elijah Bryant starts posting Ayton up every possession*
"Bud has made some great adjustments this playoffs. He introduced a ton of new looks and used our depth against the Heat. They couldn't touch our defense. He eventually shortened the rotation against the Nets, went small with Tucker and kept our poor defenders off the floor. And he has now made adjustments against the Hawks with Trae/Lou and Giannis being out. He has made great adjustments. But he also had some goofs. He watched us get killed on high screens and PnR over and over, often the same play 4x in a row. He's sometimes let big runs go on and our guys get hit without calling a timeout and making an adjustment. He gave Elijah Bryant, who was literally just playing for Tel Aviv Maccabees, some questionable minutes (who hadn't played at all). He continually puts Jeff Teague on the floor, who looks absolutely terrible on both sides of the ball. He's had some instances where he should have used a challenge but didn't. He often puts out some sus rotations with too many poor defenders and bench guys that end up giving up lots of points. Like a line up with Teague, Bryn and Pat.   The expectation has been a deep playoff run with our team. That expectation only grew with the state of injuries and Bucks making the ECF. Bud had at least been able to right the ship til now. If he makes the finals then we can give him even more due props. From there, we have to see how the finals play out and what happens with Giannis."
"lol ngl i just put Elijah Bryant there just for the sake of it. and yes, I don't think he has upside too"
"Elijah Bryant looked meh even in garbage time, but in contrast Diakite did look like he had potential"
"Connaughton isn’t a pg, Merrill is a fine rookie but would get toasted by Lou Williams or basically anyone else he’d be guarding. I know nothing about Elijah Bryant.  Edit: I should clarify, Teague shouldn’t be out there either, so I do agree with your point about using Middleton to bring it up"
Add Diakite and Elijah Bryant to the list of guys I'd like to see get minutes before Jeff Teague
"To answer your question of what the hell is going on here, is Bud does Bud things. Inexcusable but Bucks are woefully short of guards with Donte out. It's basically Jrue, Teauge, and Elijah Bryant (maybe Forbes counts but he never really plays PG). Seems like early in a series Bud goes a little deeper on the bench, same thing happened against the Heat and Nets, and then later on Teague never saw the floor. Let's hope that's the case going forward."
I guarantee you Elijah Bryant has already earned those minutes.
when you say 'had to play' elijah bryant i love that it implies some necessity when bud had bobby portis sitting on the bench and chose not to use him in a couple games  fucking hilarious that you get to use bud making boneheaded decisions that *you guys' own fans* were complaining about in the game thread as some sort of 'haha you IDIOTS we're just as disadvantaged'. just like actually the funniest shit
Considering elijah bryant got meaningful minutes i'm not ruling anything out
"Not this Bucks fan. Even if we get the ring he’s gotta go. IF we end up winning it all it will be because of our players, not Bud. I can’t take it anymore with him, he didn’t play Bobby Portis at all last game (Elijah Bryant instead) which hurt us, and he didn’t play Portis tonight either even though we pulled it out. I’m up for firing Bud now and bringing in Carlisle…hell even Craig Counsell"
"For those interested, Elijah Bryant has a youtube channel that documents his time in the Euro League.   [Here it is. He looks a bit like D'Vontay Friga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaSt0zYxxu2J8RHOJNJO3w)"
Aight it’s time for Elijah Bryant now
"Best I can do is a Rodney Hood, Elijah Bryant, and some cash."
Prob gonna get cut if not Elijah Bryant or mamadi
"Lol I think I can remember what game youre thinking of. I remember seeing our garbage time line up out there and also Jrue. I was like wtf Bud, just pull him if you have him sharing the court with Sam Merill and Elijah Bryant"
"Two of the three Mormons in the NBA, Sam Merrill and Elijah Bryant, play for the Bucks, and the third, Jabari Parker, was drafted by the Bucks."
Justin Jackson and Elijah Bryant too!
It’s Elijah Bryant since he’s been posting some anti-vaxx adjacent memes.
"This is postseason inclusive. As others mentioned, excluding postseason you'll come away with Elijah Bryant as the leader.

Elijah Bryant wins if we only count his one regular season game. He got minutes in the playoffs.
It's [still](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/phd51b/who_is_the_alltime_leader_in_most_points_scored/hbhoewq/) Elijah Bryant.
No problem. Not sure of a way to find the exact answer but it’s likely Elijah Bryant as he scored 16 points in the only NBA game he has ever played. Apparently Jordan’s was 8 while he was a Bull but scored just 2 points as a wizard once.
"Statmuse was weird and didn't give complete responses, but Elijah Bryant (/u/nowhathappenwas) appears to be the right answer for players with exactly 1 game played... if you try to do a few different date ranges. He appears to be the only one in double figures at all  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/players-who-played-only-1-nba-game-after-2002"
"&gt;Edit 2: Fine, I’ll do it myself. It’s Elijah Bryant  By doing it yourself you mean taking what someone else commented on your post?"
Elijah Bryant.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanel01.html
"Yeah, but hey it worked out I guess 😂 despite the Teague and Elijah Bryant minutes"
"Well Schroeder had to take a ridiculously small contract because there was no space for him. Mike James went back to Europe after looking good in Brooklyn, one of our guys playing preseason Elijah Bryant didn't make our roster despite looking like a great role player. James Ennis still isn't signed despite being a solid player. And then there's just a lot of young guys who just didn't impress enough in their brief time but who knows if they might if they got another chance.  Like it's not superstars obviously but you could spread some players around the league and fill out the rosters fine."
there was report of us waiving elijah bryant about a week ago but somehow he's still here. waive him for good please
"Our shooting was horrendous that series (we actually had the lowest 3P% ever for a team that won the title in the modern era), and we ended up having to play Jeff Teague and Elijah Bryant that series due to our own injuries and depth issues.  I’m not saying we’d win for sure or anything, but now that we’re over the hump I expect a lot less jitters in that type of series."
What? It's Elijah Bryant in pre-season. This type of call will surely follow into the post season!!!

"This isn’t new right? Calling it on Elijah Bryant is one thing, calling it on CP3 or Luka in a game that matters? Yea well see"
This is what happens when your name is Elijah Bryant. Holding judgment till they call this for a star in a pivotal moment.
I thought the Bucks released Elijah Bryant
That is Elijah Bryant...
Didn't know Jordan nwora new name is Elijah Bryant
"That's Elijah Bryant, not Jordan Nwora!"
I love Elijah Bryant! Mainly cause I watched him at BYU but I never thought he’d be in the NBA
