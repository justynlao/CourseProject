"Can I ask a question that by no means is meant to insult you?   Why is the assumption that Kyrie or KD would be unwilling to let Harden run point or control the offense?   Kyrie came to Brooklyn with KD, knowing that he’s not as good of an offensive player. He came in willing to concede that KD is better and even in interviews has said “I’m happy in the clutch I have a teammate I know can hit the shot” (paraphrasing).   KD has played with Steph and Russ. And in both cases has never cared about who gets more shots or who controls the ball more. The only time he got heated was when he wanted the ball late in the game and Draymond green wanted to be the playmaker."
I guess Kevin Garnett and Draymond Green just had really great coaches the entire time they were in the league

"no, anyone that plays enough minutes and has fast enough hands could possibly get 10 steals once. Draymond green averages 1.4 per game, but he's gotten 10 before. I would expect him to get 1-2 steals in a game, but there's a chance he'll get 10 at some point this week"
"is it?   Wiseman will probably still be very green, Wiggins is looking decent right now but its still to be determined whether he can keep it up. Steph, Draymond and Klay are not getting any younger with the latter coming off two large injuries."
"Warriors centers:  James Wiseman - Out with sprained wrist, at least 1 week  Kevon Looney - Out with sprained ankle, too soon to know how long  Marquese Chriss - Out with broken leg, rest of season  Alen Smailagić - [Out with meniscus tear,](https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/alen-smailagic-surgery-20210104) possibly back soon  Eric Paschall - Is 6'6""  Draymond Green - Is 6'6"""
Draymond Green is an dadaist and his medium is box scores
"yeah this team is not close to the warriors at all. but they might be close offensively or better. Mostly because they trade so much defense for offense. Warriors had draymond and iggy who were monsters on defense but could be ignored somewhat on offense. this nets team with green at the 5 has 5 40% shooters from deep, 4 that are absolutely snipers in harris, durant, kyrie and harden. Green is the guy you want to leave open but hes been hitting enough to make it tough."
Draymond shortbread Green
"Draymond Green deserves a mention, it will wind up being Jokic though.  Right now, I'd have Manu at the top ahead of Gasol."
"Rodman over Gasol maybe, but in no way is Rodman better than Manu. Not even close.  Draymond Green should be mentioned (I would take him over Rodman, as well)"
"Softer than the Draymond one. At least Green was cursing at the top of his lungs.      Also not a foul.      I feel like if a ref calls a foul and then a player is ejected for complaining about the call, and the league determines that the foul was called incorrectly, that referee should be suspended for a game."
"&gt; Why isn't that knee limiting his defensive performance this season?  well it was earlier, he wasn't nearly as good at moving laterally as he was last season....he's getting better though               &gt; comparing a #1 overall pick in Ben Simmons with Draymond Green is why he gets criticized so much                That doesn't make sense. That's like saying that you're comparing #1 pick Simmons with #15 pick Giannis. Doesn't matter where you were picked, it matters how good you eventually became. Draymond was arguably a top ten player at his peak so that's not exactly a low bar. Simmons went #1 with the expectation that he would eventually develop a jump shot which would make him a generational player. Sometimes expectations don't play out...but hey, he's got a few years left so who knows."
"Exactly. If a player like Russell Westbrook or Draymond Green was caught telling a female fan ""bitch shut the fuck up and sit down"", there would be numerous people calling for a suspension/fine. But because it's LeBron everyone just finds it hilarious..."
"&gt; Do fans want trash talk, or not? &gt;  &gt; I'm very confused right now.  Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are the bully fake-popular kids with the megaphones. McGruder is an under-the-radar hustle player who has managed to carve out roles on some quality teams in his career so far."
"&gt; Was it funny as hell and true? sure  Definitely not funny, or true. I don't even understand what you're saying. McGruder is a quality player who has been a rotation player on some good teams in his short NBA career, and has had to work hard to prove himself. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are the bully popular kids with the megaphones. McGruder is an under-the-radar hustle player type."
Top 3 softest techs this season in no particular order because they're all stupid   Marvin Bagley III hopping  Kelly Oubre blowing Montrezl a Kiss  Draymond Green yelling at his own teammate   League is softer than baby wipes
"draymond green has a 30% chance to make the HOF according to basketball-reference  he would probably have the worst stats out of anyone in the HOF, rodman has fewer points but nearly double draymonds rebounds.   draymond does have nice assist stats though.  117th all time in assists apparently.   I assume that is slightly padded by playing with some of the greatest shooters of all time in steph, kd, klay  I assume it would be a combination of his above-average assists plus his defense and silverware if he does get in."
"If I was a blazer's fan I probably wouldn't be the biggest Stephen Curry fan either lol but arguing that Draymond Green and Oubre (this season so far, his last few games have been approaching okay) provided better spacing is just laughable. Teams straight up only guarded Steph on the perimeter and he gets triple teamed."
Pleasant surprise: Andrew Wiggins   Unpleasant surprise: Draymond Green   Pleasant unsurprise: Steph Curry   Unpleasant unsurprise: Kelly Oubre
"I mean its Draymond Green, you can hate him but hes never held back.  Hes gonna call out bumass Mcgruber for his antics and Mcgruber should clap back from the sidelines if he feels some way about it"
Bruh triple single aka Draymond Green is a lame wouldn’t have no rings without klay or steph
"Calling Draymond fucking Green a ""Fake tough guy"" is one of the weakest takes I've ever seen."
yes sir this right here. Draymond Green is definitely a fake tough guy
Has there ever been an NBA player more overrated than Draymond Green?
"What do you guys think of trading Draymond green + any other asset for Kyrie Irving. I know its a crazy trade, Nets need defense and Warriors require someone who can complement steph scoring"
"Publishing methodology is a fundamental part of academia.  And as I've said, I don't credit RPM because of a combination of weird results, lack of clarity, and lack of continuity, not just because of lack of clarity.  I don't think it's a matter of you inferring that RPM includes a 'versus teammate' effect - I explicitly told you as much.  And when I say the methodology seems to change every year, what I mean is that if you look up [what RPM said about Draymond Green in 2018](http://web.archive.org/web/20190129051546/http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2018) you get one number, but if you look up [what RPM says about Draymond's 2018 season today](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2018/page/3) you get a very different number.  It's lack of consistency on a different dimension than the one you're checking."
That is simply not true lol  How would you evaluate someone like Draymond Green by strictly looking at his box scores?    You’d miss his player value 10/10 times.
Draymond Green counts?
"then u have PJ Tucker who is maybe considered a bigger man than Durant is.   Historically you have guys like Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman who plays the PF. Draymond Green too who are all smaller than Durant. Hell even Jayson Tatum are taller than those guys, it's more about the style of play and reputation I guess. Also tall =! big"
"those things that don't show up on a stat line ARE important. That's the thing... There are a handful of players in the league that can control a game without stuffing the stat sheet. Lebron, CP3 (still) and Draymond Green come to mind. Kyle Lowry, too (OK. unapologetic homer on that one.) Jokic belongs in that category on offense, at least.  A Lebron lead offense always has every player in his best possible positions and best possible match-up to make the most out of the possession.   It's not an accident"
"To be fair, a significant reason for his improvement is the health of draymond green (he wasn't playing in the first few games and is crucial for the golden state offense to run efficiently) and oubre and wiggins not being record bad at shooting, helping to take additional pressure off Steph."
TIL Draymond Green single handedly cost his team 3 rings by trash talking while also being one of the smartest defensive player in the history of the league... Re read what you said and figure out who the real moron is.
"Yeah, but your argument is that all of his heaves are without green on the floor...despite Curry and Draymond being on the floor at the end of both the 2nd/4th quarters  Aka, your argument falls apart (and was also a bad one to begin with, but whatever)"
An outlier game w/o Draymond doesn't erase the rest of the games without draymond.  You can just watch the games and see how much more effective the plays they ran were for Curry once Green got bacm
"We're talking about a sample of 50 shots in the rookie years of two players of differing ages. You can find two random 50 shot samples that make Draymond Green look like a better shooter than Steph Curry.  Granted I think Nesmith was way over drafted, as well."
Here's what I don't get at all. None of them fight each other so who would be scared of anyone in the NBA? Its not like these dudes are MWP or Ben Wallace this is Draymond Green.....not a soul on the planet thinks hes doing anything.
Draymond green should write Usman's press conference talking points
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"Not a significantly better shooter, not an elite passer, not the engine/driving force of the warriors? These are all bad/incorrect takes. Shoot, the guy you say is the engine of the warriors, Draymond Green, literally said ""Steph is the flow"" in a post-game interview this season.   Also, teams have all ready ran box-n-1 on Curry and throw constant double teams at him and he's on the warriors, not the wizards. If you took Steph off this team, they would once again finish with one of the 3 worst records in the league"
Draymond Green definitely didn't hold back...  https://www.instagram.com/p/CKsxt6jAP7y/?igshid=nsxdpg3xdjk6
"Draymond Green really mastered getting triple single every night, he was in double digits 4x this season, 2x in points and 2x in assists"
"I like civil debates. My goal isn't to make this incendiary but its late where I am so if my wording makes it incendiary I apologize.    ""not based on any type of fact""  Lets look at his most commonly praised skills: 3pt shooting, and offball movement. Tell me what good is creating open looks for teammates who can't shoot, or tell me what good being open to receive passes does if your teammates aren't good passers and opt to take the shot instead? He isn't a top 10 iso player, he isn't someone who is known for driving by defenders by force, and he isn't the passing god like CP3, Draymond, or even Lebron are. He isn't a BAD passer, but thats not what puts him in the MVP tier.   ""In the case of 2012-2013 or 2013-2014, this was when Steph legitimately led teams to the playoffs when his best teammate was David Lee.""  Well first of all he had Klay, so idk about it being a solo carry job--also bogut was there, at least for half the season. I mean, Klay and Lee at least can use steph's spacing no? Green wasn't good until he utilized properly, but Klay was never bad.   ""But moreso than that, Steph became the engine of the team, and thus it was hard to separate his success from his team's success.""  Green is the engine. Green is the floor general that leads Kerr's motion offense. Sure Klay and Curry being historic shooters help, but motion is a high IQ system and I don't think many people would disagree if I said Green is the highest IQ warriors player. I mean regardless motion offense is a team effort, not a solo effort; thats why the most famous motion offenses are all borderline super-teams/super teams (2014 Spurs, MVP season Curry). But maybe we just define engine differently. Maybe my definition is wrong, but semantics aside, Curry isn't the sole reason Kerr's offense works.   ""Everyone always tries to discredit the fact that Steph is the reason his teams are so good, and instead rely on the idea that he's great or has major success because of his teams. ""  Not my argument. My argument is that one of steph's greatest and rarest strengths is that he makes an offense better just by existing. He isn't an iso player, he isn't a Magic Johnson type passer, he isn't a bully in the paint player. I can't think of any player in history that has steph's skillset and comparing him to Dame, Kyrie, Harden, any other guard, is ignoring half his strengths.   ""If Dame was on this exact same team, I don't think that they have a better record.""  I picked out those three because they're selfish Iso players who don't necessarily ""want"" help. Look at some of the bad games the warriors have had. Its usually because steph's teammates can't take advantage of his gravity and brick very open 3s. Defenses leave oubre and Green open until they drive and instead triple team curry because...well why bother guarding them? Dame doesn't have nearly the same off-ball movement Steph does, but he is better at iso, and is better at playing hero ball. Same with Harden--I mean his MVP caliber seasons have been him playing one man offense (I know he had help but he isn't the passing magician or an off-ball god he isos and step-back 3s). These selfish players have an easier time dismantling bad teams, but against more sophisticated defenses, they hit a brick wall. Look at the Bucks last year: they had one of the easiest offenses to ""figure"" out and got knocked out fast. Look at the Lakers in comparison: they have one of the best passers on the main unit, and a historically great passer off the bench.   ""So there's an example of his floor raising happening right now.""  Green is also back, Wiseman is an addition whether as a starter (debatable) or off the bench. Paschall had a year to grow and is better now than he was last year. Oubre isn't the player we hoped for, but he is at the very least a positive addition from last year. Wiggins had time to gel with the Warriors (we played most of it with DLo last year). Wasn't Looney also injured last year? I think this year's team, even without curry, is a lot better than last year's team, so I'm not sure this is the best example.   ""He is simply much more talented than every other point guard""  Overall? Sure. He isn't better at iso than the guard I listed. He can't be a force in the paint compared with plenty of bigger guards (I mean he's NBA-short at 6'3)  ""To say he isn't a floor raiser is relying on lazy narrative as opposed to watching the actual games."" I watch most if not all their games.  ""The reason he has a better iso game is because he's a significantly better shooter than all of the aforementioned players outside of KD""/Iso talk  Well first of all I wouldn't say significantly. I dislike Kyrie too but he still is an all-star caliber player lets not go too far.  Second, being good at iso means you can....well isolate a match up and create on your own. That comes from Kyrie like handles, or having multiple different ways to score whether thats shooting accuracy, or driving to the basket, etc. I mean think about Ben Simmons. He has the physical tools to drive to the paint, but because his offensive skillset is very limited (no shooting), he is hampered on offense. Not trying to compare the two just using Ben to illustrate the idea of how a ""limited"" skillset hampers offense. Also not trying to say steph is that limited, but he doesn't have the size to bully through defenders (like, say, Kobe, could). Also not trying to start the dame vs curry debate because they're very different players and a comparison is very context dependent.   ""This is an example of glorifying one on one basketball when it doesn't have a significant baring on the success of a team.""  Nope. That would imply my argument were ""Iso means you're better"" which it wasn't. Iso is definitely a part of basketball, and its one where curry isn't a goat in. Also, Kobe was an Iso-god, and he contributed to team success. Harden is an iso player and he led the rockets to conference finals, only losing to a historic team.   ""The people who repeated the narrative that Steph couldn't carry the team are the same people that don't understand what makes him so great, yeah.""  Well i'm saying he isn't a floor raiser while at the same time saying that its because his gravity is a solid part of why he's an all time great with the likes of the ""not quite Lebron or MJ"" tier players. I mean, if I had to do an all time PG ranking, he'd be easily ahead of Kyrie and Dame. Thats, however, not because he can take a 5 win team and make them a playoff team (I mean again if you surround him with 30% shooters, why would teams NOT triple team him? He can run off ball all he wants if his teammates are too low IQ/skill to take advantage of it. ). Thats because he can take a 40 win team and make them a title contender. Put curry on the, say, wizards, and all that means is teams box1 and hound curry. He either shoots with multiple defenders in his face or passes to a teammate who probably bricks a shot. Off ball, he can run around all he wants. He can disrupt the opponent's defense all he wants but if nobody passes to him  or his teammates can't make easy shots, then what does that even do?"
this a warriors thread so they gonna control the narrative here. Draymond Green punched a dude in the dick and they are acting like it's not as big a deal as Lebron telling reporters that he called him a bitch. It's 5 years later and these mfs are still this stupid.
Who remembers when /r/nba was fuming at the Bulls for giving the Warriors “another Draymond Green” for cash  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6iyok5/wojnarowski_sources_golden_state_acquired_jordan/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=comments_view_all
“When the fuck did Rodney McGruder become the tough guy for their team?” - Draymond Green
Because the human psyche actually effects the game and seeing that many shots clank can hurt the team. It's part of the reason they'll tell someone that's cold to try to get an easy layup or get to the line so they can see the ball go in.   Also the mark for 3 being as valuable as a 2 33% not 30% and going by your logic the warriors should let Draymond Green (a career 31% 3 point shooter) throw up 10 3's a game.
We call that the Draymond Green.
Draymond Green is about to have a field day
The ol Draymond Green technical
"I know Kerr wants defense, but the starters — until Looney took over for Wiseman — couldn’t defend either. We’ve wasted more than 10% of Steph’s minutes playing him with the old starters, a group that was scoring at a rate lower than the Process era Sixers. It’s should be rather difficult to create a lineup that bad, but Kerr has managed to do it with Steph fucking Curry and Draymond Green in their late primes."
"The center who actually resurrected the position from the dead is none other than Draymond Green himself. No center since the stat started being tracked in 2018 has averaged more open-ended straight draws than the one who calls himself Day-Day. Even this year, it’s like he has missed a beat - averaging a pot busting 4-5-6."
"As a Mavs fan, would you trade KP for Draymond Green?"
"There’s a lot of players who tip the scale in big moments without being full time superstars. The concept makes me think a lot about Andre Iguadala in 2015-2017 with the warriors, Draymond Green on and off, and in modern years Jamal Murray. I think it depends too much on your definition of a superstar.    To me a superstar is the number one option on a team or an mvp caliber player. Hard to say Rudy is the most impactful of the players left out of that group."
Draymond Green is surprisingly eloquent when he joined the Inside the NBA crew during the bubble last season. I could see him going into media after he retires.
&gt; Scored 8 points but anyone who remembered this knows he legit controlled the tempo and destroyed miami  This sounds exactly like what someone would say about Draymond Green
Draymond Green and Grayson Allen
"In the wise words of the great Draymond Green - ""Refs needs to stop being so emotional"""
&gt;and now he's becoming Draymond Green without the ball kicking.  DEAD
"Lonzo started off as Magic lite, then he was Steph with a 40 inch vertical, and now he's becoming Draymond Green without the ball kicking."
"I see! That was my assumption but i didn’t watch in 99, and I didn’t want to assume anything cuz it was relevant to my main point of “this is the most valuable accomplishment a player can have”  Funny you brought up “most important vs best” in regards to the warriors. I made a scorching take about best vs most  important relating to those warriors cuz I have a hot take:  draymond green is actually the most important warriors player in terms of them becoming a championship team.  Steph’s shooting transcends reality, but draymond is the biggest difference maker on that team from 14 to 15 and 16. And he is the biggest ceiling raiser for them"
"Metta World Peace, Rasheed Wallace, Draymond Green"
"They don’t really have the salary filler. Wiggins and Westbrook are not equal spacers. Wiggins is around a 33-37% shooter. Westbrook is lucky when he’s at 30%. Rebounding doesn’t matter that much. Passing wise, he’s really amazing, but it doesn’t matter when you have Steph Curry and Draymond Green on the team already. Westbrook would be an awful fit on the Warriors regardless of if you love or hate him."
They don’t show everything in the nba either. Imagine describing what Draymond Green does with just box stats.
nobody's more emotional than draymond green.  lmfao.  what a dickhead.

[He did. I'm not making this up.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/08/09/draymond-green-fined-devin-booker)  And yeah I'm bitter about it.
"Feel horrible for Kelly tbh, would’ve liked to see him have a good game tonight in a loss.  I however couldn’t be more thrilled to beat the Warriors and Draymond “Get my man out of Phoenix” Green."
Draymond Green is going to be the best possible thing for this kid and his growth. It really can't be understated. Green is a perfect vet
"He can start over Danny Green. Move Curry to the 2, Tobias at the 3 and Put Draymond in 4"
Lol guy having a good week means people think he’s a more impactful player on winning than Draymond green(yes even this draymond)
"The league absolutely bailed him out vs GSW. The Draymond Green suspension was bullshit. Lebron shoves him down, steps over him and hits him in the face with his crotch. Somehow they KEEP PLAYING, and then LeBron grabs Draymond while he's going up for a rebound, and then gets in his face and starts an argument. He fouled like 4 times in a 10s period. The refs never should have let it get to that point. If anyone but LeBron pulled that shit it's a foul way earlier, and Dray never gets that tech."
"I remember there were literal studies showing the disparity on officiating on *who* you are, not *what* you did. Nets were an OK team a few years back (enough to make the playoffs in the East, not saying much), but despite performance that equaled some teams with star players, the officiating against them was so lopsided it was ridiculous, like a 30% disparity.   Then of course we can't ignore all the officiating scandals of the past. Why was Draymond green suspended in the 2016 finals, but got away with repeatedly stomping Steven Adams nuts in the WCF? To me that title still feels fake, same with Wade's first ring, Shaq and Kobe's third, the list goes on."
Draymond Green is an all-time great defender. That’s independent of the All-Star talent surrounding him. He was the second best Warriors in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and Golden State might not have won a single championship even in 2017 or 2018 without him.
"I know this is an insane play by Curry but Draymond knows his role so fucking well smh. Not many better matches for Curry than Green, they just work so well together."
"Actually everyone should treat trades for the day that is happened. If you traded a mid 1st round pick. You should consider the value of that pick at the time. You can get lucky and draft Giannis from mid first pick. Sometimes you can suck at drafting and get a bust. Sometimes you might be unlucky with an injury aka Oden. Lets say Nets to trade for Mcgee and send a late 2nd round pick of 2026. Even a 60th pick can turn into Ginobili, Draymond Green type of talent. Why would we judge that trade with outcome of 2026 late 2nd round pick? It is irrelevant with the trade. The value of that asset should be taken for today.  Trade value of a trade pick of 2-3 years later should not be judged with the drafted player and his development."
Draymond Green will be ejected from a future finals game
"I don't think anyone really really argues that Lebron didn't bait Green. He 100% did. And Draymond took the bait. But since this is a thread about cheap shots, let's not leave out that that play only mattered because Draymond was cheap shotting people all damn playoffs."
"I don't think so  Is it likely that a player is a super star without scoring lots of ppg? No. But that doesn't mean it's impossible  Stars are usually great on offence, and usage and scoring are both big indicators of offensive value, as well as what leads to ppg. So it makes sense that super stars usually get a lot of ppg  But it can be done other ways. I'd argue Dwight Howard was a super star in 2010 and he averaged 18.3ppg. Nash was definitely a superstar from 05-07 and didn't score a lot, including averaging only 15.3ppg in 05. Draymond Green wasn't quite a super star, but he was damn good for several years and never averaged more than 14ppg. Kevin Garnett in 08 was 3rd in his team in ppg, but he was a superstar  If you can play defence and/or be a playmaker then it is certainly possible that a player could be a superstar without getting a lot of ppg. With more ball-dominant all-around players it's more difficult than in the past, but it ain't impossible"
"Skimmed it but mostly it seems like he's saying LeBron dominates against the Sixera about as much as he dominates against every team. Weird way to title the article, especially for a Philadelphia paper.  Also a gem from the end of the article mailbag section: ""I came up with this trade proposal, what do you think? Warriors get Ben, Terrance Ferguson (expiring contract), Danny Green (expiring contract), Mike Scott (expiring contract) and a first round pick. The Sixers get Stephen Curry, Draymond Green.""  Oh honey."
Theres something great but sort of deeply wrong about seeing draymond green steal a ball and slam it down on a fastbreak
"Learned from the best of the best, Draymond Green"

"Not even a double tech, though.  LeBron stepped over him - that should be a tech, because it's a deliberately disrespectful, hostile violation of the player's cylinder.  Draymond Green... looked mad about it? Made an annoyed gesture that may have wafted a gentle breeze in the direction of where LeBron's nuts would have been if he'd had any that series?"
Trae shooting with that Steph Curry green light but Draymond FG%. Just keep passing for more dimes MF
"Well since you can’t show a Murray apology, I guess he can join the list of dirty punk players with CP3 and 2016 Draymond Green"
Ben Simmons is literally an Australian Draymond Green
"Im not saying youre not cool anymore, but you guys definitely werent cool to watch last season. Im sorry but no one wants to watch an offense with their best player being Draymond Green. But having Steph back definitely restarts that streak, but yeah the streak started to end after Klay went out and then died when Steph went out."
Draymond Green sends his regards.
"&gt; I could see an argument for a double tech on him and Lebron instead of a flagrant in game 4 - but his suspension was absolutely warranted as a result of his behavior all playoffs IMO. That’s why that rule exists.  The argument is that Draymond would not have received a retroactive flagrant in the finals if not for his behavior in the OKC series (and the league taking shit for not suspending him) and the [Cavs lobbying the league](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-cavs-reportedly-wanted-draymond-green-suspended-for-2-games/) for a 2 game suspension.   The ""rule"" is that cumulative points result in a suspension, not that players who have racked up points should get undeserved flagrants because of their previous bad behavior."
"A Warriors fan calling the Lakers the most stacked team in the league. Lol. So I guess it's not so much fun when the shoe is on the other foot.  Still, Imagine comparing a LeBron AD Lakers to the Super Perfect Cell Warriors of Steph, KD, Klay, Prime Draymond Green, Iggy, Livingston and other elite guys off the bench. That team's only weakness was rim protection, and they didn't even need it.   LeBron's not gonna win MVP anyway, so you can calm your tits"
Draymond Green nods in approval
"Thompson was replaceable on those teams, if you put Jae crowder or Danny green there instead those warriors team still probably wins the finals. Peak draymond was not someone you could remotely replace, not only was he the best defender in the league and the reason their defensive scheme worked, but that team especially pre-Durant needed an additional playmaker to curry, who has never been an elite shot creator for his teammates."
I'm thinking Draymond Green will be underrated by casual fan idiots. I think he'll be remembered as along for the ride with Curry/Durant/Thompson despite being more important to the Warriors than Thompson and probably one of the ten greatest defensive players of all time
"The answer is Draymond Green, looks like an average player from the stats, but his impact is equal to an Allstars."
I wouldn't be surprised if they managed to get draymond green in. A 1 on 1 trade for shamet at this point . That's just rediculous bruh...
"Chase Down blocks is LeBron (Prince honorable mention)   Transition Defense is Danny Green (Draymond also good because of his IQ)   Cutting passing lanes and stealing the ball, very underrated Ricky Rubio as a defender (CP3 too)   And I can make a bet right now that Haliburton is gonna be also one of the best at it"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Ziaire Williams, Draymond Green, James Wiseman"
I think we would kill for a Draymond Green rn lol. Dude just builds a defense with his presence.  He also forces young guys to stay focused/alert in games and doesn't let them tamper off confidence/energy wise. We need all of that atm until we grow up a bit.
He needs to be closer to 20 than he is to 12. He is coming off injury so I think he should get a reprieve because people were somehow acting like he should be Draymond Green in terms of scoring lol. He's way too talented for that
Lillard??????????? Anthony Davis????????  Draymond Green???? Just because you can't score does mean you can't impact on other end
"Do you have a Lebron boner or something?   Lebron did NOT singlehandedly beat the Warriors he had All-Star guard Kyrie Irving dropped 40 with him in game 5, Draymond green get suspended and a lot of pieces had to fall perfectly for the Cavs to pull that off, it was impressive nevertheless. KD in the year he won MVP did NOT have better teammates than Lebron, Westbrook was out for half the season and KD singlehandedly led OKC to 59 wins which was the second best record in the league, Lebron was still on Miami with Wade and Bosh and they reached the Finals only to lose to SAS. Lebron has been the best player for 15 years but they was never a season were he was robbed of MVP which is a regular season award, since most of you Bron stans even claim he 'Coasts' in the regular season. Lebron should have won Unanimous MVP in 2013 but he didn't deserve DPOY of Gasol."
Draymond Green
It was deadly until Draymond Green shut it down.  I wish we gave Harden a center that had a skill set similar to Woods during our contention period.
"&gt;	Durant isn't a playmaker. That's not his position. He's not a guard.   Ah ya let’s just forget lebron james, Larry bird, KAJ, Kevin Garnett, the all time great playmakers who were guards, ya. No it’s about usage: how does the player *play.*   &gt;	Durant was always the primary option. OKC would be nowhere without him.  Not in GS he was ....*checks notes* ....**third** in time with the ball, dribbles per possession, passes completed, etc behind Draymond green then number one Curry. How is he the primary option but doesn’t even have the ball for the *second* most possessions on the team?   I won’t get into OKC other than WB was the de facto ball handler and creator."
Draymond green has been underrated for dang near the entirety of his career
"Your argument is going all over the place man I can barely keep track! 1) yes draymond is taking attention away from Klay. Curry flips it to green, green drives hard down the lane, gets an extra defender to help (usually Klays) and then kicks to klay for a wide open 3. I've seen it a thousand times. And don't come in here saying klay shoots just as deep as dame, that's false and you know it. Klay has everything going for him to have a 40+% 3pt year everu year. Let Dame play off ball while curry and draymond are running the offense and give Dame only spot up shots and watch him shoot 42%+ from 3 just like Klay."
"Is this still true? It’s hard to believe for me, only because you figure it would have randomly happened by now.   If you told me 5 years ago that Draymond Green would still be dunking and Blake Griffin couldn’t, I bet a lot of fans would have downvoted me into the night."
Draymond Green
Hi slightly disagree with your statement. Draymond Green is a good offense of player. He is a horrible scorer but the assist numbers he puts up and the way he runs the offense is great. In fact I think his assist number are even better than they look because teams sag of to dare him to shoot and he still makes the great pass.
"All he has to be is a big body down low to just absorb contact on defense and then set screens and playmake on the short roll for Harden. With all that spacing, he'll get wide open drives to the rim or easy kickouts for shooters open outside; **he's essentially Draymond Green with slightly worse playmaking but better shooting on offense.**  Not a major signing, but he's a net positive overall if given the very limited role he'll be given. This team is too good, not just because of the superstar power, but because of the spacing. Everyone but DeAndre can shoot well at the very least."
"It's a funny clip but he deserved that technical. He was told not to do that death stare mean mugging and didnt stop. It really was a ridiculous stare that he was doing with intent to humiliate/intimidate  Rasheed was draymond level of ""screw my team""ness. Just like Green, Sheed constantly fucked his team by his selfish attitude"
"Dude, are you dense? No one knew how good they would be until after the fact. You are obviously looking at their career in hindsight. Pippen was garbage when he was DRAFTED and got better. Phil Jackson was an UNKNOWN coach with 0 rings. Jesus.  A superteam is an ALREADY KNOWN super star like Lebron James joining a super star like Dwayne Wade and all star like Chris Bosh by signing with Miami. A superteam is superstar Kevin fucking Durant joining the 73-9 GSW with Unanimous MVP Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. This isn't Rocket science."
&gt; He could have just as easily go with a Eurostep or another move to get to the hoop without going right towards a spot that he knows is going to be contested.  Easily? Have you watched Draymond Green trying to score my dude?
The problem in this situation was Covington biting on a Draymond Green pump fake and giving him a lane to the rim.  That was the defense's mistake.  But they got bailed out for it.

i wanna know why players are jumping at draymond green shot fakes from behind the 3pt line tho 😂
Yea 6’2 lillard should jump and try to contest 6’6-6’7 230 pound draymond green going full speed downhill. This is why your a Redditor and that’s probably as good as it’ll ever get for you
"Pretty sure this is still a charge. By the time Green is taking off, Lillard is still sliding into position. Still hate having Draymond have to score to end or tie a game. It's basically never worked."

Draymond green did a what now

OMG DRAYMOND GREEN WITH A TRIPLE SINGLE OUTTA NO WHERE
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2929077-draymond-green-no-1-scared-of-no-damn-rodney-mcgruder-f-king-kidding-me
&gt; triple double with steals  https://www.nba.com/news/warriors-draymond-green-records-historic-triple-double
"You've made a bunch of assertions here, but have provided exactly ZERO evidence to back them up. How about you provide some actual hard numbers or statistics to backup what you claim? Otherwise it's pretty clear you probably havent watched the guy play. ""Lacking the ability to get to the line"" is mostly a cop out - the dude constantly finishes through contact and gets hit and just makes shots anyway. The only reason he doesnt get the FTs is because he actually tries to score those plays instead of accentuating the contact like Embiid, Luka, Harden, Trae Young, and the other noted foul hunters.   To counter your point that he gets ""devoured"" by the ""elite bigs""... who you have in mind, exactly? Embiid? Hmmmm let's check that out. Jokic and Embiid have played each other 5 times in their careers.  Embiid averages 19.8/11.2/3.2/1.2/2.2 with 5 turnovers and 4.6 fouls shooting 37.7/16.7/82.6 in 29.7 minutes per game.  Jokic averages 21.4/8.2/7.0/1.2/0.8 with 2.2 turnovers and 3.4 fouls shooting 48.8/25.0/83.3 in 31.9 minutes per game.  Huh. Interesting. I'd say Jokic has gotten the better of that matchup pretty consistently and most would say Embiid is an elite big man. The same is generally true of KAT - Jokic tends to own him. He also owns KP if you want to call him elite, and... who is really truly an elite 5? There aren't many, other than Jokic and Embiid. Even AD (who is a 4 and insists on playing the 4 as much as possible), Jokic does mostly fine against. Not going to stop him that often but most people arent. There is ONE archetype that Jokic struggles with and there's only really one team that has it - he struggles in the PnR with teams that have elite, super quick ball handlers paired with a fast and springy athlete at the 5. There's only one team that has both of those things - Atlanta. Trae Young + Capela, but it only works because Trae Young burns the Nuggets perimeter defense putting Jokic in the position of choosing between two players to guard. No one can guard both of those guys 2-1 except like, Draymond Green, Simmons, and maybe Embiid.   The Nuggets also have a pythagorean win expectation of 24 right now, which says that their record will improve in the second half of the year and they should probably end up at least in the top 5 in the West. Maybe higher depending on how other teams fare, but I think 4-5 is where they'll end up.   So again, you can miss me with your false takes."
Yeah. Same with Draymond Green. He said he gets tired much easier now
"Just watch Draymond Green, he gets a tech and continues to jaw off and being restrained by teammates. He always gets away with it more often than not, more recently he did not get away with it in a game against (forgot who) but I remember a game where he got T'd up, kept saying things to the point you could hear him over the audio at the free throw line still using profanity and the second tech never came."
"Team success doesn’t equal player success. Draymond Green has more rings than Charles Barkley but was never a better player.  Not to mention those Clippers teams lost mostly due to injuries, not lack of skill."
Butler is averaging 20/8/8 and I feel like that's pretty reflective of his impact lol  G: Conley  G: Mikal Bridges  F: Josh Hart  F: Draymond Green  C: Rudy Gobert
I’m sure that Devin Booker and Draymond Green aren’t losing sleep over 15k
Draymond and Rodman don’t make up for IT being 5’9. And part of the reason Draymond is so effective is the mismatch he creates at the 4/5. With that lineup you’re going to have a clogged lane and Jokic is going to have to spend a lot of time on the perimeter instead of posting up because teams are not gonna guard Rodman or Green at the 3 point line.
"He’s Draymond Green size with a 40” vert, but still clearly adjusting to the game. I still think he has the highest ceiling in the class when things start to slow down for him"
"Write a new rule: *""The referees shall compare any punishment to any and all rulings made against Green, Draymond.""*  Why is this so hard? You call a ref a bitch, you get tossed out. You don't call him a bitch, you can continue playing."
"Lebron is extremely lucky in his career, he is a few situations away from really only having one title. Ray Allen misses a shot, draymond green is never suspended/bogut isn’t injured, there isn’t a global pandemic/nba bubble. I guess you can really say that about anyone though."
"That's not surprising, I think I remember people speculating that the Draymond Green thing with Durant was more serious than it was made out to be initially and I guess that was confirmed when Durant left cuz so far as I know Steph and KD are still pretty good friends."
The fact that Murray and Lebron are ahead of Draymond Green.... I can't man.
Draymond Green would disagree with you lol
"You're thinking of that other center, Draymond Green."
Draymond Green: That's nuts!
Smart for Draymond Green straight up do you do it?
Kawhi is really the only one of the four to be a true perimeter defender. There's even articles calling Draymond Green the best rim protector in the NBA the year he won it. And 24 of the last 25 before those four have been rim protectors.
"Firmly believe this is the next version of the generic big:  Being able to make reads and efficient passes on the short roll is so valuable in an era with so many dominant guards.  I mean, Draymond Green is probably going to be a HoFer because of it.  It’s especially valuable with Harden and Steph obviously cause teams will just trap them continuously in the PnR because they don’t want to play them."
Harden is a glorified draymond green without the defensive IQ who is firmly the 3rd option whenever KD and Kyrie are playing with him let's be real
Fuck it. Draymond Green vs Steph who says no?
Steph Curry and Draymond Green
"\&gt;Name me aside of Kawhi, Simmons and Draymond green another player who can guard 5 positions.  Herein lies your problem: you're conflating defense with ''''guarding''''? What does that mean? Is it quantifiable? Or are things like rim protection the most important thing? Clearly the latter.   FYI: this season in 300 mins without Joel guess what ben's net rating is? -9 and his defensive rating is 117. really horrible for someone who is supposedly the best defensive player in the league  \&gt;Embiid is a great defender and I would have put him at the place of Myles Turner but Simmons deserves that #1 spot  No embiid is a defensive juggernaut he's not just 'great' he is anchoring an incredible defense."
"Name me aside of Kawhi, Simmons and Draymond green another player who can guard 5 positions. Did you even see what he did to Luka, Dame??? Embiid is a great defender and I would have put him at the place of Myles Turner but Simmons deserves that #1 spot. If you ever watched him play, you will know what I am talking about."
"I think you're trying to turn them into some scrubs when they were basically the best defensive playoff team since 2004. I'm sorry, but who did the Warriors have besides Draymond who could even exist within 10 feet of Lebron, much less defend him? Igoudala? Meanwhile the Raptors had the 3 above, plus Danny Green and Ibaka who could all play very physically. And OG didn't even get a chance to play because of appendicitis."
"Lol warriors radio commentator made statements about how the warriors should trade draymond green after the previous charlotte game, I wish I was listening to it because I hope he's eating his own shit"
"Oh he must not realize that there were more players on the W’s than Durant and Steph. Believe it or not, Steph had help from some other pretty “okay” players. Guys like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, David West, Andrew Bogut, Andre Iguodala, and Javale McGee. I guess he just isn’t familiar with any of those players."
Draymond Green plays Basketball.
"Kerr has always been a tremendously underrated defensive coach. Where he might fail in drawing up tight offensive plays, he absolutely succeeds in crafting a winning defensive culture. Those guys play incredible team defense.  &amp;#x200B;  Also a tremendous credit to Draymond Green, who is just a defensive wizard."
Yea steph is number one reason draymond green is a DPOY level player.. that’s exactly it
Danny Draymond Green
"Honestly, if Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, or Draymond Green turned out to be closet racists, I'd be pretty disappointed.  I love Inside the NBA mainly because of those two dudes, and Draymond was an awesome addition as well. I'd honestly be ok if Draymond retired and picked up a gig alongside the dudes - he's awesome."
Draymond Green? Andre Iguodala?   Never even heard announcers talk about them being athletic (although iggy was in the dunk contest) it always about the BBIQ.  Making blanket statement never works out bruh
Draymond green made the finals 5 years consecutively. What has ben done? For being such an elite  defensive player you’d expect there more buzz to be around his DPOY candidacy. But we know why: embiid anchors the defense and does all the heavy lifting like *rim protection *
"Lowry, westbrook, draymond green, lillard, etc. all averaged less than that in college and they're pretty good passers in the nba. College stats are weird. Cade is a good passer, watch him sometime."
Oubre and Wiggins are both far above average defensive wings and Draymond Green is a great leader on that end too. 1st is a suprise but I definitely expected the Warriors to be no worse than a top 10 defence this season.      There issue comes down to who steps up while Curry commands the attention of opposition players but they're working their way into the season really well.
"schroeder and LeBron in warriors? they would probably do pretty well considering LeBron gets to have draymond green on his team. LeBron would need to do a big scoring workload though.   Lakers on the other hand would have a new identity, no idea how lakers would adapt to curry style of play since they just lost a massive playmaker, they would need to scrape their entire offensive playbook, curry also gets AD when he comes back.   this is something I would like to see tbh, I wanna see curry in a new system no longer having to read those curry-warriors slander, and going supernova, and when AD gets back... oof"
"His TS% is 55.3%. A modest improvement considering he is playing on a team with Steph Curry gravity. When playing with Draymond Green and not KAT, it will make a lot of players defense look vastly improved."
"Outside of KD, none of these guys play remotely the same. And comparing joe Harris to draymond green is beyond laughable. They legitimately have opposite skill sets."
&gt;Draymond Green = Joe Harris  and it got worse from there
Lebron 2015s Draymond Green 2016s Kobe Bryant  Kevin garnet Mutumbo
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
Yeah very common play to drive and then dump it off. It’s also not like Bradley Beal is Draymond green
Are you telling me Draymond green is better than Ben Simmons?
"Again... Draymond Green averages more assists per game, with almost half the turnovers per game, that LeBron James does... does that make Draymond Green a better passer than LeBron??   If you gave Zion the same opportunities handling the ball that NY has given to their only ""star"" FA signing since Melo it would be undeniable; Zion hasn't even played 60 games in his career yet. Randle meanwhile has gotten to play point forward for like 2.5 years now, and in that same amount of time from now this isn't even going to be a debate. Feel free to do a !remindme or whatever it is for when that time comes if if you're that indignant to the contrary lol."
"Magic Johnson, Pj Tucker, Draymond Green, Bruce Brown (he played center for us last game), Wilt.   Game over."
"Well his body type disguise him in this conversations but Draymon Green is the best comparison that I have seen.   AK has the same elite defensive instincts, and near level court vision (not playmaking, Draymond is in another level there) with a much better athletism all around - agility, jumping etc.   He wasn't a great shooter, and probably wouldn't be one in today's game too. But he was the guy that every team ever would want as 3rd or 4rd option. IMO, he is very underrated."
Let’s not pretend that Celtics fans thought their supporting cast was actually decent in the beginning of the season lmao.   “Grant Williams next Draymond green”  “Semi Ojeleye has reinvented himself into a top tier sniper role player”   “Tristan Thompson is better than Myles Turner and his championship experience will help the Celtics”
https://theundefeated.com/features/light-skinned-vs-dark-skinned/  https://sports.yahoo.com/news/draymond-green-steph-curry-light-skinned-players-want-make-soft-162527235.html
"Yea, his vision is better and the defensive attention he attracts is more than Randle does, so even if the former wasn't true he'd still be more effective running an offense just by way of how much he can manipulate the opposing defense as long as he's not selfish and has good enough decision making on-ball (which he does).   Not that Randle is a BAD passer, or that Zion is the next coming of Magic or anything ridiculous, but I'd say yes he is definitely better when you look beyond counting stats. Like Draymond Green is averaging more assists per game than LeBron this season... but obviously that doesn't make him the better passer lol. As Zion gets more games and minutes in the role that Randle's been occupying for literal years it'll become more apparent."

Maybe you should consider that dudes like lebron James and draymond green know what they are talking about."
"The year Myers became GM, the team drafted Draymond Green, Festus Ezeli and Harrison Barnes. They had the 28-30th pick of the first round for five straight years and still ended up with two playoff level rotation players in Eric Paschall and Kevon Looney. The jury is still out on Poole, he's currently the G Leagues top scorer while taking time in the bubble. Smiley is trash and nobody can convince me otherwise.  Compared to someone like the Raptors, our GMs aren't great, but compared to teams like the Hornets or the Pistons, the Warriors FO is incredible."
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
"No, that's Jokic. Green is great, but most of his passes are hand-offs, simple passes to Curry coming off a screen, or hitting the backdoor cut when the defense overplays. Jokic has a much greater variety of passes (i.e. he throws it Luka Doncic style cross court to an open shooter, no look passes that actually trick the defense, etc.). And no one is better at passing to cutters than Jokic; the way he threads the needle is just ridiculous.   Draymond is a great point forward and passer, but Jokic is already among the greatest passers of all time. For the numbers on this: [Ben Taylor's analysis of Jokic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okIwFBdbEOc)"

draymond green would drop 50 on you before you could score one field goal against him
"Draymond ''Quintuple Single"" Green"
"What?  What makes Curry/Klay/Dray so lethal is Curry. Specifically that he's an elite PG that can flex as an equally elite SG, harden does not have that flexibility at the same level.  Steph may shoot the 3 or drive and I'll give harden that he's a match for Curry here, but Curry may also give the ball to Draymond who's an elite passer and you now have two unstoppable shooting guards scrambling off ball for him to pass to. Harden does not do this.  Players talk about why they say Curry is so lethal and it's his off ball movement, harden doesn't compare. If anything he's playing a Green type role but with a better 3 point average."
Such a dirtbag  https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavsnation.com/draymond-green-refers-kevin-loves-shoulder-injury-calling-kelly-olynyk-dirty/amp/
"I'm factoring in that players that aren't superstar level would be making significantly less than they are currently.   There's no way Holiday gets 40M a year from any basketball team on the planet. No way Draymond Green makes as much as he does either if you have to have significantly better players than him in order to be a contender. Drummond never sniffs anything close to 30M a year, etc in the type of environment I'm suggesting."
"Bro, Curry still has Draymond green leading the team in assists every single year. Curry has never even been the primary facilitator on his own team. Harden has had to do everything on his teams. I’m sure Harden’s efficiency would go up if he was a secondary playmaker to a point forward that often found him open looks at the perimeter. Stop comparing just numbers, it’s ridiculous. Curry often is moving off-ball and finding good looks, while Harden is running the whole offense the entire time. Apples and oranges."
2012 one was the best one Ive seen in a long time  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Tomas Satoransky  Will Barton  Jae Crowder  Kyle OQuinn  Quincy Acy  Darius Miller  Mike Scott
"and Harden's floater/lob combo has been crushing non Draymond Green having teams for almost a decade, so join the club I guess"
"Honestly... if Draymond Green was not on the teams he has played on, we would be looking at his career the same way we view a say....  a Tristian Thompson.  You put Draymond on say..  the Rockets?    Well.. you'd probably see the true Draymond... giving up an whining."
"Honestly, I don't understand how anyone takes the two finals losses to the Warriors seriously. Nobody on earth was beating a team with prime Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, with good coaching to boot."
They need Richard Jefferson and Draymond Green. Players who can take a joke and aren't going to complain when a big shoots a 3.
"The fact that if we look back over draft history and there isn't a single GM that drafts the best player available at the time shows that it is mostly a crap-shoot.  For the guys outside the generational talents (e.g. Lebron, Shaq, AD) I feel like it depends mostly on the team fit more than the actual player. I think it was Draymond Green that said ""the player wasn't a bust, the team bust him""."
"He’s Draymond green, he doesn’t have to shoot"
"Steph Curry has been extremely blessed with a team around him that simply could never be matched. While he is the greatest shooter of all time, he also has been blessed to have a teammate in Klay Thompson who is the 2nd greatest shooter of all time, a defensive player of the year in Draymond Green, and an MVP winner and all-time scoring titan in Kevin Durant. Curry has been able to avoid double-teams most of his career, he's had Klay and Draymond to defend the opposing team's best players, and he's been free to soak up all the fame that comes with the accolades that a perfect team accumulates and project his face into the reason it happened."
"Draymond Green has Eric Cartman levels of self-awareness. Of course *he* knows all about the game, but those hall of famers and former all-stars? *They* don't know shit."
"Draymond Green is the most overrated player in the history of all sports. Also when he was at Michigan State he used to “accidentally” kick guys in the balls, does the same stuff in the NBA. Fuck that guy."
I rewound twice and I'm still not sure Kenny said in his joke about Draymond Green.

"Is he implying this is one of the reasons he left OKC?   We thought you were someone who would hang out with Draymond green during the finals, and didn't think anything of it at the time because players hang out, and now we know that you're someone who can't handle the cognitive dissonance that there is a negative reputation that comes from joining the team with the best regular season in nba season, who conveniently beat the Thunder, while you were hanging out with Draymond Green."
"Petition to eventually change the NBA Finals crew to Ian Eagle, Stan Van Gundy, and Draymond Green"
Draymond Green can't say nothing about being competitive dude literally cried in a parking and went and got KD because Lebron (who he's business partners with) whooped his ass.   Tf is competitive about that.
"Draymond green shut the fuck up already, if you had not played for the warriors with steph and klay you would be just another average roleplayer no one would give a shit about."
"Reminds me of Draymond's story about [trying to talk shit to Tim Duncan](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15532035/draymond-green-playoffs-diary-part-10).  &gt;""I do have a Tim Duncan story.

I just kept talking junk to him and he kept staring at me.  &gt;""At that point I realized during the rest of my career that I might as well not talk to him.

I figured then that was the last time I would talk junk to Tim. And that was the last time."""
"Probably not, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see CP3 making a huge difference that series."
"&gt; On February 23, 2011, the Golden State Warriors acquired Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round draft pick (the 35th pick) from the New Jersey Nets (now Brooklyn Nets) in exchange for Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric.  That 2012 second-round draft pick was Draymond Green."
Fuck Draymond Green.
"Draymond ""pull yourself up from your bootstraps"" green"
Dude how fucking stupid is Mark Jackson to stake his coaching career on his political disagreement with gay marriage when his boss was openly and proudly gay. Like if he didn’t do that he probably could’ve kept running 50 steph pick and rolls a game and kept Draymond Green at the 3 position till he fell out of the league. Jackson is such an idiot it’s insane
"Haha I always feel for Wiseman when it shows Draymond kind of shouting advice and input at him every single moment of reprieve they have on the court. Like obviously you know you’ve got to listen and absorb everything you can, especially from someone like Draymond Green, but damn I bet it gets tiring getting barked at in that abrasive tone all game"
"Now put Curry's 3 point percentage without Draymond Green on the floor to hook him up with assisted shots, Curry has nearly double the assisted field goal percentage of dame and harden"

Marcus smart is the eastern conference Draymond green a good general lithmus test for someone and their ability to analyze the game comes through what they think of him
"I listened to the podcast today.  It's clear the media blew it up based on the story they both gave. This article still tries to make it seem bigger than it was, in my opinion. They're leaving out the fact that Draymond basically explained that KD cussing him out is a regular occurrence. Also that Draymond told the Warriors' front office that he and KD would figure it out -- which they basically ignored by suspending him.  And then the article talks about how the call after the 2016 finals was BS and is actually a text saying ""you just watch that shit?"" (both KD and Green confirmed this on the podcast). Why does Bleacher Report clear this up and not the on-court incident?"
Draymond Green had that “Noah prime”. 3 and done. RIP
I wonder if Draymond Green tried taking shit to OG but OG calmly proceed to Wrestlemania smack him down
"Yes, when I think of MJ and Kobe I immediately go, “Man they’re so similar to Draymond Green.”"
"You mean people cant fathom how a guy who had to get held back from trying to fight Steve Kerr over him yelling fuck you, [who repeatedly had to be restrained from going at teammates](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17790252/golden-state-draymond-green-problem), and who got suspended [by his own team by how he overreacted in a confrontation with Kevin Durant](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-kevin-durant-argument-suspension-what-did-they-say-report) doesnt lose it sometimes, go overboard and get sensitive. As a general reddit rule people always will look for reasons to be pedantic and argue ""well actually!!"" about how these things dont mean that but the point is obvious."
Draymond Green last seen talking to Warriors to trade him to Phoenix.
"So he’s above 2 young stars notorious for not being able to get to the line, and known scorer Draymond Green.   Ngl looking at this list just makes it look worse for the officiating lol"
"Just from that list of top 100 FTA/FGA, he's above Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, etc."
"Just so you know, no one actually thinks Draymond Green could guard Shaq."
"Love it, although it would be better to have the default be Per36. Gives a much different top 4, which makes sense with “hustle” being an attribute of sparkplug bench guys. Love Dipo and Sabonis but there’s no way they hustle more than TJ.  Per36:   1. Thaddeus Young   2. Andre Drummond   3. Draymond Green   4. TJ McConnell"
Yea a carry job of Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green lol. Wth?
"You mean the team with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and Andrew Bogut?"
Draymond Green vs the whole team USA soccer women’s roster
Yeah they were so stacked that Draymond green cried to KD In the parking lot to join them after getting beaten up by cavs.
Draymond Green would love this for sure
"&gt; series of tweets by Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green in which he, in part, blamed women for making ""complaints"" rather than taking action over disparities in pay and investment in women's sports.  &gt; ""You don't think we asked for more money? I mean, what are we screaming about? Nonstop!""  I don't think Draymond just meant asking ""can we have some more?"" when he referred to ""taking action.""  As a 2nd-generation union member, I've never heard of a labor action where the union just ""asks for more money."" An ""action"" usually refers to something a little more substantive than asking politely - it's a slowdown, sickout, strike, etc.  The problem for the WNBA is that a strike doesn't hurt management financially - it likely helps them, seeing as his the WNBA operates in the red, financially."
ah yeah they should just get Draymond Green
Except they really don’t.. your take is laughably bad. Andrew Wiggins and Draymond green would be the 2nd and third best players on those rockets  Even kelly oubre is average 15 a game albeit on bad efficiency
"This is pretty funny but the sad part is that there really are people stupid enough to believe that Draymond Green is merely a product of Steph Curry   Sure, playing with Curry maximizes Green's offensive strengths but he'd be a great passer regardless of who he played with (as evidenced by last season) and he'd be an all-time great defender if he had never shared a minute of court time with Curry"
"People always underrated it because he got attacked almost nonstop in the first couple years of them being good, but in reality he was just an around league average defender sharing the court with Andre Igoudala, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Bogut. So that’s 2 of the top 15(IMO) non big defensive players of all time; one of the best two way shooting guards of the last 15 years; a 2nd team all defense level Rim protector; and an above wing Defender with a lot of versatility. It’s hard to not to look bad when other team exclusively scheme to attack you."
Kerr essentially created draymond green and look at how well Wiggins has done since coming to golden state
When Healthy Draymond Green
"Draymond green averages 8 assists a game and plays elite defense, andrew wiggins averages 18 PPG and shoots 40% from three and plays elite defense, harden carried the shit out of that team. Stephs team isn’t good but other players have won games with players just as bad and you need to face that"
"&gt; andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they  Jesus christ, if you think Oubre or Looney is at all comparable to the talent the Rockets had in 2015 you didn't watch that team. Green is great on defense, but I'm focusing on the offensive talent the Warriors lack. Wiggins is the only player that is comparable to the offensive talent Houston had."
"the fact that you ignored the warriors best players and used the guys at the end of the bench to prove your point kind of shows how dumb it is. andrew wiggins, draymond green, kevon looney, kelley oubre, do they not exist? or are we going to pretend ariza 40 year old jason terry and corey brewer were way better for the sake of making curry look good"
Nobody gives a shit about boomer whining over tanking or building teams through free agency  The chances of drafting a Draymond Green or Nikola Jokic in the second round are immensely small. Counting on that is not a very viable strategy. The Warriors just got lucky that they drafted one of the greatest defensive players ever who also happened to be an all-time passer at his position.
they got downvoted for the trade idea. that's a terrible trade for the warriors when you already have Draymond Green...

PG: **Bugs Bunny**  This may seem like a cop out, since he [apparently](https://thewordwebzine.weebly.com/sports/analytical-breakdown-of-the-space-jam-tune-squad) played point in the original space jam, but since I've never seen the movie I think I'll still do it. I'm looking for him to be a fast moving pass-first point guard in the mold of a JJ Barea or Chris Clemons; with a quick first step and good leverage on taller players. Defenders actually have to play back a bit further than they might for a taller playmaker (which they're comfortable doing because his release point is so low), which should give him the space to make some elaborate gags... sorry, *plays* and break down defense in the halfcourt.  SG: **Alan Powers**  Iconic character from the Arthur franchise Powers, better known as The [Brain](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Alan_Powers), is actually one of the few characters on this list who is confirmed to be a basketball player, and an elite one a that. In the first episode of season 14 (The Wheel Deal), we see that he is a next level shooter, apparently capable of draining hundreds of free throws in a row. In the mold of a Joe Harris or a stockier Duncan Robinson, he is a *literal* bear who can be trusted to get to his spot and make the shot. Additionally, with a confirmed IQ of ~140, I think he will be an invaluable asset as a big body who can get position and make the extra pass.  SF: **Prospero** It's been a long time since I read the play, but I'm reasonably sure that Prospero was the antagonist of Shakespeare's [The Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest). I'm not looking for much here, he's probably by far the worst of the starters... but since he got exiled to an island I think his magical abilities present surprising upside on a *great* contract. Hopefully his proclivity for plotting and penchant for potions translate to a sort of defensive floor general role in the mold of a slightly less evil Draymond Green.  PF: **Hobbes** Although I would be interested in what the realist philosopher could bring to the table, in the power forward position I've chosen the titular tiger from Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes."" Hobbes is a athletic freak, capable of astonishing high speed contortions and explosive acrobatics. He has unmatched straight line speed and [elite](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/05/27) agility. In the mold of a skinny Blake Griffin or even Charles Barkley type, I'm expecting a lot of activity on the boards and a good nose for putbacks. His number one asset is his motor, which as a cat is only really bested by patches of sunlight... fortunately, no NBA arenas have windows.  C: **Mr. Hyde** The alter ego of Dr. Jekyll... it's not clear to me whether the pre-game serum he takes to transform would be banned by the league, but I can't imagine it's that different from gatorade so I'll allow it. He is described as a violent, hulking figure with a disposition towards arson trampling. This is no posh fop or dainty cartoon, he is quite literally a metaphor for evil, and I think he brings a much needed raw audacity to the group, the kind of creature to impose his will on the game and ""dominate erneh."" He's definitely going to be a bit undersized, but we've seen plenty of centers who've made that work. Look for Look for him to play a Daniel Theis type role, potentially morphing back into Dr. Jekyll when he's at the three point line for the steady hand and scientists eye.   I think they fizzle out in the conference finals tbh."
"For the Bucks, [I’d love this trade.](https://tradenba.com/trades/NOwOcZD90)   Bucks get: Draymond Green  Warriors get: Pat Connaughton, Donte Divencenzo, and PJ Washington  Hornets: get Brook Lopez, 1st round top 5 protected Milwaukee pick (the soonest one MIL can give up after the Jrue deal)  Why do the Bucks say yes?  Draymond Green is the perfect player for this Bucks team. With Draymond, we have a lineup of Jrue/Middleton/MLE Starter(PJ Tucker again maybe?)/Giannis/Draymond, and that’s guaranteed the number one defense even if Jabari Parker is the starter to be named later. Dray fits in perfect defensively, as Giannis can go back to the free safety role and terrorize while Draymond protects the rim and the paint and Jrue and Mids lock up the perimeter.   Offensively, Dray fits in as the main facilitator. Giannis and Jrue are okay to good as facilitators, but adding Draymond gives the offense a whole new dimension where Khris and Jrue play as off ball shooters while Giannis and Dray play a two man game.  Dray is an upgrade over Brook, and it sucks losing Donte and Patty Cakes, but the upgrade is worth it and I believe makes us top tier title contenders, which is something we are not with Brook Lopez starting.  Why do the Warriors do it?  Giving up the heart and soul of your dynasty isn’t ideal, but you’re getting 3 quality players back, 2 of whom still have great upside. We’ve heard all year how the bench is weak, and it’s their downfall, because, well, it is.  Now with Klay coming back you have Steph/Klay/Wigs/PJ/Wiseman with Donte as a perfect 6th man/Klay recovery fill-in, and another solid bench guy in Pat Connaughton. Also, they have MIN’s 1st and their own. It’s possible they have a Steph/Klay/Cade/Kuminga/Wiseman lineup if the lottery falls perfectly for them.   And even if it doesn’t, they’ll still in theory add 2 NBA caliber players in the draft. This year they have 3.5 competent players (Steph, Wigs, Dray, .5Looney), if they did this trade, next year they’d have (Steph, Klay, Wigs, PJ, Pat, Donte, GS pick, MN pick, .5Looney, .5Wiseman). So they go from 3 quality players to 9 (and 10 if Wiseman develops), restoring their depth from the title days. Replacing Dray with a young PJ Washington and adding two high quality bench guys that will mollywop other bench units. All of a sudden their bench goes from the steaming pile of dump it is this year, to a bench lineup of Poole/Donte/Pat/Paschall/Looney, a top bench lineup in the whole league to go along with world class starters.  Why do the Hornets do this?  Well, simple. You’re upgrading at a spot where you need to, and getting a 1st round pick. You’re the benefactor of having PJ Washington as a piece that GS wants over Brook Lopez, all the while Lopez helps you too.  Lopez is a clear upgrade over Zeller, and Melo/Rozier/Bridges/Hayward/Lopez is a playoff lineup for sure. Brook is tailor made to play with Melo, pick and pops would be deadly, and Lopez is great in the post which becomes an enhanced skill with Melo throwing entry passes to him.   PJ is a good young player, but Lopez helps you more now, and you get a 1st as well. No brainer."

lol at people who call draymond green elite. His game is so limited.
He’s a fan of a team that has Draymond “natural shooting motion” Green as their mascot. Wouldn’t expect anything less 🤣
"He wouldnt be useless if he was actually used properly - he just hasn't ever been used the right way in Philly.   He's supposed to be a better version of Draymond Green in the PnR, capitalizing off the 4v3s by either attacking downhill and scoring or finding the open shooter  He's not supposed to be the guy running the PnR. He's the roll man"
"Draymond Green  3 points and Defense, right?"
"Dont be so hard on yourself. You know things we dont so its a give and take. I will say be weary of this sub if you are beginner because at times it can seem like only 5-6 teams matter and it comes and goes in waves. Understandably as those are the best teams (jazz, Suns, 76ers, Nuggets)  or teams with one of the best players (Mavs, Blazers)  Your best bet is watching as many games as you can and if you cant catch a game just go to Youtube and get the condensed version of the game. The more you ingest of that the more you'll learn players tendencies and capabilities. Also theres thousands upon thousands of highlight tapes of old players on youtube as well.   The thing I really like about the NBA is there are 10-15-20 elite guys (depending who you ask) but each guy has their own way of being effective and elite. Ben Simmons is a great example. Guy is 100% elite but cant shoot the ball worth a lick so check out some youtube highlights and you'll see how an Elite NBA player that cant shoot is so dominate (basically does everything else at an elite level besides shooting).   [https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  This site is basically a basketball bible if you wanna deep dive into stats. Also this is good for beginners so you can check who leads the league in whatever category and going back to the youtube thing, and check out their highlights or you can just type in ""Draymond Green Defensive highlights"" and you'll be able to see the things he does well.    I've been a 2k player for many years. Recently gave it up because gameplay sucked ass and its not realistic. I could see the benefits for a beginner from a roster standpoint but I do not recommend this method. Really not at all how real basketball is played."
"Agreed, id argue thats why most nba fans cant really see why Draymond Green is so impactful. Which is kind of a shame"
Im going  Pg ben Sg jimmy buckets Sf giannis alphabet bro Pf draymond day day green  C bam bam adebayo While this team may suck at guarding lil mfs under 6'3 we gon have jrue the best guard defender come off the bench to fix that.
I think his videos showcase that steph is actually a very good defensive guard. But it is true that anchors like Draymond Green will always be more impactful than perimeter guys like Kawhi Leonard.   In the same way that an offensive manipulator like Lebron will always be more impactful than bucket getters like KD.   I guess it’s because those guys dictate the way a possession will go while the others don’t really have that level of control. So i can’t really argue against him on that.
I think the hate comes from the fact that you can’t play Rudy Gobert deeper into the playoffs because he struggles to defend in space. He was a legit liability vs Houston.   Not fitting of a DPOY.   Id say a better example of bias against defensive minded players is the Draymond Green slander
The Draymond Green (prevent opposing player from producing children)
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"Draymond Green 2018, 2019. Had top 3 impact in 2019 playoffs along with curry and Kawhi."
"Depending on the definition you are using  Not an all-star: Brodgon, CJ, Grant, T. Harris, Draymond Green  Good Starter: Lonzo,J Harris, Wiggins, Royce O'Neale, Ayton, AG  Low Level starter/6th Man:Jordan Clarkson, Fournier, Donte Divencenzo, PJ Tucker, Jonas Valancunas  I think overall this is a pretty solid list of guys who could be considered role players or not."
"if we're talking RIGHT now... dort, bruce brown, draymond green or duncan robinson  thru history... steve kerr, robert horry, dennis rodman"
I can't believe two redditors is trying to convince everyone that Draymond Green NBA DPOY doesn't know defense because his 19 year old rookie teammate is lost on defense.
Draymond Green would be a good kicker.
Draymond Green has entered the chat
Draymond green
"For the sake of anonymity, we will refer to him as D. Green...no, that’s too obvious - Draymond G."
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
"&gt; This is a good point, but I would just add to it with that I dont think Curry is as dependent on Dray as vice/versa, though Dray obviously makes him better.  It's clear that Draymond is maximized with Steph on the floor, but Steph still plays around the same level without Draymond. Kerr has been doing some lineups with Green out with Steph in and vice versa for a few minutes a game and it's essentially the same result as having just the bench out there in terms of offensive output."
Draymond Green has come out and said he was being a bad role model and he needs to cut the shit.
feels like we have this convo every year. when will people accept that some players can be impactful and great without being scorers i.e draymond green
&gt;Oh it had nothing to do with Curry and Green being out last year and Klay losing two years of his Prime. Nothing at all   Draymond played most of the last year. He played like shit but he played.  And even with Curry on the court you are a 0.500 team.
Why is it unnamed? lol. It was Draymond Green
Who is Draymond Green? Alex.
I wonder when this sub will realize that Steph is almost as dependent on Draymond as Draymond is on him. Dray anchors the D and is the perfect 4 on 3 guy for when Curry gets trapped like Dame does. He also can handle and playmake which frees Curry to be at his most devastating as he can be elusive on the move.  Stephen Curry without Draymond Green(2020-21) via statmuse:  GSWGSW	 gp:5	 min_avg: 34.6	 ppg: 26.2	 reb: 4.4  ast:	7.8	 Stl: 1.8 Blk: 0.4	 TO: 4.0	 Fgm: 8.2	 Fga: 21.0	 Fg%39.0	 3pm: 3.8	 3pa: 12.8	 3pt%29.7	 +|-:	-33   This is not a knock on Steph Curry btw.
https://theathletic.com/1892238/2020/07/01/anonymous-nba-coaches-poll-best-defenders/ Athletic 33 out of 34 coaches polled Ben as one of leagues best defenders and worthy of 1st team all NBA in response to an espn poll leaving him off.  Kendrick Perkins also called him the best defender in the league in a YouTube video but he’s espn head so take as you will  But Draymond Green has also spoken highly of Ben’s defense https://sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/draymond-green-explains-why-respect-151505256.html Ben was the only player he mentions by name when praising defense etc.  point is with the amount of info on google and sources everywhere. If I wanna search for confirmation bias about Ben or Jrue it’s definitely out there
"Perimeter: Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, Kawhi, Butler, OG, Draymond, Tatum  Paint: Gobert, Davis, Draymond, Embiid, Bam, Noel, Capela  Giannis does a little of everything, so I couldn’t really classify him for one of them. He’s more of a freelancer, but he’s very good at it. Clearly the defensive anchor for a top team.  Edit: I didn’t want to add him because it’s kinda of a homer take, but RJ Barrett has really impressed me as a perimeter defender. He’s shown that he can hang with the best in 1v1 situations and make it difficult for them."
"This has me thinking, is Ben Simmons ever going to surpass peak Draymond (2014-2017)? Green was an all-time help defender and excellent passer in the half-court even if he was getting left wide open from 3. Imo neither his offense nor his defense are as good as Green’s at his peak."
Called it. Taller draymond green
Draymond green is a good player but ben simmons has every single tool to be better than him he had the playmaking ability and the size plus the bball iq to be a good defender. He should be better than draymond green by every measure
"It’s not about any player being one or the other. Al the great players are both but some players are clearly better at certain aspects than others.   For example draymond green. Green on a bad team last year was virtually worthless as his playmaking on offense is not useful without other shooters. But you put draymond on a twam with another offensive star and all of a sudden his impact numbers explode and he actually looks like a top 20 player in the league.   Then you can look at lebron and wade. Two elite floor raisers, top 1 and top 5 players team up on their prime and the resulting sum is much less than the parts. They don’t work off each other on offense and lebron led lineups with the bench actually performed better at times than when they were together. The twam still worked because of the overwhelming talent but you can see there wasn’t a synergy there.   Then you look at lebron and AD. Lakers trade away most of their team, get worse at basically every position but add AD and get significantly better.  If you look at that trade of who came and went you might think numbers wise Davis is worth over 30 wins to a team that was already decent."
Yeah but would you have made a post in 2016 saying draymond green should have upped his scoring+5ppg by now? Simmons plays his role and is a pretty decent scorer for a guy that will never take a significant number of jumpshots

Rudy Gobert kissing Draymond Green
"After watching hundreds of Warriors games over the past years, it’s become very clear to me how good Draymond Green is, but I would suspect fans of other teams could have him be from top 20 to 100 in the league"
So are Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green? Each missed 5 games and are nowhere even close
Yeah Draymond Green was everyone’s favorite player.
"I just read a quote of him saying "" not to brag but im really, really good at this game..""  You may be good bro but Great players never do shit like this. This is dirty AF and he SHOULD be fined by the league for this to make a point as to why you Can NOT be a dirty bitch as  player like this. F this guy.

"Draymond green (player for the Warriors) tends to elevate his level of play in the playoffs, which are 16 games"
"Well, weird post but cool time to share my ideal Warriors team after the Off-Season.  Steph/Jessup (Or an appealing vet bench player)  Klay/Poole/Lee  Wiggins/Jalen Green/Bazmore  Draymond/JTA/Looney  Wiseman/Chriss  Summary-  Nico is on a 2 way, we SnT Oubre for Picks/TPE, that sort of stuff, Smiley is waived, Looney is moved to the 4 and so is JTA so Dray can be preserved and spacing is fixed, we get Chriss back, we trade Paschall for some 2nd rounder or something, not sure, maybe a part of a bigger trade, we get Jessup, we get the 4th pick from Minnie and draft Green OR package our pick and the Wolves pick for the 4th pick.  Since the moves aren't too drastic, you have a nice amount of assets to play with for any surprise FA or trade demands. Think that team can make a great run in the playoffs and is set up for the future."
"Ideally both, a guy like a Draymond Green that maybe won't lock you up every possession but make your team better thanks to BBIQ and preperation, that could help with rotations and anticipate anything that's coming."
"Bro it’s the all time regular season record. They also won the chip the year before.   The warriors were a significantly better team but cavs had everything break right plus super heroics from the best player of our generation   Curry injured in first round vs rockets, never was the same that run.  Bogus injured in finals  Iguodala injured back in finals  Draymond green suspension game 6"
In the real world the NBA is a guard/wing ran league. In the real world Rudy Gobert gets ate alive by any above average guard and wing in the post season. It’s why y’all can’t get out of the first round of the playoffs. Your best defensive player is not great in space at all and when an NBA coach is given the chance to gameplay to take advantage of that y’all get smoked. Why do you think Jamal Murray was giving y’all 50 every game last year in the bubble?? Get Gobert out of the paint and he’s a liability. Every guard/wing in the league thinks that guy is food. You know who they don’t think that about?? Draymond green. Lots of guys SAY they can guard 1 through 5. There’s only one guy who actually DOES IT EVERY GAME. Good day.
Dude Draymond green is arguably better then you
"I know this is a bit ridiculous, but what if that same team had all-time defensive player and great playmaker, Draymond Green?"
"Eh? Green got a combined total of 2 first place votes the years Gobert won, he didn't finish top 5 either year and was barely on the radar. Should have won at least one of those is a baseless statement.  Rudy probably should won have over Draymond in 16-17, defensive statistics heavily favored him. Realistically Draymond won that one because he was well known from the GS playoff runs while most voters barely even knew who Gobert was that year.  14-15 he got more first place votes than Kawhi, though not by a lot.   As far as I can tell he should have at most two, if you give him the one in 14-15 and don't give the 16-17 one to Gobert.  I think he probably has the right amount, but it should have been 14-15 instead of 16-17."
"Pretty cool pattern where a player is clearly next up for any variety of reasons (improvement, previous DPOY falters or gets injured, shift in perceived value) and ends up winning it the following year.   1984/1985: Mark Eaton  1991/1992: David Robinson  1994/1995: Dikembe Mutombo  2003/2004: Metta World Peace  2011/2012: Tyson Chandler  2016/2017: Draymond Green  2017/2018: Rudy Gobert  2019/2020: Giannis Antetokounmpo"
" &gt;Draymond green is a former DPOY, but he’s still a very solid defender.  He is more than solid."
"Do what? You think Draymond Green is close to the post defender that Rodman and Wallace were? Green was always getting abused by AD and LMA. Both finesse bigs. Shaq would eat him alive. Hell, Chuck would be too much. Too skilled, strong and athletic for Draymond."
Draymond green should have 3 I’m still mad about that smh
"I would also say that Shaq's basketball IQ is underrated.  He likes to act like a clown, but he's always had a good eye for the game and he could read offensive and defensive actions effectively in real time.  He wasn't a genius like Jokic or Draymond Green, but he was a very smart player."
C- Draymond Green  PF- Demar Derozan  SF- Jimmy Butler   SG- Brad Wannamaker  PG- TJ McConnell   The playmaking/3pt mason union lineup from hell. Imagine game after game being watching beautiful passes end in wide open bricks from 3.
Personally I feel like a draymond green is more valuable on defense
"Think of if this way. He’s basically Draymond Green except if he happened to be a better wing than paint defender, and if he could score at a top 10 level when it comes to 2s. He’s a fantastic player who always keeps the offense flowing and makes sure the defense is set. It’s very hard to measure these sorts of contributions but the BPM and advanced stats love him for it"
"Also, Curry moves off the ball so much because Golden State has a reliable playmaker that shares the floor with him in Draymond Green. Bogi is the only other guy in our starting 5 who I trust as a secondary ball handler"
Really? I thought he would've gotten worse on defense playing with Draymond Green and getting coached by Steve Kerr instead of Ryan Saunders.
I am scratching my head thinking why he made the Draymond Green comparison. I guess it is because he is undersized and gets a lot of steals. Draymond is a really special player and one of his best abilities is his switchability on defense and that is one of the biggest question marks with Sengun.
So he is a great passing version of Enes Kanter with Draymond Green defense? Isn't that a little optimistic? That would a HOF caliber player easily.
"I think calling him a below-average shooter is a bit disingenuous. The fact that he's shooting 81% from the line shows that he is more than capable of becoming a respectable shooter, but there's just no reason to settle for jumpshots when he's capable of getting such great looks in the paint. His FG% was 64.6, so it doesn't make sense to settle for jumpers when he can get a better look in the paint almost every time. I still think his shooting is a bit of a question mark, but I think it's promising.  The Draymond Green comparison is a bad one though, I agree with that."
"Draymond green ? No way lmao. Sengun is an efficient score first center who is a below average shooter, he doesn’t Even have a sliver of Draymond in him lol."

The Warriors forward surpassed Rick Barry and Michael Ray Richardson to break the Warriors’ single-season record for steals in a game.   &gt;   &gt;It was only the second time in NBA history that a player has posted at least 10 rebounds, assists, and steals, dating back to Alvin Robertson’s quadruple-double in 1986, according to Basketball-Reference.   &gt;   &gt;Had he scored six more points, the Warriors forward would have become just the fourth player since 1983-84 to post a quadruple-double alongside Robertson, David Robinson, and Hakeem Olajuwon, according to Basketball-Reference.  He was 6 points away from becoming the first ever to have BOTH a quad-double AND a 5x5 in the same game."
He’s easily the most NBA ready player there is. He can evolve to a scorer version of Draymond Green. He MUST be a lottery pick.

Draymond Green himself said the same thing and it's the pinned comment on HoH's post.
Kuz used to be a revolving door. He's not Draymond Green but he definitely plays defense well on wings he can keep up with. Fast guards blow by him but he still gives a lot of guys some friction at least. Kuzma the first few years wouldn't even give you that
"Draymond Green: ""We ain't no 'We Believe 2.0' We got fuc*king Steph Curry on our team."" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  https://twitter.com/DrewShiller/status/1392341379234238465?s=19"
"Stephen ""Can't Carry"" Curry is playing with:   * Draymond ""Unscorer"" Green * Andrew ""No Heart"" Wiggins * Kent ""Foul Trouble Vet-Min"" Bazemore * Kevon ""Oldest 25-Year-Old Ever"" Looney * a bunch of G-Leaguers  Even without two all-stars, the Jazz still have better depth than the Warriors, yet the Warriors won anyway."
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
Durant wasn’t the one getting locked up by K Love and losing a finals mvp to Draymond green
"I always think hes a better Draymond Green, in a right team and a right system, AK could have been much greater."
"&gt; Shaq wont get the ball 100% of the time on offense.   Prime Shaq probably *would* get the ball 100% of the time, actually. He might not shoot it every time he touches it, but it would just be stupid to not have him touch it at least once every time you were in your half court offense.   You have to realize that you couldn't just take the ball out of Shaq's hands, nor could you just foul him with smaller players and make that your strategy. Even guys completely wrapping Shaq up were unlikely to prevent him from scoring unless they were close to his size. All that did was just give him and an one. If you wanted to just foul Shaq all game and be able to have those fouls prevent a dunk then you needed huge, legit centers to foul him. If you put like Draymond Green on him, Shaq is just gonna stuff him through the rim cause Shaq would have outweighed him by over 100 pounds."
"I’m not sure how you validate all those names, but some, not most, of those guys are much more individually recognized but Draymond’s impact on the entire team defense is flying heavy under the radar. With all the injuries and not having a single game from our 2-way elite guard, we still are 5th in DTRG. The 8th-10th seeded Santa Cruz and Curry warriors are 5th??? All because of Green. He’s a defensive anchor every single year for almost a decade now and has a few years left to continue I’d say. You create a compelling list but Draymond is 100% in the discussion at least."
"I see a lot of posts saying that the Lakers are fine with the play in....Be careful what you ask for...getting Curry and Draymond Green in the play in is far from a guaranteed win.    If they lose, they have a second bite at the playoff apple, but anything can happen in one game especially with the recent injury bug."
"And you just quoted Charles Barkley. Tell me you have no idea what you’re talking about without telling me. Your contributions in this back and forth should be a lesson in Nephew Projection.   Curry is the most important part of our offense. Wow, what a ground breaking revelation. Draymond is our de facto point guard who takes advantage of Steph’s talent and importance. That’s all there is, and this as not an argument against Green being an extension of Kerr helping orchestrate our motion offense. But keep wasting your time. Jokic is both Steph and Green to your team on offense now w/ Murray gone, and in that there is room for role comparison.   In your latest confusion, **you’ve repeatedly conflated a player’s role with their production AND value.**  This argument started as Green’s quality of assists to Steph, and you’ve desperately tried to misconstrue and hyper focus on something else every time you’re against a wall. And now we’re here, with you trying to gaslight this into whatever you typed up that doesn’t apply. What a shit show  Disable Reply Notifications, you the real MVP 😂"
"Wood is a lot better than you're giving him credit for, plus Golden State would be all for a win-now move to take advantage of what's left of the Curry era.  Wood is under contract at a fair value for two more seasons. Yes it sounds like a lot for Wood, but that's why I mentioned a package around Wood, not ONLY Wood. Houston could throw in draft picks or even a guy like Tate (who could be a cheaper/decent replacement for Draymond Green) or take on bad contracts from Golden State (Oubre or Wiggins).  &amp;#x200B;  A lot of it depends on where the Minnesota pick lands, but it could work out for both teams."
"Which team in the west had a worse roster last season? You can call it tanking but they really had no choice because they’re roster was such garbage. Draymond was completely exposed too. Averaging a triple single while making like 20 million. A good player’s stats would have gone up from higher usage and shot attempts while curry and klay were out. But not green, no team even respected him on offense. They leave him wide open on the 3 point line and dare him to shoot. And you know what he does? He passes it every time because even he knows how bad his shooting is. Passing the ball to a player that can actually do something with it is literally his only option he has when he gets the ball."
"&gt; Curry took Draymond Green who is overrated as hell and Klay and won multiple rings.  Curry won one ring with Draymond and Klay as his best teammates. Someone named Kevin Durant was on the team for the other titles, I think he's a pretty good player in his own right. Why are you pretending that Klay and Draymond were somehow a sub-par supporting cast in the first place?"

"Yes, in that he’s an extension of your coach. Jokic is your team’s valve. The offense goes through him, often in the high block or back to the basket out past the elbow…a series of dribble hand off options and back cuts, and it’s up to Nikola to decide what to do. It’s all up to him to position the sets and decide. He dictates the entire pace of your team.    Draymond does a lot of that for us. Curry is often off-ball, and when he’s not he gets doubled almost immediately and has to release the ball to Green. That’s when it’s up to Draymond to either go downhill 4 v 3, wait for off-ball action to get Steph open, or dribble into the mix with Curry and help create space for him to launch. Also, Green creates in the post, slip screen back door cuts or split action to get open threes."
"&gt;	Curry took Draymond Green who is overrated as hell and Klay and won multiple rings  He “took” them to rings? Draymond and Klay were huge parts of the team that allowed the Warriors to even be contenders. Draymond is not overrated, Klay is an all star, and you’re completely leaving out *Kevin Durant*."
"I gotta disagree on this one. Curry took Draymond Green who is overrated as hell and Klay and won multiple rings. Harden hasn’t done anything close. Curry changed the way the league played.   Harden is still a beast, but Curry is definitely in a different level"
Jesus.   That's already one Draymond Green.

"All counted equally although 10 steals and 10 blocks would be the most impressive just because youll rarely if ever see those stats by themselves. 10 assists is probably the most valuable category because it means your responsible for at least 20 or more of your team's points. You could also make an argument for 10 steals being more valuable because of the defense leading to offense tradeoff. Scoring at least 10 points is the easiest, least important, and least impressive of the categories. For a top player, youre expected to score more than that every game, even for valuable players that arent typical scorers (ie Rudy Gobert)  5×5's are also a popular counting metric in the nba with the 5 boxscore metrics that could make up a triple double. Theyre even more rare bc the steals and blocks are just that hard to accumulate especially together. Funny enough Draymond Green missed a 5x5 game either last season or the season prior on points (he only scored 4pts)"
"What do you mean?  I never denied that they defend well without Draymond, i explained my reasoning for this already so im just gonna copy and paste “Sure, but that could be a result of GSW playing all of the best defensive players together while relying on green to try and stabilize offensively oriented units. If he wasn’t able to do this then it’s possible the warriors would actually struggle on that end.”  Maybe if you could point to whats confusing you then i could clarify?   I posted the kawhi video to illustrate a scenario where the spurs actually defended better statistically without their best defender , mind you that this is DPOY Kawhi. The idea is that using these metrics can be extremely deceptive and are susceptible to misrepresenting the situation."
You just don't know much at all. Draymond Green has anchored some incredible playoff defences over a large sample size and was the main reason why Golden State was so good on that end of the ball for all these years.   You're an idiot. You think Myles Turner is a DPOY contender because you looked at his BPG. LMFAO. That's all the evidence we need to demonstrate how dense you are.
"I don't think you have the rules right. If you receive votes split between two positions, 100% of your votes go towards the position you got more votes for.

"He’s a 19 year old who gets yelled at by Draymond green every day in practice, think he’s plenty tough. Gobert cried after not making an all star game"

He was also getting a crash course from draymond green. There’s few players I’d rather have my young big coached up by than draymond. My gut feeling says he’s around to start next year. I don’t think you make a drastic move as gsw until you see what Klay looks like.
The Draymond Green x2
"Somehow, only 3 players have had a 7/7/7 quarter in the last 25 years.  Kevin Johnson in 1997, Jason Kidd in 2010, and Draymond Green in 2021."
"Zion needs to listen to the advice that Draymond Green got from Kobe when the league was not in favor of his play.   Keep doing what you do and be you Zion.   The league will have to adjust to you.

"Kobe was my favorite player, but i truly play like Draymond Green. My body is not agile, but i tend to defend every position, facilitate when necessary, and take shots that come to me more than be a one on one player. I’m only 5”9’ in pickup world thats Draymond’s height 🤣."

"We're making green Latino puns right? I thought since people hated Draymond and the police, I made a triple spin. It went from Back the Blue to Back the Berde"
"Skill boost: Draymond Green. A 40% 3pt shooting from Green (with another jumpshot please) would do wonders for the team.  Athleticism boost: Kevon Looney. He's already a good defender. Give him verticality and speed, and you have a very good center again.  Size boost: Nico Mannion. A 6'6'' Mannion would be instantly more valuable. Giving it to Paschall would be cool as well."
Draymond Green got a nut kick on Steven Adams and that was called a flagrant 1 (later upgraded to flagrant 2 and fine).
Draymond green is the “just like hitler” of the nba world lmao

Draymond Green. But you’d have to put a stack of pancakes or something at the finish line.

No he's a zero score offensive player. He can still grab offensive boards and set screens. He's like a hypercharged Draymond Green.

For more examples, following examples all win % first then triple double win %: Westbrook: 61, 75% Jokic: 56, 80% Curry: 66, 100% Draymond green: 68, 97% Chris Paul: 64, 81% John wall: 46, 75% James harden: 65, 83% Giannis: 64, 84%  So a (totally unrandom top of mind) sample he improves his team win % the least when he gets a triple double.

Draymond Green?
"Unsung hero of the night: Draymond Green.   If Green doesn't get all defensive team while carrying the team defensively, it's gonna be straight out robbery."
"Blake has been the nets Draymond green, his defense has been underrated"
"&gt; I don’t understand what they were arguing against  the argument is more subtle than this thread would lead you to believe. None of them are arguing you don't need stars or don't need ""others"".  The argument is about *which* is more important for winning.    Barkely is saying that most role players on top teams are equivalent. So the real difference between winning and losing is how the stars play.    Shaq and Kenny on the other hand are saying, the top of the teams tend to even each other out. But often the separator is how well the role players play.    And given the 3 playoff experience I can understand why each one would make that argument.    1) Barkely ran into Jordan in the finals. He felt like he could overcome pretty much anything and anyone. But Jordan was a different beast.  His biggest difference was between him and Jordan.    2) Shaq &amp; Kenny though saw that the difference was a lot smaller though.  They played against each other, and although Shaq was more important than Kenny (and both would agree), Kenny hitting 7 3s in a game made a *huge* difference.  But Shaq also played with Derek Fischer &amp; Robert Horry (so did Kenny) and in many of those series games came down to Horry (""Big Shot Bob"") hittin shot for or against him.  He saw personally how *much* a ""role player"" can have in a series.    I think to some degree both could be right depending on the year and series.    When Lebron faced Toronto, his talent was so much better than the Raptors best, that 'role players' and how well they played didn't make much difference.  But when he faced Golden State, how his teammates played made *a lot* of difference... sorta.    2015 - he outplayed Dubs best, but with both Love &amp; Kyrie out, his role players weren't enough   2016 -- with Love &amp; Kyrie helped balance out not only the top of the Warriors, but the very underrated bench (Iggy, Livingston among others).  That bench was a very important reason why they won 73 games.  So it was battle of top end vs depth. And it went 7 games.   2017 &amp; 2018 - Warriors gave up their famous depth for top end.  KD changed the balance. KD, Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond too much top end for Lebron, Kyrie/Love to handle.  And when he lost Kyrie, they got swept.   2019 -- Without KD, the Warriors lack of depth was exposed by the Nick Nurse Box-and-1 coverage.  People think they lost Klay, but he was there for a significant part of the series and the Raptors outplayed them even with both Steph &amp; Klay.    But the Raptors had 1 superstar, 2 all-star caliber players (Lowry, and future all-star Siakam). And several very quality starters/players in Ibaka, Gasol, Green, Powell.  Kawhi balanced Steph, but Lowry/Siakam/FVV more than outplayed Draymond/Klay/__insert_other_player."
"Eh i think you can add way better role players, PJ was good in the that small center role and Draymond needs the ball on offense   If you add in a legitimate 3&amp;D instead of Ariza who decided to shit the bed it would be way better  Say someone like prime Danny Green 2013 finals"
"Bam Adebayo&gt; Ben simmons. The maximum Ben Simmons would be is a athletic draymond green (Not a slight), but that's his ceiling at the moment."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
"That's about what I expect, his overall playoffs per game is 15 10 , 2 and all of his finals were against the Warriors meaning one of the greatest defensive forwards of all time in Draymond Green had a hand in defending him so I would expect him to shoot less efficiently"
"400 minutes isn't that tiny of a sample - it's about 12 games. It's not a huge one, but imagine how this sub would blow up if it was this:  ""Draymond Green has missed the last 12 games. In those games, Curry is shooting 40% from the field and 30% from the 3. The Warriors have a net rating of -5.2 with him on the court, good for 26th in the league.""  It's also essentially been the exact same the entire season, so it doesn't appear to be a small sample size thing. Curry is a big off ball guy. Take away the guy that passes to him, and he struggles because he has to be a pure on ball scorer, and that's not his game.   I'm not even saying it isn't understandable that he'd struggle without Draymond. The point is simply that people forget that you can't play off ball if you have no other playmakers. It doesn't work. Even the best off ball player of all time can't do it."
Simmons aims to be the next Draymond Green.

"Sometimes nothing, dudes mom called him out to stop complaining lol.  If we considering *Draymond Green* soft, then your definition of the term is the thing that's off."
Laughs in draymond green
"I feel like what Barkley said ""The Bucks are going to win the championship, but they play the dumbest basketball"" could apply equally to the Sixers.   At least Giannis can run and dunk... I don't know what the hell Ben Simmons is doing out there. He's putting up 2020-2021 regular season Draymond Green numbers in the playoffs with less than half his free throw percentage."
"If you want to break it down as simple as guys that can shoot, tall guy that score, and big man that plays defense I guess you're squinting your eyeballs out.  Even the warriors system was so simple to recreate every team would try but it isn't.   Seth is a lot closer to a shorter klay thompson without defense than he is to his brother.   Embiid's and Bogut's roles, styles of play, and ability aren't really comparable. Bogut was a solid passing big that played great defense. Embiid is a great defensive big, improving passer, but one of the best scorers in the league.  This also already ignores the fact that the swap doesn't do anything positive for the sixers but replace their non shooting PG for a mediocre shooting pf. He's not going to provide more offense than Ben because that's not his game and never has been. Teams aren't going to stop double teaming Embiid just because Draymond '27% from 3' Green is open the same way they treat him on the warriors now. He isn't a scorer either.  He doesn't improve their defense because it just takes away their best perimeter who also just might be the best perimeter and most versatile defender in the league.   And the playmaking is a wash. Ben is already one of the best playmakers in the league especially in regards to getting his teammates 3pt shots. He was even assisting on more threes than Draymond was on the KD warriors.  All that ignoring age gap and contracts. But go on, please parrot this sentiment that Dray somehow is a better fit and helps this team win this series and the next one."
Tall Draymond Green
Royce O’Neale is .05 Draymond Green
"Anyone surprised about this type of game is kidding themselves. Simmons absolute refusal to even attempt a jump shot is indicative of his ceiling, a draymond green type player. Perhaps the best role player in the League but cannot be counted on for reliable offense. If Philly loses this series head will roll, and Simmons has to be moved for someone who can actually make a shot off the dribble."
"An athletic Draymond Green just not as strong mentally as Draymond Green in the playoffs. Draymond Green was  in perfect situation with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with their shooting to provide space for Draymond to set screens over and over (at their peak some said moving screens), rebound, pass the ball, and maybe score to yell ""AND 1"". The scoring is provided by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and later Kevin Durant on offense. In playoffs most of teams are good at finding other team weaknesses and exploiting them until the team can make adjustments. Draymond Green isn't a good scorer, and Warriors were able hide that weakness most of the time where it wouldn't be detrimental."
You gotta stop thinking of Simmons as a franchise player. He is draymond green
"Docs Rivers said Ben Simmons is good at defense, and he found out in game 5 that defense brick 10 FTs out of 14 attempts. He is a good player, and can make an impact to a championship team. This current team does not maximize what Ben Simmons does well and hide his glaring weaknesses. What so great if he can defend, rebound, and pass but if other team can attack his weaknesses leave him to be the scorer and foul him to put him on FT line when he is on the floor. You can put him at the dunker spot and screen, but Joel Embiid operates there to be his best which mess with the spacing with Simmons. Seth Curry is only good shooting threat, and maybe hot Danny Green to provide space. If Simmons is not going to score by seeking it when opportunities present itself, shoot jumpers, and shoot poor FTs he is just a big man who needs to operate in paint who can handle the ball. To me if he is not going to be aggressive in seeking to score he needs to be in situations similar to Draymond Green in 2014-2016 team where he surrounded by 2 great shooters to provide space and player movements carrying offense load from perimeter."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n0jf0a/simmons_isnt_focused_on_becoming_a_scorer_i_was/gw7mqqk/  Bunch of fucking morons in that thread claiming Simmons is way better than Draymond LMAOOO  &gt;	The reality is Green wouldn't even put up 7 assists on a bad team - cue last season with 6.2 - because he has no shot creation. Simmons can at least collapse the defense in half court and kick out to open shooters, Draymond can very rarely do that. He's got the better touch in transition where a big percentage of Draymond turnovers happen. While they both have great anticipation and court vision, Simmons no doubt has the edge as a 6'10 player, some of his dimes are ingenious.  Imagine upvoting this trash"
Contract-wise Ben's contract makes Draymond Green looks like a steal. All the defense but also doesn't run away from the ball in crunch time.
Lol y’all think Simmons is Draymond Green  He has almost zero impact on offense
so pretty much an athletic Draymond green but with worst free throw shooting and more aggresion attacking the paint.
"In a Draymond Green role, he definitely could be. But that type of style doesn't suit Embiid."
He plays like a draymond green. But draymond may not even be that flawed on offense
Same people ripping Ben Simmons think Draymond Green is a hall of famer.   Just goes to show you how expectations shape your total perception!
Ben Simmons is Draymond Green lite
So why does Simmons get a pass on criticism? Lol they are sagging so far off during the 76ers offensive sets its costing them.  He is running into the Draymond Green problem idc how great you are at defense YOU CANNOT be a complete liability on the offensive end your are not going to be a net positive for your team if it essentially becomes 4v5 on one end.   Imagine if both GSW and PHI could count on them to keep the defense honest and make shots and lol they aren't even asking for alot because of the orbit of both teams stars.
"The problem is in todays game you need your 1-4 to be reliable shooters. We see with the Warriors that they've won titles with a ""small ball 5"" in Green, which is I why I used quotes for ""small"" 5. Because at 6'10"" Simmons is a legitimately solid size for a 5 and probably a better defender (imo) than Draymond. But I don't see how you win championships in 2021 going forward with a 1, 2 3 that could legitimately not outshoot several people in LA Fitness. Theres teams that have strong guard play that could use Simmons defense and you can still use him as a PG to bring the ball up, let your guards run off screens, pass, Simmons goes down for rebounds. But treating him like a startable PG just is weird for me.  I've slept 5 hours since Sunday so all these words are to keep me awake"
Wilson Chandler (though he no longer plays for the NBA). Draymond Green wasn’t as outspoken as Chandler and Kyrie but seemed very open to the idea that the earth is not round
GSW was injured+suspended  neva forget draymond green cost the warriors a ring by punching lebron in the balls
"Lebron has 5 all defense first team selections and 1 all defense second team selection. RW is a hustle player on both sides of the ball. Other than harden, this was a garbage take.  Also players like Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, and Draymond Green all got max contracts for being elite defensive players while being average on the offensive end."
"I know that Curry and Kerr have publicly said good things about Mark Jackson. I'd argue that they're doing so out of politics.  If you compare the roster of Jackson's first Warrior team to the roster of his last Warrior team, it'd be insane if the defense WASN'T vastly better:   You're replacing injured Steph with healthy Steph. Rookie Klay with third-year Klay. Monta Ellis and Dorell Wright with Iguodala and Andrew Bogut. You're adding Draymond Green to the bench.   So, yeah, it'd be something if the defense didn't improve drastically.   Also, the defense scheme was designed and overseen by Michael Malone and Darren Errman."
"Inside the NBA is fine the way it is and if there's somebody who should be replaced it should be Shaq.  You may not personally like Kenny's commentary but you have to admit he provides more analysis than the rest of the crew.   As for adding a personality, I thought Draymond Green has been excellent when he's been a guest."
Nah Draymond Green said it fucked him up for a while too.
"2017 Warriors are the GOAT NBA team. Kevin Durant is over there, maybe the best 1v1 scorer in NBA history. You stopped him? Okay. There's Steph Curry running around, the best shooter in NBA history, the most dangerous off-ball player in NBA history, and an elite 1v1 creator off the dribble. The two best pure scorers of the 2010s. Pick your poison. You somehow locked them both down? Okay, cool. There's Klay Thompson, the best catch-and-shooter in NBA history, sitting on the elbow, waiting for the pass. And on the other end he's locking you down with Iguodala and Draymond Green, a DPOY/serial 1st-team All-Defense.   Just an absurd, all-time great, totally unfair team."
How sway??? KD just dropped 49 and came back down 17 with Jeff Green and a bunch of trash. Ain’t Nobody that can check KD but any forward that has any pride in their defense steps up. Ain’t no way Draymond watches Wiggins get torched all night the way Giannis left PJ and Middleton
Prince was an elite defender. So is draymond. Prince scored 13ppg the year before the redeem team. I would hardly call that a scorer.   How many players in the nba are better than green as a roll man? Not many. Have people forgotten that he was the roll man in the death lineup? He’s one of the best passing big men in the game. Offense isn’t just all scoring.
You're entirely ignoring DPOY and amazing playmaker Draymond Green lmfao
PJ think he draymond green or something?
"that moment's up there with the ""you do not eat enough donuts to push this button"" draymond green bit"
Jeff playing like prime draymond + danny green rn.
He's a suped-up but introverted Draymond Green
I would compare Ben Simmons to Draymond Green rather than Lebron since Dray and Simmons are both elite defensive point forwards. Lebron coasts too much on defense and has a consistent jumper unlike the other two.
"&gt;	Did he have Joel Embiid next to him to score for him? Or Tobias Harris averaging over 20?  You’re not getting the point which is that Embiid had an off night (and he’s injured) while ben had 10 **shot attempts**, made half of em and fucked up crucial free throws.   He’s a poor man’s Draymond green but a lot worse"
Draymond Green recruitment tour
Ah yes which is why Draymond green is better then dirk
"With basketball, a player can have an off night shooting wise, yet still affect the game in many ways. Draymond Green prime example. Trae's ability to create for his teammates on a bad shooting night is frankly astounding. If you're not making shots, get it to somebody who is. Also, lack of turnovers and assists are a HUGE difference maker from someone who has the ball so much. In all, shooting isn't everything. Keep checking it out. It's a great game with many subtleties and strategies."
"A lot of those people you listed are still playing so I'll go with realistic people like: Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Vince Carter, and some non-player anchor.  If I could have my ideal 4, it would be: Candace Parker, Draymond Green, Richard Jefferson, and Vince Carter."
"He aint lookin like he gonna be a lebron at this point, he more like an upgraded version of draymond green"
Can’t wait to watch Green poke out some international players eyes in the gold medal game. Just kidding. Fuck draymond
"This is based entirely on your expectations. No, he's not going to be the leading superstar on a championship winning team. Doesn't mean he can't be highly impactful.  I mean, he could be an even better version of Draymond Green--a defensive savant and playmaker who is the second most impactful player on a great time. Unlike Draymond, he actually has good handles and can finish around the rim.. A ceiling raiser, not necessarily a floor raiser.  He's not a scorer and he knows it. Knowing your limitations is important. Get the right team around him and Simmons can absolutely help them win a title"
He’s a slightly better draymond green
Draymond Green?
I’d say he’s a bigger Draymond Green but at least Dray can hit the occasional 3
"Ben Simmons is a worse version of Draymond Green and does not deserve a max extension. I don't get the hype AT ALLLLLLLLL.   The man is dogshit at 2s and 3s. He's clearly a defense and rebound guy but also is a massive offensive liability.   You can't be handing out max contracts in an offense-forward league and expect great results. In another way, do you want your $200m+ player sitting on the bench on your team's last possession. What a waste of cap space $$$$"
"He didn't REALLY build the Warriors, but he's credited for identifying Draymond Green which is HUGE"
"Ben Simmons is at best the 3rd / 4th option. Aka Draymond Green / Lamar Odom. As a 1st option, he’s definitely a tank commander."
"Simmons is not a defensive anchor  Defensive anchors are Gobert, Draymond Green, Giannis, Poku and AD etc.  Perimeter defense is not anchoring the defense"
It was crazy.  It’s like hating on a team headed towards the lottery for not taking a younger Draymond Green on a $40M max contract
Remember when we all hated on the Rockets for taking picks over Simmons.  Like Simmons was gonna carry them to the playoffs lol.  People think he’s Giannis but he’s closer to Draymond Green and that’s not bad at all.
Lol 2011 Lebron would be an improvement for him he’s basically a slightly better draymond green
"My question wasn't answered. And yeah context matters. Jokic isn't Draymond Green.. look at the context and history of the guy, he's not a dirty player"
Yes... when comparing him to Draymond green... who is a DPOY and just got a first team all defense while also being the primary passer for the Warriors.... wild   I’m using Draymond green to show how overrated Rodman for the Bulls was. Was he crucial? Sure. Was he extremely replaceable with other post defenders of that era and barely a top 50 player in the league at that time? Yep
"Aged like milk my dear casual nephew   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard"
"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
"Dylan  Dylan  Dylan  Dylan  And Dylan.    Also,   Matisse Thybulle  Ben Simmons  Draymond Green  OG Anuonoby  I can’t decide between Rudy Gobert or Joel for my 5th, so I’ll go Joel Gobert."
What a blunder by Draymond Green!!
"why not add in Klay Thompson and Draymond Green while youre at it? But why stop there!? Let's fill out our bench with Jrue, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, AD, and Valencunias?"
"I agree that the remaining games will be far more informative than was the part of Game 4 sans Kyrie.    That said, KD has Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Shamet, and probably one or two others that I'm forgetting (in addition to Mike James).  That's an infinitely better supporting offensive cast than what Curry had this season.    Wiggins TS% the year before he was traded was *sub-50*.  And he was their 2nd leading scorer this year.  You also had Stone Hands Wiseman &amp; Draymond making Ben Wallace seem like Hakeem.    We also have one good data point from Game 3 of the 2019 Finals, when Curry didn't have Klay or KD and he hung 47 on an all-time defense.    KD doesn't have to win another game, but he does need to show that he can be an unstoppable offensive force even without another superstar."
"Yeah I'm aware, but that's generally how they call them still. Excessive contact usually means intentionally fouling and/or not going for the ball.   He accidentally grazed his face with his upper arm. His hand got all ball. That's not a flagrant 2.   Can you explain to me how this was a common foul on draymond but jokic gets called for a flagrant 2? The inconsistency is absurd.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-vs-warriors-lebron-james-follows-up-hard-draymond-green-collision-with-game-winner-to-seal-no-7-seed/"
"There aren't many point guards left who are true floor generals, guys playing three dimensional chess with that next level understanding and have the ability to be that guy on the court consistently. Who are thinking beyond what they're supposed to do, knowing what everyone else should do, communicating well, motivating, knowing when feed the right guy, knowing when to take over, etc.  The only guards that fit that next level of floor general right now and have the ability to take full advantage of it are Chris Paul and Steph Curry (they have completely different styles of play, but they are always completely in control of the game). Damian Lillard is close, but doesn't move without the ball or pass as well as those two guys. There are a few guys like Marcus Smart or Andre Iguadola or even Draymond Green that understand the game well enough, but don't quite have the skill level to be that guy consistently every night. Those guys are invaluable teammates though. Luka, LeBron, and Jokic aren't technically guards, but some people might put them in the conversation as basketball becomes positionless so I could see an argument for each of them. Chris Paul really is a throwback though.   Paige Buekers, Sabrina Ionescu and Diana Taurasi fit that mold on the ladies side. You have to be really smart, but you also have to see the game of basketball in a way where you kinda always feel like you are in the zone and then have all the skills necessary to get the best shot for you or your teammates in any situation. It's knowing when your teammates get hot, what shots they prefer, where they like to catch the basketball for a catch and shoot 3 versus a curl to the basket. It's next level things that even in the NBA only a handful of guys are capable of seeing and then having the skill to execute. There are a bunch of NBA role players who have very limited athleticism, can't shoot outside ten feet, yet they got to the league and can dominate within that role just by having that level of understanding, they make incredible teammates. You need those players to win championships. Chris Paul is on another level though."
Draymond Green for encouraging his own teammate
"You have to take it by a case to case basis.  Scottie Pippen was bigger and heavier that Dennis Rodman,but one was a SF and one was a PF. Ben Simmons is the size of a Center but is a PG. Kevin Durant is half a foot taller than Draymond Green,but one plays like a shooting guard and one plays like a center."
Equating Kuz and Draymond Green makes me pretty angry
"There is no comparison here. Draymond jumped vertical and (stupidly) had his hands up and out at a angle, LeBron then jumped into him while in the air. Green didn't initiate contact, wind up, or swipe down but just made a really dumb move. Jokic fully wound up and swiped down across the face.. that's way more excessive"
Ok so Steph Curry/Book/AG all faced the same racisim growing up as say Lebron/Draymond Green/ Khris Middleton?  THE FIRST 3 AINT TRUE BROTHA'S.  Steph's curry's dad is light skin to begin with and his mom is basically white.  Just looking at Steph I can tell you he aint black.
"I've been 100% clear. And you're the one who asked me to give examples lol..? Anyway, Jokic isn't Draymond Green lmao. The refs should have used the context of the situation and the player to know that he wasn't intentionally trying to break Cam's nose."
Obviously Ben.  His defence was just frankly that valuable. Say what you want about it but there is a reason in the warriors run every impact metric painted Draymond Green as a top 5 player in the postseason.  I think it is hard to make an arguement that Wallace wasn't one of the 5-7 most valuable players of that era.
*Draymond Green*  Warriors fans: *REEEEE*
This isn't fucking Draymond Green. Jokic doesn't have a dirty history at all..are the refs slow
"Says the Warriors flair with Draymond ""eye poke, nut kick"" Green  GTFO"
Players can’t have frustration foul now? Draymond green does this shit every game
"^ this dude just said draymond green was a top 5, arguable top 3 player in the NBA in 2015"
"I'm sorry you think KD carried Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green?  Holy shit."
You think klay and Draymond green are both “top 15/20 players”?
John Stockton/Prime MJ/Scottie Pippen/Draymond Green/Ben Wallace
Steph Klay KD Draymond Looney vs....  George Hill JR Jeff Green Bron and KLove  Game 1 was a summary of the series and that season for Bron. He puts on one of the greatest individual performances ever to only be screwed over by his garbage team.
Did every Nets player learn how to set screens from Draymond Green?
Draymond “Electric Spam” Green
Unless Joe Harris &amp; Bruce Brown can morph into Steph Curry &amp; Draymond Green. Then no it isn't too early.  They have no secondary scorer or playmakers on the floor.   The Bucks already smell blood &amp; will end this in 6.
"Do you reckon there are insurance policies written on the contract of a player which payout during the even of a major injury? Perhaps the premium on such policies for players like Cousins, Embiid, and Davis are higher than say those on players like Draymond Green, Damian Lillard, and Luka Doncic. And on another hand, some players' contracts are so valuable that the premiums are probably high just because of the contract value such as Giannis or Lebron, you know?"
"That is simply not true that Giannis is a liability in the halfcourt. I mean, he is not Draymond Green or Ben Simmons for crying out loud . He had 34 points in game 1, and 33 points in game 3. He had a terrible game 2 but he has certainly not been getting completely locked up this series by Blake at all. The Nets are walling up on him, because the Bucks as a team are shooting an abysmal 22 percent from 3. 22 percent. It is just not Giannis. This kills Giannis' spacing, and doesn't allow him to do what he is best at. Look at LeBron vs the Suns. He struggled against them, because the Lakers shot horribly, and he was not able to go off on them.      And I would not say he had horrible court vision. He is one of the best playmaking power forwards in the league. You say he has nothing to offer in the halfcourt, but he has by far the highest amount of gravity on the Bucks. He creates so many open looks for his teammates, because defenses are entirely honed in on stopping him at the rim. It is not his fault the entire team is struggling to hit their shots.   While I agree that Giannis needs an outside game to maximize his abilities in the playoffs, pinning all of the blame on him is unreasonable, when the team as a whole is shooting 22 percent from 3."
Draymond Green or Randle or Westbrook when they are chucking jump shots
Let it be known Draymond green hit 6 of 8 threes game 7 in the 2016 finals
Draymond Green
"Nah, Draymond Green should've been suspended against OKC and they would've gone to the finals. And calling the Warriors the ""GOAT"" team when they added Kevin Durant the next season is laughable"
Chris Paul lobbying for anybody to get a tech is peak irony coming from one of the [dirtiest players](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/draymond-green-nba-dirtiest-players-history-bruce-bowen-bill-laimbeer-kevin-garnett-chris-paul-charles-oakley-120216) in the NBA
"&gt;This Memphis team is significantly better than last year. Morant made a pretty huge jump. We both know it lol. Also that wasn't the point  Just like Curry's Warrior team was significantly better than that Blazers team. Both had about the same records as their comparative Memphis team. Dame just got it done. You keep ignoring the facilitating difference. Dame just creates more shots for his teammates. He draws more doubles by virtue of being on ball more, and he's much faster, which sets him up for more drive and kick opportunities. Dame had **50% more potential assists** than Steph this season.  &gt; on bro he is part of the reason Blazers is 29th on defense  Lmao just stop dude. Stop with the bad faith arguments. Neither you nor I believe that the Warriors being 5th vs 29th defensively is because of the difference between Steph and Dame defensively - hell there's stats out there saying they're almost equivalent. The difference is that Curry guards the weaker opposing guard with draymond Green behind him. Meanwhile Dame is on the opposing teams PG with **literally the worst defensive center of this generation** (Kanter) as his center. As soon as Nurkic came back, we had a good defense.   Dame isn't even a bottom 4-5 defender on his team lmao.  &gt;I don't exactly recall your record, but I believe you were out of playoff spot at some point after a 5 straight losses or sth idk? But imma trust your input. So I will give you that.  We fell in the standings for a while near the end of the season when Dame got hurt; we went 4-11 during that stretch. We were well over .500 without either Nurkic or CJ.   That stretch was when Dame was hitting all those game winners and we were winning every game by 2-3  &gt;do you think WB is a better facilitator than Curry and Dame? I absolutely don't think so.  Yes. Russ is a fucking awful scorer, but you can't deny that he's amazing at getting to the rim (even if he doesn't finish) and drawing secondary defenders. It's always been his best skill.   &gt;Even tho he played with injury, that doesn't change the fact that he was statistically worse.   It does if you're trying to actually see who is better, right? It doesn't matter as far as MVP goes, but idc about awards. I'm talking who is better. And Dame outside of that injured stretch played better than Curry did and lead his team to the 2nd best offense for the 2nd year in a row.   You don't just have a ""bad game"" for 15 games in a row immediately after getting injured lmao. It's not a stretch to say he was hurt. He even sat out 3 games to get right.  &gt;Can you even imagine Steph having that kind of a stinker and GSW winning that game?   I can actually. Steph shot 2-16 against Toronto and had just 6 assists with 5 TOs. And y'all won.  We gonna act like he didn't lose **despite having argubaly the best playoff game in NBA History?** One game is meaingless, especially since Dame wasn't even bad that game. He almost had a triple double in 3 quarters. He was slicing up there defense and getting guys wide open all game. That game is why they eased up on doubling...because he just got guys easy looks."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, James Michael Mcadoo, Kevon Looney, Anderson Varejao  and Jason Thompson who got waived midseason."
"Because he is n athlete and not very skilled.. there are many players like that and media tends to hype them up.. ben simmons will never become a superstar. Media once called draymond green a superstar..the reality is nba is a skill based league..those guys will never be superstars and with time the reality will set in.. look at once perennial allstars dwight howard, drummond... they wont"
Draymond green is the answer to this question
Can we stop listening to Draymond Green?
Draymond “Multiplier” Green
"LoL replace Draymond green with Danny Green to play with Klay and Curry during 2014, they are still champs. You can replace Draymond with Gerald Green or Jeff Green or any of the green brothers and the warriors still win with the splash brothers."
"&gt; You can’t compare a completely developed player in their prime to a player who is still young as fuck.  Wait, you compared them 5 comments up.  And 24 year old Draymond (2014-2015) did better than 24 year old Simmons on those same metrics      Player | Def Win Shares | Def Box +/- | Def Rating / 100 poss (points allowed per 100 possessions, lower is better) ---|---|----|---- 24 y/o Green (2014-2015) | 5.2 | 2.8 | 97 30 y/o Green (2020-2021) | 3.4 | 3.3 | 106 24 y/o Simmons (2020-2021) | 3.3 | 1.9 | 106  Not trying to shit on Simmons. Dude is awesome, Draymond is just a net negative on offense and Ben is not, but Ben doesn't match Draymond defensively."
"Not so sure regarding Draymond at 24. Simmons greatly benefits from already having Embiid on his team, another DPOTY level player. Without him, Simmons didn’t have much success. Simmons without Embiid led an almost exactly average defense (in 713 min), while Green without Bogut was anchoring a  -5.5 defense (in 1218 min). Even Draymond without both Bogut AND Iguodala was anchoring about a -3 defense (485 min). I say all this to supplement my eye test which would also conclude Green as a better defender at that age, his rim protection at that stage in his career and everlasting communication made him so valuable."
Draymond Green has won a playoff series which Vucevic can only dream of
If it’s not hard everyone would be like Draymond green or Giannis or gobert. But not everybody can be alert at all times throughout the game it’s human nature to sack of every once in a while. That’s how you sometimes get people not running hard at close outs or not boxing out every rebound
"Draymond Green. Also CP3 before OKC. Still love him, but now everybody loves him even though he's still the same guy."
"Tell me you really watch warriors games ? Green can lead the fast break or  set up the offense by having the ball in his hands while curry n klay runs off screens . Green basically is a point forward , you heard of small ball, he was the reason for the change in the nba landscape where traditional centers went to extinction. Simmons with his size and athleticism can be a soup up version of draymond green ."
That’s why people still go bigs in the early picks in the draft. Unless you have a guy like draymond green who can effectively play big while being small you still need bigs inside who can dominate. Everyone trying to find the next Davis and Giannis rightfully so.
Draymond Green
"Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant"
Draymond Green
He will also never shoot like that ever again. He’s a worse career 3 point shooter than Draymond Green. He shot over 60% from 10-16 feet as a career 42% shooter from there also.
Kevin Love would have helped the Warriors close the series quicker lol. People really need to stop saying the dumb without Kyrie and Love. Draymond Green eats Kevin Love alive in almost every match-up between those teams. Tristan Thompson was actually more of a threat to the Warriors. As he is a better defender than Love and was killing the Warriors on the glass.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green can shut him down on a double team
"Stephen curry and draymond green. Superstar scorer, defender, playmaker, shooter, teammate elevator, nut kicker"
That's no excuse per Draymond Green.
Bigger ball handling wing?   Jump shot is a work in progress?   Draymond Green/Pascal Siakam comps for you!
"It always amazes me how people lose sight of the fact that scoring points is literally the purpose of the game. Draymond green is great, but Klay is also a great defender while also being Steph lite on offense."
"Defensive specialists like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green, and Rudy Gobert aren’t exactly getting wiped off the floor. DeAndre Ayton, Julius Randle, and Giannis are all big men who don’t shoot much from outside. They are all doing pretty ok."
"Never have I ever thought to myself - ""Kyrie Irving is just as good, if not better than Steph Curry"". Much less, ""JR Smith is just as good, if not better than Draymond Green""..."
"Right?  KD-Curry-Klay-Dray-Zaza?   Lebron-Kyrie-Klove-JR-TristanThompson  I'm sorry.... Perfectly balanced?  Let's pretend for a second that Lebron is *so good* that he+Kyrie together are better than KD and Curry (the MVP's of the 3 previous years, mind you...)  Then Klove+JR+Tristan are as good as Klay (possibly best 3&amp;D in the league), DPOY Draymond Green, and Zaza Pachulia?  And forget about the fact that the Warriors bench includes Iggy, Livingston, &amp; Javale McGee...."
"Jerami Grant yelled, “There we go!” Draymond Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jayson Tatum belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Keldon Johnson hit the locker room door, ex-USA Olympic star Carmelo Anthony hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
You support draymond green? One of the dirtiest players in league history
"Draymond Green, Team USA 3 point Sniper."
"They certainly both turn out to be cant miss, superstar prospects, but at the time ( in Embid's case a couple seasons after being drafted ) there was enough questions and doubters to cause teams not to pick them first or second.   To be clear, I'm not categorizing where these players **should've** been viewed as, but rather where they were regarded as.  For example, with the benefit of hindsight, Jimmy Butler&amp; Draymond Green **should've** been viewed as high lottery prospects, but they **WERE** viewed as late first rounders at best at the time they were drafted."
"There are some similarities to be drawn between the two situations, though.   Warriors core mostly drafted. Barcelona's top talent coming from the academy.  Changed the tactical approach at the top level (3 pointers, tiki taka).  Were already dominant and then bought Suarez and Neymar (KD).  Basically a cheat code for years.  Curry and Messi having their personalities understated for how good they are.  Draymond Green and Pique both talking absolute shit. Also Green and Busquets being underrated floor generals.  Dani Alves and Klay playing on the wing and being likeable weirdos who can absolutely take over a game when they feel like it."
He plays like if Draymond Green thought he was Trae Young
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
"Is there chemistry issues at Golden State??? Klay Thompson allegedly ""sick of [Draymond Green]."""
"‘Similar production’ doesn’t matter, we’re just talking about which team had the better players.   Imagine how good the Cavs would’ve been if they had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson instead of Kevin freakin Love lol"
"Wojanrowski: Draymond Green (fractured cock) will miss the entirety of the 2021-22 NBA season. “He should’ve taken en passant,” says teammate Klay Thompson."
"the lowest rated player on 2k that year was rudy gobert, but yeah 2k14 had giannis, middleton and draymond green very low ratings wise"
"Technically that year Cavs had more. Draymond Green was not a star, Kevin Love was a star."
Yes we do. Rings culture is the reason Draymond Green had the audacity to put himself on the same table as Charles Freaking Barkley.   And it's not just in Basketball where this obsession with championships is starting to become increasingly prevalent. Messi won his first international trophy this year. It was the deciding factor in millions of people finally picking Messi as the GOAT. That was perplexing to me because the COPA final was one of the worst games I have ever seen him play. He has been to finals 4 times before and was the best player on the field 3 times and he was slandered nonetheless for losing on extra time and penalties. Somehow the one time he was carried was the deciding factor in pushing him as the GOAT for a lot of people because the end result was different.   Too much focus is put on trophies and it needs to stop
"Kawhi, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday."
 Breaking news:  Draymond Green reportedly cheating and caught stealing money from fellow teammates. Boat Captain reveals all.
"The person that benefitted from the dynasty most was draymond green. He would never have been viewed as anything other than a role player without the dynasty. When u break down the individual games of players on the dynasty, draymond has the least talent.. and his defense doesnt even win them games when steph isnt playing.."
This is dumb af. It was a quick reaction foul to try to save a finals game still in doubt.  Draymond green fouled lebron much worse at end of 2016 finals…. It’s the finals
"Undisputed: ""Klay Thompson on his IG live claimed Draymond Green had been cheating his money. Is this a sign that the Warriors franchise is crumbling and does it mean that the Lakers have a serious chance of signing Steph Curry?"""

Draymond Green
"That would be foul by Giannis is the type of foul if Draymond green does it, he’s got fans so fooled that they’d say it was solid. That’s literally the worst type of play you can make in basketball. That’s how guys get Gordon hayward’d"
*Draymond Green casually puts up one of his middle fingers*
"When he can’t drive when older, teams are just going to let him shoot 3s the same way they let Draymond Green or Ben Simmons shoot 3s. Fewer assists then."
Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Bradley Beal  Damian Lillard
"Wiseman is already looking like a potential bust. Wiggins is a high volume, low efficiency scorer that adds nothing to this team Draymond hasn't been Draymond for years. At this point of his career, he's more like a Myles Turner or Jeff Green level player A Steph-Wiggins-Klay backcourt is still way below average defensively.  One above average 3 and D wing doesn't turn a team who misses the playoffs into a Finals shoo-in"
Where was Draymond Green in this?
"There are lots of Spurs defending the decision but TEAM USA is still lacking a playmaker and We already have Lavine, Booker, Jrue, and Middleton.  Meanwhile, the only half-way elite passer is Draymond Green.   There's also a lack of speed on the defense which Fox would have helped on.  As far as working together, the entire team has barely played together and on the other hand, its not like johnson is going to play right away anyways or whomever would have filled the spot.  Then you add McGee who hasn't played with the team so its like fill a need here and we will just add johnson there.  To make it worse, Luka Doncic for Slovenia and Spain who has Ricky Rubio.  All I have to say, I hope we win Gold."
"I think Draymond Green is hot garbage without one of at least Curry, Klay or Durant by his side. Every time he has had to be the ""guy"" without one of those 3 he's been pretty average if not straight up bad."
"&gt; ""Why Draymond Green was the 2nd most important player on the Warriors episode""  Did he mean the 2nd most important player on the 73 win Warriors or the KD Warriors? If he meant the latter then he's really a bigger dumbass than I thought lmfao"
"I did love how his Steph Curry's peak episode turned into ""Why Draymond Green was the 2nd most important player on the Warriors episode"" lol. I was wondering what in the goddam world he had 30 minutes of content to speak about Steph Curry, a mainly 1-way star (in other episodes he often split offense and defense apart, it was shocking to get through half the video for KG, and then he started talking about defense), then I realized ""oh, this is a Draymond Green episode as well."""
"Serious answer?   Draymond Green and a bigger 2 guard. Draymond helps the Blazers defense, which has never been good in the Dame era. He also gives Dame a second ball handler who he can dump the ball off too when teams blitz and trap him.   I think they'd also need to try and turn CJ into a 2 way SG but that would probably be enough to have a real shot at the finals. No guarantees but nothing ever is in this league."
Players with 3 rings and a gold medal:  Bill Russell  KC Jones  Michael Jordan  Scottie Pippen  Kobe Bryant  Magic Johnson  Many Ginobili  Lebron James  Larry Bird  Draymond Green  Klay Thompson  Dwayne Wade  Steph Curry (if US wins gold)  Javale McGee (if US wins gold)  Javale is joining an elite club lol
"&gt;The story that I think bests sums up who Draymond Green is:  &gt;We’re downtown in The Bahamas, about to go to the club and his teammates are worried about hot gay dudes. One of them asks what he’ll do if a hot gay dude tries to suck is dick.  &gt;“I’ll suck his first.”  &gt;Then he walks in the club."
"the players left (as I read it are)  Jayson Tatum, Dame, Draymond Green, KD, Bam, and Zach LaVine"
"Dray as in draymond green, current member of the team? Lol"
"The best players never go out for FIBA (no one in the USA really follows it) so it's actually rare we overcome the lack of team chemistry and win there.      If you go back and swap out Joe Harris for KD, Derrick White for Dame, a sophomore Donovan Mitchell for Devin Booker and Harrison Barnes for Draymond Green do you still think we lose in FIBA? I don't."
"Do us all a favor and go watch some Shaq tape. The man was man handling players in an era where teams had crap spacing, 2 big men on the court and were fouling him constantly. Imagine what he would do against these centers today. Embiid would be the best option against him but even he wouldn’t be able to stop him. If Duncan and Robinson couldn’t stop him than what makes you think anyone in today’s league will slow him down? You really think Draymond Green would be able to slow him down?"
Draymond Green. He’s the one guy who actually does everything and he coordinates his team unlike anyone else.
"Rudy Gobert or Giannis Antetokounmpo in the regular season, Anthony Davis / Draymond Green / Giannis in the postseason"
That Zion is just a worse draymond green
"Yeah I’m not as much a fan of the swap concept because Dame is the most doubles player in the league already and does all his damage in the spread PnR with Nurkic, Simmons and Nurkic to me shouldn’t share the floor ever because the damage you do to your spacing would be ridiculous- I’d be all for it if we could get Ben who would gladly play that Draymond Green 4/5 role of being the anchor of the defense and running the offense on the short roll and just hammering to the bucket, but tbh I don’t see Ben having the dog Dray does so I don’t know if he would be willing to play that role.  Can we get the mentality of Jimmy Butler infused into Ben Simmons as a player?  I feel like if he just played like Zion or Giannis and had pure smash mouth mentality, I’d accept the Shaq level terrible freethrows, and I’d gladly move all our assets to acquire him."
"I see a lot of people choosing Team B, but I think it's easily Team A. You are surrounding Draymond Green with 4 shooters and surrounding Jokic with 3 shooters. You are also covering Jokic's only weakness with Draymond Green, one of the top 3 defenders in the league. Also, when the worst passer in your starting 5, is Joe Ingles, your team is solid.   Team B is incredible defensively but when the 2nd best 3 point shooter in their starting 5 is Myles Turner, the team is going to struggle offensively. Also despite their defense, they have no one to stop Jokic"
"If only the US had Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Bam Adebayo to make up for that."
Draymond “John Madden” Green.
"Ah yes, the Draymond Green school of ""go ahead and call the foul, you won't""  Exhibit A: him defending AD, which he does pretty well while balancing fouling versus being very physical with him."
If defended by a 3 ft toddler he goes for a face up jumper. Fans can say “hee-haw” akin to how GSW spectators say whenever draymond of green goes for a backpack donkey 3 pt’er.
"Rudy Gobert has been doing this for 5 years now. He'll make at least 7 of those 10 shots and will provide everything else a team needs in rebounding, defense and effective screens. Impact wise, I'm not sure there is any player that can do more. A younger Draymond Green would have a strong case as well."
All time? Bill Russell.  In today's game? Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green.
What kills me is how he only acts tough when his team is winning. But then he acts like a baby when they’re losing. At least Draymond Green will talk trash even if the Warriors are getting blown out.
"In this case, not with Jrue. Jrue is so much better offensively than Draymond Green and I want him to stay aggressive.   Draymond has never really averaged close to 20 ppg his entire career. Jrue Holiday is capable of dropping 20 every night, while guarding the other teams best player. Dude is a beast."
"Do you believe in a Mendoza Line for basketball, meaning a point where his lack of offense is more of a liability than his defensive prowess? Under no circumstances should he be taking more shots than Giannis in a game. I think an interesting comparison is Draymond Green whose offense has fallen off since 2016 but who also usually only takes 10 shots tops.   Its worth mentioning in Jrue's defense that even shooting 4/20 he was +8 on the night."
There will be mj for cameo so   also cp3 and draymond green
This could’ve been equivalent to the 2016 series when Draymond Green should’ve received a suspension against the thunder earlier which would’ve cost them the entire series
This is coming from a guy who supports the Warriors who employ Draymond Green.   Y’all make this sport way too damn personal.
"The NBA refs suck more but it's not necessarily their fault, their reffing policies are basically a league wide directive.  Think about how the greatest NFL player of all time was suspended four games (perhaps unfairly) and his team has lost draft picks multiple times in his career. By contrast, the NBA had Draymond green kick people in the nuts multiple times and not get suspended when his all-time great team was trailing in a playoff series yet get super soft technicals to get suspended while leading in the finals. Calls also seem to change midseries all the time seemingly to extend a series. The league makes ""integrity of the game"" decisions and calls all the fucking time, and people actually support ""superstar calls"" and different reffing standards in ""playoff basketball."" Nobody in the NFL ever says, ""come on that's not an illegal contact penalty in the playoffs!""  So when refs calls technicals on opposing teams when Lebrons teammates whack him in the face or let Booker do whatever the fuck this was, it's not just their incompetence. The league actively encourages them to take care of superstars and it leads to wildly inconsistent reffing decisions that actively benefit certain teams over the other. The crazy thing is, fans are pretty accepting of this and only sometimes complain in the most egregious cases."
Draymond Green
"Giannis at 5 is fucking OP man, pretty much a overpowered draymond green with less passing skills lol"
Where's Draymond Green to tel late refs that they don't love you like Kobe
Draymond green
"&gt; There clearly was an argument, and a pretty strong one considering he got the award.     If you think the 12 media members are infallible and didn’t make a horrific mistake, sure. Neither of those things are true.      &gt; It's simple to understand. The perception was that Steph underperformed, Iguodala overperformed MASSIVELY and that his insertion in the starting lineup heavily slowed down the actual best player in the series (LeBron), which caused the Warriors comeback.      This is just a narrative argument. It doesn’t matter how much anyone under or over performed, the FMVP isn’t about how far above your average level you are.      &gt;Steph did average 26/5/6, but he also did have an all-time horrible Finals performance in Game 2 and his efficiency did drop massively in that series. Nobody with a brain will argue that Iguodala was more valuable than Steph on offense, but his impact on defense alongside Draymond Green in that series was second to none and that's specially important when you consider that it was DEFENSE that won Golden State that championship, not their great offense.      Steph had a stinker in game 2 and an all time great game 5. He was consistently good the rest of them and was the entire offense due to how poorly Klay played. If you think Iggy’s defensive impact was anywhere near what Steph’s offensive impact was, I don’t know what to tell you."

The fact they held LeBron James to 47% TS through six games and the Cavs to a 99.6 ORtg was a much bigger deal than Steph averaging 26 ppg on slightly above average efficiency."
"When they had KD, they were so good they didn’t need Draymond Green to win everything (assuming Curry, KD, and Klay are all healthy). Having Green was just the icing on top.  I mean, what team in the world can stop Curry/KD/Klay? Was pretty sure it was demoralizing when coaches were drawing up game plans against that trio of shooters. “Let’s just defend them tight and pray.”"
"Search “draymond green dirty plays” and “Russell Westbrook dirty plays” and see the difference.   I’m also referring to this specific series, I don’t have recollection of Westbrook kicking anybody in the head, and a quick search for it only has me seeing when he kicked the ball away from Damian lillard  Edit: in fact searching for draymond kicking someone in the head immediately brings up one on James harden, but the topic is on this series so let’s ignore that yeah?"
Difference is that Draymond Green was the best Warrior in game 7 of the 2016 finals so he’s more than proven himself in those big moments
"Yeah if Ben continues to shoot under 40% from the free throw line you can't play him. But it's crazy to me that people think that's his most likely outcome. I think he'll at least get back up to 50% and if he changes his shooting motion/hand then it could go even higher. Draymond green is useless on offense too, but he still is a very valuable player. That kind of impact is his floor in my opinion.  I also disagree that his impact on transition is as neglible as you think. If it was that easy then every pg would have gaudy assist numbers from it. He's a freight train with great vision and he draws multiple defenders because if they don't foul he's scoring 9/10.  And again, you don't have to believe any of this. But I think the idea that we can get a better version of Ben isn't ""delusional"". He's got such a unique skill set a team who can afford to build a team around him could take the chance.  Fox may have a higher likelihood of being an all star next year, but Simmons has a much higher likelihood of being all nba which is what teams need to compete. Fox will never be the best, and probably won't be the second best, player on a championship team. Simmons has a range of outcomes where he is."
"Dame I think. Curry, Dame, Klay shooting trio is gonna be hard to stop. You have an elite playmaker with Draymond as well. If u add Simmons then u have two players who are offensively limited in Green and Simmons.I don’t wanna hear all the defense excuse becuz that’s what all they said about the Nets but if they were healthy then they are winning the chip."
"Bruh woah don’t get wrong I hate Simmons 😂 and want him off this team. I didn’t say they had similar stats I said they had similar assist (both around 7).   I just think people get too reactionary and start undervaluing players to an extreme degree.   Yes fox is a better scorer and better in the clutch (as much clutch as you can have at the 12 seed, would *love* to see him in the playoffs soon). But other than is there much he’s better at then Simmons?   Not everything is about scoring, look at player like draymond green. That’s all I’m saying"
"of course just not oklahoma city and the surrounding area, russell westbrook, draymond green, the warriors ownership group, steve kerr, cleveland ohio, lebron, the boston celtics, the city of boston and state of massachusetts, and anyone in houston texas.  other than that they’re good"
"You’re proving my point with the Warriors example. They had elite perimeter defenders so they often went small with Draymond who was a good rim protector, but like you said not nearly as good as Gobert.  They could settle with less rim protection since having elite perimeter defenders meant their man wasn’t getting by them every possession, and Draymond doesn’t need to help as often as Gobert does.  If you had a roster like the Warriors with competent wing defenders, what would be the point of paying Gobert 40 million? It would be over paying for a luxury you don’t really need. Like you said, they got away with Green and Bogut who are both good, but Gobert is just on another class of rim protecting. You need to contextualize these players with roster construction and salary caps"
"Simmons is a great player. The problem is people compare him to Magic so they put him at point guard.   The more realistic comparison is Draymond Green.   He should be a forward.   He can attack the basket and post up, and he's a solid rebounder and playmaker.   But you are right. The dude needs to learn to shoot. Even if he's got a low percentage, like Westbrook or Draymond, teams still need to know that he will shoot if they leave him open."
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."
"I think they could if they traded Harris+ a few young pieces for a legit max player. Having a big 3 of Simmons+Butler+ Embiid with great supporting players is getting you the finals under usual circumstances   Thats my point though, the problem is that people were trying to tout simmons as the next Lebron when in reality hes a Draymond Green. If you ask Draymond or Ben to be you second option on offense then thats a sure fire way to get the worst offensive versions of those players. If you ask them to be your 3rd or 4th best offensive players then you’re probably going for the title"
"Scoring wise yes, still an impactful play maker, screener and transition player. Basically what Dhat Draymond Green does"
"Against the NBA champions, they were the only team to push them that far  Correct me if im wrong but it’s possible for a team to have 3 max players and solid supporting players. The problem is giving a max to Tobias Harris   You’re never gonna quantify Simmons impact by counting his PPG, you wouldn’t be able to with Draymond Green or even Bam Adebayo. Without Simmons defense on Kawhi, his ability to push the ball in transition and play make for others i promise you its would have been over in 5"
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kevin Durant gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond green belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Dame hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Luis Scola hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Simmons to the Warriors make zero sense unless the Warriors are gonna trade Draymond Green as well
He’s not that amazing.  If you hold the ball a lot you get a bunch of assists anyways.   Draymond green is a much better passer in the halfcourt and he doesn’t need as much time to find open guys.  Ben could never do that.
"Draymond Green has the highest impact on Curry's efficiency among all players who play/have played with Curry (including Klay and KD), the effect is even more pronounced this season."
"Draymond Green. Great basketball player but outside of some of his pretty passes, he just has an ugly game."
"I mean, Ben Simmons has always been a perimeter player while Draymond was already known as an undersized big since his college days. That's just how both guys play and I don't think it has to do with confidence. Kerr didn't give Draymond the confidence to play big he just used him in his proper role. I also seriously doubt that Simmons would be anywhere close to as effective as Green was playing Center because that's just not his game."
"I think that it’s good to evaluate players playoff stats in a separate sphere because the playoffs are a whole different animal, along with the reasons you listed above. Honestly though, at the end of the day, people really only care about championships and not playoff totals (except for lebron supporters), but they’re smart enough to know that someone like Draymond Green is not better than Wilt because they have more rings"
Sad how many people hold out hope on this man. He’s a glorified Draymond green. Making Steph money.
The disrepect on Draymond Green name lmao.  Did we forget GSW have the worst offense in the league this year without Curry?
"For context on the team changing, here's him many players on those teams are also on the 2020 USA team:   2008: None   2012: 2 (Kevin Durant and Kevin Love)   2016: 2 (Kevin Durant and Draymond Green)  This year's team could really benefit from better bigs and either more MVP-caliber talent (Lebron, Harden, Curry), or some guess that are better at the off-ball/non-scoring aspects of the game. They don't have the raw talent advantage they've had in the past, so they need to form an actual identity."
"This team is pretty poorly constructed.  Durant, Beal, Lillard, Tatum, and Lavine are all good at creating their own shot, but no one on the team is great at creating shots for others.    The team needs like a Harden or Trae Young or even Westbrook.  I wouldn't be surprised if Draymond Green ends up leading the team in assists."
They have an playmaking savant and the greatest defender of all time in Draymond Green tho
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"The 04 Pistons? Look, the NBA pays role players to play great defense while providing minimal scoring. There are guys sitting overseas and out the league who can only score, while guys like Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday make top dollar.   Guys on the out at one point or another like IT and Melo were both blacklisted over defensive concerns. This is very basic basketball knowledge. Draymond Green can’t score at all and he’s flirting with a max bc of his defense/IQ."
60 points on 11 dribbles in 3 quarters (Klay Thompson).  Triple double AND 4X5 in the same game without points to for either (Draymond Green).
If Draymond Green can outperform Curry in the Finals then CJ is allowed to outperform Dame like two random series.
"I'm not ignoring context. I'm very aware of the context surrounding why they lost.   Of course getting Durant wasn't the only way for them to win.   I already touched on how Green not getting suspended or Bogut not getting injured or Curry not getting fouled out would have resulted in a win.   You could even argue that Kyrie and Love getting injured is another avenue to win like it was in 2015.   Again I feel like you're misunderstanding my point...    I already acknowledged that the Warriors had the base level of talent to be able to win. That's not what getting Durant gave them. Getting Durant was getting a safety net so that even if any of the aforementioned circumstances occured again the Warriors could still win.   So if we pretend for a second that you are the Warriors front office or ownership. And I ask you ""/r/MasaiGotUsNow, your team just lost the finals. What do you ***need*** to do in order to make sure that doesn't happen again?""  Your response would probably be ""All of those circumstances are out of my control. But free agency is in my control. So what I ***need*** to do is get the best player I can so that this team is so talented that even if any of the other extenuating circumstances occur we can still win.""   Now you, as a fan, can be against that decision and think that they shouldn't be allowed to do that. That's fine.  But in the context of this conversation, regarding what the Warriors ***needed*** to do in order to, not win, but prevent a loss in the face of overwhelming adversity: it was to get the best player available, which was Kevin Durant.   And that's part of the reason it seems to you like I'm ignoring the context of the injuries in 2019 or the other circumstances in 2016. Because the whole benefit of having Kevin Durant was to make any and all circumstances irrelevant. If you make your team so good then theoretically Draymond getting suspended shouldn't matter. Curry fouling out shouldn't matter. Bogut getting injured shouldn't matter.   But as we saw, Kevin Durant wasn't even enough to negate all adversity."
"Harden being down on Giannis was a thing, but also directly connected to Giannis winning MVP over him.  CJ McCollum and Draymond Green also tweeted some stuff about Giannis too 'not defending the best player' (*veryyyyy* funny hearing defense complaints coming from CJ,) and some of that is Giannis doesn't do all that banana boat stuff.  A lot of these guys don't like it when you don't suck up to them and do open runs with them in the summertime. BBall players are pretty big divas and there are plenty of cliques in the basketball world."
"If this player gets the 10/10/10 pretty naturally without stat hunting then this is a player with star-level impact but potentially underrated because of a lack of scoring. Like some others have said, kinda like a Draymond Green. I might even look at this as some super PJ Tucker or Jae Crowder - just a good net positive guy on the court who can step up to any occassion and make the right play."

I'm kind of surprised I haven't seen Draymond Green mentioned.  I like him but I thought he would get more flack for some of the dirty plays.

"I think he’s a good coach, but he’s absolutely not the best. He took last years warriors to one game out of the playoffs. The past few years he’s had to play g-league players major minutes. I don’t know any coach that could take the squad 2 years ago to the playoffs when the best player was draymond green. A goat coach could’ve taken last years squad to the playoffs, but I doubt they make it out the first round. Hell, Kerr probably would’ve made the playoffs last season if curry was healthy the whole season and if kelly oubre started the season shooting his averages"
Newly drafted Draymond Green
"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 5 straight Finals. 5 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK.  And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Rockets and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH. I CHOSE THE TEAM WITH THE PRETTY COLORS CAUSE I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WOULD HAVE SATAN A SNITCH AND HIS DONKEY IN THEIR CONFERENCE. I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a warriors flair talking about Curry. Every warriors fan would let steph curry shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search ayesha curry feet until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt curry people would think this was cool"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Steph Currys DICK in their mouth.  They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Steph Curry gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his teammates who works day in and day out for him, because the warriors are only up 74 - 8, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 3 times, and then once more for good measure. And I'll watch that shit on youtube for the rest of my life. I'll be there at his funeral to comfort Ayesha with hors d'oeuvres but when it's my turn to sprinkle dirt on his coffin I'll drop a picture of LeBron James instead. And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear step currys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Ayesha is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of vegetable curry ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning. I am home now. Some days are good. Some days aren't. All I can do is live what life Curry has left me."

"Throwing shit at the wall   East  1. Milwaukee: Despite winning a championship, Giannis, Middleton and Jrue go full all gas, no breaks next year and gun for 65ish wins and the 1 seed in the East. Love the Portis re-sign.   2. Brooklyn: Battle injuries like they did last year, but still prevail as the most dangerous team in the league.   3. Boston: Ime Udoka brings much needed cohesion to a C’s team with a lot of firepower. Jay’s + Rob Will stay healthy. Schroeder guns for 6moy.   4. Atlanta: After a rocky first 10 games and everyone questioning how legit the young Hawks are, they explode back. One of Reddish or Huerter gets dealt at the deadline.   5. Miami: Pretty significant drop off in win column from top 4 to here. Heat play hard, but it’s not pretty. Robinson underperforms.   6. Philadelphia: Simmons situation leaks into season. A lot of turmoil. Embiid’s health is a big question. Maxey takes a big step.   7. Indiana: Have a sturdy season led by Carlisle. Warren and LeVert play 65+ games each.   8. Washington: The Wiz outlast New York and Chicago in the play-in. Washington has multiple 6moy candidates.   Other East  Chicago barely misses out. Derozan contract quickly becomes bad, fit turns out to be atrocious.   Cleveland (for no other reason that I plan on hammering the Over for their season win total) takes a step forward.   Charlotte is everyone’s favorite bad team.   West (In general has a pretty down year)  1. LAL: Hate this team with a passion (not Russ &amp; Me7o) so it’s only right. Spacing is a legit issue but the defense is still top notch. Kent Bazemore tries to fight Trevor Ariza at some point.   2. Phoenix: CP3 slows down, but the rest of the team comes to play after slipping in the Finals. Ayton MIP finalist.   3. Utah: Same ole Utah, nothing too crazy. One of Ingles/Bogdonavic gets dealt at the deadline.   4. Denver: Jokic keeps everyone in awe. Porter Jr. never takes that step everyone expects him to with Murray out. Nuggets make a move for Dame.   5. New Orleans: FUCK YOU DONT CARE. Na but Zion and BI take over, Zion comes back and shocks everyone on defense. New back court + defensive depth is a huge strength. Willie Green for COY. Nickeil finishes top 5 MIP.   6. Dallas: Solid year, Luka wins scoring title. Jury is out on Kidd, he and Luka fight a lot. Porzingis bounces back and plays 60ish games. Team defense gets really bad though. Lot of shootouts.   7. LAC: Interesting year for the Clips. They meddle around .500 but are that random team every year that wins all its close games but gets shredded by lottery teams. Terrence Mann has the greenest of lights. Kawhi returns.  8. Minnesota: Now we’re in the ugly. T-Wolves and their fans don’t give a shit though, playoffs baby. Edwards and KAT become unstoppable. DLo doesn’t get in the way. Defense is close to non-existent, but enough energy from Pat Bev keeps the young team engaged enough to go .500.   Golden State: I’m gonna get ripped apart for this but I don’t see the hype. Curry is fuckin amazing, but I think we see a really broken down Klay. Draymond replicates last two years. Youth isn’t what it needs to be. They come up short as KAT gives Draymond and Wiseman absolute hell in the battle for the 8th spot in the play in. Pat Bev gets a clutch block on Curry and the internet folds inwards.   Other West   Portland is horrible after Dame literally sits out (I 25% believe this) and gets traded East (plz). CJ gets dealt. Powell gets the green light to shoot 25 times a game.   Kings finish as the 9th seed but Walton fucks it up and gets knocked out by Curry and the Warriors.   Memphis = Charlotte West  Houston starts 5-0 and finishes with another top 5 pick."

Draymond green is better than klay thompson. Doesn’t elaborate. Leaves.
"Billups Rip Hamilton Scottie Pippen Draymond Green Anthony Davis   I think is a better all defense squad but I see you were choosing defensive players with not a lot of offense, except Pippen is an offensive force. I think this All D team would beat the above team."
"I think 20+ teams take Draymond but not everyone. Philly would be nuts with Simmons/Klay/Green/Harris/Embiid, not so much with Simmons/Green/Harris/Draymond/Embiid. The offense of that second team would get extremely jammed up."
"PJ Washington/Draymond Green/Miles Bridges/Terry Rozier/LaMelo Ball would actually be a really cool small ball starting five. If Rozier or Ball learned to defend, the switchability of that unit would be interesting.   Sub Rozier for Oubre for defense and everyone in that lineup is 6'7 except for Bridges (6'6), and you'd have 3 guys with 7'2+ wingspans.   Now I want to see that, Philly should trade us Simmons"

"Steph Curry and Draymond Green always seem to become top 10 All-time players whenever Portland is involved.  If they play again in the postseason, we bouta see Steph whip out some windmill dunks and Draymond start launching from half court.   It goes:  1) Portland Steph  2) Portland Dray  3) Ben Simmons in practice videos  4) gap  5) some scrub named Michael Jeffrey Jordan"
"In LeBron's Heat years he was easily up there with anyone in terms of defensive impact. I'm not ""making shit up"", google ""2013 LeBron DPOY snub"" and explain to me how Marc Gasol won DPOY without making the defensive 1st team, meanwhile LeBron had the most votes. And he has been in consideration multiple other times, but the modern NBA values (properly imo) rim protection, so he has an uphill battle by being primarily a perimeter player.   Maybe ""snub"" is the wrong word, it's just more that it's exceedingly rare to win DPOY as a perimeter player in the modern NBA, when Jordan won it, it was not unheard of for guards to win. We have had a total of 5 non C non PF players win it since then (30+ years: GP, Artest, Kawhi x2, Draymond Green. That's it)."
If he won 11 championships but only 5 MVPs that should tell you how he won all those championships. He has played with more hall of famers in their prime than everyone except KD I believe. If you replace every team Robert Horry played for with Draymond Green You'd have Draymond with 11 championships and people calling him the goat.
"Let me tell you, as a Wolves fan I would KILL for a consistent string of 1st round playoff exits.... Big market teams don't really understand what it is like to not have FAs want to come to you. Ever. Like never ever ever. The Lakers best ever FA signing is a toss up between Lebron and Shaq. The Wolves best ever FA singing is a toss up between Kevin Martin and Taj Gibson. Then comes the tanking, so we small market teams need to tank to get top prospects, but once they sign their 2nd contract it still becomes hard to build a team of competent role players around them, because you are overpaying for FAs to come live there. There is no Danny Green tier players that will come here. The best case scenario for a small market team is to find diamonds in the rough that stay loyal to their franchise. GSW isn't a small market team, but before they had not too much FA sway. But Curry is better than anyone could have guessed, and Draymond is an absolute gem of a late pick, pair that with a coach that has an innovative system that fits their players strength and now you have a contender, once you are in contender rankings you get the chance to sign KD."

Lol - you might as well argue that Draymond Green is more of an NBA legend than KD haha
"Its not even necessarily about Westbrooks poor jump shooting, its about his serious lack of off ball game that has made things harder for his co-stars. Both the Rockets and Wizards actually had stronger offensive ratings with Russ on the bench and Harden/Beal on the floor. Also despite all of the praise he gets for taking the Wizards to the playoffs the truth is that they only won 9 more games compared to last year. And that was a season where the remains of IT started 37 games. Meanwhile Draymond Greens presence in Golden State significantly improves the overall efficiency of the offense and the numbers of Steph Curry. If Russ was legitimately active off of the ball in ways that didn't involve him jacking up low efficiency shots he would probably be a very impactful offensive player who's game could effectively work alongside ball dominant stars. For example, if Draymond Green sees that a team is sagging of him and baiting the jumper then he will automatically run a hand off or set a pindown for Steph Curry or Klay Thompson because he now knows that his defender will be woefully out of position. But That's because Draymond is a very willing off ball screener and understands his limitations as a player.   If you can provide significant evidence that Westbrook is capable of making those reads and actually willing to deploy those types of counters to teams sagging off of him then you'd have a much stronger argument for this working. If you say that he will do those things more often in LA as a result of Lebron and AD's influence then fine but as of right now we have never really seen him do that consistently so until we actually see evidence to the contrary we have no reason to reject the null hypothesis"
"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-kevin-durant-argument-suspension-what-did-they-say-report        &gt;Green accused Durant of making the whole season about him even though he was going to leave after this season. Green let out his frustrations about how Durant has handled free agency — keeping his options open and keeping the story alive, consuming the Warriors and their season with talk of what Durant will do next.        this is what it was about, and no i dont believe its not about this because a few years later they said conflicting stories to each other where neither of them take any blame for it."
"I think that article is about a different incident. There were [a bunch](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/14/18094918/kevin-durant-draymond-green-drama-fight) of different fights between them over the years.  The tl;dr is that by December of the 18-19 season KD still hadn't told anyone on the team what his plans for free agency was. I think most people on the team assumed that meant he was leaving or at least wasn't committed to the team long-term. He was also behaving pretty ridiculously at the time, like when he got super mad at Draymond for passing the pall to Steph instead of him during a game."

"Draymond Green - nut kicking, poking eyes"
"&gt;Did we watch the same interview? Green admitted he overreacted and needed to make it right.  I thought we were talking in a more general sense now and not just about Green specifically. However, in reference to Green, the fact that he said 3 years later that he knew he needed to work it out doesn't hold much weight with me. Additionally, just because he knew he needed to ""make it right"" doesn't mean that he knew what that meant or how to accomplish it.  &gt;But you can't come in as an outsider and demand someone take a specific action to fix a relationship  A couple things. First, when we are talking about unprofessional conduct at work, your boss isn't an outsider. Second, it isn't the job of the boss to ""fix a relationship."" It is the job of the boss to set and enforce standards on professional behavior. If someone acts unprofessional, it is on the boss to call them out and set clear expectations on what needs to be done to address the past problem and ensure that it won't happen again going forward.  Also, did you listen to KD? His issue wasn't that the ""outsiders"" did too much. He was mad they didn't step in *more.*   &gt;it's disingenuous and takes away from the meaning.   ...but that goes both ways. I mean, if your boss tells you to ""make it right"" how do I know if you honestly mean what you are saying vs. just doing it because your boss said you have to address it with me?  Additionally, I'm not sure if it matters that much. If you fuck up, admit and outwardly take ownership of your mistake, and you change your behavior to not fuck up again in the future, it doesn't matter much to me if you did it because of some personal growth and acceptance of if it is because your boss made you. All I need from my coworkers is accountability and professionalism. I don't care much if that is motivated internally or from their superior.  &gt;Now if he goes and apologizes, KD can't know if he meant it or if it was just because the boss said he had to do it.   Same thing if boss tells Green to ""make it right"" or ""hash it out."" KD can't know if Green actually thought that the situation warranted that or if he is just doing it because that's what he was told to do.  &gt;...but Draymond wasn't a bully, he just got pissed in the moment.   ??? He acted unprofessional and intentionally targeted the weaknesses and insecurities of someone to maximize the impact of his attacks on them as punishment for questioning his authority and decision making.  That's bullying. You can make the case that Green is only a bully when he is pissed, but even if we agree with that, it still doesn't mean he isn't a bully.  Seriously, if you fuck up at work and get called out and your response is to attack them on a personal level using unrelated shit that aligns with their insecurities and weaknesses, you are a bully, period. This shit isn't really up for debate.  &gt;...but you don't lock him in a room for nearly 2 hours and demand an apology.  Well I will agree with that. If I tell them to apologize and they say ""no,"" there isn't any point in having a discussion about it for more than 5-10 minutes. Either they do it or they face appropriate consequences. Holding their hand for 2 hours to try and convince them that it is the right thing to do is a waste of everyone's time.  That doesn't mean that it is/was wrong to say he needed to apologize.  &gt;Maybe you can take that tack if you're viewing your employee as completely replaceable and you don't care about internal dynamics and will fire them if they refuse, but not when you have a guy that's integral to the organization that you have on a multi-year, multi-million dollar contact, and who needs to stay bought-in with the culture.  I wouldn't fire them. I'd take other disciplinary action and see if that cleared it up or if they kept acting the same way in the future.  Beyond that, unless we have a culture where it is ok for people to act unprofessionally and refuse to apologize, then Green *already* wasn't bought-in with the culture. The question is if he still provides benefit despite not being bought-in. If he does, ***and if we can set up sufficient boundaries to protect the other workers on the team***, then I'd probably keep him."
"KD verbatim said that he felt like steve kerr/bob myers were acting like ""nothing happened"". Then agrees with Draymond that Kerr/Myers asking Green to apologize screwed it up.  Somehow doesn't acknowledge that these two things completely contradict each other.   The logic in this video was severely lacking..."
"&gt;  He needs to learn how to fix that and make that shit right.  Did we watch the same interview? Green admitted he overreacted and needed to make it right. But you can't come in as an outsider and demand someone take a specific action to fix a relationship, it's disingenuous and takes away from the meaning. Now if he goes and apologizes, KD can't know if he meant it or if it was just because the boss said he had to do it. They fucked it up.  &gt; Again, if you fuck up, you need to fix that. It isn't on the other person to ""sort it out"" with you. Also, again, it is perfectly fine for the superior to set minimum acceptable conditions on what counts as ""sorting it out."" Otherwise, you are just inviting the bully to engage in more bullying to avoid having to take responsibility for their actions.  Not disagreeing that it was on Green to talk to KD and sort it out, 100% in agreement there, but Draymond wasn't a bully, he just got pissed in the moment. It was an overreaction, and he should have worked it out, but you don't lock him in a room for nearly 2 hours and demand an apology. Maybe you can take that tack if you're viewing your employee as completely replaceable and you don't care about internal dynamics and will fire them if they refuse, but not when you have a guy that's integral to the organization that you have on a multi-year, multi-million dollar contact, and who needs to stay bought-in with the culture."
Sergio Busquets ?? He is pretty unathletic but makes up for it with his incredible vision of the game . He is the Draymond Green of Barcelona
All The Smoke already did this interview on a much more relaxed &amp; long form conversational format.   Although this little thing Draymond Green is trying to do will most likely be popular.... its being done way better by other camps.
"Draymond Green throwing his current coach under the bus for no reason. Meanwhile KD continues reach new levels of immaturity and unlikability.  These guys need to be more like overweight James Harden, posing maskless at the strip club. That was a pro PR move to leverage a trade."
If Simmons can't work it out with Embiid then why would it work out with KAT.    Simmons is such a weird player to try and build around because his like a better version of draymond green. Can't even make a pocket rocket type team because of hack a shaq strat.
"Oh come on, the Rockets weren't better than the KD-less Warriors in 2019, they had something to decide this called basketball. Which they happened to lose. woulda-coulda-shoulda is not what decides which team makes the finals. The Rockets had met the Warriors 4 times in 5 years, and lost all four. Only in one series did the Warriors have KD from start to finish. They had their chances over and over, and squandered them.  It's like saying Toronto should have managed to beat LeBron once... in the NBA, there are some special teams which stare down the odds, and the odds just surrender. The Warriors were one of those teams. Steph and Klay are arguably the two best shooters ever, Draymond Green is elite defensively and an excellent point-forward, and Iguodala still had the case for the best lock-down defender in the league come playoff time. KD made them unstoppable, but even with a depleted bench they weren't a bunch of scrubs.  You can make a case that if Iguodala / Klay / Livingston / Looney weren't all limping and missing games due to injuries throughout the playoffs they don't need KD or an injured Cousins to win it all. We'll never know, because that's woulda-coulda-shoulda territory, and the Raptors beat them 4-2, just like the Warriors beat the Rockets."
Dude got cooked all season on defense before his injury. He needs to be getting that teaching from Draymond Green and Looney non-stop rn lmao. At least he’s with the Warriors to maybe develop
"To be honest, they need someone like draymond green. I think Shannon sharpe with Stephen a smith is the best. Obviously if we don’t play the diversity thign"
"&gt; How much else does KD want the front office to intervene?  We, the Golden State Warriors organization, have found Draymond Green of Saginaw, MI, guilty of crimes against basketball winning. We therefore sentence him to 48 hours of watching Ben Simmons shoot free throws.  \- Bob Myers, GM Golden State Warriors"
"He’s like Draymond, just you know not as good or savvy. All the bad traits (cowardice, immaturity leading to embarrassing tantrums on court) plus hits 3s every now and then. He should train with Green in the offseason and work on his crotch attacks"
"Here's [that post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/) about potential missed calls on both teams:  ------  Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.  #Calls going against Rockets:  1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.  2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.  3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.  4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).  5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)  6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)  7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)  8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.  #Calls going against Warriors:  1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.  2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.  3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)  4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)  5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.  6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).  A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:  https://streamable.com/el34r  https://streamable.com/vtmzu  https://streamable.com/uv829  https://streamable.com/9fqlg  https://streamable.com/junss  https://streamable.com/2peej  https://streamable.com/53mhy  https://streamable.com/cuojo  https://streamable.com/07r5o  Bonus Harden trying to draw foul when there was none &amp; just looking like a fool:  https://streamable.com/ca5v5  https://streamable.com/jffyc  Oh and, inb4 Rockets fans accuse me of bias again, and calling me a Warriors fan.

"Draymond took the ball out of KD's hands, then told him ""You're a bitch, we don't need you"" and then procceeded to blame Myers and Kerr for KD leaving.  I get KD having that opinion, but Green should have definitely took some blame for the situation, Myers and Kerr scrambled and took the wrong decision, sure, but they were put in this situation because of your stupid mouth.  You give the ball to KD for the final shot, and this is not a thing we talk about."
"It’s much easier to not choke and to perform well when you’re surrounded by a core that won a championship and 73 games without you…obviously he’d play better with Steph freakin Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green surrounding him"
"Draymond Green will make more money on TV than he ever will hooping, incredible interview"
"This kinda seems like a cop out on both sides. It seems like Draymond is absolving himself of guilt and placing it on everyone else. And KD is to intimidated by Green to say “I left cuz I couldn’t stand being around your ass.” The entire team had KD’s back on that one, but KD was made to look like a punk in the media. It all comes down to KD not feeling like he was getting the respect he feels he deserves."
"I'll throw in a comment to get downvoted. I actually think internet trolls made them crack up. A lot of players wouldn't think about it too much because they spend more time in the locker room or with their families etc, but I think KD is a rare bird and he reads all of it constantly. There was a point where he started snapping at people heckling him from the stands and I figured something was going to give.   I don't know how much time Draymond Green spends on Twitter etc. but he got in a flame war on Instagram I think with Conor McGregor (a UFC fighter and noted trash talker) and lost pretty badly so he clearly had an ear in it too, and I think he would pick it up also from how Durant was acting.   Perhaps the first occasion that fans got sick of a team and vetoed their existence lol."
It’s like you have no idea who Draymond Green is.
"Draymond Green had zero points on three shots at halftime of the Golden State Warriors' win at the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Green went on a profanity-laced tirade in the locker room, according to Lisa Salters.  “I am not a robot. I know I can play. You have me messed up right now. If you don't want me to shoot, I won't shoot the rest of the game""  This is when Draymond tried to punch kerr"
Draymond Green with a better scoring package
"I'd say the former because of guy like Ben Wallace, Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green who all got rings unlike guy who just care about scoring like James Harden and Carmelo Anthony."
"Hi, me mo-mo Draymond Green."
Steve Kerr Starting 5:  Steve Nash  Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Kevin Durant
"Draymond Green, Marcus Smart and Pat Bev where/ are seen as the heart of their teams despite not being the best player on the team"
"You’re blaming the wrong person.  He came from nothing as someone with too little talent to make the NBA and scrapped and fought in every way he could to make it.   Full effort on defense and does anything he can to win.    He got paid millions to be a dirty ass 3&amp;D and he doesn’t apologize for it.   Still bothers me that he’s dirty, but so is Draymond Green and Bobby Portis who’s injured more players than Beverly has.  Dirty players with great defense get paid.  You gotta blame the system that pays him, because this was the only way he could make those millions."
Draymond “Patrick Beverly” Green
"""IS BEN SIMMONS THE NEW DRAYMOND GREEN? TODAY IN THE JUMP AT 3PM"""
"But if his best comp is a slightly better Draymond Green, what does that mean exactly? Even the warriors aren't a Championship team with Steph and Draymond alone. Really doesn't characterize him as a centerpiece player."
"Draymond Green, not Steph Curry, leads the team in assists"
"Both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Warriors had 6  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Demarcus Cousins/David West"
"I'm conflicted - the lineup data with Simmons does indicate his value as an elite transition player with playmaking and strong isolation defense.  He also should improve over the next 4 seasons, given a standard development curve.  RPM data also puts him in the top 20 players, winshares, plus/minus, is all very similar.  On the other end, I have characterized him as a borderline all star before, which really means I can't figure out what he is or how impactful he is within the context of a championship offense.  The error bars on his actual value is the highest Ive seen in awhile.  We falsely characterized the 2011 heat mavericks finals as a breakdown on the part of lebron, when really it was at least 50% about the mavericks unusual zone lineup adjustments that didn't really have a counter until 5 out offenses became more predominant later in the 2010s.  Even then, it is clear that series might have played out differently if it was a best of 15 rather than best of 7.  I don't know what the fuck happened with Simmons during the hawks series.  You can point to individual plays, but the number of shots, his inability to be coached to throw the ball at the rim if he is within 5 feet and to see what happens, and the lack of any form of shot development is really odd.  Is he really just living off natural potential and is lazy off the floor?  Does he have an undiagnosed, untreated anxiety disorder and we are bashing him inappropriately?  Is Doc Rivers a toxic coach? Im not sure anymore.  What I do know is most casual fans are severely underrating him right now.  He is significantly more valuable than Jrue Holiday.  He is less of a player than James Harden, but he is much younger and locked into a contract he cannot escape from.  But I also don't know where he can go, because a player like Simmons shouldn't go to a rebuilding team in the modern era, because he does have championship equity...  And his hypothetical fit, even if the lineup data doesn't always agree, means he needs to go to a team with elite shooting.  The most obvious fit however, the warriors, already has Draymond Green and its extremely unclear whether these two players could play cooperatively next to each other or if their skill sets are not additive.  Basically the Simmons hate may or may not be warranted, but a player can't just move on when he feels like it when under a massive contract and the team he is on cant get something in return."
"I don’t think that would do it. We need a stretch 5 but losing Marcus would open up other holes. He’s the leader and defensive anchor of the team, so his value goes well beyond salary. The closest comparison I can think of is Draymond Green, so the value he provides the Celtics would make the asking price quite high.  Many fans might disagree with my assessment but I think it’s evident that Celtic management puts a ton of stock in Smart. I can’t really imagine a trade scenario that makes either team very happy."
* Isaiah Thomas * Manu Ginobili * Draymond Green * Dennis Rodman * Jokic
"&gt;honestly imo, he has strong potential  to be a prime Draymond green with higher scoring    Did you watch prime Draymond?"
"At this point, if the Process Sixers end their run without a title to show for it- it probably won't be because of Morey, unless he keeps throwing weirdass Simmons trades at teams instead of taking a reasonable route to improve when available. But his team ultimately picked a worse Draymond Green 1st overall before he got hired, There's nothing he can do about it."
"I think dude has made a lot of progress since he came in the league n I was a fan of his in college...he always had/has defense,  his only problem was consistent offense, which he definitely has improved on...honestly imo, he has strong potential  to be a prime Draymond green with higher scoring if he really wanted to push himself"
Sure but they had Iggy and Draymond. There are very few players I wouldve chose over draymond green. There are easily 5-6 players I wouldve chose at point guard over Westbrook.
&gt;outside of his 2016 season Draymond Green has never played like an all star. He is strictly a role player in 2021.  This is just plain wrong.
Warriors are not a super team because outside of his 2016 season Draymond Green has never played like an all star. He is strictly a role player in 2021.   Westbrook put up 26/12/12 last season he is still a superstar and LeBron was putting up MVP stats 25/7/7 before the injury.   The Nets AND Lakers are superteams. To claim otherwise is a lie and/or ignorance of reality
you were 1 draymond green away from contending in the past 5 years
This is a proper 'son'ing. Draymond Green just 'Dad'ed Dame.
"Let me make this reaaaal simple for you: Draymond Green is arguably the 2nd best player on the warriors, but literally the 5th option on offense. In our finals run, Lowry was the second-best player but IMPERICALLY speaking, Siakam was the second option over Lowry."
"Really? Because that Lacob interview where he's crying about the luxury tax seems to say otherwise. I wonder if an owner who thinks the roster isn't championship or bust this year would say , “If we can’t [win a title], then you should look at Joe Lacob and Bob Myers and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins and say you weren’t good enough,” Lacob said. “You’re paying all that money you weren’t good enough."""
"I'll reply to [both](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p5qwwq/steve_kerr_i_think_this_years_team_will_offer_a/h983hh1/) of your comments here.  &gt;  It's easy to boost your net rating by playing alongside good players.  You're right. Which is why I compared Lee to Oubre and Bazemore in the same 5-man lineups (i.e. Curry+Wiggins+Green+Looney+?, Curry+Wiggins+Green+Wiseman+?, and Curry+Wiggins+Green+JTA+?). Those lineups with Lee playing SG shot better and had a higher NETRTG than the same lineups with either Oubre or Bazemore.  &gt;That TS% does not excite me due to him not shooting that much, and that's because he's afraid to imo.  I don't think he's afraid to.  https://youtu.be/vxZ-XOA7auM  https://youtu.be/HKPtA3lLpZo  &gt;Also, last year (in a year Steph was getting triple-teamed and we needed alternatives to make a play or score) D Lee only attempted 5 FG's per game. He had every opportunity to play better, he's just not very good.  Well, technically you should be looking at per-36 or per-100 to compare.  You your point though, you're right: Lee's 11.8 FGA-per-100 was less than Oubre's 19.7 or Bazemore's 13.6. Granted, that includes stats accumulated during non-Curry+Wiggins+Green lineups as well  With that said, I would argue that Lee's 8.4 3PA-per-100 at 39.7% is more important to spacing the floor than Oubre's 7.8 3PA-per-100 at 31.6% or Bazemore's 6.4 3PA-per-100 at 40.8%  Case in point, despite putting up significantly more FGA we saw how sub-optimal the starting unit was with Oubre.  &gt;Dude takes about 1 shot per quarter. That's not how you beat teams when Steph is getting triple-teamed. Especially when Draymond isn't going to shoot, Looney isn't going to shoot, now that lineup you referenced has 3 PLAYERS WHO REFUSE TO ATTEMPT A FIELD GOAL.   If 3.5 of those 4.8 are 3PA then yes, that is how you beat teams when Steph is getting triple-teamed. You don't need him chucking junk up there.   SG	|	5th	|	FGA	|	3PA	|	FTA	|	OFFRTG	|	DEFRTG	|	NETRTG	|	TS% ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Lee	|	JTA	|	87.9	|	39.4	|	27.3	|	139.4	|	77.4	|	62	|	69.8 Lee	|	Looney	|	84.2	|	47.4	|	21.1	|	147.4	|	105	|	42.4	|	78.8 Lee	|	Wiseman	|	75	|	40.6	|	37.5	|	153.1	|	126.7	|	26.5	|	83.7 Oubre	|	JTA	|	81.3	|	33.3	|	23.5	|	118.3	|	108.4	|	9.9	|	64.5 Bazemore	|	Looney	|	88.7	|	40	|	13.4	|	116	|	106.7	|	9.3	|	61.3 Oubre	|	Looney	|	86.9	|	37.3	|	19.1	|	114.1	|	105.1	|	9	|	59.9 Bazemore	|	JTA	|	75.4	|	34.7	|	21.6	|	107.2	|	105.5	|	1.7	|	63.1 Bazemore	|	Wiseman	|	87.7	|	31.1	|	17.9	|	105.7	|	111.8	|	-6.2	|	55.2 Oubre	|	Wiseman	|	81.8	|	29.9	|	17.6	|	96.9	|	109.7	|	-12.8	|	54.1  FGA may go down but if 3PA and FTA and TS% go up you're going to win. Damion Lee is fine filling in for Klay until he gets back.  &gt;My feeling is Porter Jr, Iggy, or one of the rooks will easily steal that spot from D Lee.  Iguodala is 37 years old. He will not be playing starter or even consistent/planned rotation minutes. Confirmed by Kerr.  Now, sure, OPJ could give you minutes off the bench at the 2 but I think it's much more likely he plays minutes off the bench at the 3 behind Wiggins. Especially because I don't see him getting 20+ minutes a night due to his injury history.  TBH, I actually expect Poole to ""start"" at SG and Lee to come off the bench and play with the starters until they sit and Poole comes in for Steph. But who knows how Kerr works it out."
"Starting 5: Isiah Thomas, Ron Artest, Larry Johnson, Dennis Rodman, Alonzo Mourning  Bench: Grayson Allen, Draymond Green, Bill Laimbeer, Pat Bev and Zaza Pachulia  Coach: Chuck Daly  ps. Goodluck surviving on em 😂"
"Kobe, Iverson, Tony Allen for past players   Currently Marcus Smart and Draymond Green for me fit that bill the most"
Draymond Green will be traded  Doc Rivers will get fired  Jimmy Butler will fight with Spoelstra and staff during midseason but we will learn it after they get eliminated in the first round.
"This is commented a lot but I don't think it's true.  Many NBA players (both active and retired) gave him props:  * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO WINNING FINALS MVP 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9yOhfBKHwM) * [NBA PLAYERS REACT TO MILWAUKEE BUCKS WINNING NBA CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 | GIANNIS REACTIONS (LeBron etc) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGBut87sqw)  Some examples from these two videos: Lebron, Jaylen Brown, CJ, Draymond Green, Pau Gasol, Andre Iguodala, Miles Bridges, Christian Wood, Larry Nance Jr, Magic, Isiah Thomas, Donovan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Ja Morant, Dejounte Murray, Covington, McGee, Haliburton, Gobert, and others."
If Ben wanted sympathy as a sportsperson he should've been a female tennis player or gymnast.   He's Draymond Green with worse marketing &amp; in a poorer fit / system.
"I’m not conflating the two eras of Green’s career. Draymond was a 39% three point shooter in 2016, there’s no confusing that. He shot 28% from three last season, on 126 attempts. That’s basically two attempts per game. Simmons shot 10 threes all season, total. There’s a difference between Green taking what the defense gives him on occasion in an attempt to keep them honest, and Ben flat out refusing to take that shot.   If Simmons does flourish on the Warriors as you think, it will take some time, and he won’t be the ceiling raiser Draymond is anytime soon. The one thing people neglect to bring up is how Green unlocks elite level Steph.   Regardless, Lacob put a nail in the Simmons trade coffin when he took a $50K fine to publicly say it’s a bad on-court and financial fit."
Steph playmaking gets overshadowed because unlike every other lead guard in the NBA he doesn’t get to run 182627182 pick n rolls every game and since Draymond green skin on offense is to find him he gets lots of assists so people think “DURR DRAYKOND REAL PG OF WARRIORS DURR”
Ben Simmons is the most over rated player in the NBA right now. He should be compared to players like Draymond green. Not Giannis.
"I really haven't seen this much.  What I see much more often is ""just turn Ben Simmons into Draymond Green""."
"Last season, Draymond got our guys not named Steph so many open layups. Simple cuts when defenders fell asleep or played too tight on the perimeter. Guys like Bazemore, JTA, Poole, Mulder, were gifted layups in the halfcourt set because Green focuses entirely on getting others buckets……even more so than Simmons, since Ben can finish above the rim over defenses so he’s understandably looking to sniff out his own opportunities."
"I do think he's perfectly suited to the Draymond role, running hand offs with Steph would be a dream for him (if he can make his FTs otherwise people would just hack him).  Weird fit with the real Draymond Green however."
You'd have to be fucking high to trade Draymond for Simmons. I'm not a big fan of GSW or green but Jesus Christ.
"**Sounds like a pretty big pile of bullshit for a max contract player** on the same team as Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Steve Kerr and Golden State support staff."
"We've seen Draymond get better as playoff pressure increases.  We've seen the opposite from Simmons.  The warriors goals are winning at the highest level, even though Simmons is a theoretical improvement over Green, the ability to play his best when facing the highest pressure makes it really hard to choose Simmons over Green."
Green means more to GS than just mere talent and shitty 3pt shooting percentage. GS is not trading Draymond.  Unless the haul is stupid hugely in their favor.
"Also, he's not a shooter. You just replaced Simmons with Draymond, and by the way, you just lost Danny Green. Good luck!"
"Draymond Green had 32, 15 and 9 on 73/75/100 shooting in a Finals Game 7. Anybody here think Ben can do anything close to that?"
"In the playoffs, Draymond Green &gt; Ben Simmons and it's so obvious too"
"Draymond has gotten overrated around here.  Simmons is not a championship player, but Green is not the same player he was when the Warriors were winning chips either"
"I don't think he will get the max as other people alluded to, especially after his playoff performance. The closest comparison is Draymond Green and he is getting \~25M a year, and Draymond Green shoots 3s and a better FT than Simmons. I would say he will be getting $25-$27M/year if he was free agent this offseason and it won't be any contender. It will be like the Wolves and Kings offering that amount."
"Eh, I've always felt that this narrative was overstated. Draymond was already getting 25+ minutes a game near the end of the season before Lee had his major injury, and he even started in the playoffs (granted, Bogut was injured, but this was Bogut we're talking about). If Lee doesn't get injured, Green would still get his minutes and it probably wouldn't take long to realize how much better he was."
"Fair point. Hopefully he’s a secondary facilitator, a roll man, and a screen setter. He can play the Draymond green role in Minnesota because we have Uber talented guards.  That’s the dream at least."
"In what world are old ass Igoudola, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green better perimeter defenders than Paul George, Kawhi, and Pat Bev?  Luka literally made Pat Bev unplayable and Zubac could never see a minute on the court because of Luka.  Luka is a more efficient finisher at the basket, better mid range shooter, better post scorer, and his deep range shooting is as efficient as Harden's."
"Crazy how Draymond Green could’ve easily left the Warriors in many different plausible scenarios because he never got a real shot. And by extension Steph and the team never gets fully unlocked in 2014-2015.   Here if they signed Dwight and Iguodala, Draymond would unlikely to crack the starting lineup or the crunch time line up. If David Lee never got hurt in their championship season, Draymond probably would never crack their starting lineup"
Right but a super team has historically been more about offense. It’s not like if you gave Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert prime draymond green that they’d be considered a super team.
"I think the top 20 is more intresting including the non superstars:  Draymond and Manu are RAPM monsters, but I think when you watch them play they are always having an impact on the game.   |rank|Player|Minutes|ORAPM|DRAPM|RAPM|O Rank|D Rank|Overall Rank| --:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |1|LeBron James|10049|5.38|2.28|7.66|1|17|1| |2|Draymond Green|4332|3.74|3.92|7.66|6|3|1| |3|Manu Ginobili|6075|3.61|3.52|7.13|10|6|3| |4|David Robinson|2137|1.2|4.14|5.34|89|1|4| |5|Kawhi Leonard|3806|2.93|2.09|5.02|15|22|5| |6|Joel Embiid|612|2.13|2.71|4.84|39|11|6| |7|Tim Duncan|9370|1.4|3.31|4.71|71|8|7| |8|Kevin Durant|5598|3.96|0.6|4.56|5|199|8| |9|Kevin Garnett|5158|0.68|3.88|4.56|182|4|8| |10|Stephen Curry|4193|4.12|0.26|4.38|3|332|10| |11|James Harden|4074|4.79|-0.45|4.34|2|951|11| |12|Eric Bledsoe|934|2.77|1.55|4.32|19|54|12| |13|Robert Horry|4243|4|0.12|4.12|4|446|13| |14|P.J.

"lmao this nephew thinks being the best player means he carried. I literally said he was the best player.     Here's an article written by ethan straus  &gt; https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1210575-the-emerging-precarious-oklahoma-city-thunder-dynasty  There are hundreds of articles since 2012 as well about how stacked that team was.   Anybody that was watching ball back then and wasn't just dick riding kd thought that was a future dynasty team. Everyone was talking about how well they drafted and how stacked that team was. Nephew really saying it's just me lmao.   who the fuck said kd was carrying that?  kd cannot lead or carry teams like bron. he has only won with super stacked teams. But apparently you're a full blown clown that thinks bron isn't  a good leader, and that KD was carrying the 2012 thunder, so idk why I'm even wasting my time lol  edit  I actually found a post by the same dude that wrote the 'article' you linked.   &gt; https://kansascity.sbnation.com/kansas-jayhawks/2012/6/18/3093203/2012-nba-mock-draft-oklahoma-city-thunder-linked-to-draymond-green  &gt; ""The Thunder have one of the most stacked rosters in the NBA, which should allow them to take the best talent available."
"When Steph ""playoff underperformer"" Curry, Kevin ""can't carry a team"" Durant, Draymond ""triple single"" Green and Klay ""role player"" Thompson go 16-1 in the playoffs but are apparently all trash"
Draymond Green gave Garland praise as well he is gaining some recognition!
"It is difficult to quantify, but the leadership attribute is definitely a factor.  There is no bigger dog on the Warriors than Green -- he will call out Curry if he needs to, and the team is not deep with that sort of personality type.  Simmons is younger, right in the same range defensively, and a better long-term option from a talent standpoint + age.  But acquisition would cost the warriors resources, chemistry, leadership, and probably some intangibles.  Draymond is just very reliable piece with 100% chemistry with a top 5 player in the NBA."
"Gobert. Capela. Zubac. Boban. All key pieces on their playoff teams. All non shooters.   Steven adams. J Allen. I can go on &amp; on w bigs who can’t shoot, and still add value.   If shooting was as simple as working on it, surely there wouldn’t be too many poor shooters in the league?   Bron and Luka must not work on their free throw shooting since they’re both not good FT shooters. Draymond Green must not be a hard worker since his 3pt shooting has regressed, why doesn’t he simply work on it, so he can become a better shooter?   For every big who can shoot, there’s 5 more who can’t. It’s not normal at all for a big to turn into a shooter.   A big coming into the league as a shooter is completely different than trying to turn a non shooter into one.  Edit: Giannis is also another big that came into the league shooting"
"I don't think it was a coincidence though. Most of these guys would be unplayable in today's game. But with Shaq in the league, you needed guys like this. No way the Warriors could play small ball with Draymond Green at center against Shaq. Teams had to get these types of players which is why many of them were big with moderate skill. They were mountains that Shaq had to climb over or through. One of the reasons we don't have guys like that anymore is because Shaq isn't playing anymore."
i'm with you ... but will simmons buy in   i think simmons would make a great draymond green
"I agree with Richard Jefferson. Love Zach Lowe and KOC and J Kyle Mann. Tim Legler, Hubie Brown, Doris Burke are great listens too. JVG is good when it's just him and Mike Breen in the booth, if Mark Jackson is there, it's unbearable since JVG will just play off Mark Jackson making dumb points. When they make their guest appearances: Draymond Green and Candace Parker."
"Chris Broussard, Doris Burke, Richard Jefferson. And Draymond Green"
Draymond Green is easily one of the most intelligent players in NBA history.   His basketball IQ has been and always will be his greatest skill.
Draymond green during his time on tnt. Really like his takes and sounds like he actually understands the game on a deeper level.   Also Gilbert arenas’ podcast is very interesting. His takes are often unbiased and he doesn’t have that hate for modern players that a lot of older ones have.
"Draymond is proven in their system. Ben isn't proven in any system.  Whilst they do play similar roles, a guy that's not a good shooter but isn't intimidated to shoot in big moment (Green), is vastly more valuable than a guy that's so intimidated by looking bad he refuses to shoot.  All of Ben's issues will follow him to wherever he goes."
"Simmons to Green is a horizontal move *at best*. Not because Simmons is a scrub, a playoff choker or anything else people might say, but simply because Green does so many of the little things that fans don't really pay attention to. He is not only a great defender himself, he is one of the guys who genuinely make others better at the defense end by pointing out stuff that I am sure the ""average"" NBA player misses or notices too late. The Warriors on-off numbers without Draymond speak volumes towards his impact on both ends of the floor.   Simmons might be a better offensive weapon and more athletic, but his IQ is simply not on Draymond's level. This is not meant as disrespect of the man, but if I were asked whom I should entrust the flow of the Warriors as the are right now (because obviously Simmons would need to take the majority of that role; Curry could handle the ball-handling stuff, but he wouldn't be as efficient running a defense), I would take Draymond over Ben any day.  Plus, trading away Draymond after Simmons arrived is a non-starter. Getting back what Draymond is worth to the Warriors would be a tall order even if the Dubs were just trading him for the sake of it; when the FO needs to do so in order to remove a Simmons logjam, the return would most likely be nothing short of atrocious. So anything involving acquiring Simmons by using Green would require the 76ers taking Draymond back in the first place and given as Green would basically cause a different variation of the problem that spoiled the 76ers in the first place, I cannot see Morey having much interest in that either."
Smelly take I'm thinking.  I don't think players have gotten exponentially better.  You ever watch MJ?  The dude did things that nobody now is doing because they just flat out can't.  That same thing can be said for many players from the 80s and 90s.  How many players can dunk like Dawkins or Kemp nowadays?  The only one I can think of is maybe Durant but he doesn't focus on the post.  How many players nowadays annihilate the other team in the post or from 8 foot like the Dream or Shaq?  Even for D and rebounds first there was Rodman and Wallace who were a lot like Draymond Green and Gobert.
"Absolutely not, having Ben Simmons and Draymond Green pretty much do the same thing which is just facilitating the ball on offence (granted to an elite degree) for 3 other players well two if you got rid of Wiggins sounds weird. Having two players play the exact same role for a combined 60 million is crazy, unless Green went back to shooting more and well there's a reason he doesn't shoot anymore and we already know Simmons doesn't want to hurt his ego anymore so he's not shooting the ball either."
I mean he wasn’t as bad in the playoffs as everyone says he was. The team basically crucified and disrespected him. I don’t blame him for not wanting to return to that toxic work environment. Plus he’s not a pg he’s a playmaking 5 in a similar mold to draymond green. It doesn’t work on the 76ers. Trade him and everyone move on.
"Bird’s a 32% 3PT shooter for his career in the playoffs in very low volume, that’s terrible.  Also, a rule of thumb has always been the higher the volume the lower the efficiency so if Bird raised his volume all indications are that he’d be worse.  - I wanna mention Michael Adams too, who was taking 8 3s a game in the same era as Larry Bird.  Notable seasons for Adams:  1.7/4.6 3P on 37%  2/5.5 3P on 37%  2.2/6.1 3P on 36%  He also translated much better into the playoffs compared to Bird.  5/11 46% in the playoffs in his best post season.  Bird’s 3PT is something that runs purely on narrative when it’s never translated into the playoffs and his volume was grossly low to be even considered good.  For anyone that disagrees please look at the numbers and tell me how Bird is even a remotely good 3PT shooter when compared to other guys all time and please no hypotheticals. I’m not trying to here he’d be better because of era because time and time again we’ve seen the higher the volume the lower the efficiency. It’s clear as day Bird was a very overrated 3PT shooter and not an all time great one at all.  **DRAYMOND GREEN has similar career numbers to Larry Bird from 3PT in the playoffs, LeBron has better career 3PT numbers than both.**  Magic&gt;"
"The Cavs 2018 supporting cast was garbage. They were literally the worst defense in history to win a playoff series (much less make the finals). And outside of the Raptors series they weren't good on offense either.  KD would be forced to do a TON defensively on that Cavs team. And instead of getting covered by the likes of Jeff Green, he's now getting guarded by Iggy/Draymond.  Warriors could switch a ton too."
"I think a team of LeBron, Klay, and Draymond + others vs. a team of Durant, Curry and Love + others is decently well matched up, however I still think Curry and company would win. For one, Curry and Durant are simply a better combination than either LeBron and Klay or LeBron and Draymond. As well, 2018 finals Love was more or less a wash compared to either Green or Klay, so there isn't a large enough cap either way to swing the tide with the third option. Additionally, Draymond's offensive skillset would be a little redundant with LeBron, especially considering that two major shooting threats would now be off of the team. Obviously Draymond would still have elite defense, but the removal of a fair chunk of his offensive impact would lessen his value on the court. Finally, the Cavs' supporting cast in 2018 was simply better than the Warriors' was. One of the only improvements the Cavs made in 2018 compared to 2017 was improving their depth. So yeah, the Cavs would be taking that chip."
Draymond Green is definitely not overpaid
"Gilbert Arenas and Draymond Green.  Arenas is great at breaking down the individual decisions and moves that a player makes with the ball in their hands, and Draymond knows positioning, set plays, and defense better than most coaches.  Both are comfortable and fun to watch on camera.  Both have the boldness to go in on guys when they fuck up."
I don’t understand why Wiggins is viewed as an asset.  Simmons was at least part of a 1 seed. The Warriors couldn’t even make the playoffs with Wiggins as their 3 wheel behind Draymond Green and Steph Curry playing like an MVP
"Draymond IS a DPOY winner, and was also a finalist this year like simmons.  Plus Green is not afraid to dunk/layup, FTs and shooting of needed."
Don’t disrespect Thaddeus. He’s legit bro. He’s kind of like a poor man’s Draymond Green
"Because he lacks a lot of the essential skills Draymond Green has.  He doesn't protect the rim, lacks off-ball skills, isn't much of a rebounder, and a bunch of other things that Draymond brings.  If Ben Simmons was like Draymond, he probably wouldn't be on the trading block."
"I don't understand how he doesn't fit perfectly at the 4 spot for a team that already has shooting and solid guards, such as Portland or Minny. The Draymond Green role. Ben is debatably the best perimeter defender in the league and can play a point forward role."
"how? What position would he play? Draymond is a PF, Tobias is a PF. You can't move him down to SF because 1. the 4 is his natural position, and 2. Danny Green plays SF."
"Spacing would be rough, for sure. I can see the logic behind Green for Simmons for sure. But Simmons, Dray, Steph, Klay, and one other shooter (Poole?) makes me wonder... Simmons and Draymond would be a terror defensively. Simmons definitely looked terrified to shoot last playoffs, but he's a terror in transition and he's a smart cutter... Anyways -- highly unlikely Morey likes what the Warriors have in return — I can't see a deal there happening."
Passes the eye test but doesn't put up great stats: Draymond Green or possibly Jrue Holiday(although his stats aren't exactly bad per se)
Draymond Green
"By 538's Player Projections, Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are both categorized as Borderline All-Stars.   Just saying that a swap of them would be interesting.   The Warriors kick the can down a year or two so some of their young players (Kuminga, Wiseman, Moody, Poole) get more experience. Klay already isn't coming back till Christmas. There's no reason to ""chase wins"" this year.   Then you go into next year with Klay having a full offseason under his belt and after playing games, primed and ready to go, and you have a 5 of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Simmons/Wiseman with Kuminga as your 6th man, and he probably slides in for Kuminga as part of the new ""Death Lineup"" with Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Kuminga/Simmons. Wiseman would be in Year 3 and Kuminga would be in Year 2, you could probably start to expect both of them to actually be able to contribute positively on a contender.   As for the Sixers, they probably have the best defensive duo in the league at that point with Embiid and Draymond. And you put your trust in Tyrese Maxey and give him the keys to be the team's #2 option for now and let him spread his wings."
Draymond Green &amp; PJ Tucker poked him in the eye by mistake too lol.
Draymond green is actually good at basketball. My friend refuses to believe he does anything then again he’s the same guy who said the warriors were WORSE with KD on the team after I gave him literal proof not only did the start numbers stay the same klays 3pt percentage went up lmfaooo
"&gt;DRAYMOND GREEN has similar career numbers to Larry Bird from 3PT in the playoffs, LeBron has better career 3PT numbers than both.  This is so dumb its baffling. Draymond benefits from spacing that Bird didn't have. LeBron up to maybe 5 years ago wasnt taken too seriously as a 3 point shooter so teams literally left him open, including in the finals. Numbers can lie."
Draymond Green? (Not saying he's as good as Russell but he's in the same mild of player)
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Good for you Ben, they try and trade you last year after 3 years of quality play and 1 average year. Not everyone has to be a shooter, Draymond green was an all start that can't shoot for shit and helps his team in other ways. Sixers dug their own grave here."
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
Last playoffs AD was healthy he was scoring 26 points on 67% true shooting against actual big men like Jokic/bam and even against solid big wings like pj tucker.    I’m sorry but your small ball against Anthony Davis or Giannis would be complete suicide. Those are the two absolute worst players to try and run small ball against since their teams can go small and still be bigger than you. You just can’t go small against those two unless you have someone like draymond green playing the 5
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"I feel like the guys that are seen as kind of boring for how good they are are probably the best to watch. Like TJ McConnell, Chris Paul, Kyle Anderson, or Draymond Green. Guys that consistently make the right decisions."
"Lol I didn’t think you meant current players. Of today, Draymond Green to watch, to avoid hmm this is tough but outside of just bad players probably physical anomalies like Giannis, KD, Bron. They’re physical gifts give them a huge advantage most wouldn’t have."
Whiteside/Draymond/Covington/Danny Green/Melton?  Gotta go all out defense because this team might not touch 90ppg
"Draymond Green might be a good guy to watch tbh, as long as you don't show his shooting motion lol  He doesn't really do what he does off of elite physical tools(he can defend bigger players and also manages to be a very good playmaker without being a scoring threat)"
Welcome to the paint  We're headed beyond the arc  Battlin out on midrange  When we gotta talk about the restricted area  Set the table and play the horns  A nice evening with Draymond Green
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: Danny Green  SF: Robert Covington  PF: Draymond Green  C: Steven Adams

draymond green for some reason loves playing against portland
Draymond Green: The Ultimate Warrior
"yes. Trae Young === Steph Curry, Bogdonavic === Klay Thompson, and John Collins === Draymond Green. The Hawks have obviously figured out the NBA and will go 74-8 and leave LeOld James in the dust before signing Luka in 2025"
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
"It is possible that the Warriors jump in, as they tried hard for Love in 2014 and didn't know what they had in Draymond Green in 2013, so maybe they trade Klay, a future 1st, and David Lee's corpse for Garnett and Pierce, meaning we see a Klay-IT backcourt, and the Cavs keep Wiggins for 2014-15. Then with no Klay or Draymond on the Warriors, Houston gets to the 2015 finals but gets beat, even though the Cavs had no Kyrie, because Wiggins plays good D on Harden, but Harden doesn't exactly do the same. Then the Cavs sign Paul Millisap in 2015 (because they have leftover space now), draft Elfrid Peyton with the Heat 2015 pick, and win in 2016."
"Putting aside how overused the ""pass-first point guard"" cliche is (nearly every PG in the league these days is a combo guard, and the ones who aren't are guys like Rubio, who aren't good enough to start on good teams anyway), we *have* a pass-first PG. His name is Marcus Smart, he would've been top 30 in assists last year if he'd played enough to qualify, and the only reason he's been playing the two-guard is because we've had a star-level PG since his sophomore year. And don't give me that ""he takes too many bad shots to be a pass-first PG"" crap— the only guy who averaged *more* assists than him last year while taking *fewer* shots per game were Draymond Green, Ricky Rubio, Ben Simmons, and TJ McConnell."
"PG: Steph (super star), his gravity and scoring is unmatched  SG: Shai? I'm not sure here... duncan Robison? Bridges? I'm thinking shooter that gets the job done when defense is swarming KD and curry.  SF: KD (super star), I picked him because this also take him away from being on another team  PF: Draymond Green(all-star), facilitate the ball and the team well.  C: Rudy Gobert (all-star) great defense and help grab boards  -----  Note: If you dont consider draymond all-star then SG really open up the room for tons of people. Since rule says no injury, I pick Klay... gets the job done and already mesh well with most of the team. This goes to show how stacked the warriors team was."
"KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Javalle McGee  Andre Iguodala, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris, Thybulle"
"I'm just an NBA fan with no favorite team so Im gonna list several teams that I follow  - Bucks: losing Tucker stink. And Nets may be healthy. Still the title favorite if one of the Nets trio is injured  - Nets: losing Green stink since he is one of the best defender on Nets last year. And the trio are most likely turned into a duo in the offseason with their injury history, making Bucks title favorite if it happen.  - Lakers: AD and LeBron injury is a big question mark going into the offseason. And even if they are healthy, the Nets or the Bucks are still favorite to win it unless they got some injuries on their roster  - Heats: Shooting is a problem for this team if they want to roll out their best defense lineup. Herro need to regain his bubble form if the Heat want to win it all since they desperately need firepower to compete with the Nets and the Bucks  - 76ers: Barring some unforseen twist of fates, their chance of a championship is close to 0. Embiid is good, but Embiid without help gonna fold badly in the clutch.  - Suns: They got good injury luck last year, unless they got the same luck again, highly doubt they can make it back much less winning against whoever coming out of the East if both side are relatively healthy.  - Jazz: Sorry but the Jazz choked a 3-1 lead in the bubble and choked against a Clippers without Kawhi. Until they manage to consistently win against weaker teams or close out games in the playoff, they arent gonna be in the Final much less winning it.   - Warriors: Klay is a big question marks, Draymond scoring ability continue to regress, the rookies are not proven, the benchs are a ghost compare to the 14-16 period. Gonna take a lot of luck for them to win the chip.  - Clippers: Kawhi out for the regular season. PG may not remain healthy enough into the offseason. Conference Final again would be good for them tbh."
I know for me it was a hateful respect. Like I don't like Marcus Smart. I don't like Draymond Green. I didn't like LeBron. But if any of those players came to the Lakers they would be my favorite players.  The same with Rondo as well.
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
"PG: Chris Paul, Davion Mitchell SG: Devin Booker, Lu Dort SF: Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac PF: Draymond Green, Christian Wood C:   Joel Embiid, Al Horford"
LOL @ all dem nephews telling me that scrub Draymond Green would shut down a prime Shaq
is that patrick beverley running at draymond green? yea i’d rather him pass it out to an open ariza tf
"Not sure about 82-0, but I think this could be close:  KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and some role players like Andre Iguodala but younger"
"PG: Stephen Curry (All-Star)  SG: Klay Thompson (All-Star)  SF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  PF: Kevin Durant (Superstar)  C: Draymond Green (Hasn’t been an All-Star in 3 years, probably never will be again)   So basically the Warriors plus Kawhi lol"
"PG: Steph Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  Bench: RoCo, Issac, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, Myles Turner, Andrew Wiggins, MPJ  My starting lineup is just the 2017 Warriors except I upgraded Klay to PG, downgraded KD to Tatum, and gave them AD to completely destroy their biggest weakness  My bench is just valuable role players mostly 3 and D and Lamelo and MPJ to boost the offense  Gave myself an extra challenge of not putting any borderline stars in here like Fox and SGA. MPJ is the closest and I don’t believe he’s on the other guys level"
"PG: Jrue Holiday (All Star)  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Paul George (All Star)  PF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  C: Jokic (Superstar)  Bench Dejounte Murray, G  Jalen Brunson, G  Mikal Bridges, F  Matisse Thybulle, F  Joe Ingles, F  Draymond Green, F/C  Clint Capela, C"
"Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marcus smart? My bias wants to say Kyle Lowry is different but these guys all hype the shit outta teammates and are annoying as hell to anyone who isn't but also they're going back you up or pull you out of any situations  Edit: saw someone say Steven Adams, that's probably the guy"
"It’s almost as if being tall and being able to defend 1-5 is a big asset. Look at the DPOY runner ups this year: Ben Simmons and Draymond Green.   Curry is short and not scrappy so he’s a walking mismatch and a defensive liability. That’s why he gets targeted on defense every playoff series.   Sorry to break it to you but yeah Magic was much, much better on defense."
"You gotta split LeBron’s career in 2 main pieces:   •Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  •Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron’s greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"Here's the thing with that: Almost every great player has a super team.   Magic was drafted by a team with Kareem and Norm Nixon. Then got Cooper, Worthy, AC Green, and Bryon Scott.   That's a super team. There's at least 3 HOFers on that team.  Bird played with Parish, McHale, DJ, and Ainge, and had Walton coming off the bench.   That's a super team.  Kobe was a rookie on a team that had THREE All-Stars (Shaq, Eddie Jones, and Nick Van EXel). Then they swapped one out for Glen Rice and Horry and Fox. Then later he got Gasol, Bynum, and Odom.  That's a super team.   They were just lucky that their franchises put together a super team and they didn't have to.   Had Bird been drafted by the Cavs... that would not have been pretty.   Has Magic been drafted by the Bulls at the time... that would not have been pretty.   Had Kobe gone to Charlotte... people wouldn't be talking about Kobe the same way they do now.   And Jordan had to wait several seasons before his team put him in a place where he could contend. He finally had Pippen and Grant (and Cartwright is a grossly underrated pieced given the importance of his defense on Ewing).   Then Jordan got reloaded with Pippen, Rodman, Toni, and Harper.   &amp;#x200B;  In Cleveland, LeBron started in the basement. He NEVER had a player as good as Pippen in his first stint there. And he STILL got to the finals.   Then he took matters into his own hands.   When I look at the Heat, and where Bosh and Wade were in their careers, I'd say that I'd take Magic or Bird's supporting cast over his any day of the week.   And yet, people aren't dismissive of Magic and Bird by saying ""Yeah... but they played on super teams.""  And had the Warriors not signed KD, they'd have only had one title. The difference between the Warriors and Cleveland is that the Warriors knew what they were doing: Curry, Klay, Barnes, Draymond... trades for Bogut. Cleveland got Mo Williams and a Shaq they picked up at Play-It-Again Sports."
"Suggs has a raw shooting finishing and ball handling? And is a great defensive prospect with good athleticism.   Barnes is the same just slightly worse at shooting and ball handling but a much better touch around the rim. being taller and longer helps.  Now on the comparisons. You are literally comparing guys with two different heights with the same skillset. And saying oh they not the same cos they arnt the same height.  Suggs could end very much like draymond green, draymond green is very much like a pg with his playmaking abilities. Just because they arnt the same height doesnt mean they cant have the same playstyle.   Suggs isnt a prolific scorer he averaged 14/4. When its point guard compared to a power forward with a massive difference in usage than its not a big gap."
"&gt;No other unanimous Finals MVP,   Probably a lot of these, tbh... But Steph is certainly *not* one of them.  &gt;no one else led a 73-win team,   Kerr and Draymond Green have as much claim as being the leader as Steph does.  &gt;no one else has his shooting records, etc.   All of those records will be broken. He is just playing at a time that the league was already undergoing a shift in this direction, which completely counters your flawed idea that  &gt; He also ushered in the current era.  It was here before Steph. Casual fans just don't recognize the first steps that were being taken for 20 years prior."
No excuses man. You think Draymond green or big baby Glen Davis is ever in shape? Haha losing is losing.
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
Draymond Green was right on 7ppg this year
"I think Draymond gives KG a run for his money in the best communicator and help defender ever category. Overall defender for me has to be Hakeem though. The man was a much better rim defender than KG and Green, better at guarding bigger post players too, while being just as good at sliding his feet on switches. He was also so good at stealing the ball on lazy post entry passes or cross court passes. So you always had to be aware with Hakeem around. Absurdly quick hands and feet, great motor and competitive drive. If we are talking about effectiveness overall, then it has to be Bill Russell. No one player had as big an impact on their teams defense as Russell did for those Celtics teams."
"Both of them need to study the Draymond Green screen tapes. That's how non shooters survive in this current era. Especially at the 1, since PG screens seems to throw every team off.  Also, to answer the question, no I don't think it would."
"Tell me you don't watch the mavs eithout telling me you don't watch me mavs.  1. About the passes and ball possesion. What the fuck, do you even know basketbal? Draymond green has this many passes per minutes, becouse he is a differend type of player. Hi passes to steph or to open shooter. He doesn't bring the ball over the halfcourt. Steph does that.   Do you even watch, how many open 3s from his passes don't connect?  When mavs are hitting 3s, he has around 13 passes easy. When they have a night of, his still has around 7.    &gt;Does he need to hold the ball that much?  Yes. But he doesn't want to. We desperadly need a secon ball handler.  Who would organise the office if it him? Brunson does, he is not bad, but he can't adjust very well when the switch. And certantly not enough to give luka a break.  &gt;, I am talking about the NBA and how stats are inflate  I know they are, blook ar hard 2 seasons back. I din't say his stats aren't inflated, but nit assists. Rebounds sure.  When KP gets his rebounds, luka averages 2 less per game.    &gt;have the highest usage rate I’ve seen in the past 10 years  As I said, the mavs fall apart, this preseason, he played off ball, and made a 2 nice catch and shoot 3s.    He is beyond perfect, his conditioning is garbage for an superstar and his ""good 3pt%=bad FT or. Vice versa"" playstyle is soemtimes hard to watch, but his playmaking is elite.  But comparing him ti draymond green, whose role is nothing like lukas, is just wrong."
Draymond Green is very underrated now for sure. But your stat can be useful but also deceiving. Some of these teams are built around a heliocentric player because they are THAT good and THAT efficient.   Just like any other stat it’s a two sided coin
I got a hot take.  Pair De’Aaron Fox and Draymond Green in a Skip/Shannon like undisputed show.
That Draymond Green is ass and that Ben Simmons is better than Joel Embiid. Really bought into the “triple single” crap and severely overvalued Ben being able to play multiple position
"Renee Montgomery, Draymond Green, and CJ McCollum would make a great trio of color analysts to replace Chuck, Shaq, and Kenny in 10 years or so. Three entertaining, intelligent, well spoken people who have shown they have a natural gift for broadcasting, public speaking, and realtime NBA analysis when they've had an opportunity to do it. Plus you get coverage from a ballhandler, a wing, and a big. Draymond and Montgomery are also similarly accomplished to the current panelists, with multiple rings and personal accolades. Though CJ is not quite in that group. I dunno how much it matters. Getting the WNBA perspective from Renee would be interesting, but she is also more than qualified to analyze the NBA and has demonstrated that pretty thoroughly.  I don't know how you go about picking a replacement Ernie."
-	Blake Griffin as Shaq (although I think Shaq will stick around for many years)  -	Candace Parker or Dwyane Wade as Jet (prefer Candace) -	Draymond Green as Chuck -	I don’t really know who could replace EJ. Haven’t seen any Turner Sports people that have the mix of seriousness and humor he has.
"CJ McCollum, Chris Bosh, D Wade, Giannis, Danny Green, Fred VanVleet, Draymond, Klay, Steph all have future/expanded roles in TV if they want it. All funny, accomplished, insightful and likeable players"
"Draymond, Candace, JJ, and either Malika Andrews for the Ernie-role or Danny Green"
"1- New Jersey Nets acquired Gerald Wallace in exchange for Shawne Williams, Mehmet Okur and a top 3 protected 2012 pick.  Wallace was then traded in the KG/Pierce trade to Celtics of 2013. Okur and Williams never played a game for Portland. BUT that 2012 first round pick became Damian Lillard.  2- New Jersey Nets acquired Brandan Wright and Dan Gazduric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second round pick.  Troy Murphy was immediately bought out by the Warriors. Wright and Gazduric played a combined 30 games for the Nets before signing new contracts in the next off season. Warriors used that second round pick to select Draymond Green."
"RAPTOR isn't very reliable lol  They picked the Harden Rockets to win every year because their algorithm had him as basically so good he made even LeBron look like a scrub  They thought they were going to beat the Lakers in the bubble lmao  It also has team effects built in way too much, I remember they used to have Draymond Green as a top 3 player in the league because his offense stats got boosted from sharing his minutes with Steph"
"KD, Klay, and Steph happened lol. Not to mention Draymond Green."

Draymond Green. He just always seems like a jerk on and off rhe court.
"Lebron is protected by the NBA and the politics of the league. He would get ejected in every NBA game if he were Draymond Green, with the way he complains and stares down refs every game."
"If I had never heard of Draymond Green and you told the story of his whole arc as a pro without giving me a name--- dominant, super skilled, undersized college big with questions about athleticism and conditioning... long arms... super vocal leader... goes to the NBA and just kind of invents a new position... becomes an elite defender, passer, and glue guy... I'd probably have assumed you were describing **Dejuan Blair.**"
"He’s a top 3 defender in the league and only 25. He’s pretty special he’s just not lebron, more like a draymond green in a 6’10 point forwards body"
"I remember being absolutely LIVID we didn't draft Quincy Miller in 2012. I thought he might be a lite version of Durant, like what MPJ is now. Turns out I should've been madder about missing on Draymond Green or Khris Middleton for Jeff Taylor. Turns out Quincy Miller wasn't even the best Quincy picked in the late 30s of that draft..."
"""Bird, Magic, Jordan, Pippen, Draymond Green, Danny Green, AC Green, Giannis, Thanasis, Kostas, Simmons, Embiid, Fultz"""
"Man, reading is fundamental...  &gt; how some people can justify klay over dray all time.  This is in comparison to Draymond Green, who is one of the most impactful and versatile defenders ever. He's also a far more impactful passer than Klay has ever been. So when comparing Klay to Dray, if you're gonna argue for Klay OVER Dray, scoring is your only real argument."
I was very surprised when draft scouts at the combine started throwing out Magic Johnson and Draymond Green.  A lot of it was apparently 'personality-based and he was called highly intelligent and 'magnetic' like Johnson.  Not a hard comparison to live up to or anything lol
"Oh yeah, Draymond Green!"
"Barkley isn't wrong.  When you have soft ass players trying to get traded with 4 years remaining because they can't deal with the deserved criticism things are going to get ugly.  The dude just quit playing the most important part of the game which is getting buckets.  He is like a worse version of Draymond Green in terms of disregarding the most important phase of the game and costing his team.  I say this as someone who absolutely loves defense and facilitating.  I grew up watching Magic, Stockton, and Payton."
Think Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green hybrid   Kidding but he’s second round pick out of Alabama from this year’s draft. Backup PF but getting run with Zion/Hart out. He’s earned minutes though for sure with his defense. His nickname is NOT ON HERB
"God damn what a great game. Caruso had some clutch defensive plays in the 4th. And of course DeMar hits a mid range EVERY time we seem to gain some momentum.   I really want to see FVV run the PnR with Scottie Barnes, and have him make the decision to either drive or pass from the high post like Draymond Green. I feel like he's standing around too much on the offensive end, and this should be a good way to make use of his playmaking abilities."
Hey we can't all have Draymond Green on our team.
"I mean, Simmons looks like the jackass here. Dude got his feelings hurt because Doc said he wasn't sure if he was a Championship winning Point Guard despite not even trying to develop a Draymond Green-level passable threat of shooting and making a three pointer."
"You don't ""keep bringing up statistics or strategies"". You referenced numbers I brought up, and still Gasol had better defensive numbers but the difference wasn't big enough so you said they were essentially the same...so then you talked about offensive numbers and Serge. You also just keep repeating the same thing, he's versatile (the first versatile defender in NBA history I guess).  He isn't better than any of those defenders, and you know it, so now you want it to be about about what era he's in despite the comment that he's a top 10 defender all time...regardless, he still isn't better.  You would take Draymond Green over Bill Russell and claim I don't know enough about basketball. Go have fun with your crack, goodbye."
"In what universe was Draymond Green the #2 or #3 while Klay was #3 &amp; #4?!?!? They have different roles and skillsets but the easy answer is Klay. He's the greatest off ball, catch and shoot player in NBA history. Draymond's record, and overall horrendous performance that year without Steph, Klay &amp; KD kinda told me everything I need to know."
I think it’s time to be seriously concerned about Draymond Green
Draymond Green is a straight up overrated player at this point. He's still living on his reputation from 2016. 22 million dollar boat anchor.
Draymond Green and Kristaps Porzingis
He's been awesome.  I like how you could see he earned Coach Willie Green's trust very early on in summer league and it's now carried on into regular season after Josh Hart went down.  Coach also liked to run some of his old GSW/Draymond Green plays for him in SL.
"Maybe. I'm not sure they should be on the list either.  There's better Golden State Warriors than Klay Thompson...Chris Mullin, Draymond Green and maybe Tim Hardaway too."
Draymond Green*
"This got me thinking, what if we combined Draymond Green and Klay Thompson? Greatest player of all time?"
Draymond Green has 50/50/50 shooting splits right now
"Juan ""Draymond Green"" Toscano-Anderson"
"Here you are, your honor.     [https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html)     Here is the same stats from 2019 against Philly. Check out Embid's series stats. They're terrible. He was shut down by Gasol.     [https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-76ers-vs-raptors.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-76ers-vs-raptors.html)     Draymond isn't in the top 10 players defensively all time.  That's the bottom line for me. Both Gasol and Green are great defensive players."
Pau Gasol and Drayomond Green over Anthony Davis is ridiculous.   You think if the 2015-2019 Warriros had swapped Draymond for AD they'd be worse??? Lmao you think the Pelicans led by Dray he would have averaged 30/13/5 and finished runner up for MVP?  I don't know how anyone with eyes who watched the NBA over the last 10 years could ever come to the conclusion that guys like Dray are better than AD.
"He's injured, which can happen, but we have a big who's not actually worse than some of the other bigs we've had to trot out.  He was raw as hell but he improved rapidly last season. Now he's being coached by the guy who taught Jokic how to play basketball and getting mentored by Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.  It's way too soon to judge a player who had to go into his rookie year **with no training camp** and having played 3 games since high school."
"Gasol has better advanced stats, The Raptors won and Green had to play more because the Raptors were a far deeper team despite the idea among most that it was all Kawai. Gasol struggled offensively.     Gasol was stellar against Milwaukee, Philly and Orlando also. He had a better playoffs than Draymond, 100%.     Your last paragraph is a bit crazy."
"Could you explain why you think that? Because the eye and numbers test doesn't really support it. Gasol played by far the least minutes of any Raptors starter in large part because he struggled to keep up switching with smaller players. This is despite being surrounded with elite perimeter players to give him help like Leonard, Lowry, Siakam and Green (that team was stacked defensively). In a tight series that easily could have gone 7, Draymond anchored a defense with awful defenders like Cousins, Quinn Cook, and 35 year old Iggy playing big minutes. Draymond also played 75 more minutes than Gasol that series, while leading both teams in assists by a wide margin (I know we're discussing defense, but carrying a defense while leading a team on offense is insane).   &amp;#x200B;  To summarize, Draymond and Curry nearly forced the series to 7 dominating on offense and defense, while Gasol was a great role-player who protected the rim and stretched the floor, but was 5th on his team in total minutes. I don't see how this is a comparison at all."
"Green interviewing Durant a few months back is a good watch. They end up sort of jointly claiming it was the way Kerr and Warriors management approached their argument that played a big part in Durant bailing. I think it sounds fishy to me, and more like ""we're going to blame these people instead of, maybe, ourselves for how things went down.""  [https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/18/kurtenbach-draymond-green-kevin-durant-couldnt-help-but-tell-the-truth-about-the-warriors-breakup/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/18/kurtenbach-draymond-green-kevin-durant-couldnt-help-but-tell-the-truth-about-the-warriors-breakup/)  TBH I feel like KD was looking for some kind of cred in his career that going to GS, and winning titles there, didn't provide, and he may have actually thought it hurt him cause he was teaming up w/ proven, extant stars. Still dogged internally from not getting it done with OKC, for some reason. He was such an incredible fit with not only the Warriors' players but their system that I will never truly understand why he bailed."
"Why is it a weird example? Sure he was on those pistons but he was more of a role player during those teams. I’m not saying they’re identical players but their values on some of them best teams of all time are similar.  [I’m not the only guy to make the comparison, someone who’s had a front row seat for both has.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steve-kerr-compares-draymond-green-dennis-rodman-skill-sets)"
No then while the referee is distracted by the feather your tag team partner comes onto the court with a steel chair and Draymond Green joins the nWo.
"Both of them don't come even close to top 75 of ALL TIME. Wtf is this recency bias, how the fuck can anyone think there weren't 75 better players in the entire history of the NBA than Draymond fucking Green."
Draymond Green saved them last year after Ja got bumped going up for a dunk by Poole.
"Yea end of the day draymond green can’t change a series by himself. He needs players with ball skill or else he is useless. He could never get u 60 with no dribbles, or take over a game and lead u to victory. If he’s not doing supplemental things he’s useless."
Draymond Green. Only muh 20 PPG casuals think Thompson was better or more important for their playoff runs
Wiseman averaged more in his rookie season than Mcgee has in his whole career lol. You drafted a lower ceiling draymond green lol so you better hope Obunga Anunoby can learn to create his own shot
"But they **didn’t**. That’s just the facts my friend. None of the players from the 90s have enough shooting to be good players today. If you just magically give huge skill boosts to the 90s players, then don’t give the same type of boost to the modern players, what kind of nonsense comparison are you making? The whole point here is we are comparing the players as they were. As they were, Jordan would be a pretty shit shooter by today’s standards. He is a career 32% 3pt shooter. He is in the same category of shooters as guys like Lonzo Ball, DeMar DeRozan, or Draymond Green. Jordan is a guard type player who makes his buckets in the midrange. It’s just simply trash skills by today’s standards. It doesn’t matter how good you are at taking midrange pull-ups, they are not good shots compared to 3s."
It's like they caught a wild Draymond Green in the wild but it was Hasty natured..  LeBron playing off-ball in the pick in roll is something I'd never see in my lifetime-- maybe it'll take more than 2 games to adjust to.
Draymond Green
"Depends on the star. Steph Curry gets mauled and rarely gets the calls. Draymond Green got smacked in the face last game and it wasn't even reviewed. Back when he was a star Blake Griffin got screwed all the time on calls, and don't even mention this stuff in the vicinity of Nuggets fans if you don't want to hear them complain for like an hour about Jokic.  But the times when the call *isn't made and should be* don't justify it going uncalled at other times when it should be called."
Porzingis turns into Draymond Green inside the arc
"They won literally because AD played free safety. I have no idea how anyone could come to the conclusion that Lebron was better. Lebron is good, but when AD's defense is turned up he's a 6'10 Draymond Green who can score and put your team into foul trouble."
"There’s one thing preventing me from agreeing with you.   How the hell would they stop Jordan?   If they’re playing small ball, Jordan would need to, and would be putting up 60+ per game to win. I believe any team with Jordan (or Iverson) in their prime would be able to beat that Warriors team in 7.   These guys knew how to get to the basket against much better paint defenders than what that Warriors team had.   I’m probably biased because of my age, but MJ was so nimble near the basket, and that’s before we get to his fadeaway. Who’s stopping him? What lineup prevents Michael Fucking Jordan from getting to the rim at will?   Maybe they just fill up the paint and force MJ to pass take advantage of the Bulls lack of perimeter shooters, but I don’t believe that would work. We’re talking about Jordan!   It’s amazing how todays bigs are so agile, but it’s Jordan! I find it hard to believe that Draymond Green or KD could stop Jordan consistently in a 7 game series.   Not to mention how easy Jordan would find it to draw fouls. His abilities are what transfer, not his record. I’m talking body and ball control.   I meant to be open minded, but as I tried to explain my point I dug in deeper. Still would love to hear some thought about defensive schemes they could run that would stop Jordan."
Ben Wallace is a lot better of a player than draymond green lol and is a very fringe hofer. Draymond literally is more likely not going to make it. He currently has about 40% odds
"Draymond Green is undoubtedly HOF bound, its legit not even a debate.   And so what? Ben Wallace is an awesome player, your original point of anyone worse than Draymond taken in the lottery would be a bust is just flat out untrue"
"If draymond green never played with Steph curry and wasn’t American, he wouldn’t have any championships, no gold medals, and probably would have fewer asg and all defence appearances. It isn’t that he isn’t a decorated veteran, it’s that to say scottie’s ceiling is draymond green is just rude and untrue. He has the potential to be far better than draymond.   Hell, Greens career high is 31 points. Scottie already almost matched that in his second game. There is no way he doesn’t develop a far superior offensive game to draymond."
"What's also funny is that the player who was tied with Chris Paul in assists/game last season will end up with almost 20,000 fewer points than Chris Paul (Draymond Green)."
Draymond green was voted the most overrated player by actual NBA players lol
Dj should not even be in a NBA rotation let alone start. I don't get why Ad couldn't start against the warriors like he cant handle 6ft5 Draymond green?
"Draymond Green is HOF. Raptors fans are fuckin delusional, and this trend continues"
Draymond green is a system player and never should have been an all star. He is not a two way player in that he only brings positive value on defence
"Defense and playmaking is part of the game. Draymond green is vastly superior in those aspects, their impact metrics aren't even close, in any season and in any lineup, with or without Durant."
"You know what you're saying. CP3, Garnett, Manu and Draymond Green are criminally underrated."
"Draymond green is a role player. He fills his role very well, he might be the best role player of all time, but he is absolutely a role player. Draymond green had his chance to prove that he was good without those two and led his team to the worst record in the nba. He is miles closer to a Steve Kerr than michale Jordan and he would have zero rings and maybe wouldn’t even have a place in the league if he didn’t end up in the circumstances that he did."
thats why I think (or hope) you're trolling. and not that dumb or ignorant. NO SHIT DUDE. LOL. the whole point is **draymond green** is not a steve kerr. duhhh. draymond green is somebody who just happened to be on a team that won rings. do we really have to spell this out for you? draymond green. is not. a role player. he was absolutely indispensable in all the warrior's success. the whole point is its stupid and disingenuous to pretend that he's some scrub who lucked his way into rings.
PG: Stephen Curry (37)  SG: Klay Thompson (35)  SF: Lebron James (40)  PF: Draymond Green (35)  C: Brook Lopez (37)  Brook looks like the best C who will be old and washed just in time to join this super team.  Who would the bench be?
"I hate that the discourse is that if you suggest someone isn't one of the 75 best players of all time someone's gonna get mad as if that's hating them. No, I don't think Draymond Green was worthy of top 75."
That Draymond Green was the best playoff performer from 2014-2019?? **lmao** pass the koolaid bruh
Does he really have to explain why Anthony fucking Davis should be considered a greater all-time player than draymond green?!? This is like the Robert horry 8 rings argument too many people that don’t understand how hard it is to win a title.
"Okay that's true, but this is also a disingenuous reply because it's fucking Draymond Green. If you ask people whose the Warrior's big three, are they gonna say fucking Ian Clark?"
He turns into steph against the blazers in the playoffs   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=draymond+green+3+point%25+against+blazers+in+the+playoffs
"Well it’s clear Steph is reliant on Draymond. Remember in the Finals when Dray got suspended &amp; Curry was only able to put up 8 points?   Draymond and Curry need each other, it’s silly to act otherwise. Defensively Dray can guard anyone so it’s easy to hide Curry, and offensively Steph needs Dray to screen, cut, space, and obviously set him up for open looks. In general, Golden State outscores opponents by 20.1 points per 100 possessions with Curry and Green on the floor. With Curry and without Green, it’s only +1.0.  I just think Draymond is incredibly disrespected by everyone, even Warriors fans. I’m not a GS fan but in his prime that man was a superstar the same way Ben Wallace was. There are barely any players in NBA history that possess his versatile defence, insane passing vision, and basketball IQ. His game is wayyy deeper than just looking at stats, he was the heart &amp; soul of arguably the greatest team in history."
"That latter point is key. Defense is a team sport, especially in an era with switch heavy and help-heavy defenses. For the Warriors in particular, playing that team concept is critical because it allows them to maximize their best defender in Draymond Green. There’s nothing wrong with playing defense in that team concept. It’s all about executing the scheme there and Steph certainly fits that."
"Oh yeah, the reason why a bunch of career sharp shooters made 3s is because some other dude stood 20 feet away unable to shoot more than 3 feet from the basket. It’s the same reason draymond green is why steph curry and klay are great 3pt shooters. It’s hilarious to since you’re arguing it’s some incredible inside out design with Dwight as the focal point when he was a horrendous playmaker and poor passer as a big man. They got him open not the other way around. Some of us actually watched those games and actually understood what they were watching. The motion in that offense had far more focus on the perimeter than some traditional inside out game. They were more like the 2014 Spurs than 2001 lakers."
"Calling Dray’s offence non-existent is a flat out disservice to his importance on one of the greatest teams of all time. Draymond is the reason Curry’s able to put up 30ppg, his offence consists of making everyone around him better. He’s basically a point guard. AD is nowhere near the playmaker he is, the defender he is, or the career that he has. AD never even shot the ball as well as Green has in his prime"
"It's not Steph's fault that he was born privileged, but it's hard to get excited when the guy whose NBA star dad had trained him from his pre-teen years with the best possible coaching, facilities, equipment, etc. succeeds. You know who makes me feel good? Giannis. And Jimmy Butler. And even Draymond. Or a few hundred other guys before I'd get all emotional about Steph and Klay. I'm not criticizing them; they're great. They're just a boring story.   You probably thought that Shooter McGavin was robbed of his green jacket, too."

Draymond green??
Draymond Green looks like the deez nuts guy.
PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Mikal Bridges  SF: Tobias Harris  PF: Draymond Green  C: Nikola Jokic  This team can switch on anyone for defense and almost everyone is a spot up shooter.
"Anthony Slater  @anthonyVslater 1m Jordan Poole now 4-of-14 FG with seven turnovers, just missed a pair of wild layups in traffic and started to yell at the refs for the no-calls after the whistle. Draymond Green tells him to ""calm down."" He just threw a towel in the huddle in frustration."
Jrue Holiday  CJ McCollum  Mikal Bridges  Draymond Green  Nikola Jokic
Klay isn't close to Pippen as a player. Draymond Green was the 2nd best player on the Warriors from 14-16. Then it was KD.
You act like you should be able to trade a version of ben with a jumpshot. He aint got one or is getting one. So what you are trading is a young draymond green more athleticism less leadership.   Maybe reasonable value Ben and trade for hos actual value and there will be plenty of options.   You are trying to trade a 2nd round exit for a championship without offering any picks or something of value how the fuck does that make sense?
"He has been a really good defensive player since he entered the league. That's the issue, he doesn't put in work/show improvement on the weak parts of his game. Nobody is expecting him to become a sharpshooter, just someone who can hit an open 3 once in a while. We've seen plenty of players with non existent jumpers develop SOMETHING. He hasn't developed anything.   I don't think Philly fans or the front office expect him to be a 1-2 scoring option. That's why they gave Tobias Harris a big contract (who also has his issues in the playoffs). But someone like Draymond Green has shown you can be a productive offensive player despite being a bad shooter/scorer. Simmons was unplayable in the 4th quarters in last years playoffs. That's unacceptable and fans have the right to be upset when again, this is largely due to him not getting better at the weak parts of his game"
Yes they do. Ben is great with the ball in his hand in a spread out offense. If you put him in a Draymond green type role he could be more than enough offensively and he’s good enough defensively to make up for it
"I feel like it's not even about him playing better. Simmon's effort and mental strength has been challenged. Draymond Green is absolutely ass on offense, yet fans love him because no one can question his leadership and effort on the court. I feel like Simmon's dug too big of a hole, and respect is offically lost with his teammates."
"Damn, he looked amazing. I wasn’t the biggest Mobley guy coming out of college (thought he was an excellent prospect but I had him behind Cade/green and even Suggs), but if I’m a Cavs fan I’m stoked. I kinda thought his ceiling was like a draymond green type (all-star who is more of a support player) but I have to rethink that. Why can’t he develop into an AD type? Only one game but gotta love what you see Cavs fans"
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"
Haha sorry!! Meant a play making 4. Draymond Green style.
This is probably worse than when Draymond Green got ejected (2nd tech) for telling at his own teammate last season.
"locks...   Giannis, Durant, Kobe, Wade, Nowitzki, Nash, Lebron, Kidd, Curry, Duncan, KG, AI, CP3, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Bob McAdoo, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard  decent chance but might not make it  Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony, Klay Thompson, Adrien Dantley, Tmac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kyle Lowry, Amare Stoudemire, Dominique Wilkins, Draymond Green   No shot but should get considered  Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Yao Ming, Ron Artest, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Joe Dumars, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, Derrick Rose  Should just fall off the list  Pete Maravich, Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens, Hal Greer, George Gervin, Jerry Lucas, Robert Parrish, Nate Thurmond, Tiny Archibald"
"In 2015 and 2016, the only real scorers were Curry and Klay. The other all-star was the notable scorer Draymond Green. If Curry wasn't the one getting the leads for the Warriors, than Klay must be an MVP caliber player."
"They're just so different. And yes while Curry is a PG, his off ball style breaks the mold so hard that he might as well be a SG. Curry's game was molded by the Warrior's motion offense scheme, and more importantly, having one of the most swiss army knife players of all time in Draymond Green, who is functionally the PG for much of the game. I kind of feel like Curry is a PG in the way LeBron is a PG. They're great playmakers, but truly they are another position. Chris Paul is a true, true PG, he controls the game."
Neh that honour is for draymond green but mikal bridges should be top3 in votings imo
Must be nice to play with a guy who can make 11 threes in an elimination game  Instead imagine being on a team with such horrible spacing that DRAYMOND GREEN that year would have been easily the 2nd best shooter
Draymond Green
"i just feel rodmen was able to impact the game than green but i dont mean green doesn't do the same. rodmen feels like a good flex seal to plug up a hole while i dont feel that with draymond, draymond feels like a lesser version of it because i dont get any confidence when he attacks the rim."
The way Draymond can still shut down Ayton is amazing. Green is a defensive beast
And Draymond Green likes you
Hot take: I've always liked Draymond Green
"&gt; ""You know, why does Draymond Green get to run up the court and say [N-word],"" Sarver, who is white, allegedly said, repeating the N-word several times in a row.  &gt; ""You can't say that,"" Watson, who is Black and Hispanic, told Sarver.  &gt; ""Why?"" Sarver replied. ""Draymond Green says [N-word].""  &gt; ""You can't f---ing say that,"" Watson said again.  Shit was like it came straight out of the Boondocks."
"They've really needed a high energy guy who... I don't mean this as harshly as it sounds, or maybe I do, but who still has hope and optimism and hasn't been beaten down and broken by years of playing in Minnesota.  Like, that franchise has been toxic for years, and what it's needed is to have some good vets but also a young guy who still thinks there's more to playing for the Timberwolves than endless losing.  Because that's a change that con only manifest if *someone believes it's possible*.  They finally seem to have a decent coach, KAT is still good, D'Angelo Russell's claim to have soaked up everything he could about being a defensive floor general from Draymond Green is looking extremely valid, they've suddenly got the pieces to be...  Dare I say it...  #Spooky."
"""Too far in the playoffs"" I think needs a bit of definition. I mean, he literally won a playoff series last year against a fully healthy Portland team with a worse team than this year's team. They started Austin Rivers and Facu Campazzo for the first 4 games of the series until Monte Morris was healthy enough to start in games 5 and 6. Like, he's already proven he can do it. And they've been top 3 in the west each of the last 3 years - the only team which can say that in the West. He's just that good.   The Nuggets on their losing streak were missing their top 3 players, it'd be like if the Dubs were without not just Curry/Klay but also Draymond Green... and Jordan Poole, given that the Nuggets were also without Bones. Of course they went 0-fer in that stretch.   Now both guys are back and they pounded the Heat, they're back on track, and only a game out of 4th place. The entire middle of the west is super packed together right now... so I think they'll still end up top 4, and maybe they'll even catch Utah (that's a bit less likely, but Utah isnt that far ahead really, just a couple games)."
"But what is your definition of basketball talent and ability?   Because for example I’d have draymond green over kyrie for both peak and career - yet I’m sure many would say he’s less ‘talented’ but then why is talent usually only considered to be your jumpshot, handles, and finishing package?   It’s a similar argument as when someone says a player is more talented or better in a vacuum than another, but acknowledges that the other player is more impactful (2016 griffin vs draymond argument to a tee)."
"I posted this a thousand times, but there just wasn't a move out there that made sense. At any point. The uniqueness of our situation with salary, Draymond green being hard to build around, and Andrew Wiggins being a negative for every team except us made every move that was suggested seem kind of bone headed."
"Without question. Changing 1 or 2 draft misses to the best player available can take literally any team from bad to great. Just using the Timberwolves as a coincidental hypothetical here because they traded for the pick before he was drafted - imagine if the Wolves take Giannis instead of Shabazz Muhammad back in 2013. Assuming everything else plays out as it did in terms of draft moves and assuming Giannis's development isn't affected one way or the other, you would have had a team of Giannis, Jimmy Butler, KAT, and others I'm not thinking of presently. I don't know that ends up as a Championship team solely because of the existence of Golden State, but at the very least, that makes you very firmly in the top level of contender that season. Can also say that for literally any team in 2014 with Jokic being available deep into the second, or 2012 with both Khris Middleton and Draymond Green being available in the second round. Taking just those three and putting them on literally any team makes them a mid-level playoff team at the absolute minimum, even if the team outside of them is doodoo.  The what-if game is a little less dramatic in some other sports, but basketball is so disproportionately affected by the top level players that making even one or two changes with those guys drastically changes the makeup of the league."
Steph Curry won’t be the same player without Draymond Green in his team
I still think it's a great achievement whether he comes close or goes over. But I honestly never put much value into triple doubles. It requires you to be a very certain type of player that most players aren't. Not every player is going to rack up 10 assists even if they score 50 because that's not their role. And the same with rebounds. I'm more impressed with players who have a great game regardless of stats. Draymond Green very rarely gets a triple double but absolutely wins games for us. Plenty of guys have a 15 rebound game or a 12 assist game and that's equally impressive for their skillset and their role on the team. Looney is never getting 10 assists. I think it cheapens the game of basketball to worry about stats because winning is what matters and it's a team game. Good for this kid though.
"Causal NFL fans know who Peyton and Eli Manning are. Casual NBA fans will have no clue who JJ Redick is, and will probably vaguely remember hearing about Draymond Green a couple of times."
"Eh there's some weird stuff there as well  [http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/\_/year/2018/sort/WINS](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2018/sort/WINS)  Bradley Beal in 2018 2nd?  Edit: Also Draymond Green as a defensive negative, didn't even see that because he's not on page 1 lol"
"The only way to stop that is if Draymond Green was guarding Gordon. He *might* see that play coming and tell the weak side defender stay home on the shooter, but then you have to defend the dunk from Gordon"
"Draymond ""Backpack"" Green has more made 3s in an NBA finals game 7 than Simmons does for his career lol"
Josh Hart trying for the Draymond Green double-double
"Draymond Green is an AS-level player, but he's not known for his scoring at all. Now Wiggins, when was he ever an All-Star? Lmao. This might be his first season if he's voted in."
If he can lead the injured Nuggets to ABOVE a play in position without a player one tenth as impactful as Draymond Green he's above Steph for now(unless Steph wins a ring)
IMO if he leads the Nuggets to ABOVE a play in spot without having any healthy teammate half as valuable as Draymond Green that says a lot
"As a Cavs fan, Draymond Green. He’s so smart and has such a unique approach to the game. Also, to a lesser extent, Steph. He’s one of the all time greats, even if Cleveland fans love to hate."
Mr. Triple Single Draymond Green
"I don't want to circlejerk because he gets plenty of attention on reddit, but draymond green in the general media and more casual NBA fanbases."
"If you're trying to make the best possible team with a starter from each team in the division, then Pacific should be -   PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Paul George  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  And this team is better than any of the other teams"
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."
Put Draymond Green next to him and problem solved. Is it viable? Maybe not but you asked if it's possible.
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Andre Iguodala   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  It’s pretty obvious why they targeted Steph.
MVP - Steph Curry  DPOY - Draymond Green  MIP - Jordan Poole  COTY - Hot Little Slut  Comeback Player of the Year - Klay Thompson
dealing with draymond green vs getting switches onto lou williams and reggie jackson
"To be fair, Pop has coached several different offenses/defenses as his stars aged. The 2003 “Give it to Duncan” Spurs were a very different team than the 2013-14 “Danny Green or Boris Diaw might win FMVP” Spurs.  So far, Kerr’s only had success with a ball-movement offense designed around 4-5 playmakers and a switch-heavy defense designed around versatile wings/bigs. I want to see how he adapts when Curry and Draymond lose a step."

"&gt; I legitimately don’t know where the narrative of him being a bad defender came from.  He used to get targeted on switches by other teams.  Notably, when the rest of the defensive lineup was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant.  The ""no shit Steph is the weak link"" lineup. Did you know he's also a worse rim protector than Rudy Gobert?"
What the fuck does that mean Draymond Green?
Everyone talks about Dwight Howard being a clear snub from the top 75. But Draymond Green also deserved to be there. Both guys deserved it clearly over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.
"How dumb are you guys really with this argument? Draymond Green can't play center 48 minutes a game, Bogut wasn't suited for the Cabs when they went small. His 12 minutes a game are instrumental when his backs ups are stone hand Ezeli and fucking Varajao where we get creamed and exposed."
The Warriors win the 2016 Finals 9/10 times. It took the perfect storm of the (rightful) Draymond Green suspension and injuries to Curry and Bogut for the Cavaliers to come back.
"I had a rather heated article with my brother in law at Thanksgiving about Draymond Green, of all things. BIL just sees Draymond’s kicking and thinks he is a terrible, unsophisticated player. I couldn’t get him to understand that Green does incredible defensive reads, anchors the entire defense, and is able to guard practically any position. Really sad that a few high profile incidents dominant the narrative over brilliant defense."

"[Kris Weems](https://youtu.be/yJRKbkqHwCg?t=1157):   &gt;Yeah, I think when you're gonna draft a kid that size, -- and knowing that long term he's going to be bigger and stronger [and] he may grow a couple inches taller -- his versatility, because of the size gives him a chance to stay on the floor longer. So, we did talk about him playing a little bit of [the] 5. We still want him to play on the wing -- play the 3 and the 4 -- for the most part. Work on his ball handling [and] his passing. But you can be effective as a 5. Draymond Green is a Hall of Famer because he does a lot of the things that Jonathan does. So we'll be very specific about those times and what we can run [and] the packages and plays we want to put in there. But the versatility on defense is really what sets him apart  So:  1. Because they're trying to win games so Kuminga isn't going to see a ton of playing time  2. Because they want to develop him as a forward first."

"Oh totally, it’s why NBA GMs/executives do what they do and we just talk about it.  It’s one thing to point out a hole in a team / thought / ideology / mechanism / whatever. It’s a whole other beast to recognize that flaw, then have the ability to remedy that weak point without creating more gaps or issues for the whole.  I can sit here and say the Suns need a player like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green as a PF (or even Bembry). Or say they need a Bogdanovic, Seth Curry, Danny Green as a SG. Or a Harrison Barnes, OG Anounoby, Norman Powell at SF. But how can they do that without giving up the things that make them good / or creating more holes?  That I don’t know."
"People still consider him as a meme player, and at the most as a ""hustle guy"", but after watching him for 20 games, he's much closer to Draymond Green than to Gary Payton II. He's very very good. Just makes any team a lot better. Can't believe he's signed to the MLE"

Draymond Green needs to get dropped
The Blazers defensive scheme rn is comedy. Imagine doubling Wiggins because he came off of a screen. Their communication and rotations are very yikes. There was a play where they trapped  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  # DRAYMOND GREEN   #   #   # AND LEFT STEPH CURRY OPEN  &amp;#x200B;  #
I can make a fluke case for almost every title that exists. You think Raptors fans care that KD and Klay went down? You think Bucks fans care that Kyrie went down? You think Cavs fans care that Draymond Green got suspended?  I could go on. Why should we care that ours was won in a bubble? Especially since the Lakers were the #1 seed anyway?  Y’all are WEIRD if you actually letting people talk you out of the joy of your team wining a championship.
"AD at his best is not a top tier rim runner that can play D, he's an absolute menace around the rim, who can make you pay from mid range and is also the best rim protector/perimeter defender outside of draymond green. He's a beast on defense"

Nobody on the warriors expect Draymond Green to be Rudy Gobert. Why are people expecting Rudy to be Draymond. I don't get it.

They were up 3-1 and would have won in 5 had Draymond Green not been suspended. And even with that if Barnes could have made just a few WIDE OPEN 3s it would have been over.
"&gt; What lineups are they playing against?  If you *actually* watch the game you know Curry is often getting minutes with GP2 against the toughest lineups. This should actually be inflating Draymond's defense rating.   Curry barely plays in garbage time. Literally the only minutes he ever got in garbage time this season was against the Nets and he still played only 29 minutes. Again, why don't you actually watch the game?   &gt; who's replacing Dray in these lineups   Explain to me why you think this matters. We don't have a better defender than Draymond at the forward position. Wiggins is considered the 2nd best defender on the team: a combination of Draymond + Wiggins has a 105.13 defense rating on 426 minutes. Steph has played 142 minutes without Green and Wiggins, he has a 27.61 net rating with a 98.25 defense rating. You can look at all these combinations and it becomes very clear Steph also has a big impact on the defense rating because offense also impacts how well teams score in transition.   So stop it with your 4th grade level intelligence"

"Draymond Green seemed like the ""antithesis"" of a Klutch guy and yet here we are"
Extremely unpopular opinion:  Draymond Green  He fits a role... but gets way too much credit. If he learned to shut his mouth I'd appreciate him a little more.
"Not really,  Draymond at the 5 works exceptionally well on both ends. Warriors w Dray at the 5 have a 97.7 DRTG this year and +16 net rating, and peak Danny Green is a monster defensive guard, peak LeBron was a dpoy level wing who dwarves Wiggins in impact, Jingles and Horry are both good defenders who have been part of high level defenses in the past and are comparable defensively to 2022 Steph/OPJ/Iggy etc"
Draymond “Triple single” Green
"Oooh aren’t you such a good guy  Obviously we watch sports differently. I watch to root for my team and I don’t fuck with any disrespect.   You must have forgotten that Clippers staffers were advised to not wear any team gear while walking around Memphis.   ZBO didn’t fuck with Blake Griffin, so neither did I.   Draymond Green poked Mike Conleys broken eye, fuck him for life for that.   This one doesn’t even have to do with my team but I’ll never forget it. Fuck Kelly Olynyk for pulling Kevin Loves shoulder out.   It’s ok to dislike players that do shitty things, ya know?"
"Cade’s gonna be a nightly triple double threat (he already is). Once his shot is consistent it’s pretty easy to see multiple all stars &amp; all-NBA’s for the vegan man, just a well rounded player that’s good at everything even defence.   Mobley’s length, skill, defensive IQ, passing ability/court vision &amp; soft touch is every team’s wet dream in a big man. He’s also almost a lock for all stars &amp; all-NBAs, and will definitely contend for DPOYs.   Scottie Barnes has a ton of upside due to his monstrous frame - not to mention his skill. He’s a little too unselfish to a fault for me to consider him a future bonafide superstar, but his upside is certainly there, as a do-it-all forward that connects the offence and the defence by himself. He could play the Draymond role quite easily.    Jalen Green might not have as much upside cause of how one-dimensional he is - a pure scorer - but man can you see stardom when his shit works out right.   Then shoutout to Kuminga who got crazy potential - I see a world in which my man becomes a Jaylen Brown type, a true 2-way star - and also big shoutout to Franz Wagner, a less athletic Scottie Barnes but better on both ends.   Not to mention Sengun, such a talented big man workin down in that low block or operating in the short roll, his potential is sky high. It might be limited due to his height (only 6’9) but his passing skill is crazy, handling is nice, and IQ well beyond his years. Gotta work on his fouling tho, which will differentiate him from a starter to a backup."
"Yup, and Draymond Green is who Marcus Smart thinks he is lol."

"PG: Calderon  SG: Danny Green  SF: Crowder  PF: LeBron  C: Draymond  Could obviously add another DPOY center over Crowder, but I think this team is better. Green/Crowder/Lebron/Draymond is already enough defense and LeBron needs shooters."
Mutumbo/Ben Wallace   Rodman/Draymond Green   LeBron/Joe Ingles   Korver/Kerr   Mark Jackson/Mugsy Bogues
"**Rondo-Anthony Parker-Lebron-Battier-Draymond** would have won a title.   I feel like you basically have to pick **Rondo** because he made 4 straight all-star games and there just isn't a perimeter player out there who averaged under 10 a game a game and was a top 30 guy in the league for half a decade. Then obviously you need shooting around them.   A lot of these teams don't have a 2nd player who can create at all, and this one has 3 since Bobby Jackson wasn't half bad in his prime, and he shot the 3 well and played hard on D, so he was my original choice. Ironically, Delonte West was my 3rd choice at the 2 guard spot after Danny Green. But then I remembered **Anthony Parker** existed and he put up 12 a game on 44% 3pt shooting his first 2 years in the NBA, and that was aged 31. So if you get a 28 year old euro league MVP in Anthony Parker I think that's the same 14-15 point guy Bobby Jackson was, and Parker was a very good defender. But I was really tempted to pick Bobby Jackson because it would be hell for Lebron on offense needing to get 35 a game on this team, and in the playoffs you need a credible 2nd scorer. But him being 6'1 was just too tough for me to get past. That's a tiny backcourt. If Rondo and Lebron didn't work I'd panic and make Lebron the PG and bring on Bobby Jackson for Rondo to get another shooter out there. Also, older Lebron in the post, I think you want Jackson shooting at PG to spread the floor and you can play 5 out since you can pick Draymond from when he had a 3pt shot. Younger Lebron, driving and playing up tempo, you probably go with the superior player in Rondo.  **Battier** vs Horry is a tough one but Battier was the better shooter and probably the better defender too.   **Draymond** is my choice as center for the modern era, but if I was competing against other all-time teams who might have a proper 7 foot scorer I'd be tempted to go with Mutombo, Chandler or Noah. Also Tyson Chandler is tempting since he was a lob threat and might fit better with Rondo and Lebron than Draymond. I went with Draymond because he's the best defensive player I've ever seen, but with Battier at the 4 I'm really not sure he's a better fit than Mutombo or Chandler since you get a real rim protector at the 5."
"Rondo Danny green Lebron Draymond  Kelly olynk   Im gonna cheat since Kelly olynk averages like 10.2 over his career but I wouldnt want to play with 2 non shooters  Prime rondo can bring some secondary scoring and playmaking and draymond, danny green and lebron would have people in HELL on the wing   Rim protection may be an issue but get Ben Wallace of the bench and this teams wins it all if they are all in their primes"
"caruso/danny green/lebron/draymond/ben wallace  absolutely suffocating defense, still very good offense if we get peak draymond shooting 3s"
"Assuming we're building a team to take part in the 2021-22 season (all peak years are IMO ofc):  **PG: LeBron James** (career 27.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 09, 12, 13, 16  **SG: Danny Green** (career 8.9ppg) --- Peak versions: 13, 14, 16  **SF: Joe Ingles** (career 8.7ppg) --- Peak versions: 17, 18, 21  **PF: Robert Horry**  (career 7.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 94, 95, 01, 05, 07   **C: Draymond Green** (career 8.8ppg) --- Peak versions: 15, 16, 17  rationale: lebron + shooting is a tried and tested formula so here are 3 shooters plus peak draymond  who could occasionally knock down open 3s too (34.4% from 3 in 61 playoff games from 2015-17). All of them are at least solid defenders with some elite ones. Draymond and Jingles are both excellent ballhandlers/passers who can relieve some of the offensive burden on lebron. Might have to ask Horry to become the roll man in some sets ig, im not super familiar w his game haha"
"Warriors already have Juan Toscano Anderson who is basically a poor man's Draymond Green clone. They don't need a max slot dedicated to another backup for Draymond Green. If they are gonna dump Wiggins and Wiseman they need an *upgrade* at the 3, which at the bare minimum would be a Harrison Barnes level player. Not Simmons who won't shoot and just stands at the dunker spot in the playoffs."

Obviously you're kinda fucking yourself with picking big men that can't shoot and never were expected to guard the perimeter a ton, but just imagine the defensive potential. No one could score in the paint whatsoever, and everyone but Korver can be a lockdown defender."
"LeBron James, Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, and Draymond Green.  They couldn't score to save their lives, but it wouldn't matter, because the end score would be 78-72 every time."
"The only thing about that shot worth criticizing was the spin, which didn't do much but also he still got a clean look so it's whatever. His other option was to drive into a waiting Draymond Green, which ain't exactly ideal either."
"Honestly have watched like 2 wizards games, so i don't have a strong opinion on the lad.  Phenomenal hair, though.  There's an argument to be made for the need of secondary playmaking on the dubs, but any dubs fan at this point will retort with this:   First--draymond green is our secondary playmaker and Andrew wiggins is actually evolving extremely nicely into a role as rotational playmaker, finding open shooters.  Second--pretty tough to convince me any of these rookies has a higher ceiling than wiseman, and as far as laying a foundation post-Splash n Dray, a two-way stretch 5 that looks something like a cross between robinson/bosh is 100% making us happy as future title challengers, i don't care how many triple doubles lamelo throws up, or what deni's playmaking looks like."
"&gt;Draymond said a few months ago that PJ tucker might be the best corner 3 point shooter ever  Tucker is a career 38.5% shooter on corner 3s, and has only broken 40% twice ( not counting 8 games this year, during which he's hit 55% ).  Tons of guys have a better percentage than Tucker, so as with most things Green says, we should take that with a grain of salt."
"“Even then, if the topic is strictly about carrying, I don’t see what point the OP commenter is trying to make. Westbrook has done a successful hard carry exactly once in his career. LeBron is a top 2 player ever, and Harden is arguably the best isolation scorer of all time.”  I’ve clearly addressed OP’s claims in this quote right here. I merely furthered it by asking him what’s the merit of it. You know, something he himself hasn’t answered. You keep saying OP was merely mentioning carrying ability in a vacuum, and I just furthered the discussion by asking what the merit of such a claim entails.  This is not DPOY winning Draymond Green. This isn’t even the Draymond from 73-9. This is a Draymond who has just returned from an i jury and a virus, a Dray who is now much older than his DPOY winning counterpart, and a Dray that has looked a bit slower starting from last season (possibly due to coasting, but even this season and in 2019 he’s seems slower compared to his peak days). Roberson definitely does not bring what Draymond brings, but 2017 Roberson definitely helps fill in some of the things 2021 Draymond does in perimeter D and rotations. Stats won’t paint a pretty picture yet since seaosn has barely started, so if you will agree to disagree with me then that’s fine, but to think it a desperate and laughable comparison is insane because you have not considered the fact that this is an older, fresh from injury and virus Draymond. You keep sayig it’s Draymond fucking Green as if the man didn’t come back from injury and the virus and isn’t as in shape as he normally is, not to mention his age. On offense, Draymond is the much better playmaker and a similar scorer, which makes him the much better player. But Draymond alone, especially this Draymond, does not make up for the other deficiencies of the 2021 squad.  The squad WB ran with couldn’t give him what he needed most, but it gave him the 2nd and 3rd best thing he needed most, defense and the capacity to play at high usage. If I had to build a team around Steph smart playmakers would be what I’d go for first, then defense and shooting. To call Steph as an inept defender is wild at this point. The man is a slightly above average defensive point guard. He’s even better than WB at it."
"I don't know basketball, but I do know Draymond Green is fucking good at it.  The Warriors live and die by Dray just as much as they do by Curry (for the most part)."
I know that Draymond Green tied in a 3pt contest to Kevin Hart. Does that count for understanding basketball?
Nah fam you making shit up lol what are you 13? All star Draymond Green was on the court the whole 4th. Sit down
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
"Jimmy Butler take was bad, but OP also ranked Draymond Green 197th in the league.   [Edit: Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j2ezdm/top_500_players_in_the_nba_190181/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)"
"So I would want to choose a team that can pass, but can also score in different ways. Driving, 3 point specialist, back to the basket, midrange, etc. Yet never scored over 15 ppg. The spacing wouldn't be great but you're great on defense and no one is a negative on offense.   PG Rondo  SG Duncan Robinson  SF Tayshaun Prince  PF Draymond Green  C Marcus Camby"
"Ya'll can downvote? The only one getting downvoted here is me. Dray belittled KD on more than one occasion, and even got suspended for it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgH2oK0XPc8   https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/13/warriors-draymond-green-suspended-confrontation-kevin-durant/1994235002/"
I would argue that his defense is more of a Draymond Green effect.
"Have you watched Draymond play the last few years? Teams literally leave him wide open and he's too scared to shoot he doesn't even have faith in himself half the time passing up wide open 3s for a dumb pass that lead to turnovers, I was watching yesterday's game it got so bad to the point where Steph saw Draymond on island alone open but looked him off to take a contested mid-range that's how sorry he is now. And I never even said he's a better offensive player lmao it's just green being a complete liability without the ball, with rodman at least he was a constant rebound threat defenses couldnt ook off."
"The point is that a guy like Carmelo Anthony, for example, who will be a first ballot HoF without a doubt in the NBA, would either struggle for years or NEVER make it in the baseball HoF. The same thing happens in the Pro Football HoF, guys like Shannon Sharpe and T.O who were widely considered Top 3-5 in their positions at the time they retired had to wait multiple years.  You can tell me anything you want, guys like Melo, Lowry and Draymond Green would never make the HoF if the basketball HoF wasn't a joke, they are all very good, but they aren't Hall of Famers if Basketball used Football/Baseball levels of requirements.  As far as steroids go, i have a very similar thinking to Max Kellerman. If you were already a HoF at the moment you started using steroids (Barry  Bonds) you are in, if the cheating took you into a level that qualified you into the Hall, but you weren't before (Mark McGwire) you are out."

Draymond Green is the Michael Carrick of basketball IDC what anyone says lol
"&gt;In most situations, getting downvoted by r/nba means you're exactly right, but saying something that certain fanboys don't like, so I don't worry about them much.  LOL this is so lame good lord. And yeah this sub is notorious for fanboying Draymond you're so right.  &gt;Green seems fixated on preventing a three attempt  What? For talking so much shit about how you're ""exactly right"" and everyone else is wrong, I think you can do better than that.  Green was expecting a screen from OG and to switch on the screen (which is why Looney was so deep), instead OG slipped the screen and cut to the basket, which meant instead of sticking with their men they were already committed to the switch and Dray had to catch up. It was a good play call from the Raps and got OG some space, but it had nothing to do with Dray being ""fixated on preventing a three attempt"" or him ""being too slow""."
He plays with Draymond green now lmao
"That's Draymond Green, not David Thompson.  And I'm not even sure the Skywalker had that much leap, but Green sure as hell does not these days.  He got beat, and got lucky.  It happens."
"More accurately, he left Draymond Green."
Steph Curry is AN MVP CANDIDATE  Draymond Green is A DEFENSIVE JUGGERNAUT  Andrew Wiggins is FINALLY KIND OF GOOD I GUESS  Kelly Oubre  James Wiseman is A FUTURE ALL-STAR
Only if they unbraid their hair and add Draymond Green
I want a Draymond Green game winner. If we loose this one can we please tank? Watching competitive basketball is not good for my aging heart.
"That's on Siakam tbh, stunting out towards noted scoring threat Draymond Green instead of defending the paint first.  Love Wiseman's speed on the break, though."
Imagine thinking you know what Draymond  Green needs to work on better the Draymond Green does lmaooo
I think 3 times. First elbow to the face then he was grabbed by draymond green now this
Draymond green effect
"This one always comes to mind when I think of everything these 3 have been through together    https://movietvtechgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Draymond-Green-Klay-Thompson-Hold-Down-Warriors-in-Steph-Curry’s-Absence-2016-images.jpg  I especially enjoy the fact that I’m not sure if Klay is paying attention or lost, staring into the stands"
ESPN: Draymond Green accuses r/nba of being drug addicts.
Easy to make an arguement that klay made draymond. Who takes the other teams best scorer back then? Klay took the guards and iggy the forwards. He also had bogut who was a good center. Draymond is a help defender he never locked down a great player. And on offense he just stood and the top of the key and 2 of the best shooters ever ran around the perimeter ortho 3 point line and draymond made the pass. Even before kd they had an extremely deep team which makes role players like green look good
God don't make me like Draymond Green. I guess I do now.
This is the correct answer IMO. Lebron is the active leader at 561 Draymond Green is second active at 252. Kareem only got 501 and Wilt managed 862 - just over half of Bill Russell's 1718.    17 rebounds is a really good rebounding game these days and Russell's record would represents 101 of those really good rebounding games. 101 finals games! At least 15 finals series where every game is a great rebounding game. We are never going to see the like of that again.
"Draymond green for teammate of the year. The warriors legit had a whirlwind turnaround once he returned, Draymond mentors the young guys, changes the offense with his smartness and passing and his defense is un fucking believable. He's as big a piece to this team and Steph or Klay are"
"I’m not, I own a Draymond Green jersey, he’s one of my favourite players, to say he is a top 15 player is fucking ridiculous."
"What? Top 15? Are you properly out of your mind? Top 30, maybe. Top 15, you’re crazy. Klay Thompson was MAYBE a top 15 player at one point, not Draymond Green."
"""There are things you know you know, there are things you know you don't know, and **there are things you didn't even know you don't know.** - Donald Rumsfeld""  --Draymond Green"
Draymond Green was correct
Draymond Green just hit me with the wisdom. I needed to hear this on a personal level.
"Nope he isnt, Steph is playing with almost all backup players and a rookie, the only all star on his starting is a aging Draymond Green"
DRAYMOND GREEN EVISCERATES R/NBA WITH FACTS &amp; LOGIC
Draymond Green calls r/nba drug addicts.
Oh this is a hard one. My guess is Draymond Green
Draymond green
[SHOTS FIRED] Draymond Green calls out r/nba and their armchairs!
Draymond green was the second best player on the 15 title team would’ve been the second best player on a title team in 2016 if the warriors won and he couldn’t score well either?
&gt;Draymond Green  &gt;Honorable man  No.
"I don’t think that’s completely true. People knew that the Warriors played better with Draymond Green on the floor, but until the stats were there to back that up, claims like that didn’t get respect because they were so subjective and hard to prove.  Also, blaming the “eye test” people isn’t really accurate either, because prior to the plus-minus derived advanced stats, the best player evaluation stats available were box score stats. So there literally was no statistical basis to argue that Draymond Green had elite impact."
"He's getting the hang of the Warrior's team defense. He's ok so far with the help defense making good rotations. He rarely has to do it because he the primary defender for the opposing team's scorer. Oubre and him do a good job at switching their man; they're pretty much interchangeable on defense. Like OP said, with Draymond back, he can be more aggressive and be closer to the scorer because he knows Green has got his back.  &amp;#x200B;  One thing that surprised me this season is his strength low post. He can guard 4's and small 5's in the low block. He's also been a decent drive-and-kick guy (I wouldn't call him a playmaker). He has sloppy ball handling but once he's passed his man, he can either score or pass; making the correct play. (Unlike Oubre, who even after beating his defender, either turns it over or bricks a shot)"
"He is Draymond Green lite in a lot of things, except scoring lol."
"Basketball is really mental. It's why Lebron picked up meditation as a hobby. It's why Jimmy Butler, Lebron, and Draymond Green are important for their teammates. Those three guys project confidence that creates that energy for their teammates and Dray won't *let you* have a mental block. He'll scream at you until you're more worried about him than you are missing the shot. They keep an eye on the mentality of their teammates the whole game though and don't let you slouch or give up.  If your confidence goes in the middle of a basketball game you can become dead ass useless to your teammates. You'll stop driving, you'll stop shooting and you'll play scared. Defenders will read you like a book and eat you.  ([Defenders want to unnerve you](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlUH6eDIyq3ASwo/giphy.gif) and get you off your game so you make dumb moves. It's why you blitz baby quarterbacks until all they can do is run the ball.)  So the mental aspect is a big part of this game, I think. If his mental health is in the way it's blocking his playing."
"Yeah Steph is actually good or great, even at age 32 he still got some juice left to impress us. The fact that he is doing so while the multitool dpoy candidate Draymond Green is lets just say getting into his old form, which would be very kind. Klay is out, Wiggins has yet to figure his role out, Oubre looks good, havent been ballin good. Wiseman looks impressive in flashes like every non 20-10 rookie does.. Pascall and the other homies got stuff to learn aswell. So really, Steph is showing us he can carry pretty good, in a different role, with very different players. Coach Kerr also needs a highfive, which he gets here /clap"
Don’t forget to give a shout out to Draymond Green. Difference is night and day with him on the court
His shot looks like a blend between Draymond and Danny Green.
Wolves don't have Draymond Green screaming in your ear
Lmao even that close to the bucket they still think he’ll pass it out. A rare lay up from the Swiss Army knife (everything except scoring threat) Draymond Green
Carried by All Star Draymond Green and Number One pick Wiggins tbh.
"Did you not read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi1srp2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)? I already addressed my views on your straw man argument, yet you keep pushing it as if it's the point OP was making. If you wanna discuss the merits of carrying, make your own thread; don't post it as a reply to my saying someone is missing OP's point.   I'm aware that Roberson is an elite perimeter defender, That's not enough to compare him to Draymond fucking Green. Yes, Roberson being an elite defender makes up a tiny bit in comparison to Draymond (*after all, that's all he brings to the table*), but it's not enough to not make this a desperate and laughable attempt to find any similarity between the two players.  I'm looking at what's surrounding Steph vs what's surrounded WB. Westbrook's supporting cast couldn't give him the thing a team built around him would need the most. If you were building a team around Steph you'd want long athletes can make up for his defensive ineptitude first and foremost."
That’s what happens when that man gets rolling. The play you’re talking about Kawhi got caught anticipating Draymond kicking it out for the corner 3 and left an open instead of contested layup but that’s the point. Steph draws so much attention you have 1 defender who has to either contest a Green layup and leave a wide open corner 3 or allow the layup.
"I just think offense warrants more of a payday over defense. An example is draymond green, great player but hesitant to pay him what it costs to keep him."
Jeff Green   Draymond Green   Javonte Green   Danny Green   JaMychal Green   Josh Green
Yea I think their team is solid. They killed us first half. It’s just a matter of spirit. They need a draymond green kind of emotional leader.
*Draymond Green plays tank commander last year*  Lmfao triple single scrub. Dude is a role player at best and an overrated player. Can't carry a team lol. Dude doesn't deserve to be an all-star  *Warriors winning with Steph and Draymond*  Lmao Curry can't win without an all-star in Draymond. Ain't LeBron's level kid.
"He has never been effiecent though, ever. He has always jacked up questionable 3s since his Durant days. He could drive into the lane and score a lot. But he relies on his inconsistent jumper. Im not even a Russ fan i just hate the reactionary takes. Some dude on here last week Draymond Green should be considered a Superstar"
"The specificity of the stats is kind of silly, but I'm always impressed by a 5-5-5-5 statline. For me it has always been a great representation of a well-rounded game.  For anyone curious about the players who have done this in NBA history:  Hakeem Olajuwon (x6)  Andrei Kirilenko (x3)  Dr. J (x2)  George T. Johnson (x1)  George Gervin (x1)  David Robinson (x1)  Derek Coleman (x1)  Vlade Divac (x1)  Jamaal Tinsley (x1)  Marcus Camby (x1)  Nicolas Batum (x1)  Draymond Green (x1)  Anthony Davis (x1)  Jusuf Nurkic (x1)"
Two nights ago Draymond Green fouled Kawhi hard and pulled him down on a funk attempt. Mark started rambling about how it should be a common foul while everyone else new it was a flagrant at first glance. The replays made it look worse and worse.
You either get a C who can shoot. *KP is better at this but Turner offers some midrange-3pt shot too.*  Or you need your big men to have playmaking skills. *Sabonis-Jokic-Draymond Green**-Gasol(Grizzlies days with Z-Bo) are good examples.*   I'm not sure if Collins have good court vision and playmaking skills. Trae is a ball hog and he needs to be ball hog for foul baiting all game. I am not sure if he'd give up the ball. *Brogdon and Pacers give the ball Sabonis more.*
"I remember this. You can’t really compare the two because Lebron put up 41-16-7 the game after.   Here was his stats for the next 12 games actually  41-16-7,   41-8-11,  27-11-11,  36-6-13,  25-10-7,  41-13-12,  33-10-4,  35-10-4,  39-6-4,  35-8-7,  35-9-6,  38-9-7,  12 Ws, 0L  Man absolutely balled out  Source: https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/05/18/lebron-james-nba-playoffs-draymond-green"
"Warriors fans were bitching about their slow start being only because triple single Draymond Green was out. Meanwhile the Rockets started the season without Wall, Boogie, McLemore, and now Wood and House are hurt. We've yet to play our roster 100%.  Enjoy the small sample size though, I guess?"
"It's their defence. Steph isn't that bad of a defender but this narrative got started because in the playoffs he got targeted in every series, purely because he was on the floor with KD, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson."
"2017-18 Harden, 2016 Draymond Green, 2018 CP3, 2019 Ibaka, 2015 Iguodala  Bench: Steven Adams, Patrick Beverley, Kyle Kuzma"
"Draymond Green in his prime except he was an all-star.  Otherwise, Marcus Smart makes sense."
"1. He's a former Celtic  2. Had a rivalry with LeBron, who has the biggest (and post-kobe the most aggressive) fanbase  3. Celtics-era Pierce ended 8 years ago, a majority of fans currently on social media never saw him suit up for them  4. Draymond Green made the funny meme quote  5. While players tend to have egos, he's still running around claiming to have had a better career than Wade   6. No dramatic success pre big 3, was pretty bad against the Nets when he could have made the Finals"
I don't agree with the height stuff... Stephen Curry is an elite off-ball player and the GSW offense really flows when he plays offball (of course they have Draymond Green) I know that they're not the same height but still that doesn't mean Trae Young can't play offball
Draymond green speed running assists
"No shade on Draymond here. He isn't an atrocity like Ben either when it comes to shooting. But the things he primarily contributes to the team- defense, secondary playmaking, heart, hustle, teams don't pick someone number one overall to do those things. Number one overall picks are expected to carry offenses in both fast breaks and half courts, to get clutch buckets. In the same vein, someone who's been touted the top prospect in high school and college doesn't dream of being Draymond Green, he dreams of becoming Steph Curry/Kevin Durant/Lebron James. And you're right. It gets especially bad when your other star player is a center who's a savant in the post."

Kenny's acting like the positive changes he are valid reasons to storm the US Capitol. We all know why they stormed the Capitol. That doesn't make them any less of terrorists. Draymond Green was 100% right and it wasn't just an emotional take.  Shaq had the only good take out of all three.
You can’t be a superstar and a role player. I’m not that emotionally invested to really care about accuracy. Draymond Green is a really good player. I am not downing him. Simmons is simply a superior player. I would rather have a team of five Ben Simmons’ than a team of 5 Draymond Greens.
No. Ben can facilitate an offense.  That’s not even close to what Gobert and his screen assists can do. I don’t see them as being on the same level.  And secondary ball handler?  Why?  Even Green was often times the primary ball handler and still is.  I think this comment just shows how he is the next Draymond in this sub.
"he can be an “all-pro level player” in the same way that Gobert was/is  he needs to focus on being a Draymond Green like secondary ball handler, Simmons has a long way to go in learning how to run a half court offense like Dray though"
I said “might” but Ben Simmons looks like he has reached his peak as a poor mans Draymond Green
Always rated Draymond Green
Draymond Green speak your truth bro
Super weird that I agree with Draymond fuckin Green lmao
"Very uncommon, but Draymond Green has a few of them. He even has one without points iirc (reb/ast/stl)."
"&gt;Granted, PG doesn't get the level of blind hatred that James Harden and Draymond Green have received in recent years  What lol. He gets way more hate, basically Warriors KD level hate."
"Sure but wiseman looks like a stud and if we can hit on the wolves pick next draft say kuminga, Green or Suggs then we could be in a good position. And we should have potential for max cap space then which would be really nice. If we can get 2 stars plus curry, Klay, green, Wiggins and either wiseman/Minnie pick then we would be favs for a championship I think.  But I think we are going all out next year so we will keep Oubre, maybe try and get someone on the DPE (Austin rivers is on a minimum for 3 seasons and would be nice as a 3 and D guard and shouldn't be that expensive). Then we have curry/klay/wiggins/draymond/Wiseman bench- oubre/paschall/Chriss/top 5 pick (hopefully)/iggy/Poole/looney then 3 more vets."
"Regardless, you're just nitpicking between the words ""few"" and ""couple"" while entirely missing the point. Who cares if some fool who hasn't been paying attention is misled by the word ""few"" and thinks he's had *3* excellent games? That's literally irrelevant to the point, and is a completely superficial and meaningless objection (and typical of reddit).  The 2 game sample of his good play is too small to extrapolate from. The 1 game sample here is too small to extrapolate from. And either way, it makes no sense to cite boxscore counting stats to assess the impact of *Draymond Green*. None of this should be controversial."
"I don't think non-Raptors fans care about Siakam as much as you think they do.  Granted, PG doesn't get the level of blind hatred that James Harden and Draymond Green have received in recent years, but he's not too far away."
Buddy you said 2015.😂🤣  I'm talking 2021. He's a role player now. But keep playing 2k and making the all-star team with Draymond Green.   Triple single!
"I fucking hate draymond green. I think dudes way overrated and is ALWAYS talking shit.    But he is 100% right, and I'm really fucking happy he said it. I think my opinion on the guy will be different now."

"Whether that’s the case or not,   why are we giving credit to what Draymond Green says on this issue?!?  It’s not like if he knew better than any of us on this issue."

Draymond Green speaking the absolute truth.
7 days into the new year and I'm already agreeing with Draymond Green....
As if 2020 wasn't weird enough... somehow 2021's already got me agreeing with Draymond Green?   I'm gonna be burning sage with Kyrie by February if this shit keeps up.

"My comments are aiming for making a distinction about charging people as terrorists.  This is a in response to a video of Draymond green calling them terrorists, in which I pointed out that charging citizens as terrorists is bad.  I believe this, because citizens losing habeas corpus rights is not only bad for anyone, even vile terrorists, but also because it will set a precedent for the future that will almost certainly lead to unconscionable uses of this distinction.  This isn’t difficult, and frankly, the issue here is that the majority of this sub’s idea of “politics” is retweeting jemele hill or cheering on a Steve Kerr quote. I wasn’t defending what happened yesterday, I was stating a fact related to the video."

Draymond is a defensive beast and a good playmaker and the warriors wouldn’t have been quite the same team without him but he was the weakest link of their core. Take out steph or klay no way is that team as good. Replace draymond with a decent role playing forward and that team wouldn’t be too much different.   After KD snaked his way to that squad they definitely didn’t need draymond lol If he wasn’t on that warriors squad there is no way that a ringless draymond green comes anywhere near the HoF. Most players who are in the HoF that are ringless were gonna make it there regardless of how many titles they could’ve won cause they are undeniably fantastic hoopers. Examples; Barkley, Stockton, Malone, Ewing"
What would happen if Draymond Green scores a career high against the nets?
He went from Shawn Kemp Draymond Green hybrid straight into the next KG this season  Look at his mid range game oh good gawly
"8 rebounds, 4 steals, 2 blocks, that's DPOY every single year for you  With decent scoring/playmaking, that's an improved prime Draymond Green right there  Max contract no doubt, the best ceiling raiser in the league"
Why were we losing.  1. Terrible defense. Losing track of 3 pt shooters  2. Draymond Green. Literally curry has to run around twice everytime. Once to get the ball. Another to get rid of the double team to draymond. Then run again to get open. We should have a floater every time down the floor. Shoot that shit you idiot.  3. Wiseman. Have some energy on your face. And stop shooting deep fucking 2s 4 seconds into the shot clock. This isn't high school.
Draymond green with the wnba free throw
"So Draymond Green, basically."
Sounds like a slightly better prime draymond green
"&gt; If they did the top 5 picks would all turn into stars every year  They wouldn't, though.  The problem with top 5 picks is that they usually go to shit teams, who are shit because they have bad coaching and development and culture.  James Wiseman is looking really promising, but he came in super raw. Would he look as good if he were on a team that had the worst record in the league because they were *just that bad* instead of because they had two of their star players missing all or most of the season due to injury, and the third going full tank commander because the season was clearly fucked the second Steph's hand got broken?  Or would people look at his first handful of games, see that a dude who'd played three games since high school wasn't playing great NBA-level basketball, and call him a bust... including his coaching staff?  Wiseman's improving rapidly, but the Warriors have great coaching and he's playing alongside Draymond Green, who coaches him *on the floor*.  Look at how much better Wiggins is playing on the Warriors than the TWolves (although having said that, there's clearly a lot of reasons that the Wiggins-TWolves situation had gone toxic.)"
For their careers Draymond Green is a much better help defender. And that's literally a guy playing at the same time as Giannis.  How about Bill Russell? Hakeem? Giannis is better than them? Lol.
Draymond green would win big time
"Yeah, maybe only one dollar sign was merited.  Side note: the NBA has an interesting increasing scale thing going on with the fines:  \&gt;The [NBA](https://www.cbssports.com/nba) fines players $2,000 for each of their first five technicals, increasing incrementally by a thousand dollars until the 16th technical foul, when the player will be fined $5,000 and suspended for one game. A player will be fined another $5,000 if they get a 17th technical. From then on, a player will have to pay $5,000 and serve a one-game suspension if they keep picking up technical fouls.  source (from 2015): [Warriors' Draymond Green budgeted money to pay for technical foul fines](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-draymond-green-budgeted-money-to-pay-for-technical-foul-fines/)"
&gt; You didn’t hear him loving on KD during the entire nets game   So? KD is really good lol. I’m sure every broadcaster talks about how great he is   Still very weird how you want him fired over it  &gt; You didn’t hear Cage call him out on his Draymond Green fandom?  Again....who fuckin cares? That’s called playful banter and it’s essential to broadcasting. Also Draymond is pretty good at basketball so I think he’s allowed to like him
You didn't hear him loving on KD during the entire Nets game? You didn't hear Cage call him out on his Draymond Green fandom? You're not listening closely enough. Wait till we play GSW.
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
the next draymond green lol
"Hmm no? Kobe did not have ego issues with Shaq , he has stated numerous times over interviews , the real problem he had was with Shaq work ethic. He even said on an interview he wish shaq worked like him because they would have 11 eleven rings..  &amp;#x200B;  KDs ego issues? Just go listen to draymond green and why KD chose to left the Warriors. Or just search KD burner accounts, 2 clear examples of ego issues.  Ok so Harden did not start to play NBA on HOU , he first decided to leave OKC and abandon a ""championship caliber team"" because he wanted to be the number 1. On HOU he has worked with CP3 , Howard , Westbrook( the ones i can remeber) and with none of them it worked , sure it is not Harden's ego fault , not even a slightest  The fact that you resumed Kyrie ego issues to that only situation is outstanding to me lol, Kyrie left cleveland even before LBJ left because he wanted to  ""play in a situation where he can be more of a focal point and that he no longer wants to play alongside LeBron James."" (this is kyrie words btw)   So yeah , no ego issues from neither of them lol"
The most Draymond Green thing that ever Draymond Greened
There's a triple double without points from draymond green
"Stanimal was on his Draymond Green shit tonight. Some of those assists man, sheesh"
"Draymond green has never been suspended. When Draymond Green gets in trouble, he transfers his T to DeMarcus Cousins."
Celtics missing Tatum in both games and still being competitive lol Sixers really fucked up by not trading Australian Draymond Green for Harden
"From the moment the warriors tied the game at 55-55 with 2 minutes left in the second quarter to when the Knicks secured a 15 point lead with 2 minutes left in the 3rd quarter the refs:  * Ejected Draymond Green  * Awarded 10 FTA to the Knicks compared to 0 for the Warriors.  Once the game was in hand, they awarded 14 FTAs to the warriors in the fourth, compared to 9 FTAs to the Knicks."
"Draymond Green has requested a trade to the NBA officiating crew. When asked for comment he gave this short reply, ""Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em."""
"The opposing team would have to play a true center to even slow him down when Shaq’s on offense. Guys like Elden Campbell, Dale Davis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Vlade Divac, etc got the match up because teams needed to put big bodies on Shaq. There were people who only had a roster spot to be a body to put on Shaq and give up 5/6 fouls. These guys typically didn’t have the athleticism and the perimeter shooting that you’d see from today’s bigs like Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, or Nikola Jokic. Part of why position-less basketball is as prevalent as it is is because there is no Shaq in the league bulldozing people in the paint."
"Because while Ben Simmons is a phenomenal basketball player he hasn’t made the type of improvements his peers have in the same span. Mitchell, Brown, Murray, Ingram, Siakam, Sabonis, Brogdon ect. I’m not saying those guys are better than him, but Simmons still has the same weaknesses he came in the league with meanwhile all those guys have been rounding out their games and making significant improvements. Simmons came in the league head and shoulders above everyone else and they’ve caught up now. I think the thought of ABSOLUTELY HAVING to trade him was uncalled for, but understandable because after all “if you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse” - Draymond Green (when they signed KD)"
"I feel like the Sixers should lean on Seth Curry more as the PG, Ben in the ""Draymond Green"" role &amp; of course, Embiid being Embiid... may not win as much but I think Curry being the primary ball handler will translate better in the Playoffs which we all know is more halfcourt centric"
&gt; How insecure do you have to be to think that if somebody is yelling  Someone? This is Draymond Green lmao. I don't really feel bad that him of all people got screwed here. Its like Boogie getting techs for just looking at them the wrong way. At some point your behavior catches up with you.
lol I think we need Draymond Green just because dude could maybe get us to our defensive spots on time for once.
"Hey y’all I have an NBA question from an NBA-ignorant fan. Just saw the thumbnail from the Draymond Green ejection video and noticed that they have a bunch of screens with what I assume are fan feeds being streamed into the arena like it’s a giant Zoom meeting. Is that what’s happening? If so, that’s cool as hell. I’ll take my answer off air, thanks."

Most Draymond Green thing ever.
"If they land the Wolves pick outside the Top 3 in 2021, this team is gonna be stacked again.  Steph - Klay - Wiggins - Oubre - Draymond - Wiseman - Paschall - Looney - Wanamaker - Bazemore  And one of Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Suggs. Jalen Green, Scottie Barnes or Zaire Williams."
"42-40 free throws. The Draymond ejection really fucked you guys I'll absolutely concede that, but the whistle was equally quick for both teams. But you can't rely on one player to hold together a very flimsy golden state D. Hell, even with Draymond you gave up 40 points to the 30th ranked offense in the league in the first quarter. Wiseman is promising but still raw, and outside of him there's absolutely no rim protection with Green out. Unless you go out and sign someone I think you're gonna see more games like this one in your future."
Would you believe *Draymond Green* if he said he wasn't cursing at you when he's looking in your direction and is already 1 tech deep?
tbh that is perfectly normal draymond green yelling. He is constantly yelling at his teammates. Communication on defense
"We did have one, but he needs to learn how to respect his teammates. I am glad that the ref stepped in and taught Draymond a valuable lesson about teammate relations, something the ref would know a lot about, more than 3x NBA champion Draymond ""Glue"" Green."
"During the timeout, the refs have called another foul on Draymond Green."
"hey, that happens to be complete bullshit. [green clawed at BOTH of harden's eyes in game 2, his left eye was bloodshot for days, then green pokes at harden's right eye on purpose in game 3](https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/05/05/rockets-draymond-green-pokes-james-harden-eye/). also refer to the images of him poking redick and lebron's eyes in the same season. also refer to him tackling lebron at the end of game 7 in 2016. also refer to him pushing lebrons head into a camera lens in one of the other finals and giving him a permanent scar. also refer to him to committing multiple fouls a game that would get any other player thrown out or fined"
Draymond Green shooting like he has a backpack on is a bigger question.
&gt; people here really think Draymond gets preferential treatment from refs  remember when green was targeting harden's eyes and clawing at them over the course of a whole playoff series and never got called for it
The Curious Ejection of Draymond Green By The Coward [insert ref name here]
"Wiseman had Noel sealed in the post, Green passed it in, but James either gave up or tried to fade to the corner right as Draymond let the ball go, and Nerlens got the easy steal."
This is the softest tech I have ever seen and I watch draymond green
"Not really into favorites, but I do have players that I like to watch all around, besides the obvious ones I'd say Jordan Clarkson, Jaylen Brown, Draymond, Jeff Green, Jeremi Grant  From the new players I liked Quickley a lot and also Cole Anthony since their games against the Cavs."
"""Draymond Green"""
"I’ve said it before, but an analysis of Draymond Green is always a great indicator of basketball knowledge."
what they'd need now is a defensive anchor... maybe a historically great one like Draymond Green?
&gt;Draymond Green
[https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blazers-warriors-draymond-green-gets-in-harkless-head-with-very-specific-trash-talk/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blazers-warriors-draymond-green-gets-in-harkless-head-with-very-specific-trash-talk/)
"I'd agree that he has the tools to develop into the player the Warriors need him to be someday. Seems to have a good attitude about things and whatnot. I also think that Ball and Deni can become very good players in their own right who could have fit the Warriors too. So I'm taking a to be determined approach about how this all turns out.  As an aside, people often say that the Warriors have needed a center. But Draymond Green has been the Warriors best center all throughout their dynastic run. They close games with him when they really want to win, and so long as Draymond is in his prime defensively they should probably still do that. So there's some potential conflict there unless Green declines, or Wiseman explodes."
"&gt; and has a huge narrative that his team is hot trash and he is carrying them  There it is. Andrew Wiggins bust. Kelly Noobre. Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green. /s"
"Definitely not on as large of a scale as Middleton or the other guys listed on this thread, but Larry Nance Jr. is currently in the middle of completely changing his profile as a player.   Career high in PTS, Assists, 3PA and 3P%, while leading the league in Steals. He’s gone from a decent energy big to a Draymond Green-lite type of player. The lack of scoring volume will always keep him out of the mainstream’s view, but he’s been super impressive this year."
A rookie top ten pick is going to step in and replace *Draymond Green* in the starting lineup of a team hoping to compete for a championship?  *Bruh*
"Any deal would have to include GSW losing Wiseman, the Minn pick, Wiggins, and more future picks. GSW would get Beal and filler. GSW would be sacrificing their future for a possibly small increase in their team this year, but would ultimately be planning for just 2022 with Steph/Beal/Klay/Green.   So GSW is getting 2 great guards, an unknown Klay, an aging Draymond, no real youth, and no real size.   I don't see GSW doing this, and WAS can probably get better offers for Beal from other teams. Beal would probably end up on a mid tier contender that feels that Beal will cement them as a top contender."
Draymond will be starting. Whoever we pick will be in a 6/7th man role. I have no doubt that once Klay is back curry and Greens minutes will be reduced but whoever we pick Green or Kuminga pls will be getting like 15-20 a night.
"that's litterally the last time he had the possibility to play in the PO, it was not 5 years ago and this year alone he completely changed the dubs just w/ his presence  but yeah let's pretend the fact that the warriors D is totally transformed (their offense too tbh) when Green comes back is a coincidence  y'all never learn, Draymond is a basketball monster, and yeah any team w/ Curry AND Draymond has a chance vs anybody"
"Yeah, also I wouldn't do that if I were Nash (or KD). But w/ no Allen, he's basically been the help rim defender while DeAndre or Jeff Green play as the ""5"" (basically absorb the body blows lol). Similar to what he did with us, except DeAndre/Jeff Green are not Draymond."
"We were due for a good one after Jordan Poole, Pat McCaw, Festus Ezeli, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones, and Nemanja Nedovic. Granted those were all late 1st rounders and we hadn't had a lotto pick since Harrison Barnes, but not a great track record considering some of the gems we missed out on. Paschall was the only hit since the Draymond Green pick"
I swear that whole season Draymond Green never set a stationary screen
"right after this game ""Draymond, we got the wrong green, we need you, you owe me one anyways, figure your way out"""
"i wasn't a fan of gsw when KD was there but I really cannot imagine one full year of durant being a better defensive player than draymond green. the latter is the core of the GSW defense, he has to be one of the top 5 defenders of last decade."
"He's not a point, ideal position is the Draymond Green secondary playmaking power foward, his inability to accept that he's not a primary ball handler is what's holding him back because he has all the talent to be great if he just accepts that role, currently him being primary ball handler is what's harming not only him but his team, 76'rs would be much better with Shake or Maxey as the primary ball handlers with Ben taking over that job in transition offense and being more willing to screen and roll for drive and kicks in a halfcourt setting"
Draymond Green would be out of a job if they called moving screens
Nets need draymond green out there.
What the fuck Harden?  2 shots?  Lmao come on dude you don't have to start being Draymond Green
Simmons is utter trash dude really is just the Australian Draymond Green
All he needed was to play with a defensive minded vet like Draymond Green    *checks wiggins defensive rating playing with Jimmy butler*
"Bruh, *come on*. This is going to sound insulting but I promise I don't mean it to be but that is one of the worst basketball takes I've seen on this sub (that's not something just outright crazy).  Who is Draymond Green getting moved to the bench for? Eric Paschall? Why do *you* think Draymond Green will be moved to the bench? Because he's not a shooter?  If Kerr was going to change the starting lineup he'd have already moved Damion Lee into Oubre's spot and played Oubre mostly in non-Steph minutes.   Paschall is a scorer first and while he's improved defensively and as a play maker he is **nowhere** near Draymond's level at either.   You have to understand Draymond isn't just about what he does individually. He literally improves everyone on the floor with him. It's not a coincidence the Warriors looked so much better once he finally started playing.   Go watch Warriors games. Watch Draymond every possession. Watch him direct guys on where to go. Watch him call out actions and switches. He literally thinks for all five Dubs on the floor with him.   He's also knocking a lot of rust off and recovering from COVID symptoms that reportedly lingered for him. That high pick and roll with Curry is still one of the most efficient plays in basketball and literally no one in the league does it better.   It makes absolutely zero sense to move Draymond to the bench and it won't happen this season or next season short of some kind of injury that dramatically impacts his ability on the floor."
"hold on  &amp;#x200B;  how?  &amp;#x200B;  Who on his team was better than who the Warriors had? Just because your guys weren't playing well doesn't mean that they weren't better than who Harden had.  &amp;#x200B;  Post-achilles, 2 year layoff Wall, undrafted Christian Wood, completely washed Cousins, Eric Gordon who's been shooting sub 30% from 3 for 2 years, and 36 year old PJ Tucker are supposed to be better than Draymond Green, Oubre, and Wiggins?  &amp;#x200B;  like, you're using an extremely small sample size and drawing some fuckin weird comparisons from it"
Draymond Green. Lmao its concerning how many ppl in this post continue to comment and show love to bums who play like “stars” when there isnt an audience watching.
"*Maybe Dray?*  Draymond Green will be on the team next season and starting, bank on that."
TIL Draymond Green fittingly averages triple single
"Perhaps players' on-court demeanor and persona is different than who they are off the court, and more credence should be given to the people they are off the court when defining who they are? It happens all the time. Draymond Green is a great current personification of it."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green.   6th Man: Eric ""Better Zion"" Paschall  Coach: Don Nelson"
PJ Tucker and Draymond Green should be top 2
"Maxi Kleber, Draymond Green, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson come to mind"
What was your argument? It was the GSW would have a chance with Draymond Green locking up AD. I called you crazy. So eitherway you are wrong. Both your points are batshit insane if you've watched the last 5 years of basketball.
It’s insanity people really think draymond green even slows Davis down lol  Davis with guys like Solomon hill on his team was the best player in that series easily
"If Giannis will not be the closer, that means Middleton or Jrue will be the guys making the decisions down the stretch. Nor sure if Giannis being a much better version of Draymond Green is gonna be enough of a championship winnining combination for the foreseeable future.   Especially since the Nets hydra is gonna be there for at least two more years barring any injuries."
"Eh. Paschall looks great but he’s really the only guy exceeding expectations and that’s only because his minutes at the 5 came as a result of Chriss breaking his leg. Right now the starting 5 has a net rating of -15. The difference in net rating between Steph/Dray/Wiseman lineups and Steph/Dray lineups is more than 30. It takes a lot to create a starting 5 with Steph Curry and Draymond Green that can’t score, but Kerr has managed to make it happen/"
"Not their fault man, you know you gotta throw a hard double with 2 All-Defensive centers to guard *checks vid* Draymond Green."
Draymond green is one of the best. Russel Westbrook is one of the worst but yall arent ready for that conversation
"I'm sorry Lakers in 4 or 5 depending on how nuclear curry goes. You're telling me that kelly oubre, wiggins, draymond green and foul trouble wiseman are gonna take the Lakers to 7????"
They did.  In crunch time they doubled him on every screen and then Draymond started dominating the 4 on 3s.  You know your strategy is bad when it's getting Draymond Green open layups.
"He's an elite defender. So is Marcus Smart. You won't find me slobbering all over him as a player because of his defense. You'll just find me angrily tweeting if he gets snubbed for All-Defense team.  I think the idea of who Ben Simmons could have been blinds people to who Ben Simmons actually is. He's a very good player. But he needs a very specific team built around him, because he has some glaring deficiencies, especially for the modern game. He doesn't shoot well enough to be a 1/4, and he doesn't have the post moves to be a 5. At this point he's super Draymond Green. Nothing wrong with that, but that's not the #2 player on a championship team."
Draymond Green for David Lee too. The kid will be fine the system in golden state is excellent
"I mean that’s how I interpreted that quote. What do you think?  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/10/31/20941852/kevin-durant-left-warriors-free-agency-explanation-nets  “I came in there wanting to be part of a group, wanting to be part of a family, and definitely felt accepted,” Durant told the Wall Street Journal’s J.R. Moehringer. “But I’ll never be one of those guys. I didn’t get drafted there ... Steph Curry, obviously drafted there. Andre Iguodala, won the first Finals, first championship. Klay Thompson, drafted there. Draymond Green, drafted there. And the rest of the guys kind of rehabilitated their careers there. So me? Shit, how you going to rehabilitate me? What you going to teach me? How can you alter anything in my basketball life? I got an MVP already. I got scoring titles.”  “As time went on, I started to realize I’m just different from the rest of the guys. It’s not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it’s like nobody could [give] a full acceptance of me there.”"
Call Draymond Green! Call Draymond Green!  ...but not for me
Bens basically a younger more athletic draymond green right now in that a lot of his value doesn’t show up on the stat sheet.
"It's crazy that he's getting less than 20 minutes a game. With that said,  he's backing up Draymond Green."
Bro you have Draymond Green on your team you should be immune to that shit by now...  Unless you're one of them bandwagon fans that r/nba love to hate
Draymond “Mr. Mayagi” Green
"The reason people aren't freaking out as much is because they don't think style wise the 3 of them will gel (the last 2 games with KD and harden playing certainly look like they're getting along but it's only 2 games and kyrie isn't back). The narratives surrounding harden and kyrie is that they are ball dominant, don't move off ball (for harden) and care more about themselves than the team winning. Whereas the warriors had steph and klay, two selfless stars that would move off ball constantly and didn't mind sharing the shots out and (this is the big difference between the two teams imo) draymond green, probably the most versatile defender in recent memory. The nets have looked sensational on offence the last 2 games, but have won both by very close margins, put a prime DPOY level draymond green on that team and its curtains."
Draymond “not an offensive threat” Green
Draymond Green: Clutch bucket getter
Draymond green noted 4th qtr closer
"Draymond Green is better than Jamal Murray, maybe Simmons too"
"He’s such a unique player. In the same vein as Rodman, but instead of being the greatest rebounder ever he’s just a good rebounder who is also an extraordinary facilitator. I really hope in the future Draymond Green is seen through a similar lense as Rodman and Wallace. I think he’s the best defender of his generation."
"Is it really not plausible for the cavs to bring better defensive personnel and ball handlers? Shit they did it the very next season with guys like rose,wade, clarkson,hill and green. Its not like im saying they could have added Jimmy Butler or something.   Point is that if the GM of the cavs had done a better job with roster construction while bringing in more defensive minded coaches then that series would have been much closer.  But because they didnt they lost convincingly. It wasn’t strictly a case of the warriors being guaranteed a chip  Nobody’s denying their talent but talent alone can only get you so far. Also its always been interesting to me how much the rating of Draymond fluctuates depending on the argument people are trying to make"
"Draymond Green should be a contender for MVP. His value to the team is huge, Steph and the scrubs all immediately improved when he came back. They went from maybe the worst team in the league to a playoff contender."
Draymond Green is hella disrespected now lol
 Steph has Draymond Green   Just kidding
"It's always been that way. Klay? Fucking garbage player whos only considered one of the GOAT shooter because he plays next to Curry. Draymond? Role player. Only successful because he's on the warriors. Iggy was a trash end of bench player. Curry is only good because he plays next to 5 all stars. Curry is getting carried by Green &amp; Klay.   The goal posts have always moved, for years, from ""everyone on the warriors suck and only look good because of XYZ"" to ""warriors are unfair, no parity, 5 all stars"" depending on peoples mood."
"Just to nitpick here a little bit, it’s not slightly better efficiency. When Harden was with Houston he never had an eFG% of over 54%. Curry is currently rocking 61%. That’s a big gap. Also you’re talking about “Can’t carry a team like Harden” but I’d argue Harden has never had teammates this bad, the second best player on this team is either Wiggins or Draymond Green, this team is in contention for the #1 pick without Steph, I get the point you’re trying to make but I think you’re underestimating the talent Harden had around him in Houston."
Cavs were a superteam. Love averaged 26/13 before joining the cavs. Just because he wasnr effective vs draymond green doesnt make that cavs team not absolutely stacked lol. Cavs were heavy heavy favourites both 2015 and 2016 in preseason odds with that big 3. League was shook when love joined kyrie lbj
"I agree with the sentiment of this post. I've thought about writing a guide on how to compare players across eras using stats mostly. This is obviously not a definite answer to such comparisons as stats can't capture the entire body of work a player offers but a lot of the things you talked about can be answered somewhat accurately.  As your post implies, context is the most important aspect of this. IMO the best/better player has to be a breakdown like this:  - What does the player do compared to a league average player in that given year (you can add position to this) - What are his duties and how does his play contribute to winning   Impact on winning boils down to by how much is a team beating other teams with this player in the lineup opposed to not having him. Or to put it in another way: per possession simulated +- over a large sample size. Per possession stats adjust this players teammates to dummies that don't actually exist and they do the same for the opponents. What does player x contribute if his teammates were entirely average players and how hard does he beat his opponent with this team if the opponent also only consists of simulated league average players?  There are problems with this type of comparison as they still have to work with the numbers player x produces in his specific team and role. FOr instance Draymond Green is an All-NBA level contributor in 2016 and per possession based metrics like Raptor ARPM and so on show it. Would Draymond however be possible to contribute in this way offensively if he played on a team without All-NBA level scorers next to him? He'll always be a great contributor on defense but Draymond's offensive prowess heavily relies on the context of his role. He's an elite playmaker but a bad scorer. He must have great scorers around him in order to become the swiss army knife on offense that he can be.   This is where you have to use some common sense and work out the role a player has. This way you can conclude that Draymond will be a great floor and ceiling raiser on defense, but he's only a ceiling raiser on offense.  - Where does player X standout compared to his peers - relative efficiency compared to league average  This is very important when comparing players across era. Just looking at TS% isn't enough here. Looking up leage average TS% for year x and then checking player Y TS is a good start. The best thing to do is to calculate the % of league average TS% to player Y's TS% which results in rTS% I believe. Example  -&gt; Player 1 shoots 60%TS, league average sits at 50%TS for the season  -&gt; Player 2  shoots 39%TS, league average sits at 30%TS for the season  One has 10% above league average, the other 9%. However in relation to league average player 1 shoots 20% better while player 2 shoots 30% better in relation to their era's league average. So player 2 is more ahead of the curve than player 1.  I don't feel like continuing at this point lol, the formating of my comment is pretty bad but these are some explanations and methods you should use when comparing players and there's no way around it. If you use BPM/RAPTOR/RPM/PIPM/LEBRON you should do so on multi-year samplesizes. 538 concluded at one point that BPM is very very close to being just as accurate as tracking based all-in-one +- impact stats btw. So people telling you that BPM sucks aren't correct. The variance between this stats mostly comes up due to the lack of samplesize for that given season. So if you want to compare players on a 5 year sample using bbref's BPM is _fine_. Ofc RAPTOR and PIPM etc use better data so you should use these if possible, but the results will very likely be the same eventually. Don't buy into arguments about which impact stat is the winner in a single-season discussion, they are all victims of variance and on a 5-year sample they are almost identical.  One thing I disagree with is this sentence  &gt; Even going by strictly the eye test as it’s issues.  Going by eye-test has waaay more issues than using stats to support your argument. There's so much going on in NBA-level Basketball, even a nerdy fan will never be capable of capturing the amount of information stats can give you. Unless you're a pro coach or played pro Basketball for an extended time your eye-test will be wrong or based around like 10% of the things that are actually going on. Stats will never replace the human eye - stats are however able to capture everything that's going on consistently and watch every second of a player with maximum attention. Before going by eye-test only you'll always have more accurate results by interpreting the data available correctly."
Hell no... Lillard is not even the conversation of shooting when it comes to Curry... Curry's worst seasons are equal to what dame good seasons... After they started shot tracking... Curry's only contested 3s percentage is better than lillards open shots percentage or his overall percentage... U act like Klay and Draymond were stars like LeBron or Kd coming though the gate... Klay and Draymond were made by Curry... Curry generated their open looks... Put dame back in warriors... Klay would be just a 3 and d guy like Danny green... And Draymond would be atmost a hustle player like faried... Also do u think everybody is a good shooter coming of the screen... Do u why people overcommitt on steph... His release is super quick and he does it in less space and better efficiency... Lillard wouldn't be even able convert half those looks... Also put Lillard on those teams of warriors ain't no way they even making it to the finals... Also lol... How skewed is your argument... Like put Drexler instead of Jordan in those bull's teams... Sure they would win 6 or atleast 4 rings right... Cuz Drexler played like Michael but with just worst efficiency because he had bad supporting casts right... So Drexler is 2nd best or even equal to Jordan.... Lol... Curry's shooting is what made him and warriors... Stop trying to put some shit down...
"First I think ur just as much a dame fan boy as ur telling curry fans are biased... As great as lillard is... Come playoff time it's so easy to spot the difference between curry and lillard... If teams take away the ball from lillards hand by trapping, he can't do much... Take away the ball from Curry's hand and he's still a threat in the court from his offball movement... U say dame's athletic but Curry travels so much on the court if u look at the numbers he's so clear cut from anybody in that aspect... Also u say it doesn't matter if 40% or 45%... Know this curry shot 44/37/90 in the finals against raptors... This what dame averages... People called Steph as a choker because he shot so bad... Let me say it again because he ""Shot so bad""... Curry's worst efficiency is what u call dame's percentage that doesn't matter...  Idk why u guys argue... Curry is a better defender and has better iq... Just cuz he doesn't play primary ball handler role like Curry and average 7 assists doesn't mean lillards a better playmaker... Check out AST ratio to understand who's a better passer... Also stop acting like curry had a great team always... He carried them before 2015 with sub par team's with team like Portland... Also u act like klay and Green were stars coming out of the draft... Curry is what made both of them... Neither Draymond nor Klay can create their own shots... If it was team of only klay and Draymond that team wouldn't even be able generate offense... Curry is what makes the great... CJ literally has carried Dame in series and create is own shots...  Why u dame fan boys gotta like this..."
He's got a Draymond Green effect
there's a guy called quindarry weatherspoon? That may beat draymond green...
Draymond Green unlocks Steph Curry's powers
"Plug in a player who can shoot very similarly to Steph and has for almost as long as him with a much worse supporting cast? Prime Steph has always played with at least 2 All NBA players (and often an all star caliber player off the bench) until now, where has 1 All NBA player and several other good role players (revitalized Wiggins).  Give Dame a bunch of low post split opportunities by rotating around Klay or coming off moving Draymond &amp; Bogut screens and he's putting up stats nearly as good as Steph. Not 2016 regular season Steph, but damn near close considering his stats are comparable and he's been rotting away on the Blazers for years  I'll take it one step further; Dame wins just as many rings as Curry does in his exact situation  Put Dame on the 2015 Warriors (vs 4 straight injured point guards, no Kyrie or Love in the Finals, 2017 Warriors (Kevin Durant on his team vs a historically bad Cavs D) and 2018 Warriors (with KD vs LeBron and Jeff Green as his 2nd best player) and he's very likely winning 3 rings too. I know I'll get downvoted, but it's true."
"No. Draymond was playing in the system. He got the rebound and immediately started the fast break. The defenders have to stop the ball and collapse on him. Draymond knows that that he's now got a trailing Durant open at the three point line, because that's the Warriors system. If you watch the team you've see this play hundreds of times. Green turns to make the pass and finds Durant trotting towards mid-court, clapping for the ball like a prima donna. Durant fucked up. If he was playing in the system and running the floor, that's an easy three.  Also, last I checked, Steph, Klay and Dray are still Warriors, so the question of whether they can win another ring without Durant has not been answered, yet."
I got two words for you: Kevin Durant. Draymond Green. Must see TV.
"Yea Steph is a legend for a reason and it’s pretty much impossible to stop him. I know this might be a controversial take but Steph game 3 vs the raptors is just as impressive as Lebron game 1 vs the warriors in 2018. Like seriously, that man dropped 47 against one of the best defenses of all time, while being in a box and one, and his best offensive option that game was draymond green."
Jeff green will guard draymond prolly
"Draymond Green = almost nobody - got it....For years Dubs fans telling us how he's one of the top 15 players in the league, now he's 'nobody'.."
Draymond Green mentor 😆😂😂🤣🤣🤣......
"not every team has Draymond Green, dude"
I've been saying for awhile that I want Ben Simmons to take on that Draymond Green role on the team.  Just be the facilitator and get easy buckets when they come to you.

"The real super star of the warriors, forget that Steph Curry scrub, forget Kevin ""the Snake"" Durant, forget Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green forget Klay ""Icy Hot"" Thompson"
"I'm no expert but to me, it seems like Oubre has the same issues with the bench as he does with the starters. Its just that on the bench, he doesn't have Stephen Curry to bail him out for his offensive lapses, or Draymond Green to bail him out on his defensive (and offensive) lapses. He forces shots, is constantly shooting contested threes and it genuinely feels like hes playing for his stat sheet. He drives, and I think he's gonna do what Wiggins does and perform a great kick out to the open man, but nope. Contested layup with 3 dudes on him. Its gotten so predictable that defenses can collapse on Oubre in the paint and it works because he doesn't pass. I also wanna mention that Oubre is improving at all of this. Another factor is simply change. Paschall isn't playing well and a part of it can be attributed to being in a slump, but playing with a ball dominant player is another factor. Thats why Kerrs gonna play Oubre with the bench for awhile. After they mesh  together, he wants to see their ceiling. Unfortunately, that means a lackluster bench until they do mesh. How would it be different if he spent time with the first unit? This is all speculation but I think we'd just have our early season bench, which quite literally carried us and was amazing. With Steph out of his slump and Oubre improving, Oubre going to the starters with less bench minutes would let the bench return to what they were and the starters wouldn't be half as bad as the start of the season. I hope I explained it all."
Something about draymond green
"No but statistically speaking, second rounders who are drafted after multiple years in college probably have a 2%? Chance of being in the nba at 30. It’s just the reality. For every Draymond and Brogdon, there’s 25+ guys who don’t make it past a couple years. I’m a warriors fan, I can name many late picks such as  Damion Jones, Jordan Bell, Jacob Evans, Jordan Poole, Patty Mccaw in which we’ve hyped up over the years just to filter out of the league in 2 more years.  Where do you see Paschall playing at age 30? Does he ever become a spot up 4 like a Gallinari, Tobias, Barnes level? Does he become an impact defender, someone like Jaymichael Green, Crowder etc as an undersized 4? Does he become an elite offensive player who sucks at defense like Harrell, Holmes etc? Where’s the fit in today’s nba? Because believe me what he does now, the classic iso in the second unit, where he sucks at defense and spot up shooting won’t last in the nba in another season or two. Turnover is high in the nba if you don’t have a specialized skill"
"I really love Damion Lee on the play waving the other guy to stay for stretching the space after he passed the Draymond, expecting a Curry 1v1, and then immediately go for the potential rebound. And also, Draymond Green is useless. Zero threat to score, and all 10 people on the court knows he'll just screen for Curry there."
[This](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/4/4/11360040/stephen-curry-no-look-towel-draymond-green-water-warriors-nba-video).
"Terrelle Pryor was another athlete who was had crazy accomplishments in both sports. State championships in both sports. First team all American in football, Parade player of the year. Fourth team all American in basketball.  ESPN had him 39th in his recruiting class, 14 spots ahead of Klay Thompson and three spots below Draymond green. And this was with him clearly more focused on football."
"They defended him the same way then. Hell, they still doubled and tripled him a lot of possession even when KD was on the team. The Warriors still run the same system, just with worse players. Without Klay and KD, Steph is free to take any shot he wants. Draymond Green is actually more critical for this system than Klay."
Versatility? Have to take Draymond Green. He’s just way more of a rim protector than Simmons and that’s a massive part of being versatile. Giannis also could have an argument
Just checked and it doesn't really seem like it. There's only been one DPOY since 2007-08 that wasn't able to lead their team to a top 3 defence and that was Tyson Chandler who took a Knicks defence that was 22nd the year prior and brought it to 5th.       |Season|Player|DRTG Rank| :--|:--|:--| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|1st| |2018-19|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2017-18|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2016-17|Draymond Green|1st| |2015-16|Kawhi Leonard|1st| |2014-15|Kawhi Leonard|2nd| |2013-14|Joakim Noah|2nd| |2012-13|Marc Gasol|2nd| |2011-12|Tyson Chandler|5th| |2010-11|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2009-10|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2008-09|Dwight Howard|1st| |2007-08|Kevin Garnett|1st|
I feel like an underlooked aspect in DPOY ranking is a player's ability to communicate on the defensive end. I don't think there is a single player in the game that communicates better on the defensive end than draymond green.
"steph mother fucking curry. holy shit. he was really good, only had too many turnovers.   Wiggins and Oubre have a good offensive game together for what feels like the first time this season  Throw wannamaker on the bench forever, though I think he might be asked to do too much, but rather see his role reduced with wiggins   Draymond green was amazing on defense, he made Vooch really really struggle  Juan Tuscano Anderson's contract better be converted, he's been playing so well in this stretch in the small ball stretch  The defense by the Warriors was elite down the stretch, but i feel like Orlando having 0 point guards contributed to that.   &amp;nbsp;  This game was not pretty, especially in the second. Kinda sucks that Orlando is so hurt tho, they would definitely be better  I definitely feel like Orlando would've been locked for playoffs if they were healthy, esp. with the way Fultz was playing"
Draymond Green is also incredible
draymond green has been phenomenal
Not a troll. There is zero chance I’m talking Donovan Mitchell and Rudy fucking Gobert over Steph Curry and Draymond Green in the playoffs.  Have fun underperforming in the playoffs.
Offensive specialist Draymond Green
What does Clint Capela have to do with Draymond Green?
"Draymond 'James ""Piggyback"" Harden' Green"
Literally how is Draymond Green such a fucking awful scorer now? I don't understand how he can go entire halves without scoring once. You'd think he'd luck into a couple of easy layups or putbacks.
"&gt; Unfortunately, they lack the ultra-smart team defenders that allow a team to play on a string and make great rotations.   So did Draymond Green die?"
"Manu Ginobili, Marc Gasol, Draymond Green, Nikola Jokic, and Norm Powell."
Alt title: Draymond Green is a good passer.
Draymond Green would have been FMVP over Steph if the Warriors had won in 2016.  Simmons hasn't shown anything to suggest he can be at that level or better in the playoffs.
"I don't think he's far better than Draymond Green at all. At his best Draymond has dominated playoff series, like the 2019 WCF (averaged 17/12/9 with 2.3 steals and 2.8 blocks) while Simmons has yet to play at a high level in the playoffs.      Draymond has also had some very under the radar playoff games like:      - Game 7 2016 vs CLE: 32/15/9 on 11/15 shooting.   - Game 3 2016 vs POR: 37/9/8 WITHOUT Steph Curry playing.     - Game 4 2016 vs POR: 21/9/5 with 4 steals and 7 blocks.   - Game 6 2019 vs TOR: 11/19/13 with 2 steals and 3 blocks."
"To me he's basically a better Draymond Green a far better Draymond Green, he'll never be a superstar but he's a star"
"The best part of his game imo, is the fact that on top of these stats he impacts the game heavily as a floor general/glue guy.   He's in that same mold as Jimmy Butler/Draymond Green when it comes to making an impact beyond the stat sheet"
Draymond green cmon now!!
"Probably Draymond Green. Won 3 titles in 5 straight finals overall, made all stars games, won DPOY, most dominant playoff defender of his era and will have made minimum $180 million+ in playing salary alone. And yes, he is a role player...just an all time great one."
"Yes siakam upped his assist totals this season compared to the previous ones. He’s trying to create more from the top of the key and is really having a great 3week-month stretch of not being predictable offensively. He’s also trying to limit his spin isos so that’s good. What I’m trying to say is if you watch the games, Grant’s scoring repertoire (the ways he can score) greatly exceeds Siakam’s. This is not an indictment on Siakam’s value, I’m just saying that they are two different players. Siakam’s rise is more about his playmaking and motor (i dont like this comparison but he’s closer to Draymond Green than he is uh KD - sorry it was really hard to make a comparison and finding a forward that’s versatile offensively). And yes to be straightforward I mean offensive opportunities for himself. The reason why I said “baller” is cos in a vacuum (defensive schemes, plays, offensive principles aside) siakam is a limited offensive player one on on than grant. Which says a lot since most people thought Grant’s just a 3 and d guy"
LeBron James/Draymond Green isn't in the video tho?
"I said what I said! Lol I’ll MAYBE give Simmons the edge this year and only this year. I’ll give you that since Melo is fresh out the gates.   But in today’s game I don’t rubber stamp ‘experience’ as makin guys better. For reference, over a year ago I said Jaylen brown was better than Khris Middleton ans this sub was up on arms. How does that look? So yea I don’t follow narratives or base it on experience, I go by their straight up game. So for for a list of best PGs for next year yea I’m ranking Melo higher. He’s that good and Ben is that bleh.   And I know what people will do: the first thing they’ll mention when talking about Ben—-is the *Sixers* success. Dead giveaway. People do the same with Draymond green. I don’t conflate a team’s success with a players actual game. A player can be a good fit and you can’t get accustomed to seeing them win WITH him, but that doesn’t make the individual player better then what he is. 76ers are this good bc of Embiid, chemistry, Tobias, and Doc (contrary to popular belief he is a good reg season coach). Yes Ben plays good D but it’s overblown at this point. He will be the reason they get booted in the playoffs bc he can’t score"
all but 2 were assisted by warriors point guard draymond green
"You’re downplaying Draymond so much. He’s not just a versatile defender. He’s possibly the best defender of this generation. His timing is nothing short of genius. Warriors have one of the best defense in the league for opponents fg percentage and Draymond plays a huge role in that. Wiseman is leading rookies in blocks and Wiggins has the most blocks for a non big man with both of them being top 20 in the league for blocks bc of Green’s help D. Also, we don’t need Draymond putting up crazy amount of rebounds bc that’s not his role. You saying that Draymond isn’t that valuable bc he doesn’t get a lot of rebounds is like saying steph Curry isn’t valuable bc he doesn’t get enough blocks. Green is a facilitator not a typical big man. We measure his success and how valuable he is based on the role he is given, which is to facilitate and defend. We can see that he is exceeding in that role very well as he is 8th in the whole league for assists, ahead of guards like Lillard, Fox, Lowry, and Brogdon. Without Draymond, the warriors cannot play well. We saw what happened with Draymond out in the beginning of the season. Their first 2 games were ugly losses and ppl called Curry washed. Draymond comes back, Curry drops 62. We saw in the Knicks game, it was a close game then Draymond gets ejected, the warriors play then falls apart, warriors lose by double digits. The offense really runs through Draymond. Curry who is double teamed constantly is much more effective off the ball and needs someone to facilitate. Draymond is irreplaceable for the Warriors and when Klay comes back, the Warriors will be scary bc Draymond is constantly finding open shooters, but they just can’t knock it down. Warriors fans know this year we don’t have a chance but next year we really do."
As an OKC fan with really shitty internet...I can't believe I'm upvoting something that has to do with draymond green
"For other All Time great defenders I have to include Ben Wallace, Draymond Green, David Robinson, Kawhi, Jordan, Pippen, and probably a couple more if I had to add. It's gonna take some amount of post season success to solidify yourself as one of the best defenders in NBA history."
i think this is the better tnt cast  chuck kenny ernie and draymond green lol
And yet Draymond Green cant score in the nba lol

"You never watched basketball, you just follow the circlekerjk, the litmus test to see if people watch basketball and can make their own conclusion is their opinion about Draymond Green, you failed the test badly."
"People wanna see absurd video game stats like the ones Westbrook and Doncic are putting up. Not essential triple singles that are arguably have a pound for pound larger impact than those flashy stats and highlights. Just ask people what they think of Draymond Green. Fucking casuals all over social media keep roasting Green and Simmons for their shooting woes. When you have allstar attached to your resume, dumb casuals assume you put up absurd ppg on relatively high efficiency coz that’s how shallow they are. It do really be like that. They gonna find any flaw they can think of, even to the point where they keep moving the goalpost."
They don't have a Draymond Green. If you REALLY understand team basketball and why teams win/lose games then you know how important it is to have a defensive anchor like that.  Without Draymond (Igoudala too) the Warriors would've been strictly a finesse run and gun team.
This is completely false  The reason KD/Curry weren’t given serious consideration is because they ALSO had Klay Thompson and fucking Draymond Green   That’s four all stars and it’s the same reason why KD/Harden won’t be given serious consideration because they’re also playing with Kyrie.   On the lakers it’s just Lebron and AD and the rest of the team.   I don’t know how y’all are so naive when it comes to this
For the 4th straight year the best litmus test to see if somebody actually watches basketball or just watches box scores is to ask their opinion on draymond green
"Bruh are you really fucking comparing THT to Draymond fucking Green?  Not even in the same stratosphere of defense, playmaking, passing, etc"
Draymond “JR Smith” Green
I mean. Draymond Green was an all star on 10ppg on 42 FG%.
"If you watch the clip closely, White was in a normal defense stance. 1 arm out, 1 arm under. Draymond may have read it incorrectly, but when you have the greatest shooter next to you while he was not doubled, you pass to him. Obviously it is a good strat to foul Draymond to force him shoot 2 FTs, but also they don't have to do it. The risk is too high. Would you bet Draymond Green to sink a 3, or he draws a foul for 3 FTs and make all 3?"
Draymond Green are you Outside of your mind?
"I am not arguing that Draymond is more important than the other three. For my money, on the KD Warriors, he was the second most impactful and third best player, though I can respect divergent opinions.  You are arguing that GSW had their success because of their other three stars, and said as much. However, the stats I linked undermine this argument since we see Green having an elite impact. You argue that this is a product of playing with elite teammates, but I believe that PIPM factors this in.   To me, this is a huge point of your argument - you're saying that Green's PIPM is inflated because of good teammates, and that Klay's BPM is unfairly hurt from playing more with the bench. However, both stats account for teammates, I am not citing on/off numbers which WOULD be unfairly skewed.  In sum, I have provided statistics that show that playoff Draymond had a huge impact. I do not feel like you have proven sufficiently that PIPM should be discounted, given that it does account for teammate quality."
"Draymond ""Matt Barnes"" Green"
Isn’t this what Durant got mad towards Draymond about that one time? Green has no business taking game winning shots lol
"That’s why KD left. All the Warriors players walk on eggshells around Draymond and it’s hard to call out Draymond if he makes boneheaded plays like these. If you call out Draymond he will try to fight you like he did with Steve Kerr back in 2016 or go personal like he did to KD. Green is out of control &amp; the team let’s him get away wit everything &amp; they won’t call him out on anything based on his role on the team as the leader. Not hating on him but he’s not qualified to yell at Wiseman the way that he does.  For plays like this, someone on the team has to call out Draymond about this bad play that made them lose the game but everybody is scared of Draymond. The play Draymond did was unacceptable, Draymond is not a scorer &amp; has no business taking a shot like that for the last shot, the ball should’ve been in Curry’s hand. I’m not a Warriors fan but I want to know how GS fans feel about Draymond. I just don’t get how a guy has so much power on the team but averages 5 PPG 5 RPG on 33% shooting &amp; 19% from 3 &amp; how can a guy be a leader of this team wit his temperament who feels he can yell at everyone who does a mistake but if someone calls out his mistakes he reacts in a negative way. From a GS fan perspective tell me why Draymond is worth the headache for your team"
"I assume it was more that, down 3 with one possession left, he figured they would foul to force 2 FTs rather than risk giving up 3. So as soon as White leaned in, Green reflexively threw it up, to try to ensure he would still get 3 FTs.  But I'm not sure if that's the case -- Draymond is usually really tuned into team/coach tendencies, and I don't think that is Pop's style. (Which clearly proved to be the case, since White didn't go for a foul.)"
"Draymond ""people think they know basketball but they don't"" Green."
"Draymond ""Steph Cyrry"" Green: Don't worry, I got this..."
"Draymond wasnt superstar level, even tho he had some superstar performances like in game 7, and its obvious that Curry, Kd and Klay were a much bigger reason to the GSW success than Green idk why anyone would think Green was the main player that drove the Warriors sucess instead of this 3."
"Draymond ""SUPER BBIQ"" Green"
"Honestly, if you look closely, Derrick white looks like he was about to foul Draymond  Green. I seriously think that was the case here."
"That’s why KD left. All the Warriors players walk on eggshells around Draymond and it’s hard to call out Draymond if he makes boneheaded plays like these. If you call out Draymond he will try to fight you like he did with Steve Kerr back in 2016 or go personal like he did to KD.

OK but if you foul then you don't get to see Draymond Green launch a halfcourt shot with five seconds left
Draymond “jr smith” green
This. If you look at the data the most efficient team would be 4 always defending and draymond ‘the human catapult’ green at half court just ready to lay siege to the opposing team’s basket.
Draymond JR green
"Give him credit for 2015 and 2016 at least lol. They were a Stephen Curry injury and Draymond Green suspension away from going back to back and even still, they almost pulled it off."
"You seem to be forgetting about Draymond Green, Iggy and Shaun Livingston (and many others)"
"Warriors had a DPOY in Draymond and Iggy, next to KD/Steph/Klay  Nets it’s Harris/Brown/Green next to KD/Harden/Kyrie"
"Draymond green was never a top 20 player. So we can just agree to disagree there. I view players separate from their circumstance. And I’d like to think Draymond’s current status—-he’s still in his prime, he aint been hurt, he’s still young, why wouldn’t he still be top 20 if he was then—- confirms that for everyone else.   As far as Gobert top 20, among many others you’d have to have him ahead of his own teammate—-which is comical considering the man averaged 45 a game in the playoffs—-as well as others who are vastly superior. Just bc it’s a fun practice my 20 in no order:   Bron, AD, Kawhi, PG, Harden, KD, Kyrie, Steph, Giannis, Embiid, Luka, Jokic, Lillard, Tatum, Brown, CP3, Jimmy, Beal, KAT, Mitchell.   How many of those are even debateable? Jaylen Brown? Only if you’re stuck on name recognition. Cp3? His argument is basically the same as Gobert.  “Effecting winning”. KAT? I’d much rather an elite offensive player like KAT and find a cheap defensive center as opposed to have Gobert and need to find elite offense."
"Don't think Draymond Green is the best example here for your point. He was a bonafide top 10 player in 2016 and is proof that defensive centric player CAN be among one of the top players in the league. Obviously Draymond is a better offensive player than Gobert but that's why Gobert isn't a top 10 player, but a top 20 player. You can't name 20 players that have more of a impact on basketball than Gobert."
"🙄 No tf he’s  not.    The league is loaded. The mvp front runners (Embiid and Jokic) are barely top 10. Kyrie Irving—-KYRIE IRVING—-whos at 27ppg on like 50-50-90, is outside of many top 15’s.   Gobert is a deserving all star but last year was proof: defense-centric players  only get you so far. If you can’t score there’s a cap to how good you are.   Are we not learning anything from Draymond Green? Gobert is more Draymond green—-big time plus player and key cog but still not a star—-than star player. Gobert has been there for years and they were never this good. It’s not all him. It’s Conley finally healthy, Mitchell ascending , and cohesion of the role players"
"""My sub will kick your sub in the balls"" - Draymond Green"
draymond green. whiney bitch who thinks way too highly of himself
He’s getting traded for Draymond Green lmao
"I would never trade him Draymond.  My point was, for salary cap purposes, it would be almost impossible to make a deal without either Draymond or Wiggins' salary being included.     The Mavs would be trading for the picks, Wiggins or Green would be salary cap filler."
The big name you forgot is Draymond Green. He’s an all time great off ball defender too.
Warriors Game 3 2019 finals by most minutes played Steph Curry Draymond Green  Quin Cook Andrew Bogut Alphonso McKenny
"&gt;Draymond Green was the best defender in the league for a few years  Dray was an incredible defender but he was never as dominant &amp; impactful overall as Gobert has been for the past 4 seasons  &gt;(Dray) was a far better offensive player than Rudy at his peak.  Sorry, but that's just not true. Like, at all."
You think Simmons initiates the offence 90% of the time? That’s higher than James Harden Rockets numbers.   He brings the ball up the court then becomes a screen setter in the half court waiting for a defensive lapse or a quick person to shoot a pass off to.   If you think he is a point guard than so is Draymond Green.
Draymond Green was the best defender in the league for a few years and was a far better offensive player than Rudy at his peak. No one considered him a superstar. You have to be elite offensively to be a superstar.
"The return of draymond green from his injury took the warriors from arguably the worst team in the league to a legitimate playoff team in the west , your best defensive player being missing makes a huge difference. With your logic you'd probably say draymond is more important to the warriors than Steph is"
Draymond Green is a dumb fuck. His statement regarding Drummond were so stupid and not anything close to being profound. All it did was show how stupid Draymond can be.
"As Draymond Green once said ""You thought you was Kobe?"""
Thad can stay as long as he wants. He’s been like our version of Draymond Green. We’re a different team when he’s on.
"Draymond has accolades outside of just championship rings, whereas Derek Fisher and Danny Green (except for 1 All-Defense selection) do not.  DPOY, 5x All-Defensive Team, 3x All-Star, 2x All-NBA, 1 Olympic Gold Medal"
So does Danny Green  Although I personally think Draymond belongs in the hall of fame considering his all star appearances and DPOY awards plus an Olympic gold medal  Just saying rings aren’t the only argument
"Harden has had some very good teams as well. That 65 Rockets team was a championship level team that just got injured at the wrong time. Also worth mentioning that Kawhi had the series of his life in round 2 where he was getting next to no support scoring the ball.  Either way I just think Kawhi’s scoring is more consistent while Harden’s is more volatile. Kawhi can reach Harden’s highs while hitting his lows far less often.  &gt;If CP3 was healthy in 2018, the Rockets very likely win it all. Just CP3 alone... vs the best team of all time and Harden almost won it all. Meanwhile Kawhi was a no show vs a Warriors team with Quinn Cook and Jonas Jerebko getting significant minutes  This is a weird argument. You chose the two nobodies on a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. And like I said he was nowhere near a no show. 28.5 ppg on 60 TS% is right there with some of Harden’s best series Harden’s ever had."
Draymond Green never was as good as Donovan is today? Marc Gasol never was as good as Donovan?
Dude. I hate Draymond Green.
Who decided that Draymond Green was the team tough guy?
I’m not sure he really even directed profanity at Hayward  He smiled at him when they thought it was a jump.  I never saw a bit of reaction from Hayward and Hayward did nothing to Draymond.    Glad Green sees the second T as out of control.  The first was likely wrong
Top 10 in total assists:  |Rank|Player|Total Assists| --:|:--|--:| |1|James Harden|289| |2|Trae Young|267| |3|Nikola Jokić|256| |4|Luka Dončić|254| |5|LeBron James|246| |6|Chris Paul|238| |7|Damian Lillard|221| |8|Draymond Green|211| |9|De'Aaron Fox|206| |10|Ben Simmons|206|
"The first tech was for ""directing profanity at"" Gordon Hayward. That's a pretty ridiculous call with 8 seconds left and no altercation.  The second tech was completely deserved and entirely due to Draymond losing his temper. [Draymond gets that](https://twitter.com/DrewShiller/status/1363941323988951040):  &gt; Draymond Green on his double-tech ejection in Charlotte: ""As I had time to let the whole thing marinate, I was dead-ass wrong. And not that I was wrong for the first tech, but once I have the first tech -- I can't get the second tech. I'm still a bit disappointed in myself."""
"I would take next season Green/Thompson/Wiggins as a better trio on defense than  Simmons/Draymond/Embiid..... you will see that next season, just wait!"
"I would go out on a limb and say the political stance they took over the past 12 months.  Not saying it’s right or wrong, but people don’t turn on a basketball game to hear what draymond green thinks about social justice"
"Falls in the 'Hate him if  he's not on my team' category for me. Other notable players in the category: Marcus Smart, Draymond Green."
Nobody listens to thibs. Didn’t he want Draymond Green. We got.. was it.. marquis teague???
"The shove and then mocking Green after. If it was just a hard screen and an accident, it's a rough sport stuff happens. But dude was busy laughing at Green after, wtf? A shove down and then laughing, and that was just one of his questionable plays this game.  Man, people complain about Draymond Green but it's more believable that he screws up than it is PBev, and even Green doesn't laugh about kicking someone in the nuts or raking their eyes (which is also shitty)."
they should consider hiring Draymond Green
Seriously. Clippers and Draymond green had huge beef on the court during our lob city rivalry but our players would club with him after games. It’s not that serious lol

"Draymond Green called this ""the worst tech I've ever seen""."
"Draymond Green -- and this isn't even just about what he did last night. There's a reason why you almost never see someone be near the top of the assists leaderboard while having fewer points than assists -- it leads to opponents just sagging off to overplay the passing lanes. Those assists he racks up are a bit misleading -- he's very predictable when he has the ball and it leads to a lot of TOs. On defense, he has a tendency to needlessly overhelp."
"I’ll do what I want, whateva -Draymond Green"
"Their reasoning is actually even more inane than that.  &gt; Here at For The Win, we might be a bit over-protective of Draymond Green. The reason is pretty simple: He so often speaks his mind in ways that other athletes are unwilling to do."
Let me introduce you to a Draymond Green
Draymond Green ruined his teams chance to win by being a dumbass
"Name em..... Steph still has his 2nd, main ball handler in draymond green."
As someone who is not a Draymond Green fan and also as someone who bet on the Warriors here... this is the most satisfying way I could have lost money last night.
"I, for one, am SHOCKED that Draymond ""I want to kick someone in the nuts even if it costs my team a championship"" Green found a way to get himself ejected during a crucial point in a game."
Fuck draymond green and his little dick
"No, Draymond affected the game. Instead of grabbing the ball, he taps it. He's late to wrap up the ball giving up a timeout. He gets pissed about his own mistake and blames it on the ref and got T'd up as a warning. He kept going because he doesn't give a fuck about his team, the game, his teammates, his coach, anything - he's just a deluded scrub who's convinced himself he can never be wrong (which is he goes on tirades against his teammates for the slightest of mistakes, while ignoring his own).  Draymond Green costs games and has cost them a championship. At what point do you cut the toxic aging scrub posting up shitty numbers who values himself more than the team? I'd say it's long past due."
Draymond Green VS The World (except the Warriors)
"Draymond is just like the hulk. He has one of the highest BBIQ’s in the game, but becomes stupid when he gets angry.  …Plus, Draymond’s last name is literally ‘green’, coincidence?"

"The refs 101% made the right call. A 10 year veteran in Draymond Green should know so much better than to continue berating refs, especially at that stage of the game."
"I wonder will the Warriors fans claim ""if we had Draymond Green we would have won the game"" like they did against the Cavs in 2016 Finals when this moron got himself suspended?"
That’s because one is draymond green and the other is Lebron James
Another update: Draymond Green was not out there at the end of the game either.

"I was inspired by drake’s line in “Western Road Flows” see in the rap song he raps “Your best day my worst day, I get green like earth day” So with that inspiration I used my intuition to form this reply, using Draymond as an example since he isn’t a box score stuffer. And most of his impact is not on the box score, knowing that a good portion of this sub are casuals I made that assumption that people would overreact to a draymond box score."
Is this a new meme or just coincidence? People were saying he threw the spurs game too. Why would Draymond Green of all players be throwing games? Why can't two boneheaded plays just be boneheaded plays?
Draymond Fucking Green will go down as the most overrated basketball player to ever live...”his stats dont show his impact!!” Stupid mf he is so brutal but all dubs fans love him because he is so slightly above average on defense holy fuck id rather have marcus smarts UGLEH AHHHS than this stupid mf

"Well... Refs is human and can make mistake too and I don't want to blame Refs much. However, I hope that they could at least replay that to make sure the TO is the right call? They didn't even look at it? It is 10 sec before final and they can watch the replay.  &amp;#x200B;  idk what Draymond Green thinking. Sure that might be a wrong call from Refs, but to think a bigger picture. Draymond Green should have hold his temper, right? If he think about winning the game then he should have hold his temper and not stupidly get 2 T and give them 2 points for free."
Dr. Green &amp; Mr. Draymond?
Draymond piece of shit green fucking sucks donkey balls. The dude is trash and lost me $250 straight up bet on warriors. Fuck him. I’m fucking livid.
"Warriors up 8. Terry Rozier hits 3 of the most insane shots you’ve ever seen, Oubre also with an insane 3 for the Warriors in between.   Warriors up 2 with the ball with the clock running down. They miss a shot with 12 seconds left, and LaMelo and a Warriors player jump on it, jump ball. Scrappy jump ball, Heyward grabs it and falls down, and Draymond reached down to grab it too. But they awarded the Hornets the timeout first... and here’s where it gets crazy. Draymond does what he always does and mouths off. So the refs give him a technical or maybe a double technical and he gets ejected.   So the hornets get 2 free throws. Rozier hits both. Then they get the ball back and Terry hit what can only be described as one of the most inanely off balance flying through the air prayer shots of all time, but he was on FIRE. So he hit it as the clock buzzed and the Hornets win.   My mind is still processing, what a treat.   Draymond Green is BIG angry and"
Yo fuck Draymond Green
"Draymond ""BBIQ"" Green"
Draymond green is an absolute SWAMP DONKEY
Dude fuck draymond green mother fucking piece of shit
Draymond green should have known better and shut the fuck up
Draymond Green lose the game.   He just can't hold his temper for 10 more second game
"""What a blunder by Draymond Green!""  I fucking love the Hornets announcers."
Draymond Green is an idiot.
Draymond Green is acting like a dumbass right now.
Draymond green making a 3 is always a weird sight nowadays.
"Ben Simmons vs Draymond Green, who has the bigger ratio of ""Good at the game/bad at shooting"""
Is Draymond Green the worst shooter in the league?
Man thats some bullshit. The man was doing everything right and was playing with his college mate John wall. Now I know where draymond green was coming from.
"Draymond Green had a triple double with assists, rebounds and steals few seasons ago. It's the only recorded triple-double without points."
I’ll say either a poor man’s Charles Barkley with better defense or a better version of Ben Wallace/Draymond Green/Dennis Rodman.
"Defensive stats as a whole are pretty suspect, look at someone like Draymond Green, most of his defensive impact can't be detected by stats"
"&gt; The Warriors can overload to stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making them pay for it.  Yea and if you replace the Warriors with the Lakers in 2020 the statement still holds true. You could even count Russ as one of those ""frontcourt players"" because the Lakers defended him like one.  The Rocket's equivalent of the Draymond play the article describes would have been something like Tucker or Jeff Green rolling to the middle of the floor to receive a pass from Harden when he was doubled. Just by doubling Harden the Lakers forced them into that action SO many times. But Tucker and Green were limited by their ball skills in that situation and did not want to dribble or hold the ball for long. The Lakers helped very aggressively off of shooters and then other defenders would rotate to wherever the help came from to basically nullify whatever advantage the roller initially had. They would also help off of Russ very liberally so often AD, who usually was on Russ, would be pestering the roller as well, making their job even harder. Tucker and Green just aren't quick decision makers and neither were any shooters that they may have gotten the ball to. The Lakers played in the gaps so well that they were always able to recover to wherever the ball went next and no one was quick enough to exploit an advantage.   The Rockets kept going to that action though because they just didn't really have any other options. The only other thing they did try, and it was actually decently effective, was just letting Harden or even Russ work in the post. I saw a lot of people talk about how they should have gone to that more and I think I mostly agree, but I don't think it was terribly efficient offense and the Lakers could consistently run lineups with multiple solid post defenders."
"Draymond Green showed me what clutch defense was every time we played the Warriors in the playoffs the last few years. We had a lead in alot of those games, a big lead in a few of them but it was always inevitable Dray would flip the switch and somehow be stopping practically everything"
So Royce O’Neale is a Draymond Green
100%.  We don't have a Draymond Green/Chris Paul/Jimmy Butler who forces guys to stay active/aggressive on the floor.
Pascal had a Draymond Green game tonight. His defense/playmaking was so crucial in the clutch.
Pascal had a Draymond Green game tonight. Holy fuck his defense was phenomenal.
"Chris ""Draymond Green"" Paul"
Draymond Green has been fined. The issue is considered solved.
"...the warriors have all 3 of their centers out.  Oh also had Draymond Green out, who was playing center.  And did I forget Klay Thompson?"
"Draymond ""Stephen Curry"" Green"
"&gt; Harden doesn’t play with anyone who makes his life easier in the way Draymond and Durant do for Steph Curry. [The play that sealed Game 6 for Golden State](https://twitter.com/connectwidutpal/status/1127056521232175105)  (a Thompson 3 with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter) summed up the  difference between the two teams. Houston blitzed a pick-and-roll  between Steph and Draymond, creating a four-on-three opportunity for  Draymond at the 3-point line. He drove into the lane and found Iguodala  in the corner, who then swung the ball to Thompson. There is no one on  the Rockets’ roster who can consistently make the play that Green did.  Draymond is a legitimate point forward. Neither Capela nor Tucker is  comfortable making plays off the dribble. The Warriors can overload to  stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making  them pay for it.    this is total facts"
Draymond Green would complain about the double standard because both coaches can wear the same color suit.
Yea draymond green is very good at defense. It’s almost like he should get talked about more for DPOY.
Because he is kinda disappointing he was a number 1 pick with the tools to become the next lebron james and has become instead supercharged draymond green
"The difference in the two teams' styles is jarring, to say the least. They really couldn't be more different.  [The Warriors are 1st in 2pt %Ast'd, the Blazers are dead last, by a lot](https://i.imgur.com/7MhFbbP.png). The Blazers do a pretty shitty job leveraging Dame into high-percentage looks from 2.  The Warriors throw the 6th most passes per game. The Blazers? 30th. Source: https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/passing/?sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1  Dame is totally self-created. I wonder how he would perform playing with someone like Draymond Green to set him up, or an actual offense where Dame doesn't have to do fucking everything.  Curry is 3rd in VORP, Dame 6th, which I think is just about fair. Curry is better this season, but not by that much."
significantly worse. what made golden state unreal was they were the best offensive AND defensive team. Draymond green/iggy/KD/Klay was an unreal defensive lineup. They were the best playoff defense like 4-5 years in a row under Kerr.
Having Pat Bev on my team made me stop disliking Draymond Green.  Sometimes you need a sometimes unhinged and often obnoxious loud mouth to get the rest of your team to play focused.  We're simply not the same without Pat Bev and I can finally appreciate how Draymond's value exceeds his already great box score contributions.
"And Isiah Thomas went 12-6 against Jordan before the Pippen joined.  So what do you have to say about that?  &amp;#x200B;  Curry is a great player who also had an unbelievable supporting cast. Klay, Draymond, Iguadola and later Durant.  Both of these things can be true at the same time and it doesn't put Curry down.  Who did Dame have?  There are better stats to compare 2 players. Playoff wins are not that.  &amp;#x200B;  If you still have any doubt, think about it like this. For all those 10 games, swap Curry and Dame.  Do you think Portland does a 10-0 sweep?  Durant, Green, Iguadola, Klay, Dame vs Aminu, McCollum, Vonleh, Turner, Curry.  Who do you think is going to win this?"
"yeah, they were down to just Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodola"
"I'd argue he's the perfect size for today's NBA. He's not tall, but he's got a 7'1"" wingspan, so he's plenty long. Any bigger and he'd be too slow to defend perimeter players. Any smaller, and he'd have trouble with big men.  Longevity... he's still going, leading the Warriors to a top 10 defense this year (probably better at this point). You mentioned Marc Gasol, who made an all defensive team 1 time. Not saying he sucked otherwise, but c'mon.  Shot blocking, ok, that's fine. He averages more than guys like Kawhi, though.  Rim protection, not sure where you get that from. He's had some amazing years protecting the rim. Source: https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/74982/the-big-number-draymond-green-might-be-the-best-rim-protector  Rebounding, ok, that's fine. He's a solid rebounder, nothing spectacular.   Endurance... not sure where you got this idea from? When has his endurance ever been a question? He had a slow start this season due to COVID, but I don't recall anything other than that.  Emotional intelligence, I guess that is fair. It's definitely cost him at times in his career. But it's also what makes Draymond Draymond. It's a positive more than a negative for him, in my opinion.   I just don't really see the points you're trying to make at all."
Draymond Green - CJ Watson
"It is but I think that 6/14 isn't really very good for any NBA player. Take a guy like Draymond Green. He's lost his shot. But he still hits them now and then. But if he goes 6/14, that's WAYY too many shots for him to be taking to get 6 makes. Any player in this league that is taking 14 threes in a game should be a great shooter. Like a Dame or a Steph. And for those types of guys, 6/14 isn't a ""good"" night. It's a satisfactory one at best. And yeah. Kelly Oubre should also NOT be shooting 14 three point shots unless he's hitting 10 of them."
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
"If u were building a team and u had to pick a player to build around, would u pick Bradley Beal or Draymond. I don't get why its so hard to understand. Is Draymond probably better than Beal all time? I would say so, but he is an all star role player, while Beal has the potential to be a superstar considering that he is just entering his prime. This post is talking about a redraft and most GMs would pick Bradley Beal as their franchise player to build around than Draymond Green."
"Why would they select Beal over Dray? Youre forgetting a whole bunch of aspects. First of all, it's not about who the better player is rn. It's about 2012, who would they have drafted if they could see the future and what that player could amount to. As of rn, they'd 100% select Draymond Green. A DPOTY, Olympic gold medalist, x3 NBA champion, x3 all nba defensive team, and he's still pretty good to this day. Bradley Beal? What has he done? Couple time all star? Dray's done that. He's never been a scoring champion, he could be this year but the season's not even over yet so you cant give him that. Im taking Dray"
"I mean that's your own opinion, however if u were to redraft, I am sure 99% that most of the GMs would select Beal over Draymond. Leading the NBA in scoring is harder than you think it is. You can't deny the fact that Green got lucky with the situation he was put in. Draymond is a ceiling raiser while Beal if given the right pieces is a floor raiser."
"Wtf are YOU smoking? This isnt who's better rn. Draymond Green is a legend, idgaf. He has accolades at least"
Ya we need Draymond Green standing up there as the shooters curl. The Blazer version hasn't looked good. Nurk can pass decently up there but that's about it on this roster.
Superstars are the best of the best. It depends on the player. DWade was a superstar on the Heat. Draymond green is not a superstar though.
Perhaps “skill wise “ he’s the best defender but he’s not the most impactful defender. Personally in the the playoffs I’d still take draymond green.
Current players only: Draymond Green KL Jimmy G Buckets Brogdon Giannis  Fucking dope
"So you believe that if the Warriors traded Draymond Green, KD would have stayed? Idiotic take. Warriors FO won the team 3 titles in 4 years and assembled possibly the greatest team of all time; they’re also currently listed as the team with the second highest value, they certainly did not fuck up."
"Point guard is more critical but you need post and rim defense in some way, shape, or form.  If you gave me Draymond Green and Mitchell Robinson, I'd be in a good spot defensively but I'd be in a great spot with an elite scoring or playmaking 1."
[That ](https://youtu.be/I45MKJZuJf8) was a nice response from Draymond. [That](https://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/amp/Reporter-who-asked-Draymond-Green-about-Houston-7377269.php) guy was fired after that.

"I don't think they'll be traded but I hope they do, and that's Draymond Green. He's getting paid $20+ million a year to pass and play well once every 3 games. I don't think he'll be traded simply because he was part of their championship runs, but this season he hasn't proven to be worth that much money, and he's only going to get older and worse and more expensive."
"Well this is an interesting debate, so I Will talk about It from my experience.   I believe that It really depends on the defender posture. Normally, an offensive action requires different positioning that can easily lead to injuries. For example, kawhi's injury caused by Zaza Pachulia is a clear example. Any push from a defender to any attacker in the end could lead to a horrible fall. So a flagrant is more than obvious.  However as a defender you are in less compromising positions than as an attacker. It also is more difficult to do these kind of dirty plays when attacking the basket, probably because they are more visible.   But, It is true that certain plays should be really penalized as flagrant 2. Perhaps a rough Contact with the defender created by the shooter is not that big of a deal, but for example a Draymond Green nutkick should really be instant flagrant 2.  This is my own interpretation though, as there are Many of others in this Matter."

"I want to say Tatum but he's very good for only being 23, but we'll see how his late 20s are.   Probably Draymond Green."
Draymond Green isn't a playmaker. Change my mind.
"They've potentially got a 4-7th pick of the draft.  So it could be Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman.  Potentially Jalen Green or Kuminga. Would they bring Oubre back?   Bench doesnt have the likes of Iguodala, Livingston, or Barbosa but the first 7 should be equivalent to the pre-KD Warriors, just more grizzled now."

"The new models don’t give you raw on/off data. They use the on/off data as a regression for box score priors along with other data like the new player tracking data, and then they test their models against years of data to see how accurate they are. They’re generally accurate enough to have some value, and are especially more useful than box score models.   &gt;	Box score models dont measure any real defensive impact, but they definitely give you good offensive impact estimate.  The Box score does a pretty good at capturing offense so it’s not surprising. Tho A lot of box score models would miss out on the value of guys like Joakim Noah and Draymond green on offense."
"Thaddeus Young, kinda like a draymond green role"
"first guy i really saw do that was shane battier at duke and then carried into the nba.  it's great for when guys think there will be contact but then almost fall over when they don't hit the defender.  danny green was also really good at it for years, which is why he was probably the best i ever saw at breaking up a fastbreak before draymond (watch the 2013 finals, he's crazy good at it).  i would teach it to every defender.  same thing with draymond on 3-on-1 breaks.  he keeps giving ground without committing.  it forces the guy with the ball to eventually have to take a tough layup or make an awkward pass because you never commit to one action."

"Uh, first of all, there were plenty of possessions where the Cavs *didn't* hunt Curry for an ISO mismatch. There were plenty of times when they hunted other players or didn't go ISO hunting at all.  Second of all, yeah, of course they went for the clearest mismatch more often than not. That's just kind of a 'no shit' thing. Yes, Curry was a worse defender on LeBron than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, or Andre Iguodala. Not really much shame in that."
"I mean, it's an argument, especially relative to expectations. Draymond averaged 17, 12 and 9 with 3 stls and 2 blks, all while controlling the pace offensively (along with Steph) &amp; defensively (all by himself).   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5z5GTTAkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5z5GTTAkg)  His defense cannot be praised enough here. Some of the defensive plays he was making were insane, guarding all 5 players at once at certain points, and none of it shows up in the stat sheet.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmEWGLLMQsc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmEWGLLMQsc)  His BBALL IQ is insane and it was on full display here. I don't think there's a series that better indicates what type of player Draymond Green is at his best other than this one, outside of maybe the 2016 Finals (particularly that Game 7 where he was the best player on the Dubs).  This isn't a detriment to Steph, because he went crazy that series too and he we know how valuable he is, but the reason why he isn't held in high regard in the playoffs vs other legends is that he's had the best supporting cast consistently around him."
If  any upcoming player or current wants to be a great defensive players they should watch draymond green.  Never seen a better help defender. and is amazing at playing two players in a pnr situation guarding the ball handler and the roll man. Completely neutralize  capela in that rocket warriors battles
"Draymond ""Zhang Fei"" Green"
"&gt; This current team would be just as bad as last year  Lolllll it's hilarious how disingenuous you're being instead of making the actual argument that is there for Curry. Sad.      Players that started the most games for you last year:   Glenn Robinson 48 games, Draymond Green 43 games, Willie Cauley Stein 37 games, Damion Lee 36 games, DLO 33 games, Eric Paschall 26 games  DEFINITELY the same team. Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre same as Glenn Robinson and WCS, no?  Not even considering that Draymond Green literally didn't try last year."
Its like Draymond Green is good at defense or sth
He was the best. Multiple years.  I don't trust voters who don't understand what pace are or voters who don't bother to stay up to watch West Coast games which is what happened in 2015 and why Draymond Green didn't win DPOY that year. He was left off of 16 more ballots than kawhi and lost by 16 points. This is also the same group of people who robbed lebron of the first unanimous MVP because they thought carmelo was pretty good. Lebron got 99 first place votes and 1 2nd place vote.  Also look at the above comment I just explained using statistics that were available at the time why the spurs were a better defence. Without the person who had been their 1st or 2nd best defensive player  for the previous 13 seasons.

"No blocks for this scrub, so called defensive leader, Draymond Green. Give me Andre Drummond all day!"
"Idk man, Embiid right now is comparable to KD, Steph is Steph and Simmons is better than draymond imo (love draymond tho)   Then you have Tobias and Danny Green and Seth Curry etc.. like that’s a really great bench too"
I didn't know who the fuck Draymond Green was and at that point I wanted a scorer not some random defensive dude i thought will do nothing
Draymond Green is washed  Kyrie is better than Curry  Kawhi is better than KD
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Draymond Green because he's a high defensive iq player and that's the only thing I have any sporting talent for
"Draymond Green. He plays hard, knows how to win, does the little things."
"If draymond can start making threes at a decent clip than it would definitely be a bad time for Robert, otherwise I think the jazz have a the personell to at least contain the steph-green pnr"
If 5v5 basketball was a person it would be Draymond Green
The Warriors were 1 Draymond Green assist away from victory in Game 7 in 2016.
"&gt;	No one gives a shit about 73-9.  Only dumb Americans only care about the post season. When has a Laker team (highly even doubt you’re from California at all) cleared 67 wins? Curry has done it *twice  &gt;	The funny part is the Warriors would have been better off resting for the postseason rather than chasing the record, but their fans want to eat their cake.  Dude ya they totally should have just said this record is absolutely dumb lol   &gt;	You don’t know shit about basketball. Curry was NOT the primary ball handler and never was. He has a low usage rate for a superstar while averaging 3+ turnovers per game.   why did Curry have the most dribbles per possession, passes completed, time with ball, initiating back and front court offense more than any other warrior? Then came Draymond green. Then as a tertiary creator we had Durant. Sucks when the stats disagree with you, huh?  And lmao you using usage rate to talk about a player like Curry speaks volumes about your basketball knowledge. Keep listening to ESPN clown   &gt;	He’s a mediocre passer and relied on Draymond/Iggy/system to get him preferred shots.  &gt;	You should thank your lucky stars Durant decided to join your team, not mock him for it.  Durant just needed a 73 win team. Curry won the year prior. Max kellerman or stephen a smith take next? Clown"
"What’s more likely, that the Warriors are ACTUALLY defensively better without Draymond Green, or looking at opponent ORTG is a terrible metric for measuring defensive efficacy?"
Draymond Green making more than a couple threes is definitely a sight
"Draymond Green has the 48th highest salary in the NBA for the 2020-21 season -- I think that's fair.  Also, Draymond is averaging a career high in assists this season with Steph being the only All-Star. His shooting and scoring are definitely disappointing though."
"It's Draymond Green lol, dude can barely spell."
I don’t know who’s more incoherent Draymond Green or Kyrie Irving
"Wow, Jokic has .4 more playoff VORP than Anthony Davis. In New Orleans AD played in 3 playoff series; he played Golden State in 2 of them. Jokic is **supposed** to have more playoff VORP than AD. And this is on top of the fact that VORP is a box score metric that overvalues offense as opposed to defense.  Furthermore, the Lakers won with defense NOT offense. AD had the most dominant defensive performance in the playoffs of the last decade (outside of maybe Draymond Green) and still put up 28-10 on 67 TS%. If you replaced AD with Jokic, the Lakers get worse because their defense gets horrifically worse."
I mean sure they will be just as dominate...If they get a time machine and yoink a younger Draymond Green from the past. If you don't understand Green's importance to that Warrior run you may as well be watching the Kardashians for entertainment cause the only thing you understand about Basketball is the fake drama side of it.
"you're right man my fault. guess joe harris &gt; klay thompson and deandre jordan &gt; draymond green eh? don't forget about hall of famer nick claxton and bruce brown. not even the 96 bulls could beat them! don't forget KD's telepathic powers, being able to contribute to this hot streak right now while even on the bench in a hoodie!"
So you’re saying Pat McCaw is better than Draymond Green?
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.    Ben is a great perimeter defender (with room to grow), but he's not at Kawhi level.

"Ya he has trash? Line Curry,Wiggins,oubre,Green,Wiseman. Ya i know draymond is hurt. But that lineup is good??"
"If this was a flag foul, dray should get them too. Why does draymond Green never get the call when others are overly physical towards him. He was literally tackled on a layup attempt and it was ruled a common foul. Amazing. Refs plZ be consistent."
"I would go with Draymond Green. Same position. Vocal leader. Hasn’t been traded thus far. Younger guys respect him. His game isn’t based on athleticism, just hard work and hustle. He’s literally a more skilled version of Haslem."
Notice he didn't mention multiple time all-star Draymond Green in his bullshit rant.  It's only different when it fits their narrative.
It's either Draymond Green or Kevon Looney
"Draymond ""Antonio Brown"" Green"
"[[Slater]](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1370553245018431494) &gt;Relevant context: Draymond Green said Steve Kerr talked to him and Steph Curry about the Wiseman decision and he didn't give his opinion.   &gt;""You got to know when it's your time to say something and when it's time to shut the hell up...Ok, cool. Respect. I left that one alone."""
"I disagree. You have dudes like Giannis, Tobias Harris, Zion, AD (who spends more minutes at power forward than center by far), Bam sometimes, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Draymond Green, Jerami Grant.  I get your argument about there not being a ton of natural power forwards, but i'd just argue the skill sets for that position has just improved to the point where theyre more capable of doing things like guarding wing players or big men. Lots of these dudes still get buckets in the paint and are athletic, but many also shoot or playmake."
So did Draymond Green though lol.
"Curry and Westbrook were both knocked as prospects for being PG/SG tweeners.  A [draft profile of Curry](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/stephen-curry/), for example:  &gt; At 6-2, he’s extremely small for the NBA shooting guard position, and it will likely keep him from being much of a defender at the next level … Although he’s playing point guard this year, he’s not a natural point guard that an NBA team can rely on to run a team  Same for [Draymond](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/), as a SF/PF tweener:  &gt;Tweener, undersized for a physical forward yet lacks the athleticism of a wing"
He’s just making a joke referencing [this](https://kentuckysportsradio.com/nba-cats/draymond-green-on-devin-booker-get-my-man-out-of-phoenix/)
"I've gotta say I do like that idea of using him like a bootleg Draymond Green, but I'm surprised yall haven't made a defense-oriented move yet."
Where were you when Draymond Green hit more 3s than Steph Curry?
We all want to watch Draymond Green play
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
There are good enough ones to get a feel for things.  And most of them show guys like Draymond Green to be great defenders
Yup now seems like he’s coming off light. Draymond Green was suspended 50k for saying Booker should leave the Suns
"**TEAM TRIMMED GOLDEN STATE**  Prized rookie James Wiseman heads down to the team bus, only to see it roll off without him. New coach Shoddy Collection has decided to roll with Kevon Looney and not look back, leaving Wiseman on the sidelines.  Right away, there appears to be a method to the madness. With Looney working as a garage man glue guy, Steph Curry is able to shine even more. Curry averages 33 points per game through midseason, earning some MVP buzz in the process. Wings Oubre and Wiggins have some good games here and there, but still show their inconsistency from time to time.  The Warriors end the regular season with the 5th seed out West, and some lingering hopes of a deep playoff run. However, that won't be easy in the Western Conference, as they draw Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in round one.  There, Looney and Draymond Green have a big test on their hands, as they try to cage up the Honey Bear. Jokic has a big series regardless, roaring to 25 points per game with 8 assists to boot. Curry does his part to fight back, scoring 37 points in Game 2 and 35 points in Game 4 to keep the series even at 2-2. Still, the lack of a signature and reliable second scorer leads to some gaps in their offense. The Warriors fall 4-2."
"&gt;Curry had 3 all stars on his team in Draymond, Klay and Iggy  It doesn't work like that. You don't say someone had all star teammates if they weren't selected as an all star that season.   For the 2015 championship season Stephen Curry played with exactly **one** All Star, Klay Thompson. Draymond Green had not any All Star selections yet and Andre Iguodala has had exactly **one** All Star selection in his career and it was 2012, three seasons before this run.  Stephen Curry was 100% the most important part of the Warriors from the start of the run until today. He was more important than KD, than Draymond, than Iguodala.   The only reason Curry was robbed of the FMVP was they voters did some kind of weird ""can't give it to a player on the losing team so we'll give it to the guy who guarded him,"" as LeBron's usage was very high and so were his counting stats. It is widely regarded as a flubbed vote.   If you go by the numbers, eye test, accomplishments, anyway you slice it Stephen Curry is one the best active players and will go down as one of the best to ever play.   The fact that LeBron stans and Harden stans hate him so much and always try to tear him down ironically reveals just how impactful he is.   So keep talking shit about Curry and telling us all how much you fear and resent him."

"The Lakers turned the results of their tank into a player that helped deliver a championship.  The Warriors weren't purposely tanking but they were garbage for a long time and used their high picks to build a core of Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green.  It certainly can work, it just requires a good front office. Something most teams in the top 10 don't have."
"Players on different teams can talk all they want directly to each other. Lebron could walk up to Kawhi Leonard, tell him he should leave the Clippers and join the Lakers next year and it would be completely fine.  The only player I remember getting fined for tampering lately is Draymond Green talking about Devin Booker. But that was a tricky situation, he was fined moreso because he did it in his capacity as a TNT analyst."
“Mama there goes man”  -Draymond Green
"After 2017 Draft where Tatum was drafted     2018 - Robert Williams III (A developing young player capable of being a Starting Caliber Center in the league)   2019 - Romeo Langford (We just have to wait and see but he has potential), Grant Williams (I know some of you have given up on him but I still believe he is just given the wrong role and position. He was nice in the playoffs against the Heats last year and showed flashes that he can be a poor man's PJ Tucker (The Poorman's Draymond Green)   2020 - Payton Pritchard (Impact Role Player), Aaron Neismith (Still young but is already good defensively, a good college shooter and showed flashes of that in the NBA)      Now you can't expect young player to be as good as the top picks immediately. Brown didn't become who he is today from day 1. Rozier is not that good the first few years here in Boston. Case in point, you got to have patience and not jump to conclusions immediately regarding these young players."

"So I’m assuming the fact that draymond isn’t a threat to score means he’s also not bringing the ball up floor and initiating the play. Do they run any PnR with Steph/Green when they’re playing small? I’m assuming teams would trap Steph on those plays which would lead to either an easy layup or an open corner 3. If teams switch, Steph only needs a few inches of room to knockdown the 3."
He called Wade the dirtiest player in the game. It's almost Like he doesn't watch the games cause Bruce bowen and draymond green come to mind from just the last 25 years. Add to that the fact that Wade has arguably the greatest finals preformance ever and that just want mentioned. This might be a mavs fan
&gt;What other player can take out all your guards or wings and small ball 5s?  Draymond Green
"The US will have Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, AD, Harden, Dame. Thats arguably 7 of the top 10. And you can still have great support guys that compliment that top 7 like Klay(if healthy), Bam, Bradley Beal, PG, Draymond Green  Only issue with US is they dont have many bigs.  FIBA rules familiarity is not really the issue with US Teams over the years. US loses when they don't have shooting and spacing like in 2004, 2006 and 2018. If they can have everyone available this will not be an issue with KD, Steph, Klay, Harden, Dame, Beal arguably the worlds best shooters right now. This opens up the game for slashers like Lebron and Kawhi and roll men like AD and Bam will thrive."
"“You put Jrue in any system, any coach is going to ask him to guard the best player. We played them in 2018, second round and he guarded me the whole series. He was picking me up full court, he was guarding me in the post. Actually, it was tough to dribble on Jrue Holiday. He slides his feet so well, he’s got good hands, he’s strong, he’s got good instincts. I gained a lot of respect for him in that series because he went from guarding me to Klay (Thompson) to Steph (Curry) to guarding Draymond (Green), neutralizing picks and rolls. He’s special. He’s special on that side of the ball. Jrue Holiday is solidified as probably the best defender in the league at the guard position. “ - Kevin Durant"
Draymond green
"I do consider offense, that doesnt make Draymond Green a better player. I didnt forget about that part of the game"
Yea because Simmons can put up 28 on near 50/40/90 shooting on a “bad team”. LaVine would literally thrive if he was sharing the court with Embiid. Simmons would be a glorified draymond green that grew 6 inches on the Bulls.
"And he's asking for you to give a specific instance, with the Thunder organization, of another player who acted like Reggie did during the whole debacle.  Don't bring out a strawman argument, while referencing Russ ""leading the league in techs"" (11) like that's some metric for his attitude  as a player. In the top 5 spots there's also Draymond Green (9), Dwight Howard (8), Devin Booker (8), and John Wall (7), but none of those players (aside from maybe Draymond) would be considered ""petty"" or argumentative.  Russ has a hot head with certain rivalries (Wall and Dame in particular), but nowhere near as bad as you are portraying it to be."
Nah I did watch them and I thought Danny Green was better at it.   Reputation DPOY. Should have went to Draymond Green.
Draymond green / Rudy Gobert . They both control defensive side of the court and don’t try to do too much

"Yeah, but at the same time, it shouldn't be that bad. Take Steph out, and you still have a brilliant playmaking 4 in Green, an iso scorer in KD, top 5 all time shooter in Klay, and Iggy. That's still a very well-fitting core, especially if you consider that Klay and KD are more off ball scorers than on ball with an excellent passer in Draymond."
We need to do some radical changes to the roster or system. We run a complex system that's ideal for Curry/Klay/Draymond but the only players who have high basketball IQ are Curry/Green/Klay/Wiggins/Jaun Tuscano-Anderson/Looney   If we're sticking with Kerr and his system(we will) we need to move off everyone else with the exception of Poole and Wiseman who are high potential guys. The issue is the salary space is severely limited and we're not as much of a FA as we once were.  Need to pray MN pick lands at 4 and draft one of the Jalens and then pray they're the real deal.

"I think it just comes down to role. On a team as the second scorer he’s not a great option because he’s very one dimensional as a scorer, but on a team where they have the personnel to let him focus on what he’s best at he’s a monster. It’s similar to Draymond Green, although he’s a much more dynamic offensive player than Green, especially in transition because he’s such an athlete."
Curry wasn't great in college? Took his mid major team full of scrubs to the elite 8 while averaging over 25ppg for his career. Draymond Green had a ton of accolades in college including being a first team all american. You are the one talking out of your ass.

"It is way too early for people to be saying the Warriors should have picked LaMelo over Wiseman. Ball is putting up good stats on the Hornets and is the better player for sure right now, but the Warriors picked Wiseman because he is a better fit and has higher upside for their system imo. If Klay did not tear his achilles, I guarantee the Warriors would be a decent playoff team at this time.   LaMelo's stats would not be what they are right, sharing a court with Steph, healthy Klay, Dray, and Wiggins. In addition to that, LaMelo's playmaking was not needed with Steph and Draymond on the team. His defense is very questionable too, and his shot is an uncertainty as well.  Who knows what Wiseman's stats would be on a team where he has more of the green light on.   Plus, the Warriors were really lacking talent and size at the center position. They had to draft a player that has great size, length, and athleticism, to possibly defend players like AD, Jokic, Nurkic, KAT, Gobert, etc out west later on down the road. Wiseman is 7'1"" with a 7'6"" wingspan, has freakish athleticism, and has shown promising potential with his shooting. He has legit potential to be a star two way big one day. I think in the long run, it will pay off for them. I am still not completely sold on LaMelo yet."
Trade Draymond Green honestly and I love the man
"&gt;Warriors were without one of their greatest weapons  That's right, all they had were Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston. I can't see a team with those players really achieving much. No idea how the Blazers couldnt beat that team"
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."

"Less than a year ESPN put Steph higher than KD.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11%3Fplatform%3Damp  So if anyone is align with clown takes it’s you. It’s also very clear you cannot have a conversation without resorting to personal attacks. Joining the league MVP has nothing to do with basketball ability. You really got me on the MVPs and more rings. Steph curry revolutionized basketball with his three shooting. Broke the league and for two years they had no way to answer. Yet, Kevin Durant has had a better individual season, playoff performance, and consistent success than Stephen curry. You seem to convieniently ignore every single thing besides rings and MVPS, which rings in of itself are extremely circumstantial (draymond green&gt;Steve Nash, amirite?).   Steph curry is a phenomenal player, a once in a lifetime talent. Literally changed the game. Isn’t a better player than Kevin Durant. It’s also fucking stupid how you make it seem like kd&gt;steph is such a casual argument. No. Only people on this website who religiously use advanced stats (especially notoriously faulty ones for defensive metrics) and tie up everything before golden state and after and ignore it because you get butthurt about his team choices."

"* Wiseman needs to become solid next season. Consistent output from him. He needs to take a sophomore leap to at least become a serviceable starting center * We draft someone who can become an instant contributor with the 4th-7th overall pick and also a net positive with our own FRP. Either do that or package them for a good player. We need someone who can contribute instantly. A player like Suggs or Green would be great. Im not sure about Kuminga though. Not another project. * Klay comes back to at least 75%. Those games we lose by 2-10? We win those with 75% Klay. That alone would make us a top 3 seed rn * Fix the bench. The bench is terrible. Poole is the only guy we should keep to build off the bench. Get at least one vet to run the bench. * Re-Sign Chriss. This helps with our bench situation since Chriss is a good backup C. * GET ROOKIES WHO CAN IMPACT THE TEAM. IF YOU DONT, THEN JUST TRADE THE PICKS FOR A GOOD VET AND GET A ROLE PLAYER FROM THE FA. WE DONT NEED MORE PROJECTS IF WE WANT TO WIN. * Hopefully, we can run a next season lineup (come playoff time) of 75%Klay/Steph/Draymond/Wiggins/DecentWiseman and our bench will contain some form of Rookie-from-MIN-Pick/Poole/Vet/Chriss/Vet-or-Rookie-From-GSW-Pick * GET THE TEAMS MINDSET RIGHT. This team feels like it gives up before games start. It feels like there's no motivation for these guys. * Get lucky with injuries  With that lineup, as long as the Rookies can immediately contribute (which is the most important part), you could see the Warriors back in contention and be successfully threading the needle like the Spurs did back in the day. There's not that big a need for trades. We just need to get over the hump and play more consistently."

[POV: You’re Draymond Green and you just spoke about the WNBA](https://i.imgur.com/huUcH55.jpg)
That would be so funny. Lottery gods pls make that happen. Cade/curry/klay/Wiggins/draymond /jalen green/ oubre (if re-signed)
"&gt;	Draymond Green Attacks Female Athletes   lmao, what a headline to run with"
"What? They are better defensively, but 50x times worse offensively.  Man Curry alongside Gordon, Capela, Ariza, Lou Williams, Beverly plus a solid bench is way better than a bunch of G leaguers and 5 ppg Draymond Green. How is this even a discussion.  Oubre and Wiggins are far from reliable players, specialy Oubre who started the seasom with the worst shooting stretch in nba history."
"YESYESYESYES. That gives us so many options. We can get Cade and Green/Suggs, we can trade the picks for a superstar, we could and this is dumb but sell off klay steph and draymond for a complete rebuild (not a fan of this one). It would be SOOOO good"
"Draymond Green, Wanamaker, BolBol, Pat Bev and Tony Snell all ahead of him tho."
Yeah Draymond Green sucks. Get Steph a real All-Star/DPOY smh
You counter them with:  Tonya Harding-Pat Beverly-Ron Artest-Gregg Williams-Draymond Green
Draymond Green was a 40% 3pt shooter for several months in 2016.
"Have we already forgotten Bob Myers drafted Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, signed Steph Curry to a bargain contract allowing them to sign Kevin Durant and create maybe the best team the league has ever seen?  Not to mention found someone to take on the awful contract of Andris Biendrins in order to sign Andre Iguodala.  Not to mention managing to snag D'Lo when KD left and then flipping D'Lo for Wiggins and a pick?   Is he the best?  Idk.  But David Griffin makes your list and Bob Myers doesn't?"
and if Luka had Draymond Green and Oubre the Mavs would be the 3rd seed
"He said ""one of the"", you really thought you did something &gt;Anything else?  &gt;""His on-ball defense has been really good,"" Kerr said. ""He's shooting the ball very efficiently. All in all, he's having an excellent year. He's getting more and more comfortable playing alongside Steph [Curry] and Draymond [Green]."
"He’s above league average TS%, and playing with Draymond Green doesn’t make you able to lock up wing players lol, he’s playing great defense in his own right. Playing with Green helps for sure, but you can’t give him all the credit for Wiggins defensive leap, he was already showing flashes of it in Minnesota before coming over."
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry and Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard and Dirk Nowitzki and JJ Barea and Jason Terry and Draymond Green and Klay Thompson and Boris Diaw and Tyson Chandler and Andre Iguodala and Tony Parker and Shaun Livingston and David West and many more all **OWN lemickey**
"The way the NBA draft has always worked since the one-and-done rule is that elite HS prospects go in the top few picks -- even above established players -- if they don't totally shit the bed during their freshman year.  The players I mentioned were [4 out of the top 5 players in the class of 2011 and the top player from the class of 2010](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/class/2011/order/true).  They were all going above Royce White, an older player on a mediocre college team with limited scoring ability, no matter what.  I mean, the aforementioned Draymond Green was drafted literally the same year and was four assists and five blocks from leading his team in every stat category as well, with significantly more points and rebounds.  He was a first team all-American and Royce White was an honorable mention (i.e. outside the top 10).  He was also picked 35th in the draft."
please PLEASE dont call dray a superstar. are we now categorising Draymond Green as being a top 5 player in the years he won those rings? because he wasn’t
"I don't understand how you could get from me talking about a floor general less movement and attack based passer like Draymond green, and then think this means I am talking about a heliocentric offense lmao. What about draymond green and Lonzo ball is heliocentric?!?  Steph having lots of hockey assets is from him creating opening and the beautiful game passing to open shooters the warriors were common for, not much to do with the traditional short roll and entry passing I'm talking about. Also I didn't say steph couldn't do these things, just that he would be better as his offball self, and having Lonzo come in as the top of the arch on ball initiator, whether it be hand offs or entry passes to giannis, or throwing quick whips to steph going back door or running to the corner, even  relocation. Think jrue can do this too just fine but I like lonzo for it more.  Also giannis definitely does play in a heliocentric offense, a lot of their offense revolves around the gravity of his threat down hill and his passing out of that. He has one of the highest offensive loads in the NBA    I get it was long but did you even bother to read my whole message lol."
That's how you get Draymond Green
"I would assume some ridiculous combo of Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green, with even more IQ and athleticism."
He takes some of the most difficult shots in the league. It’s a below average percentage but considering he took only hard threes basically and the fact that teams respect his jump shot and actually guard him is enough to prove to people who actually watched basketball that he wasn’t a bad shooter.   People who only look at box scores stats were trying to argue Luka is a bad shooter as in he is literally bad at shooting like draymond/Giannis   There are a lot of shooters who shoot way higher percentages that don’t command as much respect as Luka does from the three point   Obviously he wasn’t a great shooter his first 2 years but I always had a problem when people acted like he was draymond green or Westbrook.
He would be a bigger/stronger/faster/all around more athletic Draymond Green.   So pretty good.
I’m Trae Young on defense and Draymond Green on offense without the basketball IQ.
Also Draymond Green
"I'd say Lonzo, Draymond Green, LeBron, CP3 and Jokic"
1. Chris Paul 1. LeBron James 1. Nikola Jokić 1. Luka Dončić 1. Draymond Green
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green have shared the floor for 0 minutes this season"
"Calling people who make more than all slaves combined did in the span of an hour of their lives while having complete control of every aspect of their lives, fully well knowing that they are signing their pen to paper, are the exact opposite of slaves. It is outright an awful statement, and one of the dumbest things I've ever read. The ONLY way it is even MODERATELY out of that realm is if if that person is less than ten years old and doesn't get what slavery is. Otherwise, all he's doing is diluting what slavery was and insulting both those who went though it, and those who actually have issues irl, to defend millionaire basketball players and using a blanket statement word he heard because black = SLAVES! on NBA and to Draymond Green. You guys aren't doing good with this shit. It's hindering. It's insulting. It's just stupid and ignorant."
Rondo played like a Star in the playoffs. And he was a Star in the past. Again last year was a freak year because of the bubble and so many Stars being hurt. Last year someone was going to win with 2 stars because no team had 3 stars. This only happens once every 8 years since Lebron changed the game in 2010.  Draymond Green was literally an All Star.
You screeching the same illogical point over and over again doesn’t make a difference. The Lakers 3rd best player was rondo or Kuz and they waltzed to a ring last year. The Warriors in that WCF had Draymond green at like 45% TS as their 3rd best scorer.  Not having 3 superstar scorers doesn’t make it impossible to win a ring. You can just scream that into existence
"Makes Draymond green comment about being professional on point.     Like players need to stay professional or else they get fined.. But if organization does this kind of bs like trading players mid game or like this happened to vincent , its okay.   Doc rivers wasnt being a professional so they should fine him"
"Pos: Starter (Bench)  PG: Steph Curry (Tim Hardaway, Sleepy Floyd, Baron Davis)  SG: Klay Thompson (Mitch Richmond, Jason Richardson, Purvis Short)  SF: Kevin Durant (Chris Mullin, Paul Arizin)  PF: Rick Barry (Draymond Green)  C: Wilt Chamberlain (Nate Thurmond)"
"LOL i want an nba player who had little achievement or recognition so when NBA on TNT put a caption on their names while theyre talking, it should look like this  &amp;#x200B;  Draymond Green   (Golden State / Three time Champion / XX All Star - Xth Most Defensive Player)  &amp;#x200B;  and then this guy  &amp;#x200B;  John Smith  (Los Angeles Lakers / Played with Lebron in 3 Games)"
"Westbrook is all effort. KD is an entitled bitch. Most of the NBA is extremely soft, Russ plays hard 100% of the time. I don’t think he will ever super team up to win championship but there are very few players I rather watch. Anyone could win a championship with healthy Splash Brothers and Draymond Green hitting people in the nuts."
Draymond green is honestly closer to being all time defence than Dennis Schroeder is to being as good as Steph curry
"Honestly I remember a lot of scouts were projecting him to play more of a perimeter combo forward sort of role in the NBA, because the league was in the ""compare literally every forward to Draymond Green"" phase. Nevermind that the dude was a legit 6'11, left handed with incredible post footwork, and an extremly skilled passer out of the high post.  I think it was a classic case of just ignoring a players actual skills and trying to shoehorn him into an archetype, which is ironic because that's the exact opposite of how Draymond Green became such a prominent player in Golden State."
Put MCW and Draymond Green on the same team! Who else gets these type of stats? Serious question
"If draymond green didnt kick people’s balls, they would have easily won that year."
I can't tell which one you are implying is delusional but I hope it's Draymond fucking Green thinking he's all time all defense.
lmao I’ve been on a defense binge also. Lord forbid someone goes on my computer and sees me searching for Draymond Green highlights
"you hold low post players because it stops them from getting into position or makes it easier to deny an entry pass.   for example if you're guarding a guy in the post and the player gets an entry pass you hold his back arm so your other hand can deny the pass.   or like if you're going for a rebound you turn their shoulders so its harder for them to reach the ball.  everybody gets held all game, just like they never call anybody for an illegal screen unless they try to trip somebody.   steph has gotten a hell of a lot of benefit out of those over the years too.   nobody has set more uncalled illegal screens in NBA history than Draymond Green, that 2-way game with him and Steph the refs have just basically decided they can do whatever they want lol."
Draymond Green?
"This is terrible. Indiana has an average defense and yet they have 2 players in the top 5 like wtf? Draymond Green is orchestrating a top10 defense with a g-league roster, and yet TJ McConnell is better than him cause he... gets steals or something?"
No draymond green? Lmao
"Cool, the Warriors would love it if you put Anunoby on Draymond Green lmao"
"""at UCLA 2 years ago"" is so confusing without the summer league part. I was like why was old man Baron Davis at UCLA playing against Draymond Green?"
"ironically him and Draymond Green are the two players I remember watching the tournament and thinking “how is everyone overlooking them?”  with Steph especially it seems so obvious, he was god tier at shooting 3s and 3 is more than 2"
You talk as though Steph isnt a top 5 player  and he is a role player looking for his 1st ring LOL. Steph as shown he can win as the #1 guy. They still have Draymond Green a promising young C in Wiseman and potentially high draft pick from the Twolves. Whose future looks brighter. Lakers dont own any of their picks and how committed is Lebron to the Lakers beyond his contract he has stated he wanted to play with his son whenever he enters the elague
Simmons is WAY better than Draymond.   Green is a role player.  Simmons is a far more versatile defender.
"Compared to the average NBA player, how smart is Draymond Green?"
Can you really compare kawhi and currys rings against teams without their stars in the finals ? Imagine if bosh and wade were injured in 2012 or if draymond green wasn’t playing in 2016. That’s the equivalent for kawhi and currys “solo” rings

Draymond Green looked like LeBron at Saginaw. Bigger faster stronger than everyone on the court. Just bullied his buckets with a touch of guard skill
Draymond Green to the Nets confirmed.
RJ and Ingram played on horrendously fucked rosters that actively hurt their ability to succeed. Wiseman was play with steph curry and draymond green.
Why is Draymond Green so insecure?
Draymond Green loves rebounding for Kevin Hart. You don't got to do that much work rebounding for Kevin as you gotta do rebounding for Draymond.
"&gt; Curry only had lower stats because the he made the Warriors so dominant, he was playing 5 fewer minutes than Harden lmao.  Playing 5 fewer minutes also implies that the team could do well without him on the court for longer. It's well known that year that Curry's team was better, he had Klay and Draymond vs...2015 Dwight? Who only played 41 games? The Warriors were a deep and experienced team that year. You're ignoring all the context.  &gt;Per possession, Curry had better stats and was more efficient.  That's a lie. Per 100 possessions:  Harden: 37/7.7/9.4/2.6/1  Steph: 35.5/6.4/11.6/3/0.3  Those are absolutely comparable. Considering Steph had the better team, him having more assists makes complete sense. Harden still scores more and gets more rebounds. TS% doesn't change per possessions but it's a 3% change with Harden still above 60% despite carrying the team.  &gt;Also 33% higher TS% is more than a bit lmao.  Uh you mean 3%? Which isn't massive considering the huge role Harden had on that team. Harden still had a TS of 60.5% which is excellent.  &gt;Harden does not have a good case for 2015 MVP.  Another lie?   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2015.html  Harden almost won. He was a massively clear second, and only 250 points down despite Steph's 100 first place votes. He had 400 points more than 3rd place LeBron. Just because you don't remember what happened doesn't mean that it didn't happen.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2436979-the-advanced-stats-guide-to-the-2015-nba-mvp-race  Another article detailing how close Harden was to winning.  &gt;Harden was 8 games above Westbrook, while Kawhi was 6 games ahead of Harden, while Harden had COTY and 6MOY. Kawhi had no other all star on his team either, yet had 6 more wins.   You're once again ignoring all the context. Kawhi had Ginobili, Parker, Gasol, Aldridge, Danny Green, etc. Harden's second best player statistically was...Eric Gordon? Second year Capela? His team was way worse. That's also why D'Antoni won CotY.   &gt;Kawhi could've definitely won 2017 if that season's narrative wasnt so skewed by stats.  Well then you're partially agreeing with me. If the voting criteria was the same as it always is, the best player on one of the best teams (*Including context*), then it shouldn't have gone to Westbrook. Harden was carrying much harder than Kawhi was, on a much worse team.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2017.html  Kawhi is much further in voting from Harden than Harden was from Westbrook. If Westbrook didn't average the triple double, Harden wins that year. Harden's stats were almost a triple double himself: 29/8/11.   MVP has always been a combination of statistical dominance, high seeding, and level of carrying the team. Harden by far fit those categories the best *altogether* compared to either Westbrook or Kawhi that year. He lost to the lower seed due to another carry job (but worse than his) and stats. However, in 2015, he had very similar stats and the much harder carry job, but lost to the seeding."
No chance someone as decorated as Draymond Green is a role player  A high level playmaker/defender who can't score for shit might not be a star in the true sense of the word in some people's eyes but he's definitely above role player status lol
"Do you consider Gobert and Giannis above average on D as well? If so, then yeah Draymond, the former defensive player of the year and guy who locks up people 6-9"" taller than him, Green is above average on D lol.  He is also an elite passer at this position and is excellent at setting up the offense and getting guys like Curry and Klay open. His screen game is amazing, and if you watch the game closely enough he is responsible for Curry getting just enough daylight to hoist those threes. Also how many players his size and ""position"" out rebound him?  He sucks at scoring but is basically very very good at everything else important for winning games. There isn't a winning team out there that wouldn't improve with his presence. There are no pre-KD championships without Draymond.  But yeah, he legit does suck at putting the ball in the hoop. Fortunately there is much more to the game than that."

"Draymond Green the type of dude to miss out on a triple double because he didn't score enough points  Draymond Green once missed a 5x5 (at least 5 pts, rebs, asts, stls, AND blks), because he didn't have enough points"
classic Draymond Green statline
"I love to hate draymond the nutcracker green but that was a classy, honest interview."
Draymond Green and Kevon Looney.  Basically Jokic put together.  Slow yet reliable and good playmaking.  That’s what stopped him tonight lol
The most Draymond Green statline you're gonna find
nephews in this sub thinks draymond green is just a passer and not a playmaker.
Sick of hearing this. If they have mvp curry and hof draymond green they should be better than .500. Their depth isn't any worse than half of the teams in the league
This could be the most Draymond of Draymond statlines in the history of Draymond Green
"nah man, steph curry has never played on a team without 4 all stars. i mean look at the incredible all star talent on this team like Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green and Juan Toscano Anderson.   If he ever plays on a team with no talent there's no way he'd ever get to .500 or even make the playoffs"
"yes i'll have the draymond green special please, what? no points on the side thank you"
"""I said to Steph, great bad game"" - Draymond Green"
Draymond fuckin Green
I was about to say that’s such a Draymond Green stat line before the commentator said it. Screw you guy
"Nash had a much better team around him than Curry has right now. All-Star Shawn Marion, MIP Boris Diaw, 6moy Leandro Barbossa, Amare's best year arguable in 2005. And I don't think you can 100% give Nash all the credit for these guys performing well.   Who is the second best player on the Warriors now? Andrew Wiggins?? Draymond Green, who is having one of the worst offensive seasons? I know Jokic is still the frontrunner but Steph is incredibly valuable to his team. I honestly think they'd be significantly worse than the Twolves without him."
"When I think of one of the game‘s greatest passing big men, I definitely don’t think of draymond Green. Like, ever."
He's our Draymond Green that doesn't do any of the things Draymond Green does :D
"There were 42 voters (out of 129 total voters) who didn't even have Draymond Green on their ballots at all. Even if you believed that Kawhi was the best defensive player that season, Draymond deserved to be in the top 3 of more ballots. Draymond was the defensive anchor of the team with the lowest defensive rating."
"&gt;  people gotta let go of the ""cp3 was the best player against the warriors"" thing.  Stop looking at stats.  He was unquestionably the best player against us.  Anyone watching the series would tell you that.  He broke down our defense time and again.  When he left the game, we went on runs.  When he came back in, runs ended.  He bothered Curry more than any post season challenge outside of a sprained knee did.  Stats are not everything.  CP3 controlled the game and ruined our offensive scheme.  It also wasn't just ""big shots"".  It was CP3 closing every game while Harden leaned on his knees exhausted at half court.  &gt;  while harden was getting guarded by whoever was the best defender on the floor.  This is how I know you either didn't watch the series or don't know what you're looking at.  Our best defender is Draymond Green, he never guarded Harden.  Our second best defender was Klay, he never guarded Draymond.  &gt;  harden has had 3 really good playoffs in a row and only gets stopped by teams like the durant warriors (sometimes only when his 2nd best player is in street clothes) and lebron/AD when he's got a broken westbrook anchor dragging him down.  Harden had 3 playoffs that were good statistically, but well below his normal performance level, especially against good teams.  He played worse than in the regular season, and got fewer stats in more minutes.  The truth is Harden has too much muscle and is an asthmatic.  He literally can't breathe come fourth quarters where he's played 40+ minutes.  His teams are not only dependent on his skill, they're literally built around him and don't work well with him off the floor.  So they can't just rest him before the end because they'll dig themselves a hole.  It's a big reason Harden decided to lose weight last season.  Weight he has now put back on because he's on a super team where he can defer possessions to KD and Kyrie.  &gt;  butler had never been out of the 2nd round until last year, despite playing a lot of years in the east, and it's not like his individual playoff numbers were amazing and it was just his teammates letting him down.  Again with your preoccupation with numbers.  Jimmy never made it out of the second round because he'd never been on a team that should have.  He was the best player in the playoffs on a squad that had Embiid, Simmons, no coach and negative spacing.  They were one shot from beating the eventual NBA champs because Jimmy performed in crunch time and because of a lucky bounce on a Kawhi jumper.  Jimmy affects the game more than just x points on x% ts.  Playing good defense, being in the right place at the right time, forcing your opponent to take tougher shots, being able to get a basket when the defense tightens up and your team needs it.  &gt;  part of the problem is his teams usually relied on him to be their best scorer down the stretch and he simply wasn't up there with the best at doing that. maybe last year was the start of a trend in the other direction.  Jimmy's clutch scoring advanced stats have him top 5 in the NBA every year and top 5 in the playoffs every year.  If you need a basket in a tight game, he can get it.  If you can't see why Jimmy is a beast, it's a good thing you're not a GM."
"It's crazy to me when people act like good defenders don't get a lot of no calls that help them. Like Chris Paul, Patrick Beverley, Draymond Green, etc. all get away with fouls that would almost certainly be called on lesser defenders pretty often."
"See thats my problem with the Gobert discourse though, i get that hes an extraordinary paint protector and defensive big but when you try to imply that hes in his own league defensively or that hes the nba’s best defender thats when it becomes an issue.   For the most part the guards he was isoed against werent these quick shiftty guys who have deadly jumpers, they were guys like THT who dont have well developed jumpshots or guys like hill who just simply dont have the skill to take advantage of a guy like Gobert. Even when he did get stops against those top tier guards like Murray i would argue it was more so a result of bad shot selection rather than lockdown defense. For example in the Murray isolation, Murray didn’t really back up and take his time sizing up gobert, he just kind of put a shot up quickly in a spot where Gobert was comfortable. This is fine if you’re calling him an a great paint protector with some perimeter ability but if you’re calling him the best defensive player in the league then you have to talk about him in relation to guys like Draymond Green or Anthony Davis and those are guys that stay with even the most elite guards on a consistent basis. There’s nobody in this league who Davis cant guard extremely well, but there quite a few players who can score on Gobert fairly easily.   The problem in the playoffs is that as you get deeper and deeper you will inevitably have to face the Kevin Durants, Kawhi Leonards or Steph Currys of the world and when players like that exist in offenses that force everybody to constantly be closing out to perimeter player or force switches then you cant have your best defensive player be someone like Gobert. You need versatility and when thats the case you’ll always be better off with a Draymond Green.  For example look at the perimeter defense of an out of shape Anthony Davis in comparison, taking on Kawhi Leonard in Isolation while also spending lots of time protecting the paint and closing out to the perimeter: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcLo3Wbt6A  These kind of shape shifting defenders that can literally do anything you need them to are thd most valuable defensive forces in the nba. They are never vulnerable and they will never be played off the floor.   Heres a few more videos showcasing the defensive versatility of Davis: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tn9QRJMec  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IB_S13ELU3c  These are the most valuable defenders in the league."
"Since 2011-12, there has been an increase in scoring every season. There has also been an increase in pace every season. Rule changes have allowed players to score more, and made it harder for defenders to guard them. How are defences better today, when players are scoring more, and teams are conceding more?  Defence and physicality are inextricable. You look at every strong defensive team in history, and they all have at least one physical player.  We don’t have that anymore because any contact is a foul. Tony Allen, an elite perimeter defender, wouldn’t even be able to play today because of his physical style of play. Players like Trae Young or Harden get half their points from baiting defenders to touch them so they get FTs. Grit and toughness have been out ruled in favour of high high scoring games.  Draymond Green is probably the best defender of this decade. Here’s a quote from him: “Defense isn’t really an emphasis anymore in this league. So I think you’re seeing it all around the league with these high scores. We know what the emphasis is.”"
"Andrei Kirilenko is always the first guy who pops into my head with this question. He was great in his time -- 3x All-Defense -- but Jerry Sloan constantly played him out of position as an SF next to two traditional bigs in Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur. Today, if used as a PF or small-ball C, I really think AK-47 would be a perennial DPOY candidate in the mold of Ben Simmons or a taller, more athletic Draymond Green."
"&gt;Three players from each team — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins of the Warriors, and Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball of the Pelicans — will be awarded “Marvel Hero Points” for each point, rebound, assist, block and steal they accrue, with points taken away for missed shots, free throws and turnovers.  Wellcome to NBA Marvel telecast, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter"
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
"I want them to explain every rule in Marvel terms just like the Nick NFL broadcast did.  ""Ok kids, you see how the ref put his hands to look like a T after Draymond Green fouled Zion Williamson? That's called a technical foul, in this case a flagrant two. The referee is like Thanos here, snapping his fingers and making Draymond turn to dust."""

News flash: Not everybody knows who Draymond Green is.
OP is clearly talking about Draymond Green
"Idk why people are saying KD isn’t a top 3 three point shooter, Draymond Green is definitely one of the best shooters in that time."
"Yeah, if you filter these stats to the games where Draymond didn't play in this season, then numbers average out. Curry really sucked starting games and since Green wasn't there they bring down his numbers when included, filtered the stat to when both played the game gives much clearer idea. I'm not saying Steph is the same with or without Draymond, but the disparity is never so big"
"It's already stupid that people expected more from a 27-14-6 player (in 31MPG) @ 62% TS (and in the one series he was worse but not nearly as bad as people say played injured in games 3 and 4).   It would be even more stupid  if he does similar things , gets bounced in the first (which I expect) and *still* think that the Bucks' ""misfortunes"" have anything to do with the on court personnel.  Giannis is a walking 30-15-5 when playing playoff minutes (i.e. 35+ minutes). That *is* what he will give you. The question is what you can do with that. If you get out out of the 1st or 2nd round, maybe just maybe you need a different coaching team/system.   Guy is a Draymond Green type of player on steroids, if you can't win with such a player then there is something wrong with you (the coach)..."
"Miss me with Paul George, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green etc   Jimmy is a great player. And last finals were only extended because of him. But by no means was he EVER a best player. Embiid needs to play a whole season. Paul George was a legend going against Lebron back in the day. But Wayoff P was never the best. Draymond really? Word..."
"Last time I read about it, https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-currys-shooting-draymond-green-court-stark-contrasts  ""It turns out that Curry actually benefits tremendously when he plays alongside Green. Steph shoots 46.9 percent from 3-point range with Draymond on the floor, and just 32.6 percent when he is off the floor (h/t FiveThirtyEight/NBA Advanced Stats).  Curry's plus-minus also drops dramatically from 4.3 (per 36 minutes) when the two are on the floor together to -4.7 when Steph isn't sharing the court with Draymond. Just 2.8 turnovers are committed by Curry with Green on the floor, while Steph averages 5.2 over 36 minutes without his longtime teammate."""
"I mean, perhaps the exception, but Draymond Green?  He doesn't have to be great he has to impact the floor and be merely good. Hes getting 27-30 a night at age 20. If he can become a decent defender its hard to see him not being top 5 if not higher in years to come."
"I have a great one. Dude was a Lakers fan growing up in Houston, claimed it was cuz he was from California but I'm not really sure when he moved over.  Of course in 2015 I start seeing posts about how great the Warriors are,   and removes all Laker references. How the Rockets are trash and even how Lebron is overrated. Dude even made his profile picture Draymond Green with a trophy. The best was I found a post by him on some fan page talking about he is a real Warriors fan that supported them from the We Believe era lmao.  Fast forward to 2020. Back to the mf Lakers. Lebron is the fucking GOAT . Hilarity"
"These people saying 2016 was a fluke are sort of right, but even in 2014 and 2015 Draymond was a much better shooter than he is now.  Green drilled a firm motion for years and years, and then when his body changed due to wear, injuries, and age, the results of performing that motion changed as well, and at that point it was already too hard-wored to adjust. Same thing happened to Jimmy Butler"
"So Kelly oubre, Draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kevon looney, Jordan Poole and James wiseman are all suddenly g-leaguers? I'll give you Jordan pool, Kevon looney and James wiseman playing like dog shit but the other 3? C'mon.   And Andre Robertson is as g-leaguer as you can get. That season was 5v4 at all times because he literally can't shoot. He made it up with his defense but like....wow his offense sucked."

Taller but less skilled Draymond Green.
"I guess i'm gonna have to keep saying this everywhere but I can name 3 eventual DPOY's who had similar foul rates to Jaren when they were young (Tyson Chandler, Draymond Green, Ron Artest)."
Justice Winslow is Draymond Green without the rebounding and playmaking lol
"It went from Draymond Green calling for Devin to leave the team, to them being #2 seed glow up.  I think it being the West might help their case too. They have 41 wins to Knicks' 32."
Draymond green too
Yes Draymond Green exposed his Bullshit selfish agenda way back before leaving the Warriors.
Harden does on a nightly basis on top of scoring 30+ on most nights. Curry isn’t being a ball dominant facilitator every night. Shout out 2016 finals mvp runner up Draymond green
"I wouldn't called wasington win this by luck. Washington ties the game when they are losing by 11 points. This is not luck. I guess Draymond Green get fouled out is disadvantage to the warriors and the layup by Wiggins, the rim just don't want Warriors to win."
"He's worse than Jokic, Embiid, Davis, Towns.  You can make a case he'd be better or equal to Bam, Gobert or Ayton.  Good analog would be taller Draymond Green."
he was  a better draymond green with much less shooting proficiency around him
"Curry, Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Embiid and then Seth Curry, Danny Green, Wiggins, Harris, Howard off the bench would be the proper lineup 🥵🥵"
"Mark Schwartz here, espn. Joel, do you believe Draymond Green is the best defender of all time?"
"Draymond Green &gt; Ibaka and Klay, dont @ me"
&gt;Draymond Green always called me a pussy ~~for no reason~~
What injuries did Draymond Green cause?
Grayson Allen    Kelly Olynyk    Zaza Pachulia     Draymond Green    Meyers Leonard
"Aye KD has feelings too man, back in the day Draymond Green always called me a pussy for no reason"
"&gt;  Golden State Warriors' franchise players,   Not to be confused with the other Stephen Curry and Draymond Green."
Exactly lmao they got 5 all stars including Blake and Deandre Jordan. Before the dumb netsphews say they arent all stars you guys are probably the ones who considered Draymond green and Cousins allstars even tho they didnt even make it those seasons lmao
"TBH the whole ""wanted to draft Draymond Green badly"" narrative seems a little overstated up due to hindsight bias."
Unrelated but fun fact- thibs wanted to draft draymond green badly but was overruled. So the bulls could have also had young green developing with butler
you are smoking crack if you're honestly arguing that Draymond fucking Green is a better playmaker than Westbrook.  SMOKING CRACK
"Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Russell's ability to both floor and ceiling raise is the reason he had the most successful dynasty of all time. Do you think it's a coincidence Russell, a defense focused player with minimal offense led the greatest defensive dynasty of all time with minimal offense? Those Celtics teams were Russell, through and through. His attributes such as defense was the reason they were so successful. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Having Lebron and Magic share the court might seem like the no brainer choice to many, but you soon realize how ineffective it would be. Lebron is going to be the ballhandler of any lineup he's in which leaves breadcrumbs for Magic. Having Magic as the bench player essentially assures the bench of leadership and flow, making sure his team has better synergy than the opposition. It's not like it's in his character to oppose it either, as he was willing to play second fiddle to Kareem for a few years. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass from anywhere, and is similar to Lebron where his uncanny court vision assures you that he will make the right choice. His ridiculous build and height can offer a new vitality to the team which is super useful.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. His incredible array of moves means he is another player that can get you a bucket when needed. He's essentially ambidextrous to make up for his lack of athleticism and has a fantastic ability to manipulate defenses to free up opportunities to score and especially playmake. Against tougher defenses Birds offensive role inside will be minimized since it doesn't suit him, so Pop and Phill would play to his other skills like passing. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense.  Then, we have Duncan. You know, he's the last person I talked about and I had to add him in at the end because I forgot about him. That says alot about his style. Quiet, not flashy, but he gets the job done. He, like Garnett will focus on defense, any kind of defense. I trust him to get the job done. He's the little thing king. So much of what he does doesn't appear on the stat sheet. If this team ever happened, and they played a game, you'd probably look at the box score and think ""Huh, Duncan, meh performance... Disappointing..."" You wouldn't see the leadership and selflessness he displayed when the team was down 17, inspiring the team. You wouldn't see the rim protection, the pass leading to a pass, or the team play. In fact, I don't think he cares about those stats. For another video, I'd reccomend Thinking Basketballs Tim Duncan video or Clayton Crowleys video on Duncan. As I said before, I value BBIQ and passing, and with Duncan playing for Pop for 15 years, he certainly has those attributes. With so many superstars, it's nice to have a consistent guy like Duncan who can't really be gameplanned against that much.  Now, Shaq. Perhaps the most risky part of this team, he makes or breaks it. If he doesn't get along with the team, I'd just replace him with Hakeem or Kareem. But, if he DOES get along, what he offers can't be matched. With Curry like gravity, he's going to be essentially unstoppable. ""The most dominant player of all time."" That's his nickname, and it's earned. His ridiculous physique allowed him to bully his way into any position into the post and from there, he used his shocking finesse to get the bucket. Or he dunks over them. Either works. Players like Shaq and MJ are the reason this team has so many passers and floor stretchers. The less Klay has the ball while still stretching the floor, the greater Shaq will be. Imagine a lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Durant/Shaq. 4 out, 1 in, feasting. It'd be so damn nuts. He can rebound, defend and protect the rim, and is perhaps the most reliable and consistent bucket getter on the team. Pass to him and you have a 70% chance of 2 points. If he gets tripled, you have Bird or Klay ready to shoot. And if they are guarded, you probably have a high IQ player like Lebron ready to warp the defense to exploit the triple team, resulting in the most efficient shot. See Shaqs upside? All of that was possible thanks to him simply being, him.  Then, the last 2 are Rodman and Green. I was SO close to adding Pippen but removed him at the last second for Rodman. Dennis's main purpose will be acting as a rebounding and defensive plug when needed. I had lots of options but I took personalitites into account and I can't have say, Wilt as a 6th man. He wouldn't accept it. Draymonds main purpose would be providing the intangibles of spirit and fire, and acting as a ball handler. If Lebrons on the bench and Magic or Bird have been gameplanned against somehow, you have Draymond to fill that spot as the facilitator. He can't exactly shoot but in this lineup, you can play him smallball center or play Garnett at C to make up for it. Jordan/Steph/Klay/Dray/Garnett could be an unpredictable lineup but Jordan at 1 works. This team is just completely unstoppable. Running Lebron + 3nD? I'll go Magic/Jordan/Bird/Duncan/Shaq and feast on your vulnerable interior. Running an old school lineup? I'll go Steph/Klay/Bird/KD/Dray and burn you. This team literally cannot be beaten AT ALL because of the beautiful mix of BBIQ and playmaking. Players like Shaq are often used in ridiculous lineups like Magic/Kobe/MJ/Dirk/Shaq but be honest, does that lineup work? They're all great but this lineup, it's different. It synergises fantastically and brings the best out of everyone and with there being so many versatile options, it's essentially unbeatable."
"***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  1992 Dennis Rodman and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)  Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. First and foremost, you have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball which allows him to do so much with so little, truly raising the ceiling. He straight up has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. The chefs ridiculous shooting is just the quintessential necessity in these lineups. The reason he's so important and a starter is that he offers something no other player in the history of the game can offer. Not only this but he has an array of assets and skills that make him super important. He's super clutch and is very reliable down the stretch and is a good team defender. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. He can pick up steals and act as a good leader and with his off ball movement, he's essentially unguardable. His shooting can shut the doors on a match with how nuclear hot he gets and his gravity can seal a win in any match as the triple teams he forces can be exploited. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better, and more efficient in many ways, among many reasons.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He may not have the consistency of 2013, but he can dial in defensively when needed as he is still a living freight train in terms of build. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. If he's in a lineup of bigs and shooting is required, he can fufill that requirement. The 40% 3P% in 2013 seems like his best but it was on 3.3 attempts, he was shooting 37% on 5 attempts in 2018. Same story with FG%. His higher spacing in the Heat days gave him more room to shoot and drive through open lanes, he didn't have that luxury in 2018 yet he still did so well. When you need an instant bucket, you have potentially the most dangerous finisher of all time ready to ram through defenses, and these traits stayed in the playoffs. Essentially, he's acting as a jack of all trades. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. It's precisely the reason I chose 2018. His mix of more experienced playmaking and much higher BBIQ makes him better suited than his younger days. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own drive into the lane, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way. Imagine Draymond in 2016 but on steroids, or Magic with Karl Malones body.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have the 2 clutchest players in Bird and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan. Jordan really completes the team because of his pure transcendence in the field of scoring. Not only that but he has a very versatile skillset. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (The team is too smart to have him be the one shooting from 3) He is GOING to be the leader of the team and thats invaluable. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. His insane athleticism allowed him to process things at an insane pace. His consistency in his midrange came from his ability to find a good spot thanks to his good handles and speed, jump so high nobody can contest the shot and go into his form mid air. This ability to leap and use his incredible reflexes was imperative to his finishing as well as his incredible free throw drawing, absorbing contact and finishing through it. He mixed his ridiculous athleticism with potentially the deepest bag of moves of any guard ever, most notably the fadeaway. All of this allows him to benefit even more from all these elite passers like Magic, Bird, Russell, ect ect. The best thing about him is his postseason success. He was not fazed by pressure, he more so than anyone else in history thrived in it. He lived in the moments where games were decided, holding practically ALL of the playoff scoring records. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. His passing matured as he played more and is now super underrated as he improved his shot selection and court vision. He rebounds excellently thanks to his constant motor, the same motor that helped him earn a DPOY and become the greatest defensive guard. His off ball movement meant he could use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (There are SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Most lists don't have Garnett here. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is super awesome and useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, footwork like Hakeem and offense like a guard. His greatest skill was perhaps the fact that he had the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound anyone. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense."
"Why would anyone give him credit for winning the title with a prime Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green who had just won 73 games by themselves and a title the year before they. Like seriously, how do you expect people to give him credit for that? It’s just not impressive.   Brons 2018 run is impressive. KD’s titles were just expected"
"dude didn't have a jamal murray just a kelly oubre, Andre wiggins, Draymond Green  don't act like he doesn't have help just cuz yall used to having 3 HoFers in your starting lineup (Klay and KD)"
"Small ball = rebounds and rim protection goodbye, unless you have a defensive big with 3pt shooting or passing like Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, or KG"
"I think he can be fringe all-star level, but not with the team constructed the way it is.  He's very similar to Dennis Rodman.  Rodman was a legit HoFer, and could impact winning at a high level in multiple ways, but if he was the only star you had on the court you were fucked.  We saw it similarly last year.  Draymond Green, despite playing most of the year, was simply unable to elevate the Warriors from being anything but last place.  We might chalk that up to motivation or whatever, but it was clear just from the talent on the floor that the team was dead in the water, and unless they were playing the Rockets on Christmas there simply wasn't enough talent to fuel that team without Steph (and Klay) to bring it all together with his scoring ability."
"&gt; he'll have a cap hit of $38m in 2023/2024  With the cap in '23-'24 being predicted to be around $119.2 million, $38m for a good second guy is really not a problem. He'll still be on the right side of 30. I'd be more worried about guys like Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Tobias Harris, Draymond Green, Gordon Hayward, etc. who all have big contracts the same lenght as Siakam's but who are older."
"Anybody who says “Curry cost them defensively every night” has literally no clue what they’re talking about. Curry is an above average defender for his position. He got bad press as a defender in the 2016 Finals where he was switched onto every possession because he was next to Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, and Andre Iguodala.  You say that like Curry is so bad defensively that he’s actually a negative on the floor despite his scoring 😂 watch some games bro"
"We're not getting 2016-2017 Draymond Green though, where he was an All-Star, the best defender in the league while also being a stretch 4 and the best playmaking big in the NBA.    He's still great defensively and his playmaking is still really good, but in terms of scoring he's hit Prime Ben Wallace levels and his playmaking has been really limited anytime Curry isn't on the floor, because it turns out it's actually hard to set up your teammates when the opposing team stubbornly refuses to guard you.    He's not a bad player, but he is limited, and one limited player and a bunch of dudes who are still working to understand basketball at  a fundamental level is not a recipe for a functional team.  And I say this all as a massive Draymond fan who has told off several Warriors fans for believing that Draymond is washed.  He's a good player, but he's definitely a role player who doesn't have it in him to pull the entire team together around him the way a star can."
It’s hard for me to honestly believe this is the worst supporting cast in NBA history when Draymond green is on that cast
"Eric Gordon, D’Angelo Russell, Buddy Hield, Klay Thompso, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert"
"This is one of the stupidest things I’ve read in a long time. Curry had weapons at points? This is the only full season he’s played without Klay Thompson since they started winning. They’re 29-29. He cost them defensively every night. Ray almost won it all with Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham and Vin Baker. Are you in telling me you’d rather have that core than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Iggy and Kevin Durant? Hollllllly shit. Certain points. Get the fuck outta here."
"Bruh stop defending KD cause you’re a Nets fan 😂 Bron won in 2016 and 2020 without a super team, until KD does that his rings will just be seen as lesser.   Bron had just AD last year, KD had *Steph Curry* and *Klay Thompson* and *Draymond Green*. It’s 4 allstars in their prime, you’re kidding yourself and being biased if you don’t think winning on the Warriors was extremely easy for him."
"Last year your top 5 in minutes played was Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson, Damion Lee, Alec Burkes, and Jordan Poole   This year it is Andrew Wiggins, Steph Curry, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green, and Damion Lee"
Curry was going to lose finals MVP to draymond green in 2016. Don’t dare compare him to Magic.
"You're right, he's on the court because of his all-time great defense. But for them to win, he needs to not be net negative on offense since he'll naturally have heavy minutes.   Curry Green PNR was the staple to 73 wins and it worked because a) don't trap Steph and he destroys whoever it is 1 on 1 or b) trap Steph and he gives it to Draymond who makes the right play everytime. And the right play is sometimes to score.  They dominated that 2019 Portland series because of it. Now he needs to do it every series instead of just one because they don't have KD to bail them out anymore when it doesn't work"
"So then he quite clearly raises the floor, and by alot.  From 2017-2020 the rockets were 10-9 when harden didn't play but alot better than that when he did. This year they were 2-6 when he played and 13-37 when he doesn't. Roughly the same win percentage with and without. Both Steph and Harden raise the floor and ceiling, but the numbers indicate the impact with Steph is greater.  Draymond Green is a better example of a player that doesn't really raise the floor of a bad team but definitely raises the ceiling of a good team."
I don’t. Harden won more and was better for his team during the stretch. And please guys I heard ESPN say Curry has no all stars around him last night like DPOY Draymond Green wasn’t starting.
"&gt;Dame being the initiator for everything for 75% of the possession  You're right we need to get derrick jones running the point more, hes basically Draymond Green"

"How exactly is it a carry job when he’s the 9th seed? And I think you guys are seriously discrediting Draymond green to elevate Curry. Green is better than any teammate LeBron had on those 2006 cavs.   Curry is having an amazing offensive season, something we’ve never seen before. But it’s not exactly a carry job."
Thought that was a Roy Hibbert or a Draymond Green
"Wiseman is an extremely green rookie and an absolute net negative. The fact that you included him and Jordan Poole who was in the fucking G-league this year  as a reason they should be winning games let's me know you haven't watched any. You'd also know Oubre is a terrible fit for the most part and box score doesn't  tell whole story.   The best players on this team are Steph, Draymond, Wiggins and probably Looney. 2 of those players score less than 5ppg, and the other (bless him) is still sub 20ppg. The offense is almost solely Steph and drops emphatically when he gets sits.  &gt; just odd he’s the only superstar that isn’t expected to carry a team.  He is playing at ridiculous clip (best in the league) with a G-League bench and they're 28-22 with him playing and yet you're here talking about expectations. Honestly, what other superstar IS held to these standards ? Smh."
"The fact that Harden was able to get all those dimes shows his supporting cast was better, lol. His teammates could actually finish plays.  CP3 and Capela played in half of the games for Harden's streak. EG played like 2/3rds of the streak.   House, Rivers, Green and PJ are much better offensively than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre and Bazemore.   And that's all Steph has. Harden at least had CP3, EG, and Capela for periods of time for the streak for a strong team."
"CP3 and Clint played about half those games each. And Harden still had House, PJ, EG, Green and Rivers. All pretty good shooters.  Curry's supporting cast was much worse in terms of shooting. Draymond, Wiggins, Bazemore, Lee, Oubre, Poole, Looney.  Both streaks are insane in their own way. Harden's for longevity and Steph's for the efficiency."
Draymond Green taking notes in case they ever end up on different teams
"Yeah, his TDs lead to winning more than any other player, except kind of Draymond Green, at least for his 16-17 campaign. But using the Warriors' 73 win season is kind of unfair because they won almost every game anyways so I feel it's fair to say WBs triple doubles are the most influential TDs in the league. Polar opposite of someone like Lebron"
"if draymond green was a good scorer he'd be a top 15 player. Yeah he's not well rounded, but that's why he's not a superstar. Back in his prime he was halfway decent on offense which is why he was so great."
"Also, people always ignore that Draymond and Curry almost always play together so when Curry sits, so does Draymond.  Without Draymond, Curry's stats suffer quite a bit.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-currys-shooting-draymond-green-court-stark-contrasts  14% less from 3, from +4.3 to -4.7"
basketball is about scoring 40ppg and anyone who does not doesn't belong on the floor. Defense and playmaking do not exist they are just dumb terms made up by draymond green to trick the warriors into maxing him
"He’s a 7’0 big man who can essentially facilitate like Draymond Green, and he has a great shot on top of that.   This dude is magical."
Draymond does all the things that don't show up in the boxscore. Its a great indicator to someone's basketball knowledge to ask them about the impact of draymond green
"No. Draymond Green and Wiseman was better than everybody on that Kobe led team. I agree that Curry is having a ridiculous season and comparable potentially better individually season, but arguably the third best player on those Lakers was Smush Parker. You're taking Smush Parker over Wiseman(when healthy), Wiggins or Looney? Arguably Juan Toscano-Anderson is better than Smush as well. But he's injured as well. If we say Green and Odom are a wash, the supporting cast around Curry is much better than Kobe's."
"Draymond Green, suddenly cant shoot threes anymore"
"He’s not an overwhelmingly stupid human being.  The piece that a lot of casual or newer fans should be told is that all of the really elite players are **seriously** smart.  And a lot of them are genius level.  Guys like LeBron James, Draymond Green and Chris Paul are the smartest people you will meet in any walk of life.  They think and make mental adjustments quickly.  They see what every player is doing simultaneously and think on a larger level strategically and direct other players where to go to counter strategies as a team and they tell people what to do on offense to take advantage of what they see on defense all while performing their own role at a star level.  Drummond isn’t a complete moron, he’s a normal guy.  And next to a bunch of really sharp people he’s basically playing with a handicap, and he also has some issues with coordination.  That being said, if he’s managed closely by one of the greatest floor generals ever (LeBron) then he can be used to great effect.  He’s probably the second best rebounder ever and he’s the strongest player in the NBA.  The problem is when he’s out there unsupervised.  Lakers fans feel entitled to championships every year and so even though Drummond hasn’t been bad for them, since he’s kind of an overrated player in general and didn’t just dominate for them, they’re just being waaaaaaaay over the top venomous towards him.  But Drummond will be mostly fine for them.  He’ll be a solid role player, he’s just not a star like people thought he might evolve into for a long time."
There's bad shooters like Draymond and Westbrook and then there's literal non shooters like Simmons. Nobody expected him to be Klay Thompson but expecting him to at least be a Draymond Green level shooter was apparently too much. The guy is just straight up scared to shoot
I remember is like 2018 Jordan Bell had a really good game and everyone was sure that he was the next Draymond Green
He was suppose to be the next Draymond Green according to people back when he was drafted.
Moses brown was dropping on draymond green/curry screens... like wtf. He has to be worst player in NBA? Or their coach is awful telling him to do that?
"I say you close out Ibaka from his right side, so he has to either rush his shot, or angle his pass and give time for Sexton to contest. Some Draymond Green type of shit."
With his size rebounding passing defense and scoring he would’ve been a 4 and a smallball 5 like a better draymond green.  Imagine starting Dray next to 2 Bigs.   From my memory he wasn’t known for taking many 3’s but he was a Swiss Army knife type of player.

"&gt;Playmaking: Curry is an elite off-ball threat and screener, who can generate open looks with smart picks, handoffs, cuts, etc. He's also an excellent passer whose volume is diminished by Kerr's system, whereas the opposite is true for Harden. Pre-peak Curry was averaging 8 apg in a more PnR-oriented system, so I'm very skeptical that current Curry can't scratch Harden's 10 apg in a similar system.  hilarious that you blame kerr's system for diminishing steph's on-ball playmaking but ignore the fact that his system maximizes his off-ball impact. relying on having a player like draymond green to playmake *for* curry in order for his off-ball movement to have an impact must be factored into the equation. he's not the heliocentric offensive unit that lebron, harden, luka, etc are.  but i appreciate you being a full-on homer. hate when people try to hide it"
"He looks between 6'5"" and 6'9"". I can't find a definitive pic, but here are a few comparisons: [https://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Draymond+Green+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+gMHlwqA\_fYUx.jpg](https://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Draymond+Green+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+gMHlwqA_fYUx.jpg)  [https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2012/05/paul-pierce11.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;crop=1](https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2012/05/paul-pierce11.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;crop=1)  [https://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Anthony+Davis+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+Iy7IZsJW-3mx.jpg](https://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Anthony+Davis+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+Iy7IZsJW-3mx.jpg)"
"He’s totally worth his contract, any team in the league would take it on to have him. Dude was a second option on a Championship team, MIP, All-Star, All-NBA Second Team, first option on the second best record in the league. Many, many teams would have offered him a max, and the Raptors would have matched it. He is 100% worth the money.  And you make it seem like this is a one time thing as if he didn’t just scored 39 with 13 boards on 58% shooting. And it’s not like he hasn’t scored 44 exactly on 3 different occasions.  And he certainly was not the “fourth option” he was the second leading scorer throughout the playoffs. And even if he was the “fourth option” when he hit the game winning shotit’s not like they had their best defender, DPOY, one of the greatest defenders of all time on him or something, oh wait, Draymond Green who was in him fits all of those descriptions.  “The term clutch should never be associated” Lol, that’s funny, as if he wasn’t the second most clutch player in the league last year.  [Source](https://twitter.com/jlew1050/status/1348662090656075781?lang=en)  You’re nothing but a hater, even after a 44 point triple double on 60% shooting."
over Draymond fucking Green not to mention
"Again, if you don't want to have a conversation with context, then that's fine. But you keep wanting to strip away the context of what I'm saying, so to be clear here, what I'm saying is:   Lebron for most of his career has been a SF w/ great passing, evidenced by the fact that he's been averaging 5-8 apg for most of his career, and when he finally stepped into the PG role, like he has in LA, he's been averaging 9apg or so, 11 apg at his best. If he *was* a PG his whole career, he'd be averaging those numbers consistently like Magic had. God only knows the numbers he could've put up in his prime if he was a true PG. But he didn't, because he not a PG, he's a SF who dominates the offence and has great passing.   Draymond Green is another great example of this. He's a smart as hell Forward with great passing. The fact that he's averaging 8.7 apg right now doesn't make him a PG, you can't just strip context away. He's a PF that leads his team, and has great passing ability. Context matters in these conversations, and just because a player controls the offense doesn't inherently make them a PG, sometimes there just such offense threats it'd be stupid *not* to put them in charge. That doesn't make them a PG on it's own."
"&gt; when Steph was out when KD was in GS and the Warriors played like just an above average squad  Lol are you just going to ignore the season GSW are having now which is Steph playing 30 mins with Green and them being a below average western team.  KD was the best player on the Warriors when every one was on the floor, They almost always deferred to him for crunch time points and he had a bigger defensive impact on the warriors that he is given credit for. If you look at that entire dynasties playoff run (all 4 years) KD pretty much out played Curry and was their best player through that.  &gt; KD has never shown to be a better leader or more impactful player  &gt;We’re not asking who’s the vocal leader of the team or who’s the defensive anchor, we’re asking who the best player is, and best=most important.  I'm pretty sure you added this because you realize that Curry is not the ""vocal leader"" of the warrior, that would be Draymond. If you are going to define leader as the person who is considered best by the team then that player would be the player that usually has the ball in their hand on important possession which during that time was Durant (lol look at those Clevland finals), so by your own definition of a ""leader"" Durant would be considered better than Curry."
Is Draymond Green a better PF than Karl Malone?
I guess draymond green and Steve Kerr in the locker room that one time when espn over heard them. But that wasn’t out on the court in front of the cameras like this. Prettty insane. They gotta fire this dude
Obviously the Raptors asking price for Lowry was absurd but it would be intriguing to see Simmons play with another primary ball handler. Simmons would completely dominate playing the Draymond Green role. Essentially he’d be Draymond on steroids. I don’t blame them for passing on that Lowry deal though because Masai overplayed his hand and clearly Miami felt that way too.
Draymond&gt;Rodman is definitely debatable. You're underrating how good the Bulls big 3 were on defense. Arguably the 2 best perimeter defenders ever and the original Draymond Green except more physical and even more of a provocateur on the court.
"I don't think why the Warriors suffer in a world with 90's rules. You can't go zone or send super hard doubles against KD or Steph. Now Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Shaun Livingston all get to handcheck on the perimeter? You have to keep in mind as well that KD/Klay/Andre are all very big relative to their position in the 90's."
"Some recent ones that I could think of are:  Draymond Green - $915,243 in 2015  Pascal Siakam - $1,544,951 in 2019   Not really comparable to the high value Kawhi but both had significant value for their championship teams."
Because bjorkgren's defensive system calls for players to fight over ball-screens at all times. Which doesn't make any sense with non-shooters like ben simmons and Russell westbrook. The pacers fucking face guarded draymond green on the perimeter lol Brogs is not the issue.

First Jrue Holiday is more than just a “solid role player”. Second In general the term role player is pretty general and describes 95% of the league (I mean it ranges from Draymond Green to Ish Smith). Knowing this there are better comps for Lonzo besides Jrue because their games are so different.
"What? OP raised the idea of Zion with Draymond level of defence.  Zion is in his second season and if he continues to develop on this trajectory, could become one of the most dominant offensive forces in the games history. I would say Shaq type of output is not unreasonable for his offensive ceiling - top 10-12 all time.  Even if he doesnt develop any further, he could probably have a Charles Barkley type of career - good for top 20-30 all time.  Now if you add Draymond Green level of defence to either of those guys? Barkley becomes top 10, and Shaq could have an argument for GOAT. I dont think that is a particularly hot take.  Dwight Howard makes no sense for this conversation. Zions offensive game is leagues above what Howard ever showed. Unless you were changing it to Howard with Zion's offensive game (or Shaq's offensive game) - and then that is more in line with what I am suggesting."
Oh its simple.  average perimeter defenders and Draymond Green
He sucks on defense and will be average at best. Comparing him to Draymond Green as a ceiling defensively is funny.
"Curry brings it up the court, at the top of the key, Green coming in to screen his man and switch the big- oh what is this?! EXCELLENT DOUBLE TEAM FROM DRAYMOND AND LONZO, CURRY LOSES THE BALL, BAAANGGGGG, ANOTHER BRILLIANT SHOT FROM CURRY WITH THE WARRIOR'S PANTENTED BOX AND ONE OFFENSIVE SCHEME.  It's what Green does that doesn't show up in the stat sheets night after night that really matters Mike, you can see here in the slow mo replay, his excellent chemistry with Curry, predicting his exact dribble combo, lockdown defense, for an almost turnover resulting in the high percentage shot."
Draymond Green: Get my man out of ~~Phoenix~~ New Orleans
I feel like we need draymond green just for this lineup. It’ll complete it.
I WANT DRAYMOND GREEN
Donte is developing into basically a SG Draymond Green
"I'll play Devil's Advocate here, although I have a bias as a Sixers fan.  I've seen teams this year, and in the playoffs last year, look for a switch on the perimeter to get Gobert.  I've seen teams this year look to get a switch so they can get anybody else besides Ben.    Ben willingly takes the assignment of someone like Dame, Luka, etc, the opposing team's best perimeter player is usually Ben's assignment especially in crunch time. Those same players who try and get Ben as far away from them as possible simultaneously hunt for Gobert on the switch in crunch time. The Sixers and Blazers played earlier this year and I remember even though Dame was going off early in the game the moment Ben took the assignment he was slowed down and the other players had to make shots in order to win, Dame couldn't get the good quality shots he was getting vs Danny Green/Seth Curry anymore. IMO as a team defender, Rudy is easily top 3 and to many top 1, In terms of overall defensive skill I don't have him in my top 5.  My 5 in no particular order are:  Draymond  Ben  Embiid  Adebayo  Smart  Honorable mention Thybulle but again I'm super fucking biased."
"I tried to tell you!  Draymond Green last night after Curry cracked 40 again:  ""Anytime you step on the floor with Steph Curry, there's an advantage there,"" Green told reporters. ""So, teams are terrified of him—and everywhere he runs on the floor, with or without the ball, teams are terrified. That type of gravity, he pulls a lot of weight.”  Literally terrified.  A true sign of greatness."

Draymond Green type beat
You know ESPN is pissed.  A game with Steph and Zion and the hero is Draymond Green?
"Hero Points are a contrived metric for tonight's Marvel-NBA crossover, Draymond Green did not drop 48 actual points.  Scoring system:  -One Hero Point for every point, rebound, assist, steal and block.  -One Hero Point deducted for every missed field goal, free throw or turnover.   Draymond finished with 10 points, 13 rebounds, 15 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks along with 4 turnovers and 1 missed shot for a total of 38 hero points. The system also arbitrarily awards 10 bonus points for the victory.    Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401307780"
LeBron was dominant the whole series hence why he has finals mvps to show for it. Steph goes cold and gets outplayed by Draymond Green. Steph is a straight non factor if he isn’t scoring at an efficient clip
if you think our shooting is bad now tho...  BI shoots worse than draymond green on b2bs sometimes
Draymond Green  Quirk: Natural Shooting Motion
All it took was for KD to give Curry the edge lol don’t act like Curry wasn’t about to lose a finals mvp to Draymond Green
Big milestone tonight: Today Draymond Green became the all time leader in hero points
"Draymond Green, of the Golden State Warriors, received the largest number of Hero Points (HP) of any player in the Warriors versus Pelicans basketball game that concluded just minutes ago.  This has never happened before, so you can imagine the significance.  Literally unprecedented."

"""Draymond does not agree with the call. He better be careful. Ah, technical foul called on Draymond Green, his 6th of the half."""
"One thing I realized after listening to a lot of NBA podcasts and interview is that a very significant number of NBA stars are like this. Even in the minds of people like Haslem and Draymond Green, they are one of the essential reasons why their teams won championship. Haslem considers himself to be the OG and on the same level as Bron, Wade, Bosh. Draymond considers himself to be the greatest defensive player of all time. Even Kyrie thinks that he was the protagonist of the Cavs team that won championship."
Lmao respect the self awareness. I feel that way about Draymond Green for his face and the way he talks
"Suns -  Suns first championship  CP3 wins one at 35  Suns win chip after missing POs for a decade  James Jones turning around the franchise in just 2 years.  Devin 'injury replacement allstars' Booker rise from empty stats player  Cam Payne from out of league to 6 man on a championship squad  Monty Williams choosing Suns over Lakers, and for good reasons  Jae Crowder in the Finals once again, this time on the winning team  Draymond Green saying Devin Booker should get his ass out of Phoenix"
"Toronto was asking for Tisse, Maxey and a couple of 1st according to Windy but Tisse wasn't on Morey's offer. And since Morey didn't even include Maxey in the Harden deal, my guess is that he only offered Green and a 1st for Lowry.   Morey should've given up Tisse to get Lowry. Tisse as great as he is defensively is equally bad offensively. And I know this is only his 2nd year but he's already 24 and he's shooting 47% from the free throw line. He's Roberson 2.0. It'd be difficult to generate offense with Roberson and Draymond on the floor at the same time."
Draymond Green
Why did elite playmaker Draymond Green only raise his team's floor to 15 wins last year?
"Today's tech were soft as fuck and bad calls.  He got them only by earning a bad reputation, similar to Draymond Green or Jokic."
"Draymond Green has never scored 15ppg on 60% TS in his life  Also he hasn't created shots for shooters which Simmons does by collapsin the defense, he just simply passes to Curry who comes off screens"
"He's aiming to be Draymond Green, which is not a bad thing."
Draymond averaged 10 PPG on 42/31/71 shooting splits that season. Jeff Green is a better offensive player than Dray.
"OK, several points.   One, no need to be pedantic. Regardless of Draymond's exact role in the team at the point of their initial sixth seed my point is who on OKC is going to be the eventual Draymond? That's the comparison. A team ascending vs. a team descending.   Second, yes he was. He played 72 games in that season.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green  I mean for fuck's sake.   &gt;In Game 1 of the first round of the 2013 playoffs against the Denver Nuggets on April 20, Nuggets' guard Andre Miller drove around Green and made the game-winning layup in the Nuggets' 97–95 win over the Warriors. Improving on his three-point percentage and offensive performance over the course of the series, Green helped the Warriors win the first round in six games.  Third, this is a direct quote from the Wikipedia entry I linked in my first response.  &gt;The Warriors had four draft picks in the 2012 NBA Draft, a decisive draft year that was vital for a potential future for the team. The picks included Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick  Please note second to last GS pick, number 35 overall, DRAYMOND GREEN.   So, not only were you being pedantic, you were wrong."

"Tbh I think people for the most part still loved Curry throughout that. Everyone has some haters but he definitely is the most loved superstar I can think of. Even moreso now that his team isn't a contender, but even when he was wiping the floor with everyone and people hated the warriors, hated draymond green, and hated KD like he'd killed their kids or something, most people still seemed to love Curry."
"Like I said, I’m not saying there aren’t genius BBIQ players out there, and Draymond Green and CP3 are the first two that come to mind, Rondo too, to an extent."
"I think that's a little unfair. There's probably been a ton of high BBIQ guys who don't have LeBron's level of physical talents and we probably all forgot about.   The most easy modern example of this is probably Draymond Green. If Dray could score like LeBron.. wouldn't they be in a similar category? Draymond just lacks the physical tools, doesn't attract the defensive attention, etc. I also wonder what CP3's career would be like if he had LeBron's size and his body."
"Blake, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarot, Claxton are all solid rotational pieces.   Steph/Draymond will show up but if that Nets team caught us on a day when Oubre/Wiggins aren't having good games then I can legitimately see us losing"

"Probably because the Knicks don't have a real PG  Randle is a perfect partner because he's capable of attacking the rim, hitting a mid, or facilitating out of the 4v3s Dame creates  There are only 2 ways to guard Dame in the PnR. You either trap, or you switch. Randle can kill a guard in the post if they switch, and he's Draymond Green on steroids out of the trap"

He’s way more agile than just a drop coverage center dude. There’s a reason he was a defensive RAPTOR god along with Draymond Green.
"&gt;	 KD doesn't need to be a top playmaker, he actually being good even if he's not top playmaker on top of him being the best scorer and best offensive player OF ALL TIME   If that were true why couldn’t he be the playmaker without averaging a turnover per assist when trying to create without Westbrook in OKC? Why was he never trusted with the ball (according to touches, time spent with ball, dribbles per possession, pass completed) in golden state: that was left up to Curry and Draymond green. Why? Because the moment Curry (or Westbrook) left the floor Durant’s efficiency cratered and he turned the ball over at an embarrassing rate if he’s an all time great.   What other top 20 player constantly turns the ball over at a historic rate when he doesn’t have an all time great creator doing all the heavy offensive lifting?   Here’s an idea: the *idea* of Durant being the best scorer ever is nice but when it comes to him being the primary ball handler/creator and scorer, he turns the ball over and over and his efficiency plummets below league average.   The “””””haters””””” on this sub are critical of Durant because of his play within its proper context.   This isn’t even to mention that he choked massively alongside an MVP-candidate then joined a 73 win team with the reigning MVP in his prime. Now he’s with james harden and kyrie Irving lol"

"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors.

What about Draymond Green?
Draymond Green smoked him on backdoor cuts all game a week ago. That's the sign of a terrible defender. I've watched Draymond play in every game this season and he took advantage of MPJ's lack of defense more than any other player this season.
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

who were they gonna put draymond green?
"Dude I have never heard anyone ever argue 8ppg on 36% shooting argued like that. For your third best scorer that is a joke. Also +/- numbers there mean almost nothing. Cmon dude that’s not even Rodney Hood numbers. He was the teams 5th option behind Tristan Thompson. Was he playing all NBA defense? Because he is there to play all nba offense, and rebound like a mf. Not be Draymond Green without passing on offense. He played smart sure but like I would take PJ Tucker over that. And that dude doesn’t account for a max contract.idk who Kev thinks he is gonna help"
Lol you gonna bail Curry out with a 1 game suspension to Draymond Green for constantly kicking dudes in the nuts?
Poor Man's Draymond Green
"We are talking about 2016, Draymond green was a better overall offensive player than current Rudy Gobert. How many ppg Draymond is averaging in 2021 has no relevance to this conversation at all. He was one of the best passing bigs in the league and a solid shooter along with the best defensive player in the league.   Clearly you think Klay was better than Drayond which is fine, Klay is great. I would take 2016 Draymond though and just didn't understand a vague definiton of 2nd banana that would have you select the inferior player because he scores more. That was my main gripe.   Your original comment said ""2nd banana isn't 2nd best"" so that's what i was trying to respond to and get to the bottom of how you would define the term and draw the line."
"Yeah a lot have been great defensive players but most of them can also score well or at least decently. I need you to understand that Rudy Gobert, the defensive specialist from your example, is scoring 8 more ppg this season than Draymond.  Klay is an insane scorer and a very good defender. Any team would take him over Draymond Green. I just entertained your ""Draymond is better"" idea because his unique style of play is a big part of what enables the Warriors' extremely successful motion offence and their ability to defend properly while playing small ball."

"Classic r/nba citing assists as measurement of passing. Usage percentage doesn't indicate anything here, that's just number of possessions used for scoring + turnover divided by the team's.   The reality is Green wouldn't even put up 7 assists on a bad team - cue last season with 6.2 - because he has no shot creation. Simmons can at least collapse the defense in half court and kick out to open shooters, Draymond can very rarely do that. He's got the better touch in transition where a big percentage of Draymond turnovers happen. While they both have great anticipation and court vision, Simmons no doubt has the edge as a 6'10 player, some of his dimes are ingenious."

"Should I introduce you to Draymond Green?  We must be quick, legend says if you hang around him for more than 10 seconds and you are not a team mate, he’ll try to gauge one of your eyes out or just a good ol’ kick to the nuts"
"disingenuos, im outplaying lebron too if i have prime curry thompson and draymond green with me. Okay maybe im not but KD is"
Draymond was trying to take a last resort foul. He absolutely wanted to foul Lebron. I seriously doubt he thought to poke Lebron in the eye specifically. This push was really different from Green’s and Lebron’s in that the guy is going away from Booker who then pushes him. On the other plays it looks like Green just wants to foul because he’s too late and Lebron initially goes to challenge but he’s too late and his push almost looks like self preservation or defensive.
"I’ll give Crowder a pass here. he had a human being fly at him unexpectedly And I think he reacted more to try to protect himself than to try to actually push DS. He had no idea Booker was going to straight shove DS like that, so from Crowder’s perspective a guy who was taking off toward the basket just suddenly re-directed in mid-air right at him from close range and he didn’t have any time at all to carefully consider what was happening and just reacted. It would have been better if he had reacted by trying to catch DS, but not everyone can be Draymond Green saving Klay or Steven Adams saving some guy I can’t remember, some guys are like me: someone lobs a can of beer/soda at me with little warning and I react by slapping it out of the air instead of catching the unexpected object."
Draymond Green and *maybe* Lakers Dwight Howard only because the refs let him hack the fuck out of Jokic with impunity.
I mean Bruce Bowen and Draymond Green have 6 rings between them
"Nurkic ?? Nurkic is really good its just that Jokic is monster. Nobody can really stop him , he destroyed Gobert in playoffs,in regular season a DPOY. Embid cant stop him ,Lakers cant stop him only one i saw play good against him this year is Draymond Green he stopped him somehow :D"
"Kyle ""Draymond Green"" Kuzma"
Poor man's Draymond Green
There are already rules in place. Flagrant 2 is 2 penalty points. 5 points in the playoffs and you’re suspended. See that year draymond green got suspended. I’m a laker fan but suspending booker would be absurd. Don’t need more conspiracies about the nba helping Lakers.
Adds to total points towards suspension. See draymond green that one year.
"Draymond Green (Shaq), Blake Griffin (Chuck), Kyle Lowry (Kenny)"
Chris Paul is who everyone thinks Draymond Green is
CP3 with the draymond green statline
Rumor has it that Draymond Green is waiting in the parking lot of the American Airlines Arena at this very moment.
Bam hitting a fuck ton of mid range jumpers in regular season seem to mean jack shit in Playoffs where his scoring aggression is equivalent of Draymond Green. He also has no reliable post moves despite having pretty good touch around the rim
Draymond Green suspension as well
"Pat Bev, Draymond Green"
"no one's saying he sucks, most people here bar the trolls just think he's a glorified draymond green which is not that wrong."
Fuck Draymond Green  But he's right...
"Draymond Green plus run the offense, push the ball in transition, attack the rim, screen and roll, and leak out for easy points. He's smart enough to read and take advantage of what the opposing team gives him, which is why his game 1 and 2 box scores look so different"
Counting rondos points is like counting Draymond Green or Ben Simmons points. Not an accurate reflection of impact. He has a 9.0 net rtg compared to lou Williams 1.3. And is a much better pg who can facilitate the offense and defend. Hes been a capable shooter there as well. There’s a reason they made the trade  You’re the only person ive ever seen who says their roster isnt better
"Harden played with Chris Paul and had an arsenal of great shooters around him. LeBron had Kevin Love and he was in the East. Curry played with Draymond Green who’s useless unless he has a great team around him, and was in the West. LeBrons 2018 run was still more impressive, but Steph definitely definitely deserves a pass for this season."
So essentially you are asking Ben Simmons to be like Draymond Green.
"Certified by Draymond Green, Psychotic Head Destroyer"
He got grazed on the chin and held his eye like draymond green poked him
The hardest road of facing 2nd option Draymond Green
"4 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, 5 blocks.      Fucking draymond green"
Anthony “Draymond Green” Davis
Draymond Green would do wonders for the Clippers. People wonder why he’s so valuable and clown on his triple singles. Here is your answer. Every defense needs someone directing traffic.
"If Kerr remains the coach, he can rebuild and that is the continuity in the franchise (in addition to Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, if the latter ever plays basketball again)."
Draymond Green:   “They don’t love you like that! You thought you was Kobe”
This isn’t even a discussion lol. OPs points boil down to “Joe Harris and Jeff Green at better 3 point shooters than Andre and Draymond so the nets offense is better”
"Harden, LeBron, and soon to be Jokic. I want another year of this from Joker before I out him in Harden or Lebron's level, cuz they've been scoring and playmaking at elite levels for some time. Curry is close but I'd take a playmaker with on ball gravity than an off all player with gravity but requires a Draymond Green type to get the ball to the open man. Curry is great for the system GSW has, but Curry just isn't the offensive weapon that the other two are where you have them and everyone else is pluggable. With Curry you would want a playmaker on that roster, with Harden and LeBron you don't."
Those Tristan Thompson/Draymond Green illegal screen battles were a sight to behold.
"This is a mostly subjective arguement. KD will go down as one of the most skilled scorers in the game of basketball, Top - 20 all time guaranteed.   Now, a three peat is a different dimension all together so let's just say he wins two or three titles in BKN w/ FMVP atleast twice. This should, on paper, make him move up in the rankings considerably to atleast top 10.  This should theoretically put him in the pantheon of the players who were legendary at their position like Bird or Duncan.  However historical context is definitely important in terms of the legacy arguement. Pure stats alone shouldn't determine the all-time rankings. One should take into account that for most , if not all, of these title runs , Durant had the best supporting cast ever consisting of transcendent players who themselves are atleast top 30, like Steph Curry /James Harden (?) and players who were elite in the roles they played like Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/ Kyrie Irving. Not to mention that the there were almost no teams in the NBA even remotely close to being as good as the GSW dynasty (We'll see how BKN does). So it must take a bit away from KD's personal role on these rings. Don't get me wrong, he was still the best player on these legendary teams, but we should look at the bigger picture here."
Thats why I didn’t bring up scoring or offensive rating. I’m just looking at the individual players. And it simply is easier to exploit Draymond/Iggy than Joe Harris and Jeff Green. If we are looking just at the Big 3 then the Warriors get the edge.
the warriors had draymond green so i dont see the issue.
Did you even watch the games? Draymond shot 39% from 3FG in the 73 win season. But once KD came he was a crap 3 point shooter and midrange shooter. Teams could leave him WIDE OPEN and that destroyed the Warriors spacing. The Nets don’t have that type of weak shooter in their closing line up. With Jeff Green and Joe Harris the Nets have zero weaknesses on offense.
I disagree. The Nets offense is better than the Warriors offense in isolation. If all possessions were half court the Nets is much better. Alot of the Warriors offensive dominance came from defense. Draymond is a huge negative on offense. Klay is not elite creating his own shot. And the Warriors didn’t have a super elite playmaker like Harden. The Warriors had multiple weaknesses on offense you could attack. The Nets with Green/Harris has no weaknesses on offense
"Draymond Green won 3 rings, will probably make the Hall of Fame, and is consistently top 3 -5 in DPOY voting and ppl here constantly shit talk him when he shit talks  Not that many superstars or stars trash talk these days bc it will impact their free agency/trade destinations so it's harder to find top level guys"
"Draymond Green, Tyler Herro.   No other superstar rn really trash talks other than Luka so I can't really give an example there, Draymond is the closest rn"
"Growing up I loved KG, Rasheed Wallace, and Latrell Spreewell for their shit talking. Just loved 5he energy they brought to the game. Gary Payton and Jordan are also notorious shit talkers with big fan bases. Not a ton of shit talkers currently,l. draymond green is the first that comes to my mind and I'd say he's mostly seen as not thuggish. People expect him to be on inside the NBA. Like paid to talk shit on TV."
The guy he’s taking about is Draymond Green.
In what world is Draymond Green better offensively than Harris? Man you gotta wake up
"What about offensive role players? Harden’s playmaking is better than Curry and Klay combined. He makes Joe Harris, Green and Blake far more deadly. Meanwhile you got Draymond bricking open 3’s all day."
"The need someone to orchestrate them on the floor. Good starting point guard or Draymond Green type of player. They just don't know what to do, running around doing nothing for too many posessions."
Draymond Green jizzed in his pants to this clip
"Draymond got suspended for a nut shot that wasn't a nut shot and LeBron got a ring because of it. Green also got a flagrant two for the but shot in Adams.  So if you want consistency, this is a flagrant 1 at minimum."
is draymond green a joke to you
"it’s not just the clippers. this is how basketball fans talk about dark skinned players  draymond green “donkey”  marcus smart “bulldog”  vs. facu and delly, the epitome of hard work and effort on the court!"
I’m so glad to see the spirit of Draymond Green still in the playoffs.
"Anthony ""Draymond Green"" Davis"
"Draymond Green did this same thing twice in a row and didn't get ejected for either, was the league rigging games for the Warriors too?"
"Lmfao alright then slugger, as you don’t know how to use Google, here are links proving that you potentially have an acquired brain injury:   [The flagrant 1 gave Green his fourth flagrant foul point of the playoffs, which carries an automatic suspension.](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16151747/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-suspended-game-5-nba-finals-cleveland-cavaliers)  [Green has been on the cusp of trouble for much of the postseason.

wow the draymond green special right there  how lebron fans gonna treat AD for doing it
AD just went full Draymond Green lmfao
"How very Draymond Green-ish of you, AD"
Draymond Green got traded to the Nets that quickly?
"Shit, Harden got poked in the eye three times by the warriors and just played with one eye for the series trying to win even in the blowouts. Fuck draymond green."
You could get one and still keep Ben. Only reason Ben is considered a “point guard” is because the 76ers don’t have any other playmakers at all. He would be at his best playing the Draymond Green role at which point he’d just be a 6’11” PF who can’t shoot which is nowhere near as big of a deal. That’s why it’s a shame that Masai got so greedy in the negotiations for Lowry because he would’ve made perfect sense.
trading away jrue holiday is honestly the biggest blunder in nba history. in an intense playoff race u got the 6'8 black morty from rick and morty playing like ben simmons or draymond green as a compliment to another star who can’t shoot. meanwhile jrue ain’t no pussy bitch he be bombing away that shit at a 40% clip. the pelicans woulda made the playoffs if they didn’t trade jrue holiday away for a 6’0 cheerleader that thinks he deserves to be on the all-defensive team when he’s outta the league in 3 years but now they gonna lose zion
trading away danny green is honestly the biggest blunder in nba history. in an intense playoff series u got the 6'11 black morty from rick and morty playing like ben simmons or draymond green as a compliment to another star who can’t see the rim. meanwhile danny ain’t no pussy bitch he be bombing away that shit at a 40% clip. the lakers would’ve won in 4 if they didn’t trade danny green away for a 6’3 cheerleader that thinks he’s worth 25m a year when he’s outta the league in 3 years but now they gonna get swept
trading away harden is honestly the biggest blunder in nba history. in an intense playoff series u got the 7'0 black morty from rick and morty playing like ben simmons or draymond green as a compliment to another star who can’t shoot. meanwhile harden ain’t no pussy bitch he be bombing away that shit at a 40% clip. okc would’ve won in 4 if they didn’t trade the beard away for a 6’7 cheerleader that thinks he’s worth a max when he’s outta the league in 3 years but now they gonna get swept
Trae just put up 32-7-10 in his first playoff game. Has Simmons even scored 20 in a playoff game yet? I don’t like Trae young but he’s objectively better than Ben Simmons simply because of how good of a fucking offensive player he is at his age. Simmons is a quicker draymond green with better passing and somehow WORSE fucking shooting.
"People expected Simmons to play like Lebron, but he turned out to be Draymond Green"
"There's witty banter and friendly heckling, and then there's straight up disrespecting  grown adults like this.   I loved the post the other day where a fan called Draymond Green a bitch. Green noticed he had his young son next to him and told him ""Is that your son with you? Why would you teach him to act like that? Why would you say that?"" He was parenting him in front of his own son.  That lady with lebron too. [These kinds of people](https://youtu.be/4f3GNCa7YYU) always fold like an omelet when you call them out on their bs."
"Easily the answer is Draymond Green for the Warriors, and it’s not particularly close. Monta had a great run too, but Draymond’s career blows Monta’s out of the water."
I honestly think PRIME draymond green was more important than Steph curry. This was when he could slash and make 3's. Early Steph curry was insane but this new steph curry is playing at a different level.
Draymond Green reminds me of Kuroko from Kuroko Basketball. He can’t shot but could pass really good. He even had to learn to shot in order to benefit his team. Draymond green is the only reason why curry gets double team easily. No one is guarding him.
Can we all appreciate the pass by Draymond Green. You need to play for too long to achieve that kind of chemistry
so he is basically draymond green
"He needs a strong second option that can play defense, if not give him a Draymond Green type of player along with CJ!"
Draymond Green definitely.
Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Plus Steph is the best off-ball player of all time.
"Tbh if you’re Draymond in that situation you’ve gotta know that guys are going to try and get you another tech, you have to be smart enough not to rise to the bait. Or even better, just don’t accumulate so many techs that 1 more will get you suspended in the NBA Finals, seems to be a good strategy for every player not named Draymond Green"
A Butler not aggressively pursuing shots and fouls is a poor man Draymond Green.
Lol clips of flopping are always made fun of and absolutely shat on c'mon. LeBron's ones are just more popular because he is obviously more famous than say a Marcus Smart or a Draymond Green
ben simmons a light skin draymond green
bam really out there doing his best draymond green impression. and he way be even worse at that than draymond is lmao
Butler cosplaying draymond green bruh
"Draymond **""The REAL Splash God""** Green for 2022 is something I didnt know I needed"
Reminds me of the time Draymond Green killed LeBron.
&gt; Picks are vastly overrated.   Klay Thompson 11th pick 1st Round Draymond Green 35th pick 2nd Round Steph Curry 7th pick 1st round   Tell me again the best they can hope for.
"Any person that studies basketball understands that a man-to-man defender has much less impact than an offensive wizard. Dramatically less. In most instances, defense isn't half the game.   Now, if you're a defender like Draymond Green than you can do man to man coverage, roam around and direct people and you surely can have a more dramatic impact on the shape of the match.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry has more impact on a game than any other player besides those who's name starts with an L and ends with an on."
"He's much more than that.  He has really good bball IQ so he understands the next move within an offense.  So, much like how Draymond Green will catch the ball after Curry is trapped or doubled and know what needs to happen against the 4v3, Lonzo will also know the next pass or move after an advantage is created and make the correct series of decisions.  But, to be clear, this is different from being a play-making guard since he's still relying on someone else to generate an advantage.  Klay isn't that type of player."
It's more accurate to say he's the 3&amp;D guard version of Draymond Green.  He'd be fantastic for GS but I don't know how that deal gets done.
We just need a starting level PF to be honest. He can be Draymond Green as a scorer if he could lockdown the paint.
"Jesus Christ. This is the payment for all of those Finals appearances. Even if it weren't for the luxury tax, those postseason games take a toll. Klay has missed two seasons and counting.                Steph missed most of 19-20, and Durant missed all of it. The only reason Iguodala didn't miss a beat is because he sat all out that time with Memphis. Draymond Green was probably the only player from the core to walk away intact."
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
"I mean true we cant assume he'd be worse or better than draymond  But I think its fair to assume hes probably worse than Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid right?  Becauze those are the guys whos shots he'd be taking"

&gt; Draymond Green  he isnt their primary ball handler and is a PF and not on the perimeter
Gobert is a great player. Only idiots that listen to that fraudster draymond green believe he isnt. Gobert is scoring more points than draymond did throughout the season and the have to guard him in the pain. Nobody guards donkey and he cant even make a damn layup. If curry leaves him his career is over.
Bruce Brown been watching too much Draymond Green with that last shot attempt.
Draymond Green is ! And I hope 🤞 Simmons is not the next green
"I know Draymond Green doesn't agree, but the Jazz really are a complete team. Every player on the floor is a threat to score, and can defend."
Patrick Beverly is the Draymond Green of the Clippers  Hated by everyone else. A defensive star. An offensive liability.
"Narrator Morgan Freeman:  *And Draymond Green, (pause) sheds a tear*"
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
I had Draymond Green PTSD right there
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
Why leave when you have steph curry Draymond green and Klay Thompson? Or having russel Westbrook and a good supporting cast. Dude just wants super teams
It should be easier. Use him as the screener. If they want to sag then the guy he screens for should be wide open. Thats the reason Draymond Green gets guarded at all. Giannis should never be the primary ball handler except in transition.
"He was one of the quickest players in the league when he played, guards included, he would have done just fine, you're talking about an Olympic level track athlete.  He would have been a better version of Draymond Green in todays NBA."
"Right now, everyone below Draymond Green has a little to no argument for getting it. Draymond will get in for playing on a successful team. As Barkley correctly described him, the ugly member of the boy band."
"Exactly. The Celtics of those times were just as fast paced; maybe even faster since there wasn't a 3-pointer.   Russell anchored those teams defensively. If you're making a comparison, at the very worst, maybe a much more athletic Draymond Green."
"Blake ""Draymond Green"" Griffin."
"""Looking at you, *George*""  - Draymond Green, probably"
Draymond Green?
73-9 Warriors Edition Draymond Green
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n4f1o6/highlight_three_spurs_players_are_scared_away/  Not taking away from Draymond green, he’s an incredible defender. I just wanted to share this because you made me think of it."
"Imagine comparing an all-star team to Steph fucking Curry, Kevin fucking Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  Wanna know the accolades between all of them?  * 26x all-star appearances * 6x scoring champ * 10x nba champ * 19x all-nba * 2x finals mvp * 3x mvp * 6x all defensive * 1 dpoy"
Draymond Green. Spacing would probably be even worse though
"It would be really interesting. The defense would be insane for sure, and the whole squad is also very athletic. As people have pointed out, in the modern NBA, this team looks like it’ll have spacing issues on offense.    Assuming every player is in their peak, the worst player is Iggy, and he’d be a top 30-40 player.     IMO: - Peak Duncan would still be a top 3 player in today’s NBA   - Peak Pippen is top 10  - Peak Butler is top 15  - Peak Simmons is top 25   I really do think it’ll be tough for any championship team in the last 5 years to score over 100 on this squad. I really like switchability of the 1-4. Iggy is the smallest perimeter defender, and he’s 6’6 220. Duncan is one of the greatest defenders of all time and will anchor the defense.    The problem is, I don’t know how much points this team can actually put up. If you have 3 top 15 players (with 2 being top 10, and 1 probably being the best in the league), and the other 2 are top 30ish, though, I just don’t see how this team loses based off talent.    The 2017 Warriors are probably the best championship team in the last 5 years, so it would be:    Curry, Klay, Iggy, KD, Draymond    vs.    Simmons, Butler, Iggy, Pippen, Duncan     The Spurs had the best defense in 2017, and game 1 of Spurs/Warriors makes me think this defensive super team has a very good chance at winning. It lacks the shooting of Mills and Danny Green (and even Kawhi), but it’s just so much more athletic and talented that it’s not even funny. The defense of this super team would be on a whole other level of the 2017 Spurs.    Peak Duncan &gt;&gt; old gasol    Pippen = Kawhi   Iggy &gt;&gt; LMA   Butler &gt; Green    Simmons &gt;&gt; Mills"
"If all you did was compare stats and never watched a game of these two, you'd think Ben Simmons was a higher scoring version of Draymond Green lol."
"I don't really watch the show; I only catch clips from this subreddit and occasionally see the half-time show if the game is on TNT.  But my understanding is that the progression went from:  -Charles makes a ""guarantee"" prediction and says ""GUARANTEE"" in a memorable way  -the crew eventually creates a button for him to press that says ""GUARANTEE"" to lean into the joke  -over time, the crew escalates by setting up a mic system with a robot voice that can add to the joke. Examples include the robot telling Draymond Green that he doesn't eat enough donuts or has too many championships to use the button when he tried to use it.  -recently (just the other day, I feel like, but I forget the context already) Chuck pressed the button for a ""GUARANTEE"" and the crew used it to flash the lights and play dance music.  -and then today it escalated all the way into a full on circus."
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
"&gt;Draymond Green: “There's no defensive situation where you don't want me on the floor.”  NBA Finals. Game 7. Overtime. 15 seconds left in Overtime. Other team has the ball. Draymond Green has six fouls and has fouled out of the game.  Coach: ""Draymond, noooo get back on the bench! You've fouled out!"""
"Draymond ""Backpack"" Green"
"lets put it this way - if you could only have one of the two on your team (and yea we dont know all the other variables/players but assume its an average team) do you want draymond green or rudy gobert? seems like a decent question. im going dray all day. im a dubs fan but like he said, there is practically no situation where dray is a liability, and he orchestrates the entire rest of the team on defense. not to mention he can basically run an offense too."
Draymond Green is a lot like LeBron James. He’s the best defender in the league and someone you’d pick to build a championship team. Same way LeBron James is arguably the best overall offensive player in the league or at least has been. They are both ultimately the most valuable but don’t see all the accolades and awards that come with it. But people know the truth.
"Superstars: Players in their prime that have won league MVP or played at an MVP level in the Regular Season, Playoffs, and/or both.   - Bron Bron  - KD - Jokic - Kawhi - Curry - Harden - Giannis  - Luka  - Street Clothes  - Kyrie  - Dame  - Embiid   Bron Bron:   &gt; Draymond Green   KD:  &gt;   Kawhi:  &gt; PJ Tucker (check the stats)   Curry:  &gt; Dillon Brooks cuz I can’t remember who else really slows him down 1v1   Harden:  &gt; Wes Matthews   Jokic:  &gt; DeAndre Ayton (No, it ain’t just recency bias nephews)   Giannis:  &gt; ~~The freethrow line~~ Just kidding, probably Jonathan Isaac   Embiid:  &gt; Marc Gasol aka Big Daddy Spain  Luka:  &gt; Porzingis   AD:  &gt; Draymond Green   Kyrie:  &gt; No idea. Any ideas?  Dame:  &gt; Jrue Holiday"
Kevin Hart vs James Harden / Draymond Green 2.0
\*draymond green.. not danny
"Yes, vital! Extremely important! Ask any Boston Celtic fan or laker fan if Perkins played an important role in the finals series they played.  Stats don’t tell the full story of a person’s value, look at draymond green.  If he’s not on the warriors, are they still a dynasty? Probably not.  Perkins is not as versatile as green but the defense he played, the screens he set, and the rebounding he gave them was super important to their success.  In addition, when he was at the 5 he allowed kg to play and dominate at the 4 without having to expend energy guarding the other teams 5. Again, I am not a fan his commentary but don’t denigrate him playing career because he’s out of pocket sometimes!"
Draymond Green seems to always be rooting for the more talented teams. It checks out.
"I said it in another comment, but I give those kind of talks no weight. You’re predicting a team with Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, and Jordan Poole — who a lot of Warrior fans like — to be worse than a Sixers team that was actively trying to lose games.  It doesn’t work like that when it’s actually played out."
"&gt; ""Everybody like, 'Look, oh, man, this guy led the league in steals, that guy led the league in blocks.' But is there a situation where you can put that guy in and make him uncomfortable? For most guys, yes. You can't put me in a situation on defense and make me uncomfortable."" https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-explains-what-puts-him-above-rudy-gobert-dpoy-debate  I get what Draymond is saying here but he needs to explain this a bit better. He's right those defensive stats are overrated but he should counter with other better ways to measure defense."
"I agree. But with how easily that narrative has stuck to ben simmons and how far it’s gotten him in DPOY conversation, I could only imagine this narrative sticking to Michael Jordan like glue. I’m just saying that, say LeBron has an MVP season next year, I don’t think LeBron would have to do as much as Draymond Green to win DPOY. I’m not saying MJ would deserve one, but I think he could get one in this era."
"What the fuck is this comment? I have no dog in this race, and I would say 100% Lebron was the only reason they were in that finals. Against KD, Steph, and Klay, with Draymond Green getting a solid mention. Having watched that game 1, and the following 3 games, I really don't understand your comment. Who else helped consistently and constantly carry that team like LBJ did?  Edit: I get it. Poster I replied to is a bulls fan, so they need what they said to be true or else they think it means lebron is better than mj because he carried 2 completely different cavs teams to finals series that they shouldn't have gotten to."
Draymond Green and his fucking WWE move on Steve Adams
"Draymond Green eye poke on Harden is one. Valanciunas on Metu is another, pulled him off the rim, broke his hand and the league closed their eyes."
"famous G Leaguers Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Jordan Poole(he WAS a GLeague player, he's a very good NBA level talent now), Kent Bazemore"
It's a shame that he's content being a bigger Draymond Green when he has the body and skills for the most part to be so much greater than that.      I guess in the end tho he's a contributor on a top 5 team in the league so he's doing what he needs to.
"Simmons, Prime Draymond Green, Bam, and AD are my top choices."
"Simons, draymond green, giannis"
listen I know Draymond Green is an NBA all star with multiple championship rings and shit but I'm some fuckhead on the internet that can kinda eurostep decently so he's probably wrong
Curry requests for a trade.  LMAO haha either Simmons plays Center (not sure if this will help at all) or you trade Draymond. You can't have Ben Simmons and Draymond Green in the same lineup. None of them deserve the bench either.
C: Ben Wallace PF: Dennis rodman PG: draymond green SG: tony allen SF: Andre Roberson
"So, is Ben Simmons what Draymond Green was now, or am I looking at box scores too much?"
Ben Simmons is Draymond green but just taller and more athletic
"""Shoot it you fucking bitch""... Draymond Green to Ben."
He should be compared to Draymond Green.... not these all time great scorers
Draymond Green?
Draymond Green if Inside the NBA doesn't work out
"Lol Draymond Green doesn't exist? Okkkk.   If you value elite scoring most, then you're allowed to say that. There's just other factors to the game that other players are better than KD at, while still being able to bust your ass on the offensive end, obviously to a lesser degree."
Draymond Green says he’s the best defender in the world…
Draymond Green the nutcracker
"Peak Draymond could shoot from outside the paint. What Ben has over Green in some areas, Green has over Ben in others. I don’t know about “bigger better.” Maybe “slightly different.”"
"I know everyone gets on Shannon for that fake quote tweet but there was legitimate basis to it. Obviously not from KD but Draymond was a teammate and saw KD every day. This is a comment from him below:  “In my opinion he got the best of ‘Bron [in the 2017 Finals], like Kevin was f****** rocking,” Green said on the All the Smoke podcast in April 2020, according to CBS Sports. “After that, that was kind of that moment of like, damn Kevin should be the best player in the NBA now because of what he just did to LeBron. And it’s like, you turn on the TV the next day, and the f****** headline is, ‘LeBron James still best player in the world?’… That’s when I kind of felt like it took a turn. And then we came back for the 2017-18 season, and Kevin just wasn’t as happy.”"
"At what point are we going to call this team what it is. The most unfair team in the history of sports. The team that every rule relating to be business of basketball is made to prevent. From salary caps to luxury taxes to trade regulations. At what point are we going to recognize that it's not working and stop this shit. We've had 2 years where one of three super teams hasn't won the championship in the last decade. And one of those was only because half the super team got injured in the finals.   My idea to fix the NBA is this. No team is allowed to add a third all star if the team already has two all stars from the previous two years. If the team has more than 2 all stars but they were already on the team before they were all stars a la Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green that's fine. But we have to stop this bullshit of superstars jumping on bandwagons with other super stars. We obviously can trust superstars to have a backbone and not do it out of sportsmanship. And part of that is because apparantly not enough people care or are willing to admit that the NBA is broken.   TLDR: Every rule in the NBA is made to prevent what has been happening to the NBA ever since KD bandwagoned on the Warriors and has ruined competition and sportsmanship in the NBA every single year but one since then. It's time for the NBA to step up and do something that is destroying competition, sportsmanship and the entire point of the National Basketball Association."

"Then there's Draymond Green and Pat Beverely winning all the championships, get these thugs outta the league smh bruh finna truuuuu cap"
"When has KD taken a bunch of scrubs to a championship lol? His only finals appearances featured *three* of Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Russel Westbrook, James Harden, Klay Thompson, and Surge Ibaka"
"Because it's easy.  The easiest narratives are unsurprisingly also the most regurgitated by those that either don't care to inform themselves or it plays along with their own personal views.  This sub is perfect for studying that sort of thing if you were so inclined or perhaps needed to write a paper about it for school.  Take all the Lebron/Steph nonsense that goes back and forth on a near daily basis.    Disclaimer:  The following is not based on my fandom of either player.  ""Lebron choked vs Dallas so that means \*insert hot take here\*.""   Now anybody that watched that series would be justified having this opinion, \*something\* was off with him, but if we look at the stats, he led all players in scoring in Game 6, and game 5 had a triple double.   So there are clearly two sides to this story.  This is one of a hundred Lebron watershed moments that come up all the time.  I'm not offering my opinion either way.    Same thing with Steph.  Did Steph choke in 2016?  He was the leader of the best regular season team of all time.  73-9.  Game 7 he goes 6-19.  But talking heads and many fans will say Draymond getting suspended game 5 or my favorite, Andrew Bogut getting hurt, was the reason they lost.  Very rarely do I see or hear Steph being objectively awful in game 7 as the culprit.  And by the same token, Draymond Green who scored 32 points in that same game 7 with 15 rebounds and 9 assists, who is still on Steph's team btw is now garbage and Steph should be MVP because he's playing 1v9.   This sounds like I'm down on Steph, but I'm not, just playing devil's advocate in both scenarios.    So now back to Blake, not exactly a player that moves the needle in the same way that Steph and Lebron do, so the easy narrative and overwhelmingly popular opinion is skewed even further than it would be otherwise.  Few people care enough either way about Blake to delve into the story that is presented.  So ""Blake bamboozled Detroit, stole their money, then quit on the team"" is the narrative, and if you ask why, most people can't or won't answer that question in a satisfactory manner because the real answer that they are embarrassed to state is ""Because I saw a bunch of people say so on reddit."""
"Draymond green, Marc Gasol/ Serge Ibaka, AD....all great defensive centers"
"What else can the warriors even offer? They wont trade curry or klay.   Blazers wont ask for draymond cause they would be rebuilding but even if they do, you warriors fans wont give up green for him?!  There is nothing else left."
"I think it is a lot more players than people think.  Look at some of the players on here [for example](https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30482938/ranking-best-nba-players-2020-21-50-11). I think there are over 20 players that can be the best player on the team and still win it all if the rest of the team is really good as well. If you have a team like Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert for example I think that team can win it all."
I did this once in a rec league. Told my teammate to look out for a specific pass and yelled then shoved him right into it. I felt like Draymond green and I've been living off that high since. For some reason it's one of my favorite memories. Was kind of a holy shit I can't believe that worked moment
Draymond Green is the definition of a star that's also a complimentary elite role player.
"&gt;You're basically positing that Draymond Green is so valuable that he makes Steph look like a top 5 player of all time.   Why is it unreasonable to think that Draymond propels Curry from looking like a, say, top 15 player to a top 5? Curry for his career shots almost 10% better eFG% with Draymond on than with him off - you don't think that's absurdly relevant? I don't even know if a duo exists that has more minutes together in the same timespan. Of course it's relevant.  The on offs you keep linking don't matter because I'm not saying Draymond without Curry is better than Curry without Draymond. You're conflating my argument with something else, and you keep falling back to posting general stats while ignoring lineups that Curry plays alongside relative to the field."
"&gt; Just looking at Steph's on offs and comparing it to Lebron and KG makes no sense because you're assuming the teammates he had were of equal value. My argument is that has never been true.  Do you think I was making a 1 to 1 comparison? The point was that there are only a handful of players that have a +/- profile that is comparable to Steph Curry. These players include people like Lebron, and KG. This would also include people like Tim Duncan and David Robinson if cleaningtheglass went back far enough. You don't see role players that have these on/off profiles -- it just does not happen. This doesn't happen for any of the other players on those Golden State teams. This happens for top 10-5 level players.  You're basically positing that Draymond Green is so valuable that he makes Steph look like a top 5 player of all time.   If we look at on/off derived impact metrics that adjust for things like teammate and opponent quality, we see that Steph still dominates these metrics (ex. [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm)) while Draymond is always much [worse](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm). We can look at KD's and Klay performances in this metric and see that they are still much worse than Steph (Steph has outperformed KD in this metric since 2015).   These all-in-one metrics are very good at what they do. We can see this through out of sample tests via [Ben Taylor](https://fansided.com/2019/01/08/nylon-calculus-best-advanced-stat/) and [Taylor Snarr](https://dunksandthrees.com/blog/metric-comparison)  Is there something that you know that these metrics don't? lol"
"&gt;What do you guys think of what Sir Charles said?  What do I think? Objectively I think LeBron should try to win a real ring  2012: Middle School Thunder, lockout shortened season  2013: game 1 = 7/16, outscored by Tony Parker (L); game 2 = 7/17, outscored by Mario Chalmers (W); game 3 = 7/21, outscored by Danny Green (L); game 4 = only good game, 33 points (W); game 5 = 8/22, outscored by Tony Parker again (L); game 6 = 2 turnovers in final minute. **Bailed** by Ray Allen  2016: Draymond suspended, Curry injured, Bogut out, Kyrie game winner game 7  2020: Mickey Mouse summer league invitational tourney"
Draymond Green mostly for “You thought you was Kobe”.
draymond green is a huge ball handler what? That's why steph curry being so great off ball is so important. Draymond is their pg.
I **literally** just told you. Ever heard of Draymond Green?
"Exactly. And the way they rely on 3s to make it go. I know Luka is one special player, but seriously the team would just get hurt if they rely to Luka only.   The teams that advanced in the second round have different playmakers. Suns have booker and cp3, nets have the big 3, sixers have embiid and simmons (aka the younger draymond), bucks have holiday facilitating and giannis. Jazz have flexible options including clarkson that can swish some 3s and slash. All of them doesn't rely on 3 game, and even the warriors don't want to rely on 3game it's just that they have curry and they have literally bunch of players (except green and wiggins) that has not been quite adept in high motion offense."
no wonder he created the Splash Brothers.  Kerr unleashed them with ball movement. And made Draymond Green a DPOY with a top defense alongside Bogut and 6th man Iggy and Livingston
"Were Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green drafted #1 overall with “generational talent”, LeBron comparisons out of the gate.   The criticism for Ben is harsher because he has more potential, higher expectations. If you said Ben Simmons in 2018 wouldn’t be a top 15 player three seasons later it’d be a surprise."
and it only works when he has competent passers like Draymond Green who can operate in the short roll and help find him after he relocates
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
"Tyronne Lue is the unsung hero this series. Made adjustments and went for the small ball lineup.  I can't praise it enough. Obviously the Clippers were exceptionally hot tonight and Luka was still an unstoppable force (even with Kawhi defending), but Lue made adjustments during this series and it paid off. Get Pat Bev and Zubac out. Have Batum play the small ball 5 ( inspired by my man Draymond Green and countrymate Boris Diaw ). Batum held his own against Bobby and KP, and since game 4, the ball has been moving very smoothly. They absolutely made fun of the mavericks frontcourt on offense (especially KP). Drive and kick. Pass. Make the shots. They had to sacrifice rebounding for more defensive versatility. I hope people stop treating Ty Lue as a below average coach. He did great.      Shoutout to the clippers players as well. The role players absolutely stepped up. Kawhi is still Kawhi, and PG wasn't as abysmal as last year (pretty decent I guess lol)."
"Guess we'll see what happens, but if Embiid is healthy, the Sixers have a great chance.  For the record, Ben isn't even really the third scoring option when he's on the court. I think people just need to get their head around the fact that someone can be highly valuable without being one of his team's scorers. No one has this conversation on this scale about defensive minded centers like Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green type of all stars."
Draymond Green has left the chat.
"Who has more value, Ben Simmons or Draymond Green"
philly defense is getting the miluakee/jazz treatement. playing drop coverage in the postseason gets u worked.   Theres a reason draymond green is the best defensive player of this generation and a hall of famer. he can guard that pnr better than anyone while standing up high and playing that 2v1
"I just don't see how Simmons actually fits in the modern NBA.   He needs the ball in his hands to be effective on the offensive end but he's not an elite scorer and can't shoot for shit.   In order to manufacture more points, you need an elite scorer that can shoot threes at a great clip to make up for defenses sagging off of Simmons. But if you have that, you're taking the ball out of Ben's hands and if that's the case, why bother with Ben if you could just get a 3&amp;D player that can actually space the floor and allow the elite scorer to operate with space.   Like I could maybe see Simmons embracing more of a Draymond Green role and being a contributor on a contending team, but in the modern NBA, you need your point guard to be able to shoot 3s."
They gave him the draymond green treatment....except Blake can actually shoot
"No, but fuck people who never have worked half as hard as a professional athlete in their life being pricks to them about their work ethic.  Just because someone works a job doesn’t mean they’d worked as hard as them. If you are that delusional to think the difference between a grocery cashier and draymond green is genetics you’re an idiot"
No no that’s dumb Kevin Durant and draymond green Twitter logic. Logical fallacies out the ass there
"I honestly have no clue but will defer to Draymond Green lmao  I thought a bigger issue was not pounding the paint more, didn't really give the PnR that much thought."
Draymond Green would be sick for this Nets team.
Blake Griffin has fully embraced the Draymond green role for this nets team
"We definitely would have forced 7 on Warriors. As for beating them, I don't know as Curry and Klay were getting great and Draymond Green is tough as nails."
Lebron has had literally one season in his entire career where he lost in the playoffs to a lesser team and that was 2011. That's it. Jordan would have lost every single finals lebron lost with the exact same teams lebron had   07 spurs clearly better 2014 spurs wade and bosh were both washed spurs clearly better  2015 warriors lebron loses his second and third best player and takes the clearly better team to 6 games 2017-18 warriors had 3 top 10 players and draymond green on it probably the best assembled team in history.   And those are just his finals losses.
"Wasn't that the series where they blew huge leads three games in a row and got swept?  They're the only team that I can remember that didn't sag off of Draymond Green (and he cooked them the whole series).  I know the Warriors were streaky and capable of big 3rd quarter runs, but that version of the team with a depleted bench and an injured KD should not have swept the Blazers."
"100%  Coaching matters in the NBA, but much less than people think. First and foremost, you need a good roster. The Blazers haven't had a team that could truly compete for a title. Dame is good enough to be the best player on a championship team, but their second &amp; third options aren't good enough and the rest of the bench isn't good enough.  He needs his Klay Thompson and Draymond Green - CJ and Nurk aren't going to cut it. You could replace Stotts with Nurse (best coach in the league imo) and *maybe* they make it to the WCF at best, but you can't compete for a championship without having a top tier roster."
Oh like Lebron getting a comeback win against the Warriors after Draymond Green got suspended?
"&gt;modern day version of Kenny Smith is, and my first reaction was Danny Green.  &gt;Buddy's response was Draymond  You two should never compare players ever again. Like seriously, stop it."
"There have been plenty of athletic freaks in the NBA who flamed out because while they were supremely gifted physically/athletically, they were also dumb as fuck on the court. Some found a niche playing limited off-bench-roles, many others washed out of the NBA entirely.  Making poor decisions with the ball (both passing &amp; shooting), making poor decisions off the ball (movement, defensive rotations etc.) and generally looking lost on the court.   There is a reason why Draymond Green despite his glaring limitations as a player is still so valuable to the Warriors, because more often than not he makes the right decisions when he on the court. Kerr's motion offense needs players who have at least a passable degree of basketball IQ to function, we all saw the difficulties Kelly Oubre &amp; James Wiseman had trying to fit into the Warriors."
"I think the key term is *physical dominance*. Even in an era full of plodding giant big men, Shaq was just so much bigger and stronger than everyone else and actually skilled enough to convert that advantage into easy buckets in the paint.  Shaq was 320 in his Laker days and still mobile. See how Embiid was throwing Capela around like a child? Embiid is 280, *40 pounds lighter.* He'd get manhandled by Shaq. Most teams don't even have a rotation guy within 70 pounds of shaq.  Prime Shaq in today's NBA would probably turn small ball on its head. Draymond Green? No fucking chance, he'd foul out by halftime and Shaq would have 40 and 20."
Draymond Green is proof of this. That motherfucker couldn’t hit a 3 pointer for shit but you put the game on the line and I for some reason expect him to hit it.
I don’t know if it’s Danny Green but I know for sure it ain’t Draymond
Draymond green is smarter than you do basketball.
"Real question is if team USA needs a game winner, how are we getting Draymond Green open?"
You forgot:  2012– DRAYMOND GREEN
"Draymond Green is literally the archetypal modern power forward, the guy who brings every other position together on both sides of the floor"
Stephen Curry would have little to no playoff success without Draymond Green
"Because it is a positionless league today.  There are only 2 centers that would give Simmons problems, Embiid and Jokic... and Giannis, who isn't really a center.  Everyone else either doesn't have a size or doesn't have the skill to be a mismatch vs Simmons.  Simmons at the 5 is prefect for a ""switch everything"" style defense.   On offense he should be a great roll man, he's a lob threat, he's can pass if they double from the corner, he can do everything but pick and pop.  He's like a bigger more athletic Draymond Green."
"It's Ingram, but Simmons in the right context could be better, like when Draymond Green was a top 10 level impact in 2016 because he was in the prefect system to showcase his abilities.  Simmons in a situation like that could be better than Ingram, but Ingram is good in any situation, he's good enough at everything that he isn't hurting the team, and that's just not the case with Simmons."
"Idk what exactly Toronto gets, but this is a 4 team trade idea I have to get 3 players in different situations.   Pascal Siakam -&gt; PHI, Ben Simmons -&gt; GSW, Draymond Green -&gt; POR  Why the Sixers do this: Siakam is a much cleaner fit next to Embiid offensively due to his superior shooting abilities, whilst at the same time, not blocking the development of guards like Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton. Siakam takes over Simmons role as primary perimeter defender. More than anything, this trade makes Embiid *happy* as Siakam is one of his guys since they are both from Cameroon.   Why Golden State does this: This is a bet on Ben Simmons reviving his career in the most optimal situation for him. You are essentially hoping to turn Ben Simmons into the next Draymond Green with some slight differences, Simmons is not the rim protector that Draymond is, which makes Wiseman important, conversely Simmons is a much better perimeter defender and a point of attack defender is needed with Klay likely not being up to scratch in that kind of role anymore.   This is a talent acquisition bet for Golden State, their 5 they would be rolling with would be Simmons/Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Wiseman.   Why the Blazers do this: This is pretty simple, to make Dame happy. Dame and CJ have long wanted to play with Draymond after that 2019 WCF series where they were exposed to just how good he was, CJ went as far as photoshopping him in a Blazers jersey.   I'm not too sure what Toronto ends up with in this scenario, Covington for sure as part of salary matching and I suppose one of Nurkic or Derrick Jones Jr.?   Not sure who would need picks out of this to be properly compensated."
"I don't think he deserves it because he's one of the best 12 players the US can offer, but neither is Jeremi Grant or Draymond Green. Looking at the other roster choices though, Love is the only big man on this team that can stretch the floor with his shooting (unless we are playing KD at the 5), and he has plenty of experience playing internationally and off-ball. I could see an argument for Randle, but he's too much of a ball-dominant player to play with better creators like KD, Booker, Dame, etc."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again: Draymond Green shouldn't have been assessed a flagrant foul on the [""body slam"" of Michael Beasley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIWzTBskqEk) during the Rockets series. It seemed pretty clear to me that he's holding Beasley during the inbounds, Beasley tries to spin and jump to get away from him, and both lose balance and fall over. Common foul for sure, but not a flagrant to me. In my mind, along with Steph slipping on Motiejunas' sweat, it was actually the Rockets that actually cost us the 2016 championship."
&gt;My brain glossed over Danny and I thought this was Draymond talking.  Happens.  Source: friend was SUPER excited to pick up 'D. Green' in fantasy thinking it's draymond. Was Danny 🤣
Patrick Beverly and Draymond green are not good defenders. They are just allowed to foul where others are not.
But he's just going to ignore that Draymond Green made the team. Guess who scored and rebounded more this year..? Kevin Love.
"Maybe Ben Simmons would benefit if people just considered him to be a poor man’s Draymond Green. I think Draymond’s intelligence and willingness to at least try to shoot and score make him significantly better, beyond just being a better defensive player, but if we just looked at Ben and stopped expecting offensive skill at all, maybe that would work for everyone."
Yea but you can do that everywhere. To be fair CP3 undercutting Lebron on a FT was a potentially series altering injury. As is him flailing his legs irregularly like draymond green cup checking Steven adams.  https://youtu.be/di2X8utj9Ng  https://youtu.be/Dy3cmIq6kFQ
"Absolutely, I don’t think love should be on it, draymond green either. But that they’re white or black has absolutely nothing to do with it."
Warriors fans talking like he's an elite 3&amp;D guy when he's barely passable on defense playing next to perennial DPOY candidate Draymond Green and barely passable on offense playing next to offensive GOAT Steph Curry.  His value is literally negative to anyone who doesn't have both of those things.   He's had one decent year on a team that missed playoffs and Warriors fans are acting like the team has rehabbed the image that Wiggins has had in his entire career prior.
"If it weren’t for klay Thompson getting injured a few times - I’d say the warriors are perpetually in great shape from a roster standpoint.  They have a lot of good problems to have.  Curry, Thompson, Kelly oubre, draymond green and pascal siakam as a small ball center.  Watch out.  That team is gonna win a lot of games."
"1. Simmons value isn’t as easy as saying “well he he was 2nd in dpoy”. Perimeter defense is significantly less valuable than interior defense, so paying 35 million dollar for a net negative on offense and a elite perimeter defender is a waste. And then when you realize that’s he’s regressing on offense and unplayable in the playoffs, it makes a Simmons as a center piece ridiculous. He’s literally a 35 million dollar Draymond green with no heart, he’d be a great as a 4th option on a championship team imo, but not as Washington’s tank commander with Russ. Also I never said he has “no value”, just that his value isn’t close to Beal, which should be very obvious.   2. Idk if you’re serious but what decent young players do Philly have? Tyrese Maxey doesn’t move the needle really as he’d be taking the ball from Deni’s hands, and Matisse is sort of useless on a rebuilding team. GSW, BOS, DEN, and NOP just off the top of my head have better packages."
That's a Draymond Green!!
Draymond Green is Draymond Green minus *some* basketball stuff.
Pat Bev is  Draymond Green minus all the Basketball stuff.
Hello hello it's draymond Green. Will u join us and win so we can win fraudulent rings? It will truly be the hardest road
Lmfao bro DrayMOND GREEN HAS MORE ACCOLADES THAN UR ENITRE COUNTRY! fucj outta here lmao.
"Top 5 is a joke. He is not even top 10: Russ, Harden, Rubio, Lonzo, Curry, Lowry, Jo Morant, Draymond Green, LaMelo, Butler, Holiday, and Lillard. Some players are debatable but good luck fit Ben Simmons in the top 10 playmakers."
"If I am the Cavs i am speaking with Colangelo and convincing him to choose Randle or outright banning Love from playing, let it go to the NBA arbitration / players association  Love was a part of the championship and was rewareded handsomely but since he got that big bag he has been utter trash - 10-20% effort and borderline toxic to the lockerroom  now after not giving any effort for the team and fans that are paying him millions of dollars he doesnt deserve at his age and skill level - he is going to play for team USA where he cant offer anything of value on the court and when he is taking a spot from Randle, who just had the best season of his career and was the centerpiece to the Knicks making the playoffs  Sorry ive said this before and ill say it again, I have ZERO respect for anyone with the last name Colangelo  NBA old timers get respect when it's not deserved - another great example is Stan Van Gundy - how many times is he going to alienate his young players and destroy lockerrooms before he never gets another coaching opportunity. Meanwhile there are great coaches who are passed up even for assistant roles and who dont even get a head coaching interview  Draymond Green - sure i understand he brings the intangibles  What does Love bring? No defense, no post game, barely shoots well from 3Pt   He is barely going to see time and his minutes would be better served for a rookie in the NBA let alone for Randle who deserves it way more  Fuck Jerry piece of shit"
"A package better than the 21st pick rookie PG, a players who offensive game is so poor he only gets 20 mins despite being an elite defender, and a guy who gets paid $35 to be a worse version of Draymond green. Hmm I really can’t tell if you’re serious or not"
"I agree Draymond like in switching 1-5, but his b-ball IQ is nowhere near Green imo. That being said he'd be amazing next to Steph and Draymond."
Yeah I saw the video with the new jumper and it looks much better there and the newer one is more fluid than Kuminga.  Talent wise they are similar types of players but Orlando needs a scorer more which is where I think Kuminga has the edge.  Barnes is like a 6’9 shot creator but for others and not himself.  If he ever developed a more well rounded offensive game he’s probably the best prospect outside of Cade and Green but he’s coming in as a negative scoring the ball.  He needs to be on a team with scorers already so he can be like a Draymond type of player.  Ironically the Warriors would be awesome for him.
The hell do you think hood culture is? Whose hood? Cause Kwame Brown didn't grow up in the same kind as Draymond Green.
"Yeah, the difference is he’ll have one of the greatest offensive players ever commanding defensive attention and Draymond green passing to him putting him in an even better position to score. The fact that you think it’ll be *more* difficult for him to score the ball is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how team building works.   This “he’s on a bad team so his stats don’t count or won’t continue” is proven false time after time after time after time. It’s almost never accurate and the player almost always continues their production when the team becomes good. See: Booker, Trae, etc. The same thing will happen with Lavine very soon."
&gt; What a lot of people don’t realize is that Kobe would protect Shaq in defending the pick and roll. Kobe fought like hell to go through screens to protect Shaq from getting killed by quicker guards.  That and pick and roll wasn't run nearly like it is today.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2016/12/19/16077164/nba-pick-and-roll-lou-williams-kemba-walker-draymond-green-f9a1ec934a2a  Shaq would cough up a few more points per game against modern offenses.
"that’s why the KD Warriors are the best team in basketball period. Not only do you have arguably the greatest scorer of all time in Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, but you added him to the best regular season team of all time led by Stephen Curry whose offensive +/- the past 7 healthy seasons has been number 1 in the league.   Steph also has an argument for greatest scorer of all time and has the most influential gravity the game has ever seen, on par with shaq. We witnessed that this past season, and he led the league in points and ppg on league best efficiency on whatever minimum shot attempts (Kevin “you know who I am” Durant actually led it but he had too few games to be in contention).  Then you had Klay “Game 6“ Thompson, who can get BUCKETS with the best of em. No one is hotter than Klay Thompson when they get hot, he has the NBA records to prove that. 6’7’ SG who was at one time the best two way player in the entire league. The ultimate SG you’d want on a 5 man rotation. There are levels to catch and shoot. And he guarded the opposing team’s best perimeter player most nights.  This is rounded out by Draymond Green, the modern era’s best defender period.  We took for granted that it wasn’t just all stars joining forces, it was literally two Top 15 players of ALL TIME, and 2 (3 if you think Iguodala gets in) other Hall of Famers. Yeah, watching what Steph and KD did individually this past season was spectacular to watch as a fan. Here’s hoping that Klay, too, makes us remember how fucking badass he is. The game will feel robbed if he doesn’t"
Draymond Green begs to differ.
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"
Lebron is an exception (and maybe MJ as well) as Love and Thompson were above average at best. But Trae and Luka are no Lebron.   Also the Warriors had Draymond Green. The raptors had Marc Gasol and Ibaka but I will admit that neither was in their prime that year.
"This is a great 'thought experiment' kind of question because it gets you thinking about the value of production in terms of not just volume or efficiency, but temporality. I'm sure someone, somewhere has cooked up a ""clutch"" stat and you'd think this player would rank near the top. Yet their utility would be limited by the amount of time they were actually effective. Could you use them besides the end-of-game situations as many have suggested? One other scenario comes to mind.  The Golden State Warriors went from the Death lineup to the Hampton's Five lineup with the signing of Durant. They used to play half-ass until the start of the third and then blow out the other team in five or six minute stretch. I wonder if Mr. Thought Experiment could be used as part of a lineup with high efficiency scoring players.   In some ways he is a short-term Draymond Green; he won't stretch the floor (1pt/game means he's not even a good free throw shooter) but the ball will move and the defense won't be bad when he's in there."
Draymond green
"I think you’re underestimating Draymond Green - no defense is going to be shitty so long as he’s in the lineup and motivated, as well as the Warriors defensive culture."
Dame getting draymond green just like he asked
"Perfect: Oubre does a sign and trade ($15M) for a proper centre (like JoVal, so Wiseman can learn/come off the bench) or you reunite the squad with a Miami trade for Iggy. Package 7 and 14 to move up in the draft. Healthy Klay, Steph still with the green light, Wiggins has improved stats with the better spacing Klay provides. Draymond continues his assist wizardry and actually works on his shot this summer. Baze signs a minimum contract to stay as the premier bench celebration guy. And yes, Klay is back and after a two year break is ready to wreck the league a la Durant. Chriss comes back for a victory lap on the cheap.   Realistic: Hit on one of the two picks, wiseman runs in place this year. Looney walks as he sees the writing on the wall with their current big men and trade speculation.   Worst case: Oubre walks for nothing. Wiggins becomes unhappy due to continuing his stellar two way play but not getting enough touches. Klay comes back as a shell of who he was before. Wiseman regresses/becomes tentative."
"I think it shows how important it is to be patient with your younger players too. The exact opposite of what Draymond Green was trying to push. Booker already has his own franchise, with an incredibly talented young second star in Ayton. Maybe they should get to play together for a couple years and create their own thing just as Steph did in Golden State."
"Worse. That’s because Giannis plays best more like a long Draymond Green on defense compared to Gobert.  Giannis can play Center and still do a great job (heck, he’s also good as a wing defender), but he’s best suited to off-ball help."
I'd like to counter with Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green.
"The Warriors have 2x MVP Steph Curry, multiple time All-Star Draymond Green, and “2 way Wiggs” (their words not mine). They have absolutely no excuse for losing to Memphis"
Draymond Green. It’s been a while since he’s kicked anyone below the belt.
He’s playing great and I don’t hate him for that. I hate that he practically complains his way to reviews on out of bounds calls (game 2) and complains his way to fouls but faces nothing from refs. He’s a worse draymond green right now but with a worse team (not saying much considering those warrior teams were all time)
"I keep saying the Clippers are like Draymond Green never getting technicals cause he's ""passionate"" except the clippers are just ""physical.""  The charge where Book was getting hacked by Jackson is a good example. So many grabs and hand checks but it's up to the Suns to go hard to the basket more"
Easily LeBron making the game 7 dunk over draymond green. Green would have had to retire right there those are the rules
"Ah yes, Draymond “Lottery Pick” Green, Nikola “first overall” Jokic, and Giannis “couldn’t trade up to get him” Antetokoumpo"
"If I were Sarver and could go back in time, I'd draft Kawhi, Draymond Green, Giannis, Jokic, Booker, Siakam, DMitch, and Luka  And I'd stop 9/11 and I'd become a billionaire."
"its almost like he is the new draymond green, only cares about the 16"
Draymond Green re-hurt Conley's face in 2015.
Draymond Green is an elite playmaker among bigs. He has been our co primary ball handler since 2015-16 and he’s been fantastic
"Draymond Green  I say this with 100% bias, fuck everyone else."
"Idk man if they won with a triple double game 7 by Draymond Green, yes he might get it"
Draymond green.  Edit: why is this downvoted. Is dray not an elite defensive player?
I voted Blake Griffin for the Grizz. But I get Draymond. He hit Conley in the face after breaking his face against the Blazers in the previous series.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/video-draymond-green-hits-mike-conley-in-the-injured-face-on-loose-ball/  Conley clearly calling a timeout and Draymond comes in grabbing at the ball and hits him in the face. It’s pretty bang-bang but lots of Grizz fans weren’t happy with how it went down.
Kinda like how draymond green won’t make a random team a contender but he will put you so far over the top of you are a contender.  Obviously green is way better than Caruso but it’s the same sort of situation
2015 draymond green hit mike conley in the face in mikes first game back from a facial fracture as he wore a mask
My question is who tf is asking Draymond green to shoot the basketball. Once from him is more than enough
Ben Simmons would make the warriors better than Draymond green.
Ben Simmons playing like great value Draymond Green
"If you can make Ben Simmons into a taller, more athletic Draymond Green, then that’s a huge W. He might not like it, but I think that’s what best for him"
I love how all of you know more about basketball than Draymond Green
"because he just can't shoot. his ceiling is draymond green, and that's not a knack on him because draymond is a HOFer, but simmons is never going to turn into a 25 ppg player, and that's what PGs are nowadays"
Kinda making Steph Curry work harder to get open shots off the ball   Makes Curry work harder for his spots  they can sag off you and have your defender cheat on you onto curry  good teammate draymond green you dumbass
"""But Draymond Green is a much better player""                Yeah, he averaged a triple single on 48% true shooting when he didn't have Steph and Klay last year. With Steph having an all time great year this season he was so good he got the Warriors all the way to the play-in tournament. I mean they lost and missed the playoffs but how good was Green! Simmons helping his team to the #1 seed and then having one terrible series in the playoffs isn't anywhere near what Green accomplished....right guys?"
Facts. I would rather take a box and 1 defense Steph Curry half-court shot than a Draymond green wide open backpack brick
"Draymond is in a way better position surrounded with arguably the two greatest shooters to ever play the game. You can argue that he’s better than Simmons on the defensive end but it’s marginal at best (although Simmons is way more versatile due to his size/athleticism). Offensively it’s not even close. Green can’t dribble or create anything, his passing ability is average or just above average. It looks like he’s good at passing because he’s running set plays and giving it to all time shooters who don’t miss. Simmons has better vision, is more explosive, a better finisher at the basket, the list really goes on. The shooting doesn’t matter because neither can shoot. The argument you can make is dray’s leadership but Simmons is clearly the better player. Draymond is asked to do way less on the floor then Ben."
Ben Simmons is way better than draymond green
You can’t possibly be calling Simmons the worst scorer in the league while comparing him to Draymond Green lmao
Ben Simmons needs to become Draymond Green. That's his skill set
Literally Draymond Green but doesn’t take dumb shots.
whats better than 1 draymond green? 2 draymond greens
"Does Draymond Green make the Sixers a championship favorite? I don’t think so. They still struggle with spacing, scoring, and roster imbalance. That’s what I mean when I say a lateral move.   In the 2 play-in games, Draymond shot 5-16 while averaging 6.5 points per game despite playing 43 minutes per game. Swapping out Simmons because he can’t score and is an offensive liability for Draymond who can’t score and is an offensive liability is just…weird. Also, Draymond is not better in EVERY category. Simmons is, despite his issues, a much better offensive player (shit Draymond averaged 7 points per game this year. 7!). He’s also a terror in transition. He’s also a better perimeter defender, although Green is a better overall defender. He’s also 24 instead of 31.   I don’t think Golden State moves Draymond. It’s a likely downgrade for them and they’d lose a integral part of their team’s fabric. But I don’t think Philly would take him either.   And I’m sorry, but Wiggins is not even close to Simmons.  He’s a better shooter, but that’s literally it. And this is coming whose username is Andy_Wiggins."
Guerschon Yabusele the French Draymond Green............ sigh
"The  2014 OKC thunder had top 6 offense and a top 5 defense. The Warriors this year had a top 5 defense and were 20th in offensive rating. When Curry was off the floor, they had the 5th worst offense in NBA history( and thats not even taking into account today's pace). They wouldn't  have made playoffs. Draymond Green already would be useless on offense without a player like Curry or Klay playing offball. KD needs a decent point guard to be at his best. His whole career he had Westbrook,Curry,Kyrie,Harden. In 2014 he had Reggie Jackson who played well as a starter."
"Sounds like bullshit. You can't play him with Draymond, and there's no way in hell that Golden State is going to trade Green for a worse version of himself who seems to have the basketball version of the yips."
"In the same sense that Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are role players, sure."
"""Simmons drives, kicks it out to Draymond Green, Green swings over to Simmons, then back to Green, who hands off to Simmons. Simmons drives again, then swings it back to Gr---shot clock violation."""
Draymond Green is better than Ben Simmons in everything. Why would they want him??
Ben Simmons is a draymond green but way worse offensively
"""Everyone has a plan 'till they get kicked in the nuts""  - Draymond Green"
"its not a 6 player draft when 5 players have respective upsides of magic johnson, kobe bryant, hakeem olajuwon, gary payton, and kawhi leonard, and the 6th player has the upside of draymond green"
How tall are danny and draymond? Green

Draymond Green and kicking balls
Fiz rooked our whole team for 2 years. His interim head coach had more wins in half a season than Fiz in his whole career. “Lance Thomas is our Draymond Green” Fiz was smoking crack man

"Jay Williams calling Simmons a “Supercharged Draymond Green” is so dumb  I’d kill to have Draymond on the Blazers, not so much Simmons"
"Draymond Green is a joke hahahaha  Weak ass player, it's a crybaby and never played good defense without being in a super team."
"Yeah, the archetype is a big stretch for Theis. Having watched a lot of Celtics games for the last three years though, I assure you that this is the most common comparison (I mean he's undersized but intelligent. Every big fitting that description gets compared to Draymond Green. And when he plays in lineup with a point guard and three wings the word ""death lineup"" inevitably escapes some commentator's lips).  You disagree that Grant Williams is a really bad imitation of Draymond Green? I actually think that's the most obvious of any of these."
"It shouldn't be, because they have Draymond Green, but that's where that ""bunch of individuals"" thing comes into it.  One of the things that makes Draymond Green great to have on your team is that he doesn't let *anybody* be out of position if he can help it... but the rest of the team needs to *listen* to him."

"And that the US fields a sampler platter of whoever is free after the playoffs that season. For a lot of countries, players good enough to play pro ball in the NBA or even in other major international leagues are hard to come by, so it almost pencils those guys in for a decade on the squad.  For the US, it’s almost like, “Who’s had a good playoffs and doesn’t have anything lined up? Can we get DeAndre Ayton out here?”  I know it’s not really as haphazard as all that, but Team USA ought to recognize that it really does need a higher degree of continuity and commitment. Assorted US/NBA talent might still be good enough to beat most/all(?) other national squads, but it’s clearly not good enough to win in a walk. And considering the gargantuan target Team USA has on its back in international tournament play, I’d appreciate if there were at least 4 guys who were 27-34 year-old NBA players who had made this commitment two years ago.  Not necessarily “For Old Glory, KD and Steph need to —“ blah blah, but Team USA should know they have a baseline of guys who’ve all been multiple time all-stars who can serve as starters in a pinch if not a reliable third rotation. Line up multi-year commits well in advance from, say, Paul George, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler. Easier said than done, I know, but I could see it being marketable to being a backbone of Team USA. Hell, if KD wins a third gold this year, I bet he’s back in three years to try for a fourth. But maybe it’s better for the squad overall if guys like Butler and Green had been vocal about returning from ‘16 once the 44 man finalist list was announced last February. Something."
"LOL Team USA has a bunch of egos too. Not all of them are willing to play roles like Manu, Tony, Duncan, Diaw, Kawhi and Green. KD wants his isos all the time. Dame wants to run the pick n roll. Draymond can't really be a threat on offense."
"If Draymond Green is your best playmaker, your team is built wrong"
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
Lol I take Ayton over Bam... Who is a power forward... Bam is a bigger Draymond Green.
"Love brings Olympic experience.   Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andre Drummond, Mason Plumlee, etc...  That’s the quality you would get in Kevin Loves spot. Draymond is the only player better than Love on that list currently, but even in 2016, Love was a better player than Draymond."
[Dray averaged 6.8 assists per game this year without Curry](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/draymond-green-average-assist-without-steph-curry-in-2021)
This team has no leadership. Draymond Green was leading their postgame huddle and he has to be one of the worst players on the roster
I’m sure he will get some mins in random games. Do you not remember Draymond Green barely playing in 2016? People weren’t mad then. Love is the least of problems on this team. Someone was always going to play &lt; 10 mins. The problem is the guys getting 20+ mins are fucken ass this year.
This is a fucken exhibition game. No one was in a circle jerk when Draymond Green played 5 mins a game in 2016.
"Holy fuck that’s hilarious. Exhibition or not, a team with kevin durant, Damian Lillard, draymond green, Bradley Beale etc just got beaten by ingles, patty, delly, thybulle and a bunch of nbl players. That’s fun."

Draymond Green: 1 point will never not be funny
Draymond Green is actually so good
"For one season? Draymond Green. Better defender, super smart offensively, and not afraid to take shots when he has to. Definitely better in a half court offense than Ben Simmons imo. Long term Ben Simmons since he's younger."
Draymond green is your MVP USA
Let me put this very simply   You want Simmons over Draymond simply as a *trade asset*. Draymond Green is the better player *now* but Simmons is far better value as a *trade asset*. Hope that helped.
*Draymond Green has entered the chat*
Draymond Green. Everytime. Even if he’s 35 years old
My opinion is similar. I think in their prime  Draymond Green was a bit underrated and Thompson was a bit overrated.
"Fair, there's a lot of faux earnest troll posts here that come up so I was unnecessarily snappy.  To give some more context, Jackson actually did a good job in 2012-13. But in retrospect, it's clear some of the things he did very well were not necessarily intentional. If anything, I'm actually more critical of Jackson's coaching job that season than I used to be.  On the second game of the year, Brandon Rush tore his ACL. Rush's career never recovered. But before that point, he was a very solid 3+D wing who figured to peak as a Danny Green type. Harrison Barnes was already slotted in as the starting SF, but he then got thrust in 25-30 minutes a game. Andrew Bogut, who was acquired the season before while he was recovering from an ankle surgery, played the first games of the season, and then didn't play again until February or so.  So only 5 games into the season, the Warriors' were down two of their top 6-7 players. Under those circumstances, Jackson was forced to make adjustments and he actually made some really smart ones. Draymond Green got rotation minutes as a rookie, even though he was an even more horrific shooter than he is now. He was very useful even though he shot badly AND he was playing the 3 with Richard Jefferson at the 2 (mind you, RJeff killed the Warriors in the playoffs 3 years later at the 4). The Warriors frequently closed games with Steph Curry/Jarrett Jack/Klay Thompson/Carl Landry/David Lee lineups. Back in 2012-13, those teams had more spacing than other NBA teams and Lee's defensive shortcomings were masked with him at the 5. The Warriors surprised a lot of teams that year and Steph Curry really turned it up to end the season after being snubbed for what should have been his first All-Start appearance.  In the first game of the 2013 playoffs, David Lee tore his hamstring off the bone. The next game, Jackson went small with Barnes at the 4 and Jarrett Jack at the 2 and the Warriors quickly took control of the series. Steph had spacing around him and with Bogut setting screens, he tore apart the Nuggets and upset them as the sixth seed.  The Warriors then faced the Spurs, who they hadn't beat in San Antonio in nearly 15 years. The Warriors came within a possession of taking game 1 in overtime and Steph Curry had 42 points. There was a defensive breakdown at the end of the game that fucked things up, but it was clear the Warriors were not a fluke. They beat the Spurs decisively in game 2 when Klay Thompson got very hot. It looked like the Warriors might actually win that series, but Steph hurt his ankle and played decoy in the final two games of the series, and Bogut also reinjured his ankle and was very limited in the end of the series.   But in the final games of the series, Greg Popovich figured outsmarted Jackson in a way that later seemed prophetic. He put Tony Parker on Harrison Barnes and because the Warriors had a perceived mismatch, they fed Barnes in the post over and over again and Barnes had high volume scoring performances in the final games of that series. But the problem with a Barnes-centric offense is that it takes the ball out of the hands of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. The Spurs won the math battle in those final games of the series and Popovic figured out a very exploitable flaw in Jackson's philosophy, which is that Jackson will attack ""mismatches"" whenever he sees them."
"If you have to ask, you weren't watching those Warriors teams.  Jackson had the Warriors passing less than almost any team in the NBA. Opposing teams could goad Jackson into calling ISO post-ups for pretty much any player on the roster so long as the other team put a smaller defender on a Warrior player. Jermaine O'Neal, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes post-ups were a fundamental part of the 2013-14 Warriors' offense. Harrison Barnes played shooting guard in many bench lineups that year. Draymond Green was a 3 for much of the season, until Jackson finally started using him in closing lineups at the 4 next to Andrew Bogut. The Jermaine O'Neal/Mo Speights frontcourt was a thing. Kent Bazemore played the back-up point guard role. It was an absolute mess."
"damn right I'm a Hornets fan so I have every right to bitch and moan about anything I want to.  Helps me get through the day.  IDC about what the Warriors do per se, just draymond sack tappin green"
Overall it was Draymond green
"&gt;unless you trade Ben to clear cap space.  ""Hello presti? Take a 2nd and a 24 year old with potential that worst case scenario is draymond green.""  Presti would hang up thinking its a prank call because anyone would say yes to that deal.   Trading ben for cap relief is easy. Getting an elite scorer back with ben is whats not easy."
"Draymond is a hard to compare player. If you have no number 1 guy, I would rather have Ben, if I have someone who can get me buckets I would rather have Green.  But still, Ben should play with someone like Lillard Curry etc to really compare the two. Green's prime started when he was 26 or smt."
"One would hope so.  But doesn’t Lillard have a no trade clause as well? Wondering how that shakes out since he’s from the bay and apparently loves Draymond green, who happens to be massaging Lillards shoulders right now on the team USA bus"
"I mean Dame Dolla is from the Bay Area, and for some reason has a hard on for Draymond Green...can’t say I won’t be surprised if something does happen.  That’s all I’ll say about it"
Los Angeles Lakers: Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Anthony Davis/Nikola Jokic  LA Clippers: Trae Young/Paul George/Kawhi Leonard/Zion Williamson/Joel Embiid  New York Knicks: Luka Dončić/Devin Booker/Jimmy Butler/Julius Randle/Karl-Anthony Towns  Brooklyn Nets: James Harden/Kyrie Irving/Kevin Durant/Giannis Antetokumpo/Rudy Gobert  Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Jayson Tatum/Draymond Green/Deandre Ayton
"I disagree. Dennis Rodman, Draymond Green, Patrick Beverley-- all superstars, all great defenders, mediocre scorers. Green is one of the league's best passers, but those other two are useless on the offensive end. Which is fine, because you don't need 5 scorers. Ben Wallace was a superstar in his day, and his presence in the Hall of Fame underscores that."
"&gt;That ""injured team"" is regarded by the community as the core reason Kawhi is in the ""top 5"" category.   That isn’t true whatsoever. He was universally regarded as a top 5 player before he ever put in a Raptors jersey. You either started watching basketball that year or you’re practicing revisionist history. Go make a post asking if Kawhi was considered top 5 on the Spurs and the overwhelming majority of people will say yes.  &gt;Whether it's fair or not, people talk about the finals FAR, FAR, FAR more than the rest of the run.   No they don’t, wtf? The 76ers and Bucks series are widely regarded as his playoff masterpiece and what enforced that top 5 status.   &gt;People talk about Kawhi being a 2x Champion and 2x FVMP, not a Champion and FMVP and ECF Champion, y'know?  Lmao…you’re making this into a weirdo Warriors fan thing as opposed to an actual discussion about Kawhi  &gt;Yes, Steph was still on the Warriors team, but you guys literally used a high school defensive tactic JUST to stop Curry and Curry alone because his supporting cast couldn't punish it.  To say it was just to stop Curry *alone* is something Warriors fans have convinced themselves and not at all reflective of reality.  The actual answer is that Klay Thompson played the vast majority of that series putting up 26 ppg on **70.6 TS%**. Yes, he got injured but **he played far more often than he didn’t** and to say Curry was alone *the entire time* is factually untrue.   By the way, you lost 11 out of 14 quarters with Klay in the game.  Also, Kawhi was hobbled on one leg and not even remotely 100%   Also, we were missing our best wing defender for 100% of the series. Pretty sure OG missing 6 games balances out Klay missing 1.5  &gt;Also, who were the 2 all stars?  Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.  &gt;Bucks were just as injured in the ECF as the Hawks were, as they were missing Donte.  This comment is way too stupid to warrant a serious response."
"You forgot ""I am the best defender of all time"" Draymond Green."
*laughs in Draymond Green*
"Draymond ""I'm better than Rodman"" Green is 6'7"""
Yeah idk. I feel like anyone who’s watched basketball for a few years or even saw the Draymond green situation when the Cavs came back from 3-1 should know this rule.
It is possible to defend guys driving at the rim without fouling  Anthony Davis and Draymond Green have lots of tape if Ayton and Monty want to check it out
But then the league doesn’t have a safety suspension to “balance” the series a la draymond green
"Lol just stop. Klay Thompson was a two way player and a much better offensive player than Draymond. Defense isn’t as important as you’re making it out to be either. Tony Allen was one of the best defensive players of his generations. You can’t build a team around Draymond Green.  Offense, in particular scoring, has always been more valuable than defense when it comes to assessing individual players. Kawhi didn’t make an all star until he started scoring like one.   Averaging 23+ for multiple seasons and getting 25 a game is nothing to sneeze at. 6x all star as well. Draymond has never dominated in any major category. Perimeter defense is not a major category when assessing star players either. He’s honestly lucky he even made 4 all stars. Had he been playing for any other team other than the Warriors I doubt he would have been selected"
"A *much better* case? Mitch had all-star games and scoring; yeah those are a dime a dozen. He was Tom Chambers at the guard spot. Gobert and Green are all-time defenders, Draymond was the 2nd-best player on a title team (every analytic shows him to be worth more to Golden State's offense at its peak than Klay), and helped to usher in a new way of looking at defense. Just because Draymond didn't score in bunches, doesn't mean he's a tier below a good scorer who did fuck-all else during his prime."
Draymond Green is definitely a warrior on the court
Draymond Green obviously lol.
"&gt; KD told a confidant that he didn’t think the Warriors would get any better if Steve Kerr couldn’t hold Draymond Green accountable for his outbursts, and that he was occasionally irked when Steph got so much attention from the media and from the fans.  I’m only surprised he’d admit it.  &gt;Kyrie told his trainer, Bazzell, that he wanted to be remembered as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, and he wanted to win multiple championships in the next few years, back home.  &gt;As for the best-ever part, the trainer gently replied, ""You know... right now, we’re at the point where, um, people view you as probably the second- or third-best point guard in the current league, not even all-time. Just... right now."" Steph Curry, the boy-prince of the Warriors, had two MVP awards to go with three rings and counting, starring on Golden State’s near-perfect lineup of all-time hoopers.  And I’m surprised the trainer’s willing to share this 😂"
"…maybe not as a long term prospect  But Draymond Green is so much better right now than Simmons.   He isn’t a shooter but he has to be respected at least a little from the 3, and certainly more than Simmons. He will launch them if they walk away and let him.   His defense is better.   His passing and playmaking are better.  His leadership and mentality are better.  He really is just clearly worse at transition offense imo."
"I feel the need to remind you, that there were a couple things missing in those last 3 games of the 2016 finals... Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut, enough said."
Swept by an unreal suns team. No shame in losing to a better team.   Curry has draymond green and still cant  get to the playoffs. Jokic had MPJ and got through the first round. Big difference.
"&gt;Kareem would be a better fit for reserves and he was also Perfect scorer with All-Defence team and Block champion and has chemistry with Magic also on the reserves.  If you believe Shaq wouldn't work due to chemistry issues, then Kareem would be slotted in. Due to Shaq's potential, I kept him in.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And then for 11-12 you have both Rodman and Draymond but talk a few times on KD lineups, so let only one of Rodman and Green do the hustle and add KD. If you take KD , also Take 2019 Kawhi and get rid of Draymond’s antics that KD and Green dont get into a fight on the bench.     I originally had KD on the team as the last 2 but I realized he'd NEVER accept that, so I changed him to Rodman. Sorry for the mistake, I never fixed the Durant lineup mentions, so I fixed them now, and the point works with KG.  2019 Kawhi is interesting but I don't really think he's too necessary. With his limited minutes, he won't add enough to risk the chemistry.      &gt;Btw , 2004 KG was great but couldn’t get Spurs or Lakers to win the chip , however 2006 Dirk did beat Spurs with a crazy series and G7 , and was Robbed in the Finals , so maybe we should start 2003 Duncan (he will cover the defence ) and Kareem (more offensive firepower), and have Dirk (offence) and Russell (defence) on reserves     KG consistently had possibly the worst supporting cast in the league, right down there with Lebron. Using his success is really unfair imo. His playstyle is a perfect fit for any era. The reason Dirk wouldn't work is this:  ""This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him.""  KG offers help defense beyond what Kareem and Duncan do, he is far more mobile and agile, and smarter. If your curious on an example on help defense and rim protection, a good one is Giannis and Brook. Giannis does the help defense, and Brook does the rim protection. Just because Brook is good on D, doesn't mean he can do every type of D. Kareem alone or Russell alone means the defense isn't good enough to deal with say Bron/Curry/MJ/KD/Shaq, a hyper offense. You need a multi layered defense in these all time team situations. KG being there is a security blanket of sorts, and Dirks offense isn't enough to replace it. Besides, KG can stretch the floor enough. Fit matters."
"One of the great analyses I’ve ever read and agree with you mostly.  Kareem would be a better fit for reserves and he was also Perfect scorer with All-Defence team and Block champion and has chemistry with Magic also on the reserves.  And then for 11-12 you have both Rodman and Draymond  but talk a few times on KD lineups, so let only one of Rodman and Green do the hustle and add KD.  If you take KD , also Take 2019 Kawhi and get rid of Draymond’s antics that KD and Green dont get into a fight on the bench.  Btw , 2004 KG was great but couldn’t get Spurs or Lakers to win the chip , however 2006 Dirk did beat Spurs with a crazy series and G7 , and was Robbed in the Finals , so maybe we should start 2003 Duncan (he will cover the defence ) and Kareem (more offensive firepower), and have Dirk (offence) and Russell (defence) on reserves"
"You’re speaking as if it’s Bucks-Suns, like it’s an NBA game. This is USA vs Nigeria. Your ‘bench unit’ isnt really a bench unit they’re supposed to be starters 1B. They’re not supposed to just have ‘good plus minus’ they’re supposed to be capable of blowing out the competition just as much as the starters (and if the starters can’t). Draymond Green and Jerami grant? Lol. In years past that would be Chris Bosh and Dwayne wade, or Carmelo Anthony and Paul George."
"Man, no 😂 Coaching doesn’t matter in the Olympics my guy, and neither does “one of the greatest defenders ever”. It’s the Olympics not a gutsy 50 win team.   This team is one of the worst and people who know better said as much 2-3 weeks ago. Olympic teams are supposed to be stacked. People like Jrue holiday, Jerami grant, Kevin love at this stage, draymond green—-yes, draymond green—-traditionally wouldn’t even make a national team.  And no facilitating PGs. The other bad national team? 2004. AI and Marbury. No traditional, facilitating PG. You need that and every team but 2004 has had that.   2016- Lowry   2012- CP3, Deron  2008- CP3, Deron, J Kidd  2000- J Kidd, Payton   1996- Stockton, Payton   1992- Stockton, Magic"
Draymond Green and Lebron James?  That would have been an interesting duo
The fact that Draymond Green is one of the best players we could muster up is a joke. The guy isn’t even an all star level talent. He’s a very good role player and that’s about it.
Draymond Green
"They’re on the same tier for me, but my point wasn’t that draymond was better, it was just that those lists aren’t really indicators towards anything.  I do think Green does get in to the hall of fame for sure though considering it’s relatively easy to get into."
"Lloyd Pierce drew up maybe the dumbest last play you possibly could.  Double screen for LaVine that took 8 seconds to develop.  Not Dame or KD or JT, the three clutchest guys in the league.  And not only that it was setup with the two screeners so that JT goes to the rim and Draymond Green goes to the three point line.  So acourse they ignore DG.    &amp;#x200B;  Really damn stupid."
Draymond green looks like andre drummond compared to the rest of the players
Draymond Green? Idk any other “DG” on this team.
You can tell how elite the NBA is when you see Draymond Green actuallly scoring in these international games.
as a warriors fan I feel like this is great conditioning for draymond green to stay into shape going into next season.
"I think the Vuc trade actually hurt their offense. Less minutes of Thad Young doing his best Draymond Green impression, and more average efficiency scoring from Vuc.  High volume bigs who don't have elite efficiency and are mediocre on defense aren't players you should be throwing picks at in a team in Chicago's situation. I think that trade basically doomed them for LaVine's prime."
"What if I told you, no one talks about Draymond Green?"
"For sure, I'm just saying in his first couple years most people didn't go ""yup, that's future DPOY, multiple all-star, all-NBA Draymond Green right there"""
"Draymond green is involved in running the show ""ow my balls!"""
I respectfully think that youre insane.  Beal has so much more value than draymond green
"People on this sub really think Draymond fucking Green is more entertaining than this man, it’s incredible."
"""so I decided to grab bigger players by the jerseys and kick them in the balls to even up the height deficit. The league never stopped me so I just kept on fouling and fouling and everyone said I was a good defender because the rules didn't apply to me."" Draymond Green"
Well that’s the beauty of it Edwards/Kat the duo and Simmons in a Draymond Green role
"I took my son to a petting zoo, and when he asked about wanting to see the donkeys I showed him a photo of Draymond Green"
"He’s been just as bad shooting, he’s definitely not been worse. Bledsoe’s playmaking also went to shit and he was a turnover machine, Jrue’s at least still been alright there even if it is part of a Draymond Green impression."
"Yeah since All star and all nba nods Klay Thompson and Draymond Green didn’t contribute to that record at all. You have to be a child bro, this is a ridiculous argument."
"The difference between these teams is that the suns are way better. Middleton is booker lite, and Holiday is basically draymond green without the passing"
I agree but there will always be an arbitrary line between a natural shooting motion and an attempt to initiate contact. Draymond Green was framed. He lost his shot when he stopped kicking nuts. That wasn't a coincidence. Natural shooting motion.
I've always wondered how many guys with the talent of like a Draymond Green are just toiling away on bad teams.
"Portland.  The Blazers have been rumored to want Draymond Green.  Ben Simmons is a bigger, more athletic version of Draymond Green but with less confidence in his shooting.  Another is Minnesota. KAT needs defensive help at the front."
"Draymond Green was already good, just didn’t get his starter minutes till that series. Jermaine O’Neal was so good for us until he got taken out by Big Baby Glen.  We should have won the series if not for tik tacky fouls. But either way, we weren’t gonna win the whole thing with Mark Jackson."
"having Booker, Ja, and fucking Draymond Green on a tier above Tatum and Zion is laughable at best, and basing your rankings off of *social media followings* of all things shows a ridiculous lack of concern for the actual basketball being played on the basketball court (i.e. the only thing that actually fucking matters here)"
Maybe a bit controversial but Gobert or Draymond Green
Draymond Green and Brandon Bass
- Draymond Green
How is Draymond Green not on this list?  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
People never give the ‘14 Warriors enough credit for taking a healthy Clippers team to 7 games with a 35-year old Jermaine O’Neal and a yet-to-be-good Draymond Green starting at center for the entire series.
1. Patrick Beverley  2. Draymond green  3. Matt Barnes   4. Cp3  5. Russell Westbrook  6. James harden  7. Kevin Durant   8. Paul George   9. Boban   10. Ben simmons
"Top 5 is a bit of a stretch unless he becomes a great shooter which current evidence hasn't shown. I think top 10 though is possible, he could become something like a rich man's version of Draymond Green."
yeah that's not draymond green lmao
Draymond green kicks nuts kevin huerter tries to snap ankles
"just one draymond green away, just like all the portland teams through the years."
Maybe if we trade our unproven rising stars Tatum and Brown for star forward Draymond green we have a chance🤣
fwiw Draymond Green was saying the same thing about Booker a year ago. Things can change drastically for a franchise with the right GM and coach.
"The bucks should trap cp3 and booker early and hard in the pick and roll, make them give up the ball. Make it tough for cp3, a shorter pg, to make the perfect read with brook and jrues long arms. Make it booker turn into a passer. Make ayton be the decision maker, see if he is able to make reads like draymond green. On top of that, the bucks need to figure out what the rotation is with helping the roll man and getting back on the shooters. Too often the bucks looked lost and didn't know where to go if they werent in drop coverage. I think thats easier said then done, but the bucks need to mix up the coverages and be uber aggressive so the sun's guards dont get comfortable.   On offense, I would love to have seen giannis as aggressive as he was in the last minute against ayton. Get him into early foul trouble, even if it stalls the offense, just keeping feeding him."
Amateur hour at the Draymond Green Imitator’s Club.
"The warriors fucking suck and are going no where in the rest of you life time, Steph is supposedto be one of the best Pg's of all time yet loses a finals mvp to Iguodala, Klay talking about how if he were there, that the playoffs would be different, sure they would you fucking role player, Klay is no more valuable than Danny Green, literally the same role, and then there is Draymond, thinks he is the best defensiveplayer in the league, man is a big Pat Bev, with worse offense... There, that should do the trick"
I liked Draymond Green look like Donkey from Shrek
I suppose 3x All Star and former DPOY Draymond Green was also a bench bum? And surely former 6MOY and FMVP Andre Iguodala wasnt known for using his body to hide reach-in fouls
Draymond Green played a few snaps at WR/TE in a Michigan State spring scrimmage back in the day. He looked so goofy out there
The Draymond Green method
Draymond Green with that DPOY performance
"&gt;you’re gonna regret it after his 4th foul in 3 min  Just FYI, Bazemore averaged 2.4 fouls in 19.9 minutes last year.  And is at 2.1 in 21 minutes for his career.  Those are a little high, but not at all exceptionally so -- just about the same rate as Draymond Green."
"Dude, it is *terrifying* how bad they look with him on the bench.  Team USA leans on Dray on defense even more than it leans on KD on offense.  ""Green subs out, Bam is coming in,"" has to be terrifying for a USA fan to hear  They have to figure out something to do about that, or else Draymond is gonna have to play 40 minutes every night"
"Haha I love when commentators say stuff like that ""the job goes unnoticed but Draymond Green has been big"" This thread has been talking about Draymond the entire game."
Draymond green is cloaking up the team’s offense. He’s basically a Ben Simmons who refuse to take any shots and it makes the team’s defense easier. Is defense is useless against other bigs. This guy shouldn’t even been on the team at all.
I admit to be a full Draymond Green hater. But his defense and smart ball movement and clutch rebounding felt like a 15 point swing there. Very impressed. Doing all the little things that were badly beeded
Where would this team be without Draymond Green
Nice drive by Draymond Green.
"When you have teams like the Lakers and Clippers going all in, year after year to contend, that's a good sign.  As opposed to the Warriors, who prefer to look forward with a bunch of teenagers when they have Steph Curry and Draymond Green on the roster"
Russell Westbrook TS: 50%   Draymond Green TS: 53%
"We're arguing in circles here. Draymond green is also a liability on offence, he just had the luxury of playing with the two of greatest shooters of all time.   So him being a liability on offense has never been a problem until recently with Klay being out.    Suffice to say that Simmons is only 25 year old DPOY candidate, who can also play make and handle the ball. And Hes not in his prime yet.   If you don't see why a more athletic version of draymond green is getting paid 30m a year, I don't know what else to tell you, we can agree to disagree here."
"Fourth option on offense sure, but the thing is batum is like a draymond green. He’s a total glue guy. Plays big switchable defense and gets your assists and rebounds"
"Appreciate you owning up to it but I think randle is also not a great comparison given randle isnt some 4th to 5th option and can play in the half court. On a championship team, randle is probably a 3rd option at best. Simmons is a draymond green with athleticism"
You're a warriors fan... You LITERALLY have the prime example of why Simmons is worth a max despite his offensive skillset with draymond green.
"Draymond green, Gobert being two recent examples of players being primarily paid big money for their defensive impact, while putting up mediocre offensive numbers."
"Simmons is an elite ""role"" player. Aka Draymond Green 2.0   that is worth one all star in an exchange OR picks.   NOT both   The Brogdon and one pick for Simmons was the most fair offer I've seen"
They should probably trade Draymond Green for Tristan Thompson too.
If lebron James couldn't get Drummond to play better who is going to do it? Chris Paul. Someone's gotta be in his ear telling him not to fuck up Draymond Green style.
"The Warriors again don't make the postseason next season. Curry has another superstar season, but it isn't enough to carry an overweight Warriors team. Declining Draymond Green, 2 career altering injuries Klay Thompson, and their low quality bench are the primary reasons why."
"2012 had Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, Thomas Satoransky, Will Barton and Kyle O'Quinn."
Definitely not going to trade away their youth (Draymond Green) for a 36 year old Lowry.
"Jimmy Butler, Mike Conley, Draymond Green even more, Kemba Walker, Russell Westbrook"
Crazy how fans always blame LBJ for Draymond getting suspended… He stepped over him… Ok… Does that give Draymond the right to swing at his nuts? Green got a T during the game and was above the limit… That’s why he was suspended for a game…

We also have no idea if lamelo looks like lamelo playing in an offense where Draymond Green is the primary distributor.
"Luka ""Draymond 'Triple Single' Green"" Doncic so far."
Draymond Green shooting 100%
"Here'e the list of players who made 22.5-27.5 million this year (25 million give or take 10%)  Al Horford 27 million  Jaylen Brown 26.7 million  Draymond Green 24 million  Nikola Vucecic 24 million  Buddy Hield 22.7 million  Well, he ain't the worst among them if he was paid 25 mill"
I really don’t think that siakam is a better fit than wiggins with draymond green being there.
"I'm not even gonna pretend to know how the Warriors cap works, Somehow they have 3 Max players and Draymond Green.   I think the numbers are close, they might have to give up some filler."
Hey it's not a Draymond Green game without at least one (maybe 3) passes that are so bad you question reality.
"Charles Barkley - Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green and Klay ""Triple Zero"" Thompson."
"I think CJ also finished 4 years. Same for Larry Nance, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green - those that I can remember.   Cam Johnson took it one step further, going for Masters degree."
"You wanna stop commenting and deleting them with your passive aggressive insults?  I'll respond to them even though your comments are gone nonetheless.  --Get off your high horse loser. Nobody thinks of you any better than they normally would have because you were ""explaining historical context.""   Which you weren't.   Take your complex elsewhere.  We are talking about Draymond fucking Green being called a donkey, and I simy brought up that throughout the entire history of mankind, labeling people you don't like as animals has been widespread, REGARDLESS of race. It's just an insult. Stop trying to act like your sticking up for the cause or some *disingenuous* bullshit. Normal people see what you're doing, and it's obnoxious.  Save it for when someone is actually being racist my guy.--"
Like Draymond Green saying he had the most trouble guarding Taj Gibson
Chris Paul 6'  Allen Iverson 6'  Klay Thompson 6'6  Kawhi Leonard 6'7  Draymond Green 6'6
"PG - Chris Paul  (6'0"")  SG - Steph Curry (6'3"")  SF - Dwyane Wade  (6'4"")  PF - Lebron James (6'8"")  C - Draymond Green (6'6"")  Average height is 6'4"". They'd need some size off the bench but I think these guys would all play well off each other."
"By context I'm assuming you mean that the person is Draymond Green, and he's black. But other than that there is nothing in this scenario that points to his race whatsoever. It isn't an anti black thing, it's just a talking down to someone thing."
He was supposedly the Draymond Green of his era   An exceptional defender and a big man who could pass well   He was a big factor in a his team getting better during his rookie year so he won MVP
Draymond Green confirmed best 3-Point shooter in the US of A
"Was thinking the same to be honest, start with Draymond and Bam and gain more inside presence. You lose some spacing, but tbh if you start with something like Lillard, Booker, KD, Green, Adebayo you have three great shooters on the floor. at the same time dray gives a lot of energy from the bench which is also important."
"Just play the starters plus khris Middleton and draymond green, Lavine. Tatum is being absolute trash"
Draymond green probably
RAPTOR can suck it. There’s zero chance that top 3 defender last year Draymond Green is a worse defender than Bazemore or Oubre lol come on now
"First off, you're forgetting the whole context of why people even wanted to trade Embiid. His health track record. Which even now, is still shaky.  Michael Jordan/Ron Harper is a strawman. The better analogy: would you rather trade Klay Thompson or Draymond Green?  One season ago, would have been blasphemy to trade Klay over Dray. An ACL and a Achilles injury later. Things have completely changed...  Health is a big factor when considering trades."
Didn't they give Draymond Green a spot on the team even though he fucking sucks right now?
"&gt;  a complete project on the offensive side.  That's the point of drafting young guys with high potential  This isn't about drafting a win now come in and go player. Most lottery picks don't come in and become instant offensive players. It's literally like 2-3 players every year that have that kind of impact.   There have been lots of high drafted players that didn't show amazing offence in college and turned out to be very good offensive players in the NBA.   I honestly see nothing wrong with waiting a few years to develop this guy. It depends on what your opinion is about the team. IF you think this team just need to plug in some new players and it'll be a playoff team, then you probably want a ready for NBA player drafted. I believe we need a complete rebuild and im fine with waiting and developing players.   Being decent in college doesn't mean you're going to be good in the NBA. Your critics of Scottie Barnes is valid but you also can't just assume Suggs is a surefire bonafide star and point to his college production when this isn't a metric of whether someone will be good or not.   I don't really care who we got between the two, they both have the potential to be really good. If Scottie Barnes turns into Ben Simmons or Draymond Green like the guy below says, then that's honestly amazing. Im not going to sit here and pretend like Ben Simmons a perennial all star, all defense player is some sort of let down. A 3 DPOY of the year and one of the reasons a historic GSW Team (before KD) hummed is some sort of let down.   I would love it if Scottie Barnes turns into those guys."
I'd like to keep Siakam as a Raptors fan.  He was the 3rd best player on a title team and scored the title winning shot on Draymond Green.
"State of this place, downvoted for saying the facts. Barnes is quite literally best case a Ben Simmons/Draymond Green type player. He is a dogshit offensive player who can pass."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"Well there are two train if thoughts. First is that simply Siakam is a way better player than Wiggins and especially useful in non Steph minutes where Wiggins couldn't generate offense. The other side is Siakam isn't a great shooter and with Draymond, that's a big issue. Also Wiggins used to guard best opposition player for us, especially the wings and point guards.  Siakam doesn't have the foot speed to guard quicker player ( though he is a beast when defending 3's and 4's). With klay also coming back from the injuries, we would need to get a Danny green kind of player to hit 3's and defend the 2's and 1's. I just think we already have Wiseman and obviously it's not like we aren't ever making trade, especially after Steph and Klay are gone so it's time to make a championship play"
"yes, but they're generally 6'5""-6'9"", while centers are like 7'.  so green is more suited to gaurding centers than mitchell is yo gaurding 3s.  also, if draymond is playing center, gsw is probably going small, so the other team is probably going small as well."
For a Warriors fan whose been watching Draymond Green for years it shouldn't be that hard for you to figure out.   No one's saying he has to be a fulltime point guard we still got VanVleet and and Lowry might be resigning. The point is to have multiple versatile players who can do a bit of everything.
"He's the best dfensive player in his class and dpoy. Lol. if draymond can guard centers, why can't he guard 3s? Ya'll talk about these small ball era everyday, but when you see 3 guards ya'll go crazy eventho the Sixers start 3 guards this season every game (Seth-Ben-Green) and were first seed."
"Not sure many people have Jimmy Butler alongside Lillard and Embiid right now.  Curry + Durant on the same level as 1A, but I really can't find any names in 1A who would move down to 1B.  Kyrie should probably be at least 3A, instead of 3B.  What the fuck is this business with Zion Williamson. Lower than Draymond Green? Khris Middleton? I get he didn't play many games but jeez."
"I think it's a matter of ""absolute best-case scenario"" evaluation. In that evaluation, Scottie is the second-coming of Draymond Green (and hell, maybe he even learns to shoot!). That's an easy HoF player and defensive anchor small-ball center with high-playmaking upside.   The Raptors have a nice system in place and if anyone can get Barnes to reach his fullest potential, it's that system coached by Nurse surrounded by shooters.  I think Suggs has a better chance at being a multi-time all-star, while maybe Barnes has a better chance of superstardom?"
"I am hoping for him to become our Draymond Green, just less mouthy and balls punchy."
"He’s a younger Draymond Green. He can facilitate like a Point Forward, he can slash, plays great defense, and has great IQ. He’s just limited offensively because he cant shoot well. The Raptors development team will help him greatly, but Jalen Suggs was a better fit for the Raptors"
The Draymond Green
Actually the Warriors draft board just has one name on it “Draymond Green.”  The team was very happy Draymond didn’t forget about them with being at the Olympics otherwise we would have drafted another all time bust like Wiseman
If his comp is draymond green then he doesn't have to be the ball handler. Green still gets 7 apg without handling the ball. A 6'9 pg is very rare and i doubt scottie has that kind of ball handling ability at the nba level to do that.
"Draymond Green, league sources tell IndyStarSports , is trying to get the Pacers to part with Duarte. Offering Moody + other assets. They're not budging right now. Duarte was the pick they wanted, too, apparently. Top of their board"
Draymond Green time traveller confirmed
That's what happens when you have draymond green and Steve kerr in your organization
"Simmons is an interesting player, as is offensively he's damn near unplayable if a team doesn't have spacing, given his lack of offensive threat beyond 3 feet.  He reminds me of a Draymond green with marginally worse defense and marginally better offense as it stands. Trading him at a rate higher than that assumes he will fix his game - something so far that we've seen no empirical evidence of.  Depending on the team's needs, OG may be the most you could offer. But in that case both teams would be better staying pat."
"That was more in part due to Curry having the best regular season of all time along with an insanely good and deep bench than Draymond being the third piece. He was good that year, yes, but comparing curry klay and dray on paper with other big 3s such as Jordan pippen and rodman is a joke. Duo makes more sense using curry and klay. They are both generational talents draymond green is not"
"I’m not sure I agree. Russ never gets guarded without the ball, and he’s prone to hanging around near half court. AD is a worse career 3 point shooter than Draymond Green. LeBron is hit and miss.   I mean, if you’re playing this team in the playoffs what kinda defence are you going to play? You are going to have 3 or 4 guys with a foot in the paint and make AD and Russ make 3s. People are talking about drive and kick. Who is closing out hard to AD, Russ or LeBron?   This seems like a desperation talent play. A 2K trade with no regard to fit. All 3 of these guys need spacing and driving lanes to be effective. These guys are going to be running into brick walls and bricking 3s all season."
"No, as a warriors' fan, they made the right moves tonight.  Kuminga and Moody was beyond a best case scenario.  I posted this in the warriors sub during the draft, but my big board prior to this draft was:  1) Cunningham  2) Green  3) Mobley  4) Suggs  5) Kuminga  6) Barnes  7) Giddey  8) Moody  You can't do better than getting two of the top eight players that I had at picks #7 and #14.    Do I think the warriors can win a title next year?  No, I don't, unless something completely unforeseen happens at the start of free agency.  What these two picks allow is for the warriors to move on from Kent Bazemore and from Mychal Mulder as regular rotation players.    Right now, you can divide the roster into the ""present"" and the ""future"".  That's part of the dual thread-the-needle team-building strategy they're employing.  The present is:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney  The future is:  Mannion, Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman  In the second half of last year, Poole took the jump, and he figures to slide in as the warriors sixth man this year, he's both the future AND very much going to help in the present.  Mannion is playing well in the Olympics, hoping for more development from him.  Wiseman should be a lot better in year two.    Now, besides these two parts of the roster, they have the ""rest"", which right now consists of:   JTA, Damion Lee, Eric Paschall  Paschall can be cut if need be, they'd have to swallow some money, but it's doable.  Ditto Damian Lee.  JTA is the only guy on this tier with significant financial guarantees, and also the best player.    What this means is the warriors have easy room to add at least two free agents next week, three if they can keep Nico Mannion on a two-way deal next season.  The draft is about your future, free agency is about addressing the roster holes you have in the present.    The dubs should go into free agency and see what they can get.  As time goes on, hopefully more and more of the future starts to contribute to the present.    The easiest way for an aging core to get back to title contention quickly is not to trade young players for a star, the easiest path back to the top is to do what the Spurs did: draft another star.  The cost controlled rookie scale contract, as opposed to the big money you'd have to pay an additional star, allow you to fill out your bench with depth.    The warriors won't be title contenders next year, but I think they'll make the moves in free agency to qualify for the playoffs as a top six seed in the west next year (and avoid the play-in tourney).  They can then build on that to take the next step to the top of the mountain again.    If there was a magic bullet trade that would make them title contenders now, they would have made that trade already.  That they haven't indicates there isn't such a trade to be had.  If no such trade exists, the best alternative is to accumulate assets for the point when a such trade does become available.    Kuminga and Moody are excellent assets for that trade, especially since to make such a big time trade will definitely require parting with Wiggins for salary matching reasons.  It would be awful nice to have players ready to step in if and when Wiggins gets dealt, wouldn't it?"
Found Draymond Green  burner account
"Gray is a unique player. He looks a little overweight but it tricks the guy he’s guarding because Gray has really quick feet. He’s a great one on one defender, and he can guard every position 1-5. Though in the League it’s probably more 1-4.   He’s got really quick hands for steals. He has a nice handle and passing ability, he spent a decent amount of time running our offense. He’s excellent in transition.   A lot of people will do Draymond Green comps but he’s really a poor man’s Zion Williamson (obviously nowhere near as good, but in terms of play style). I like Gray a lot and I think he sticks in the league. He does a lot of little things well that lead to winning basketball (which is something I used to say about Terance Mann)."
That makes about 43 out of the 59 players selected that got compared to Draymond green.
Any prospect that can guard 1-4 but isn’t an amazing shooter:   Player comp: Draymond Green   Every time.
"It's like being able to draft a more explosive, worse shooting Chris Paul and taking Draymond Green."
"You should never make super high picks based on how your rotation will look next season.  Hes very unlikely to start in year one anyway.  I was a Suggs guy, but you cant deny the talent Barnes has.  Id take Shawn Marion or Draymond Green over Jrue Holliday. I trust our management.  This might be a home run."
AD is a worse career 3 point shooter than Draymond Green. Even on long 2's he's bad. 33% the last 5 seasons outside 16 feet.  Definitely not a bucket outside 16 feet.
Gregg popovich best bet to win gold this year is  Pg jrue holiday or dame  Sg khris Middleton Sf jayson tatum  Pf draymond green or Keldon Johnson  C bambam or javele McGee
"Not uncommon to draft a decent role player or even an all-star at late 1st to early 2nd round (Jimmy Butler 30th, Draymond Green 35th, Joe Harris 33rd, Malcolm Brogdon 36th, Pascal Siakam 27th ...) Chances are really bad by late 2nd round"
"David Thorpe had some high praise for Barnes on [Chad Ford's podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/mock-draft-wars-2/id1503591370?i=1000530149983) a couple days ago where he has him #2 on his big board behind only Mobley. Starts at 18:21. Ends 27:41.  Some highlights:  - Excellent locker room presence - Can guard all 5 spots - Super high floor  - Comparisons to Pippen and Draymond Green - Projected first team All NBA player   - ""Most Giannas like player in this draft"" - ""Scottie is going to be a better player than Draymond, without question. And I think a very similar impact defensively. Which means Defensive Player of the Year."""
I'm assuming Kuminga is going to Draymond Green assistant on defense

Yes Scottie Barnes = Draymond Green   /s
GIVE ME 19 YEAR OLD DRAYMOND GREEN
And why would the warriors want another draymond green?
I had a dude trade me Dame for Jimmy Butler a couple years back cause he was a Bulls fan.    He also traded me Derozan for Khris Middleton.    This was back in the 2016 season so both of those were super lopsided.  I also tried to trade D. Green (Danny) for McCollum hoping that he would think is was Draymond Green but he didn’t fall for it.  I was a menace that season and ended up winning
AD is a worse career 3 point shooter than Draymond Green.
"They should have known it would be difficult post-Durant &amp; after their core got paid. The Warriors' payroll and veterans make it really difficult to re-build on the fly.  The Warriors' payroll is LOCKED UP for the next few years and they're committed to almost $140 million for just to 4 players  *Players* | 2021-22 | 2022-23 :-- | --: | --: Stephen Curry | 45.8 | — Klay Thompson | 37.9 | 40.6 Andrew Wiggins | 31.6 | 33.6 Draymond Green | 24.0 | 25.8  If Curry leaves next FA, the Warriors have *no* chance at contention without a rebuild."
&gt; and the sixers get their new sharp shooting donkey.  The Sixers get Draymond Green??!
To give up that much for a player you'd rather have Draymond Green take the shot over....
Think a better passing Draymond Green but not as good inside defensively.  His ideal fit would be the Warriors actually - with Draymond as the small ball center.
"Even though I hate green his IQ is on another level. You cant compare them. Simmons is a great defender. Draymond elevates the whole team defensivly and at least he aint afraid to shot or is a liability at some point like simmons. Green knows what he can do, simmons probably still thinks he is like lebron."
They also have Draymond Green. You can't have two non shooters (especially one as bad as Simmons) in any offence even if it has Curry and Klay
"He’s usually used as a point guard in transition, where he runs down the court and finishes or creates for teammates. You’d want him to be used as a hyper-athletic point guard in the half court, like a Fox, Westbrook, or Wall, but he hates taking shots so he can’t really create much. Therefore he’s like a Ricky Rubio with the ball, and a normal dunking big man without the ball. On defense he’s most similar to peak Kawhi Leonard, a guy who shuts down ball handlers from 1-4 but doesn’t provide quite enough strength or rim protection to be a 5 like Draymond Green."
We just going to assume he learns to shoot?  That didn't go so well for Ben Simmons.  Because if he doesn't learn to shoot...  Let's say he actually *is* literally the next Draymond Green.  He still won't be the best player out of this draft.  Because Draymond wasn't even really close - Anthony Davis and Lillard for sure above him.  Beal and Middleton arguably.  And this draft is pretty well stacked at the top.  Now let's say he is more of a poor man's Draymond... I mean he could *easily* end up a decent player but be wildly overdrafted at 5 or 6.
"Power Forward, a role like Lamar Odom or Draymond Green."
Draymond Green
"Don't think he will be the best player to come out of this draft, but if he becomes like a Draymond Green/Ben Simmons type player he will still be very very good."

A little biased but the Denver Nuggets putting him in a draymond Green role with Jamal and Jokic would make the Nuggets serious title contenders instead of just a pretty good team and I think we have the assets to get it done
"Jesus Christ.  Klay thompson and Draymond green would be the 2nd and 3rd best players on our team, even when you account for dwight. Iggy would be 5th. The warriors cast is *far* better then ours. I’m not entertaining this argument anymore when you just won’t admit when you’re wrong"
"I’ve been hearing it as a consensus for the past while. Why would you take a traditional Center early on? Look at the recent FMVP’s, as well as just the biggest game changers.   Sure a Draymond Green type player is perfect at the Center position, but those players usually come into the draft as a forward with “small ball five potential” meaning they’re not really bigs. There’s guys like Embiid and Jokic who impact the game immensely, but guys with projections like that also tend to fail a lot more than guards/ wings."
"You're such a huge LeBron hater it's actually painful to keep on reading your replies.  If anything, the Cavs overwhelmed. Stop trying to twist the narrative. We all saw it. The 2015 Cavs were completely undermanned, the 2016 Warriors lost Bogut who was averaging 10 minutes a game and also lost Green to a fully deserved suspension. It's just like fouling out. It's his own fault. Nothing unfortunate or lucky about it. He did his classic Draymond shit and got suspended as the rules state he should.  LeBron did the correct thing voting for the cap spike. He was representing the players and did what was best for them as a whole.  Even if you want to attribute the cap spike to him completely, this still has nothing to do with his actual basketball performance.  I won't reply to you anymore. You're simply not worth my time. LeBron's the GOAT and 2016 is his crowning achievement."
actually it does make sense.  draymond green was arguably the 2nd best player on the warriors last season and is literally the 4th option on the team at any given time.  it’s clear you don’t understand the terminology at all.
Draymond Green 2.0
"&gt; And its not just 1 series. He also averaged 11 ppg in the 2nd round of 2019 vs the Raptors.  Why is scoring used so much to define Ben Simmons? Draymond Green averaged 10.8 ppg for the entire playoffs in 2018 when the Warriors won the title, no one acts like he was a chump (and if you don't want to count that year for KD reasons - Draymond's *career* playoff scoring average is 12.5 and he averaged 13.7 in the playoffs for their 2015 title run). They're not the same player, of course, but they do share the fact that neither of them is on the court to score, so it's kinda crazy for it to be the number one thing talked about for either of them."
Kd already has said it had an impact in interviews before   https://www.google.com/amp/s/bluemanhoop.com/2020/02/09/kevin-durant-speaks-time-warriors-beef-draymond-green/amp/  Hate him or like him kd usually is pretty honest in interviews
barnes couldn’t shoot a ball and draymond green couldn’t stop kicking them. but let’s just blame the refs lmao
"getting a 4 peat is ridiculous. You are assuming that Westbrook and Lebron could coexist. IIRC KD's issue on the Thunders was that they would play throught Westbrook more than him. Also the Draymond Green and LBJ fit would be interesting. I think they would still win the 2, but with Klay hurt, and no depth, would make Raptors an even match."
"Draymond &gt; Klay  Klay is perhaps the best catch and shoot offensive player ever, and his defense is wonderful. He's like the HOF version of Danny Green, but still being a great 3&amp;D guy isn't being the unique talent of Draymond. Dray is the most versatile defender in a generation AND an offensive mastermind without being a shooter. No one else in league history was really like that."
"Before we start just naming players, let’s think about what kind of skillset we’re looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won’t really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn’t expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I’d be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn’t need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don’t think he’s the WORST player (he’s very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I’m hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he’s obviously young and still developing, so we don’t know what he’ll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6’5”, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous “Big Body.”   P.S. Another interesting question is who’s the BEST player who WOULDN’T succeed on a team of clones of himself. I’d be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it’s hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn’t still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
Prime Blake Griffin &gt; prime Draymond green
This alone made me a fan of draymond green lol.
OG is also a more efficient scorer than Draymond Green. Does that mean you would take OG over Draymond?
"Yeah he’s a perfect example. Gilber Arenas, Kevin Durant, Kobe, and Draymond Green are my favorite people to listen to talk about basketball- but Arenas especially. I love this clip of Arenas talking about what makes Kobe so special: https://youtu.be/1bu7u6-2zlM. We’re so fortunate he has a podcast, he drops gems on the regular and his insight is top tier."
I mean nearly made the playoffs with draymond green and Andrew Wiggins. Give him the 2020 Hawks roster and I’m sure he does worse than he did with the warriors this year.     I don’t think there’s as many guys as you think who can take a shit team to the playoffs
Everyone hates Draymond Green
"Bruh, second option means second option (on offence). Offence doesn’t just mean scoring, draymond green was arguably their second option for creating offence.  I agree some people view it as second scorer but I don’t think it’s as ubiquitous as you put it"
"I disagree that he needs to be “second options”’as you describe it. Draymond green is definitely not a second option but effectively functioned as the pre Durand warriors second “creator” helping to unlock their offence. klay was their second best scorer of course, but draymond was the second option for creating offence as a passer, transition, hit a head passes, short roll etc.   I think he could help unlock KP as a the mavs “second scorer” but functioning as the creator for KP as a combined second option to Luka.  Simmons + KP = second option while neither by themselves can be.  As for a nuggets, I like the fit you describe if you remove Aaron Gordon."
Not even a little! They need a 2nd go to scorer that can create for himself and others they need what they thought KP would be a 2nd option even if Ben was willing to take jumpers he’s still not good enough scoring wise to be the 2nd option in Dallas.  A team that I think should trade for Ben is the Nuggets he’d be their draymond green next to Jamal and Jokic that would be a VERY good trip that pushes the Nuggets to a finals favorite
We also hate Draymond Green
Its deadset stupid to trade your franchise player for someone's number 2 guy to begin with. And he is barely the number 2 guy as nearly every player on the field is prioritized on offense over him.  Simmons is better overall than fox to who? You maybe not to the kings. Not to even mention that fox contract is way better. Simmons is draymond green. If you dont have stars there is no point having dryamond green.   Simmons is a great defender and playmaker. In the plays offs you play 4v5 on offense and if not for Embiid individual excellence simmons would be getting roasted even more.   Now just to prove how stupid you are the only trade rumours going around right now is a 3 way trade with portland. Fox isnt even mentioned its Halliburton and picks. And kings arnt even sure they want to do that.   Get your moronic takes off the internet you know absolutely nothing.
He’s already 28. He can provide all the intangibles that green offers but I’m not sure he will ever reach green’s level of impact. Draymond is one the best defenders of our generation
"Oh I don’t think he will be Draymond at all I agree it’s a lazy comparison, but there’s a spectrum with Draymond on one end and Giannis at the other that I think Barnes falls somewhere on. Closer to Green it’s more about defense playmaking and incredible basketball IQ. Towards Giannis it’s more physical domination and scoring upside. (Talking purely upside here of course)  I will disagree on Kawhi though, he clearly showed way more polish imo when you look at Kawhi in college and in workout videos he has a great handle, textbook shooting form, stiffness and awkwardness for sure but not the baby horse learning to walk level bloopers you occasionally see from Barnes. the other FSU guy, Patrick Williams, is a bit more reminiscent of Kawhi to me."
Is the perimeter defense that much of a difference if you replace draymond with Simmons tho. It’s not like Simmons made these differential possessions on the perimeter against trae young and the hawks. Danny green was the difference maker of that series once he went down was the start of the hawks resurgence
Draymond Green was never even the third best player on the warriors dynasty. Igoudala finals MVP on thier first championship. Then KD got there. Draymond overrated AF.
Draymond “AAAAAND 1” Green
"Ben Simmons &gt; Draymond Green.  Better to equal at everything besides shooting, and Draymond is so bad at both shooting and scoring that it doesn't actually matter.a"
"&gt;“Darius Garland actually,” [Draymond] Green said on “Warriors Roundtable” on 95.7 The Game when asked about the toughest players to guard. “And I know that’s probably an unpopular opinion. That kid is so fast, so herky-jerky and he can shoot the ball. When he really figures out how good he truly is.  &gt;“I hate getting switched onto him. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.”"
I think having a Marcus Smart (or a Draymond Green) in your ear helps a lot to put more effort on D.   Horford will also help to teach the non-guards something about it. C's should be good on D this year.
The thing is Rodman was a defensive specialist before the Bulls who’s superstar talent was rebounding the basketball. Now I don’t currently have advanced stats of how his opponents truly faired against him vs the league in front of me now.  The issue with Rodman’s offense tool kit is that he was relegated to tip-ins. Seeing that his skill set was all due to coaching after being drafted you could see him becoming a Draymond Green type player on a championship team.  However his career was predicated on him being a starter/6th man on a championship team. Similar to how Green might become a HOFer solely based on being on a championship team
"Not sure I think this dude can be a real superstar, but Juan Toscano Anderson gives me Draymond Green vibes"
"They have the exact same physical profile. 6’8”, 7’4 wingspan, 40 inch vert. Pippen is a hof player but it’s not like he’s better than any of the top 5 players in today’s game. Scottie B probably lands somewhere between Draymond Green and Giannis. Scottie Pippen is somewhere in between that."
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
Or Draymond “triple single” Green
How would Rodman's game translate today? He would still be a fucking animal right? Like maybe a Draymond Green or better?
"&gt;Curry, who literally transforms a team of bums into 40% 3PT shooters because of his gravity.  You might should double-check that claim.  Curry has played with, last time I counted, 16 different Warrior teammates who shot over 40% from the arc while playing **for other teams.**  That does not include Klay Thompson or Draymond Green, obviously, as they are Warrior lifers to date.  It also doesn't count Andre Iguodala who has not shot 40% yet, and whose best shooting season by a mile was with Philadelphia.  So who, exactly, are these ""bums"" you are referring to?"
"Starters can absolutely be role players. Team success has nothing to do with whether or not someone is a role player either. Role player isn't really a pejorative, just means a guy is keyholed into a specific role, focusing on one or two things, rather than being an all around star. Some of the better players in the last few decades have been role players - Dennis Rodman and Draymond Green spring to mind. Brook is essentially a 3&amp;D big now - doesn't really rebound well, not a good passer, doesn't really create his own shot. He's there to be out of the way of Giannis, knock down shots when his man leaves him to double, and play strong help D at the rim."
"Ben Wallace, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert are all defence first players who were all stars with similar stats off the top of my head, not saying Simmons deserved his spot this year (Trae probably should’ve got in) but there’s definitely players who get into the all star game based off their defensive play  EDIT: Looking back on stats, Luol Deng did average 19 his second all star year though so maybe not the best example for my argument compared to the others"
He could have grabbed artest or the fan and defused the situation  All those short skinny white boys are no match even 4 against 1 vs NBA players come on man   Rush to help his teammate get away from the fans sure.   But let’s stop pretending Artest was in any real danger if anything the fans were at risk as one wrong punch from a guy who is 6’9-7 and 200-275 lbs would be game over   Other Pacers and Pistons players and coaches were trying to defuse the situation and stop the fighting   Artest oneal SJax and I believe one other guy maybe Tinsley I forget did not stop fighting until they left into the tunnel   If a fan threw a beer can at Artest or glass bottle sure I can see beating the living fuck out of them Bc he could be in danger of losing his vision or getting seriously injured   But even if shaq stood in front of Artest and threw a cup of beer at his face notning will happen   Disrespected and insulted by a single fan sure   But not enough to climb into the stands and start punching random people   Never has it happened in sports history in any sport and people are in here saying the penalty is harsh?  Draymond Green on the best team in NBA history got suspended during a the NBA finals for a nut tap on LeBron who was walking over top of him   What punishment did you expect the nba to hand out to players who attacked multiple fans Bc one unruly fan threw a beer.
prime draymond green is a dpoy and you say he sucks balls? the math ain’t mathing.
"MVP: Curry  I can't see the Mavs having a top 3 seed this season unfortunately. I think Warriors have a good shot at it with Murray/Kawhi expected to miss a significant amount of time. Lakers may take a bit to gel and Lebron should be on full coast imo. We say how brilliant Curry was at the end of last season and he could get it this season. Embiid, Giannis, and Brooklyn are the biggest competitors imo. Luka, Jokic, and Trae have an outside shot.  DPOY: Anthony Davis  I'm not the biggest fan of AD, but his defense in 2020 was amazing. Draymond talked about one guy whose never out of shape that was - and we all think it was Davis. He's one of the most switchable players in the league. And a clear top 5 defender.He had an off year last year that i think will help build a narrative for voters. Draymond is polarizing, Gobert won too much, and Simmons is the go-to hate guy for the media. As much as i believe Dray may deserve it, this award is going to come down to AD vs. Giannis.  6MOY: Derrick Rose  Thibs trusts his guy. D Rose is gonna have his role in the offense, and I dont see Kemba being a huge threat to his minutes. Rose is going to keep his 25 minutes, and he's trusted with the ball in his hands. I dont think Clarkson will have the same season as last as his efficiency started to return to the old clarkson at the end. People aren't huge on impact guys like Ingles for 6MOY so I think Rose will take it.   ROY: Jalen Green  He's going to score more than any other rookie, and from everything we have seen, Green already has a level of efficiency to his game. I think Cade is less of a go get his and neither guy will be on a good team. Green's stats are going to jump out a bit more imo. Playing next to Hayes, Cade won't have a high enough assist total to make up for it.   MIP: Rui Hachimura  You never really know who is going to win MIP before the season. MPJ already had great counting stats and most of the improvement he needs to make is outside the stat sheet (defense, shot selection, smarter basketball). Hachimura will have much more of a scoring role without Westbrook there, and he showed some insane potential in the olympics. His outside shot is developing well, and I see a breakout year for him.  COTY: Erik Spoelstra  Exec: Bulls"
How crazy would it be to say he can become a Scottie Pippen type of player more than a Draymond Green type of player?
Every NBA team would’ve chosen Klay before Draymond. That’s a fact. Green (like Rodman before him) is a GREAT role player on a championship caliber team.
lmao cause you know im right. draymond green had to bail curry out in game 7 and curry missed the three. dude got locked down by love lmfao. theres a reason why curry will never win a fmvp
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
"&gt;Also I love how the first video you linked shows a dribble hand-off leading to a wide open layup  There's no such sequence in that first clip, so maybe be less of an idiot, and watch more carefully.  Harper does beat Olajuwon off the dribble, following a switched pick.  Olajuwon makes an aggressive reach on the dribble -- which would likely be a foul call today -- but Harper is able to maintain possession and also beat the recovering Kenny Smith for the layup.  &gt;leads to a wide open shot like you almost never see in today’s game  Wow, this is so frighteningly stupid that I'm worried about you.  There are wide-open shots constantly in today's NBA.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=6%2B%20Feet%20-%20Wide%20Open  Hell, fully 13% of Stephen Curry's attempts last year were wide open!  The last time Thompson played, 16% of his attempts were wide open.  Teams basically refused to guard Draymond Green that season, leaving him wide-open 41% of the time.  You haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about, and you desperately need to discontinue blathering out of your asshole here."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"You know that colluding story was fake right?  Draymond Green wasn’t the player he is today back then. He was still just “Big Dick Dray” the energy guy off the bench and fan favorite and LeBron’s numbers plummeted when Iggy was on the court.  You totally watched that series and remember it accurately though. You couldn’t even be bothered to Google the thread back then and look at the actual reaction of people in this sub to him winning? Spoiler, only people who were upset were the people who wanted LeBron to win. Curry wasn’t even in the conversation."
"The Lakers barely even could win that play in game. Steph carried that team so hard all year, and ended the season with such a historical tear he deserved to win MVP. The team is good defensively, top 5, but is literal fucking trash on offense outside of Curry. Andrew Wiggins was the was the 2nd option all year and is at best a 4th offensive player on a team. He's a purely volume offensive player. Draymond Green is a human boat anchor on offense. If you think Simmons is bad, oh boy, wait till you watch this guy. I guarantee you weren't watching Draymond games without Steph though, so you wouldn't know. Oubre and Bazemore are nice energy guys, but both have low IQs, are bad teammates, inconsistent, and also volume scorers. Again, better on defense than people give them credit for purely by their athletic ability, as they also struggle helping on defense. James Wiseman is great prospect on offense, but was simply unproductive last season. The only two real other offensive threats on the team were Poole down the stretch and JTA who showed out as a bit of a sniper. That team has no business being a middle of the road offense. The fact that Curry was able to lead them to a middle of the road offense instead of dead last with that squad, and the amount of injuries they sustained throughout the season, is truly incredible."
"If you're the best player in the world, the engine works. Funny how he could be the ""engine"" on a superteam but not with ""G-Leaguers"" Draymond Green, Wiseman, and Wiggins."

Draymond Green
"Lol, yeah it's not the gravity from the greatest shooter of all time helping Wiggins it's noted offensive threat Draymond Green.  You nailed it mate, good job"
"The poor defender commentary is old. He had huge improvements last year. His defensive real plus-minus rating was higher then Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green , and AD. Do some research and although he's not the best defender, he is WAY better then you're assumptions here. His only weakness is his shot blocking, but he finished 11th in steals. It's hard to say he's a poor defender when there is very little evidence to claim it."

What a way to run away from my point. You have me stats and I asked about the turnover then you shift goal posts. There's no such argument when he had draymond fucken green and Wiggins
"Because his usage rate was lower than everyone that played except George Hill and Danny Green. Sure, he does some things exceptionally, but he’s a much less valuable Draymond Green when he plays this way."
"Your acting like if an nba could guarantee drafting a prime draymond green, he wouldn’t be drafted at the #1 pick? Okay"
"The Hardest Road - Kevin Durant ft. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson,  Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving and James Harden"
"Rose Deng Noah Bulls. There were the Rose injuries, obviously. Taj should've started over Boozer. Korver should've got way more run.  The 13-14 Bulls should've been all-time good, Jimmy had come into his own, Deng and Noah were at their peaks and 28, Rose was only 25, and that's without getting into the part where if Thibs had his way we'd have had Draymond Green in his second season instead of Marquis Teague.  Man everything that happened with those Bulls was so frustrating. Fuck GarPax, fuck injuries, and (not really their fault but) fuck Boozer and Bogans."
"promising high energy defender, reminds me a little of draymond green. Offense needs work though"
"raptor fans, myself included, are anguishing over the fact, raps spend a 4th overall, in a deep draft, on a potential draymond green, when the original one was drafted at 46th overall"
I respect Draymond Green and him going to the Mavs will make us a championship contender but Green is easily replaceable in GSW. How easy it's to have undisputably 1 and 2 greatest shooter of all time in the NBA running around non-stop.
"Does that mean Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green were all negatives? Yeah that makes sense lmao"
"On the court, I got to say it was Draymond picking up that technical in game 4 in the 2017 NBA Finals.  Lebron was absolutely frustrated at the point and took out some of his emotions and Green gave the Cavs a window when he could've just laughed it off like he usually does (and get the opponent more annoyed).  Off-court I'd say Twolves Flynn over Curry, especially when you already picked up Rubio. Honestly, I think Flynn would have been a better player on another team too.  David Kahn screwed so much up with that pick."
"scottie barnes rn gives me some draymond green vibes on both ends, but he can definitely develop to be much more"
Who ever deleted this must have experienced Draymond Green
"Draymond Green is massively overrated and one of the luckiest players in sports history. If he dident end up on a team with two of the best shooters of all time, he’d be selling insurance on the streets."
"Draymond Green is incredibly overrated. He cannot shoot. He is not a good ball handler. He has little to no post game. He is not a great one on one defender (he has spent his career watching Klay Thompson, Iggy, KD, and others take on the top one or two offensive talents). He is not an above average rebounder. He is a good passer, but his assists are inflated by not being guarded and playing with literally the greatest shooters of all time.   I fully acknowledge his abilities a communicator and as a help defender. He is not, as he arrogantly claims, the best defender of all time, nor really that close. He is a plus role player that is now treated as a star.   There is a reason that when Klay went down, the Warriors became average overnight."
"Draymond Green, and not Steph Curry, is what changed the NBA to what it is today. Yes everyone sees all the threes being shot. But Draymond changed what it meant to play small ball, changed the definition, expectations, and roles of the 4 and 5 positions. Curry's greatness was a product of Green's impact. Draymond Green, and not Steph Curry, has had a bigger impact than Curry on what the game is today."
&gt;Draymond Green  Checks out.
"I was going to suggest Draymond Green and Greyson Allen, but you creative types already came up with those. Always a day late……"
You genuinely do not understand basketball if you think Draymond Green would be OUT OF THE ROTATION
Draymond Green is possibly the most overrated NBA player ever and probably wouldn't even be in the league if he didn't come up on a team with 2 (and later a third 3rd) generational talents surrounding him.
"Idk I guess it’s hard to explain the dynamic. He’s more of a draymond green type where if he was your number one, your team wouldn’t be very good. But let’s imagine a hypothetical team with both draymond and zach lavine. Zach lavine is definitely better than draymond, but adding draymond to a team led by zach lavine would massively increase the amount of games they wound win, in a way that’s disproportionate to draymond’s individual abilities. I feel like it’s the same with lowry. They’re better “ceiling-raisers” than “floor-raisers”"
Draymond Green got me
"1.	I find it impossible to look at only one side of the ball, so to me a lot of the purely offensive players are completely overrated. Trae, Booker, Kyrie, and Sexton are all worse to me than guys like Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and Ben Simmons 2.	There are like 5 true 3 &amp; D players in the league, all the others who are put into that category are either too skilled to just be considered 3+D, or are just good defenders who can’t really shoot but space the floor anyways by hanging in the corner or on the wing on offense. 3.	If you think the Lakers are legitimate title contenders you’re a casual"
"Rudy Gobert is a better defender then Draymond Green, Ben Simmons or Giannis rn, and I'd underrated offensively"
"Nah, Draymond Green is the best one here."
Draymond Green and Dennis Rodman are the two most underrated players in NBA history. EDIT: To make it even spicier-- Chris Paul is the most overrated player in NBA history.
You made this whole thing for Luka Dongkick and Draymond Green
"1. I don't think this is fair to say. Not because I think Sabonis is good, but rather because I think 99.9% of NBA fans don't give a shit about Sabonis. I don't think anyone can confidently say what Sabonis's actual ""rating"" is with the public. So without knowing that, how can we say he's over OR underrated.  2. Hard Agree. He's a physical beast and nothing else.  3. I agree, but not because Klay isn't great. Klay IS great. But Draymond Green is one of the five most underrated players in the history of basketball. He is incredibly, incredibly good.  4. Hard Agree. But I don't think this is an unpopular opinion. I could be wrong.  5. Hard Agree. Personally I would go further and say CP3 is my pick for most overrated player ever.  6. Maybe? To be honest I really don't give a shit about the clutchness of players that have never won a chip.  7. HARD agree."
“Draymond Green” is killing me
"Draymond Green isn’t just a regular good defender, he’s one of the greatest of all time. Not only that, but his defensive versatility is almost unprecedented (especially at his size) and unlike some other defenders whose value drops off in the playoffs, he maintains it and arguably becomes *even more valuable.   As for his offence, his excellent passing and decision making going downhill on 4v3s is a huge part of what made Golden State so deadly."
"I had to really think about #3 cause at first I was like “wtf” but the more I thought about it the more it made sense.   Warriors fans chime in here and correct me- but I think about the championship runs, and you remove Draymond pre KD Acquisition and replace him with most other players at his position and I’m not sure they win. But you remove Klay and replace him with for example Danny Green or a slightly above average 3 &amp; D player and I feel like they still win. Hell, even 2016 when Klay went nuclear in Game 6 they ended up losing the championship to the Cava anyway (in part due to Draymond’s suspension, of all things). So part of me can see this take making sense"
"Yeah I think Ben Simmons is a great defender but he doesn't deserve to be in DPOY talks at all. I think Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, and Joel Embiid are all noticeably more impactful defenders than him."
Mick Foley vs Draymond Green   Hell In A Cell
"Personally, I love watching Draymond Green and Steph Curry look bored out of their minds while they watch the game and occasionally talk to each other. Way better than actually watching basketball."
"Do you really need me to tell you why 22 year old Ben Simmons earned a bigger contract than 30 year old Draymond Green?  You should get off this sub mate, I don’t think this sport is for you"
"You realize Jordan and Pippen are two of the best defenders to every play the game? In 92/93, Jordan and Pippen were first-team all defensive players and Grant was second-team. I'm not sure if anyone on the Warriors is going to slow peak MJ, and that Bulls team was insanely switchable, too.      What Durant, Curry and Thompson did was extremely special, but saying one of the best finals teams of all time doesn't have an answer is hyperbole. The 2014 Spurs, 2012 Heat and 2001 Lakers (especially these Lakers) would be tough match ups for the 17/18 Warriors.   The Cavs teams that the Warriors face were not world beaters outside of Peak Lebron. Pippen in 92/93 had the size and speed to guard 1-4 in the old NBA and he could probably guard 1-5 in the new NBA. Grant had great touch and was doing Draymond Green things at a high level. The 92/93 Bulls are a much more complete team than any Cavs team Lebron was on, especially considering the pace they played."
"&gt; Steph had an MVP level season and they still missed the playoffs. Warriors fans should really temper their expectations  Counterpoint: Everyone needs to temper their expectations and assumptions. Warriors fans **and** non-Warriors fans alike.  People don't seem to realize just how bad the Warriors were starting Oubre and Wiseman last year. That and playing Wanamaker instead of Poole pretty much negated Steph's MVP-level contribution.  Looking at the last seasons in it's entirety and using that as a basis for the Warriors performance this year is a little bit myopic if not a bit disingenuous.  Now, does getting rid of Oubre &amp; Wanamaker, with Wiseman having a more defined and purposeful non-starting role a la the new developmental staff automatically make the Warriors contenders.  No, of course not.   But I think if you look at how those 6 players still on the roster (Curry, Green, Wiggins, Looney, JTA, and Poole) played after they lost those net-negative contributors, you'll see they were putting on an absolute clinic last year. And not just against bad teams. They did the same against teams like DEN, and PHX, and UTA.   Now, that's not to say that will continue to this year either. It's very possible that Steph doesn't have another scoring-title year, or Wiggins regresses, or Draymond continues to unperformed, or Poole doesn't continue improving, or Looney becomes chronically injured again, or Wiseman continues to be ineffective on defense, or Klay comes back as a shadow of himself or not at all, etc etc etc.  So, with that said, my point is that I disagree with all the people saying ""Yes, they are a contender,"" as much as I disagree with all the people saying ""No, they are not a contender."" Because the truth of the matter is we just don't know.   I almost feel like GSW is the team with the most question marks this year; the team that has the potential to either be a top-3 seed, or finish bottom-3 in the NBA in record. But that's for another conversation."
"Oubre, Paschall, Bazemore were parts of trios that were the worst lineups. Oubre and Bazemore specifically played hundreds of minutes of those trios and they were just outright bad.  Oubre, Wiggins, and Paschall played 111 minutes and were -18.5 NETRG  Oubre, Lee and Paschall played 151 minutes with -17.2 NETRG  Oubre, Bazmore and Lee played 102 minutes, -10 NETRTG.  Oubre, Bazemore and Looney played 136 and were  -1 NETRTG.  Curry, Wiggins, Oubre 833 minutes, -2.6 NETRTG.  Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre 811 minutes, -3.8 NETRTG.  Wiggins, Oubre, Wiseman 396 minutes, -16.8 NETRTG.   There are many more, I just picked a few with those 3 people. Meanwhile trios with Curry, Dray and Looney at 582 minutes have +15 NETRTG.  Curry, Green, Tuscano 467 minutes at +12.2 NETRTG  Curry, Looney, Lee 101 minutes were their best trio at +25.2 NETRTG.  Or their most used trio, Curry, Green, Wiggins with 1352 minutes at +4.6 NETRTG.  - -  Oubre is overall just a person who doesn't like to set solid screens when it was clearly a job he was expected to do. Instead he faked the screen and dived to the basket leaving Curry to create for himself.  Bazemore has some great lineups but that's when he's not trying to be aggressive and has a scorer alongside him. When he becomes part of the scoring equation he starts turning the ball over like crazy. On defense he would let people slip behind him often for easy catches for layups. His IQ is just low and he makes mistakes when he has to turn the switch on.   Paschall just lacked experience and made mistakes all around the board.  The biggest additions were exactly as you said, addition by subtraction.   The next step is getting Wiseman on pace with the rest of the team. He is also one of the main people who were part of many lineups with huge minutes that had negative NETRTG. Even with Curry and Dray, their NETRTG with Wiseman was -7.3 at 423 minutes, which was *the only* trio with Curry + Dray that was negative."
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
"Tell that to Draymond Green. Hasn’t made it in 2 years. Jrue Holliday hasn’t made it in like 8 years. No, defense and playmaking alone don’t get you in the all-star game unless you’re on a great team. If he goes to anywhere but the Warriors he’s not making the All Star team. And the Warriors don’t want him."
"Lol you have to be on crack to think he’s a more impactful defender than Anthony Davis or Draymond Green,"
Yeah when people say that Ben Simmons is as good of a defender as Draymond Green it’s a good bet that they’re totally clueless. Simmons at the five is non-viable defensively. Green is one of the greatest defensive players ever.
"Not wrong but as said. It’s have to be with CJ in Portland. Not Dame.   Simmons is a drama Queen who needs the ball in hand. He’s a stat padder. He can’t log assists playing off the ball, yet as a non shooter, he has literally zero value playing off the ball, which he’d be doing with Dame.   Draymond Green was a really subpar shooter of the ball but at least he took shots. And some games he was the difference with the shot.   You’re right that all they need is DPOY Simmons, but you’re talking about a guy who tells security “google me” instead of getting his ID out in lines at night clubs.   He really isn’t gonna just humble himself and accept the role of 10-7-6 a night PF who doesn’t handle the ball.   Though if he put his shit to the side. He’d go well there"
Bill Russell and basically every help defense principle that exists in basketball  Steve Kerr/Draymond Green and the idea that playing without a real big is a legitimate strategy
Draymond green feb 6 vs the mavs:   15 assists  6 rebounds  7 steals  4 blocks  2 points on 0-3 from the field and 2/2 from the line.
This feels exactly like the Kevin Love for Klay Thompson + Draymond Green speculation way back when Love wanted out from Minnesota  People underrate the Hawks assets because they haven't gotten their chance yet and think the Hawks need to make a move to get to the next level. They just need to keep the core together as best they can.
Just a blind look at DBPM career leaders w/o looking at tapes:  David Robinson  Tim Duncan  Hakeem Olajuwon  Kevin Garnett  Draymond Green  Ben Wallace  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Chris Paul  Joakim Noah  Michael Jordan  Manu Ginobili   John Stockton  Lebron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Scottie Pippen  Larry Bird  Dikembe Mutombo   And leaving out a few others who should be on this list.  You tell me I have to watch tape to see if these stats are wrong?
"poor man’s andre roberson is too far. he’s a middle class man’s draymond green. still can’t shoot but he’s an excellent passer and screen setter who can finish at the rim. assuming that a new team that has confidence in him repairs his broken confidence, which i personally believe will happen, and that’s a good player. he has a lot of value to add to a team as an off ball player, especially when the primary ball handler is an elite shooter like dame"
Draymond Green is going to get asked about KD for the rest of his life.
"I mean as Stan Van Gundy says, there's a lot of talk about what Ben Simmons can't do, and not nearly enough time spent on what he CAN do, and some of the things that he is absolutely elite at that correlate with impact on winning.   He is a super role player, but he is being paid like a star.   There's really only one team in the league that his skills would shine on and his weaknesses would be limited in their exposure and that's Golden State, as a Draymond Green replacement/successor."
Draymond Green is already the Donkey.
"The funniest thing is the retrospective narrative around The Warriors to undermine their achievements.  The constant complaints around being a ""stacked team"" to ""got lucky with injuries"" but before 2015 the stacked Warriors were made up of:  Steph Curry who was considered too small, too frail, too unathletic and an ankle injury away from being shipped out of the league  Klay Thompson who was considered a role-playing spot-up shooter at best (Marco Bellineli comparisons) because of his athletic limitations  Draymond Green who was considered a tweener with no true position and a high probability of fading out of the league  Andre Iguodala who was celebrated as a versatile two-way swingman but also heavily criticized in his Sixers days as being too passive and not a championship calibre SG  Andrew Bogut who was considered an unfortunate draft bust due to his injuries  And a collective of uncelebrated veteran journeymen like Shaun Livingston, Leandro Barbosa and Ian Clarkson"
"&gt; If the dude won't even ATTEMPT a shot or a FT, why the hell would we expect him to learn anything else?  Because shooting is much much different from defense.  Do you think he simply walked into the league an allstar and DPOY level defender?  He may have not made any progress on shooting but its pretty clear he has at least somewhat improved in other areas of his game.  Im sure that, given he is pretty damn good at defense, if he was asked to guard the 5 on a regular basis he could get good at it.   The problem is he isnt asked to do that on our team so he has never had to develop that part of his defense.     Draymond Green and Gobert are both elite defenders who are relatively bad shooters.  Why have they not worked on their shooting?  They can guard the 5 but somehow dont develop their shooting any more then Ben."
"People like you are the worst of all. And I’m not saying you specifically, but I grow tired of disagreements where people say stuff like, “oh you don’t think Mitchell Robinson is a great passer? I guess you just don’t watch the games.” Or, “you don’t think Lu Dort has more gravity than Duncan Robinson? You must not understand basketball at all.” Just because we watch the same games doesn’t mean we necessarily come to be same conclusions, and just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean they are ill informed. The worst one by far is draymond green. I like Draymond just fine, but you can’t say anything negative about him without hearing, “there’s more to basketball than points. You casuals need to watch the games.”"
&gt; he’s the second coming of Draymond Green  you’re being very generous here
Draymond Green says at one point Kevin Durant blocked his number and they only talked on Instagram    loll
"i mean, he probably could at like a fairly ineffective level without it looking like steph curry guarding a center, but he offers basically no rim protection, which draymond does at a pretty high level. He could do im sure as much as Jeff Green, but 1) its not like Green is great at it and 2) youre taking away one of his best assets, which is that hes one of, if not the, best perimeter defenders in the league. WE should've done it over Dwight at center, but it would still be a flawed lineup."
This is an enormous insult to Draymond Green.
People in this sub are right about this phrase:  You can tell someone is a casual based on how they see Draymond Green
"Pretty sure everyone says no.   Kings want Simmons not Green so if all the Sixers want is Hield/Bagley the Kings do the deal themselves.   Sixers want a WAY better package than Hield and Bagley  Warriors would be incredibly stupid to trade Draymond, their defensive anchor and locker room leader who guards bigs extremely well and carries the team defensively for Simmons who is mainly a perimeter defender and would only have a month to learn the entire system both offensively and defensively as he’d be needed as a primary ball-handler then throwing in a high ceiling prospect just to have that problem  Everyone loses"
"&gt;Sam Vecenie of The Athletic, has a general rule of thumb to never compare any draft prospects to Draymond Green  Sam's rule is a good one. Draft comps are pretty silly in most cases as they are so often made to All-Star caliber players. I understand why it happens since comparing a prospect to a solid role player doesn't click with readers the same way and generate fan interest. So the silly comps get made even though they are so rarely actualized."
Saying Ben Simmons is not the same type of player as Draymond Green is an outlandish take?
"&gt; As a small ball 5, he doesn't have the advantage that these players do, shooting three's.  Counter argument, Draymond Green.  He's a better shooter than Simmons, but aside from one season, he's still not anywhere near good. But dude averaged 8.9 assists a game last year, and over 7 for the last 6 seasons, and does play as a small ball 5.  Granted, that only works because he's surrounded by shooters.  But Simmons has the ability to play that sort of role on the right team.  I don't think Simmons could be a *full time* small ball Center, but I think he could do it for stretches."
"&gt;He's not a rim protector, he's a perimeter defender.   He's shown the ability to do both, he's just not typically asked to serve as a rim protector.   &gt;He's not going to use his size to score, he doesn't look to score.  Yeah, 90% of teams are not throwing the ball into their center in the post for them to score anymore.  &gt;He provides no shooting to stretch out opposing big men.  Neither do most centers.  &gt;He doesn't have the size to defend opposing big men.  He has the size to guard pretty much everyone short of Jokic/Embiid.   &gt;He's not Draymond Green. Draymond can defend big men.  I'm curious which non-Jokic/Embiid bigs you think Ben can't defend."
"Does he offer those traditional strengths?  He's not a rim protector, he's a perimeter defender. He's not going to use his size to score, he doesn't look to score. He provides no shooting to stretch out opposing big men. He doesn't have the size to defend opposing big men.  I'd argue that the ONLY suitable position for him is to run point and be helio-centric offensively. He's not Draymond Green. Draymond can defend big men."
He is most certainly not a better defender than Draymond Green lol. An intelligent defender who can guard the pick and roll as well as he does and can also protect the rim is invaluable. Simmons cannot play the five long term because of his defensive limitations.
"If you’re defending Draymond green you as a defender genuinely should not give a shit if he shoots the ball, its the exact same with simmons. You can say Draymond shoots the ball better but the difference between the two is marginal at best  This is like arguing that someone who scores 30% on a paper is dramatically different from someone who scored 37% on a paper. Technically you’re right that its a worse mark but the distinction is pretty meaningless in practice."
"&gt; He’s the exact defender you want in the playoffs. I’d argue that he’s better than Draymond and still has untapped potential on that end.  As a man-on-man defender, sure I could see the argument behind that. For me, Draymond's mind and on-court leadership/floor general is something that has me more inclined to believe Draymond is an overall better defender. His ability to read the floor and direct the players on what to do and what the other team will do is simply amazing to watch. Also, Draymond's ability to step up for when it matters has been proven time and time again.   There's a reason why one of the more prominent draft experts, Sam Vecenie of The Athletic, has a general rule of thumb to never compare any draft prospects to Draymond Green mainly because of Draymond's mind and how he's arguably one of the smartest players to play in the NBA."
Anyone who cares about this better not ever say shit about Reality TV shows or TMZ ever again. This shit isn't news. Have no idea why people care who Draymond Green is friends with.
"I think this is a smokescreen.  Dame has been wanting Draymond Green, who for all intents and purposes is a point-forward, for years.  Simmons in theory can do a very similar thing."
"He was still a stud for me. I won 9-cat off FG%, FT%, steals, blocks, and turnovers.  My best players were Giannis, Thybuille, Mikal Bridges, Draymond Green.   I wish I was kidding. I had a few other bench guys and what not that kept the fg% high, ft% to compensate for Giannis/Dray.. mostly defensive guys"
I mean according to his recent interview with Draymond Green it is something that he enjoys to do.
Draymond Green can defend the 5 and play center though.
He’s not even Draymond green.  Draymond can hit 3’s occasionally…and is not afraid of contact/going to the line.  Right now Simmons needs more work and a little less play
The problem is that people expected him to be the second coming of Lebron when in reality he’s the second coming of Draymond Green  I was never sold on the idea that ben could be the first or second best player on a conference finals team and i honestly never quite understood that sentiment. Its not coincidence that 2019( where ben was 3rd best) was the only year where the sixers were legit title contenders.   Maybe a fresh start on a new team will help him
"That game would’ve been know as The Draymond Green Game had the warriors won.  32/15/9 with 2 steals in a game where the warriors only scored 89. 11-15 from the field, 6-8 from 3. Had a serious case for FMVP if they pull that game out."
Draymond was atrocious in the play in games.  If he has any semblance of offense the Warriors make the playoffs.  Look at the last play of regulation vs the grizzlies.  He has the same problems as Simmons were you can just double the star player with impunity because Green/Simmons can’t make you pay in the halfcourt
"You must be new to the Draymond Green experience lol. In his prime the dude almost set a quadruple double but didn’t have the points for it. He’s never been excellent because of his scoring, it’s been everything else he does."
"I realize that.  But Dray isn't getting any younger and 29 teams manage to build rosters without a Draymond Green.  The Warriors would have to do things differently without Draymond, but there would still be more than enough talent to build a contender without him."
"“James Harden is a better defender than Draymond Green, bum got carried by KD”"
"i just don't get it. could someone explain it to me? how does simmons for wiggins make sense if you have draymond green on your team (plus whoever they have playing centre - is the idea simmons plays centre?) i mean like yeah, you are getting the ""best player"" so i guess you win the trade but the fit is just terrible, and it's just not worth it, especially if you are giving up assets like wiseman or kuminga or whatever. wiggins is an overpaid but perfectly good starting 3, especially with the full big three on the court (still something we have not yet seen).  if i'm missing something someone let me know because i'm honestly curious."
"Ah shit, you’re right. DPOY candidare Draymond Green leading the **checks notes** league’s 18th best defensive team.   Oh but wait, let me recheck that. That’s only the regular season, let’s pull up the playoff stats.   Oh… it’s empty? Weird. It’s almost like a team with All-NBA, top 3 all time defender Draymond Green (still in his prime, of course!) didn’t make the playoffs. And yet… hmmm… better than the 2nd best player on an actual championship contending team. Weird…  But yeah. I’M the one stuck in 2020. LAUGHING. MY. FUCKING. ASS. OFF."
"Ben Simmons is about as good of a Draymond Green successor as you're going to find.   Is it worth it to make that kind of swap if you're trying to compete for the championship? Fuck no. Draymond is still the better player and as you mentioned has a perfect chemistry with both Steph and Klay.  But why do we think the Warriors are trying to compete for the championship when they have so many young players on their team and are trying to develop Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody etc.  You don't compete for a championship AND groom young players at the same time. It just doesn't happen. You have to pick a path. I say that as somebody that learned from hard experience about this having watched the Celtics try and fail in that regard from 2017-2019.   If the Warriors were serious about competing for a championship, their roster would look more like the Lakers in terms of the # of veterans they have on their team."
"It was his role because the Sixers don't have a single other PG on the roster man. Theyve had a bunch of SGs like Seth, Maxey, Danny Green, Richardson etc.   They've yet to have a single player next to Simmons that can actually run an offense.   You can't have him in a Draymond role without a PG. And there's no PG in the entire league that runs the PnR more similarly to curry than Dame. All he has to do is run the 4v3s Dame creates.  Will he be draymond on defense? No. He's a perimeter defender. But he can easily be him on offense. His BBIQ may be lower, but he's also taller and more athletic, a better passer, and a vastly better finisher that actually puts pressure on the help defender"
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
To me the only way to make it work for the Warriros is to shipping away Green. And I'm not really sure they would like to remove one of the leader of the team and the emotional leader to take an empty bucket like Simmons.  But pure basketball wise it would have sense only that way.  Tbh Draymond bitching on Kerr and Mayers wasn't the smartest move by him knowing they could always trade you.
I mean he'd basically be an athletic Draymond Green in their offense
"All that does not guarantee Simmons will improve. Besides, his asking price is not worth the risks involved.  If Morey was selling Simmons as a project role-played with a solid floor and All-star upside he'd be out of Philly. The Sixers are trying to move him as a first/second option on a contending team, when he's more like a Draymond Green."
https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/09/01/warriors-not-interested-in-ben-simmons-while-they-have-draymond-green/
But Ben Simmons could be anything. He could even be Draymond Green!
"I don't think a trade is going to happen until Ben Simmons doesn't show up to training camp, assuming he is willing to take it that far.  Simmons is a very good player but Morey is delusional if he thinks anyone is going to trade another top 20 player for him, much less a top 20 player plus multiple draft picks.  Realistically Simmons is, at most, a better/younger version of Draymond Green.  It is possible to build a championship team around him but to do it you'd need 3 or 4 players who shoot above league average from the 3 point line."
"Fair enough, but since Ben demands the ball in his hands and be the nominal point guard, we haven't had a reliable half court initiator.   If he was content to be a Draymond Green with a real point guard next to him that could work. But he's insisted over the years that he is the point guard and the roster has been built on that assumption.   And it just hasn't worked because of the aforementioned shortcomings"
Its not if you put simmons in a draymond green role.  Which he should be playing till he learns to do something else.
GSW: What do you want for Ben Simmons?  76ers: Steph Curry and 3 unprotected first-round picks  GSW: How about we also send Klay Thompson and Draymond Green  76ers: Fair Enough  GSW: I am sorry you didn't get the joke. STOP CALLING!!!
Inserting obligatory draymond green in here.
"Maybe they win, maybe they don't but the Raptors team was really good. Siakam was playing lights out and was giving Draymond trouble. FVV, Green, and Lowry couldn't miss from 3. Kawhi was actually the guy that scared me the least lol and obviously he's an all time great player. Not to mention how well coached they were on defense. With KD, I think we for sure win but I still say its a toss up with just Steph and Klay. We severely lacked depth at the wings all season"
"That might be the biggest L/L trade I've ever seen. Warriors downgrade their defense and probably offense and lose their locker room leader, Philly gets to figure out how to run a Seth/Green/Tobias/Draymond/Embiid lineup.      Just takes two seconds of thought to see why this is a terrible idea."
LMAO dude was dropping 30+ a game on prime Draymond Green with Norris Cole and Tyreke Evans at point guard in the 2015 playoffs
"Honestly i think they’re 3-5 seed if they’re healthy. Ben Simmons is literally the perfect missing piece for them apart from maybe Draymond Green would be better at the 4. They’d be a dominant regular season team when healthy, three guys who can go for 30+ on any night, Ant only getting better and Simmons locking down being that extra playmaker."
[Doing this](https://youtu.be/3ugrYiEl9gg) on 80% shooting against Draymond Green is dominant. He had tons of other crazy playoff games in that run as well.
Ben Simmons WAS suppose to be the PnR ball handler not the roll man. He just never developed as a player and peaked as a worse draymond green.
"He really has nobody to blame but himself tbh.  He hasn't worked on his game since he entered the league he is literally THE EXACT SAME player. I knew he was doomed when he made the quote about his jump shot a year or 2 ago and I'm paraphrasing but, "" Once I perfect my jumpshot I'll use it in a game"". I just said to myself so he is actually scared to shot because that's not how it works he is going to have to go through growing pains and TRY and incorporate a jump shot into his game. It's not going to be game 1 of the season and he just starts stroking it like Steph he may start the season ugly 15% from 3pt range but, if he finished the last half at 25/30% then the league is in trouble.  I dont think he realizes that nobody cares if he misses but, jfc you gotta try. I'm not the biggest Giannis fan but fuck he doesn't give a shit about misses and atleast tries but, it's the only way to get better and instead of going that route he just refuses to do anything. I think that's what Doc and the Front Office saw when the competition is at its highest and defenders sag he won't even attempt to shoot but, that starts to screw up everything as now Embiid has to work harder for an entry pass or Simmons needs the ball in his hands so with defenders sagging but, now what are the guards doing? It just creates so many issues when you refuse to shoot that hurt your team when the margin for error is so thin.   He is entering Draymond Green territory where the question is .....does it benefit us to have a defensive stopper who literally can't shoot and both organizations GSW slower than Philly but, the answer is slowly becoming no."
"You're really gonna disrespect the shooting of Draymond ""I didn't miss a shot at the Olympics"" Green?!!?"
"I don’t think anyone thinks he is LeBron-esque, but peak Draymond on defense is way better than peak LeBron on defense. I wouldn’t ever count on LeBron to absolutely lock whoever he was guarding down 1 through 5 over the course of the season, but Dray can definitely do that game in and game out. Maybe LeBron could, but he is relied on too much offensively to give that effort all the time.   Sure, I’ll bite, idk how to talk to you if you compare Draymond to LeBron, but don’t also realize that the dude needs people around him to succeed. Sure, he’s not a great scorer, but if you think that is all basketball is about then you are immediately going to discount guys like Draymond or Rudy Gobert or any number of amazing players whose value is outside the box score.   Who the heck has ever said Draymond Green is like LeBron? You’re just creating a straw man argument you can easily counter, but idk anyone who would make that comparison."
I don't think Ben has the angst and leadership that Draymond has. Green keeps his head up. Simmons tends to crumble when faced with adversity.
"https://www.si.com/nba/2018/03/27/nba-players-fines-suspensions-money-nbpa-draymond-green-matt-barnes  _The formula for a game check is now equal to 1/145th of a player’s annual salary_  I'm not sure if there's a cumulative limit/cap on the total amount a player can be fined if they keep committing infractions.  a player can't lose their entire salary simply by missing every game, but i guess if they also go out and make ""problematic"" (for the league) statements about refs or something they might be able to lose a good chunk more?"
Draymond Green  1 point  9 assist  18 rebounds  37 blocks  26 steals  5 crotch shots
"&gt;Could Simmons' next home be San Francisco?  No because [""According to league sources, any interest the Warriors might have in Simmons is conditional. In short, they’re not that interested as long as Draymond Green is on the roster.""](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-trade-table-warriors-ben-simmons-interest)"
Draymond Green talks as if he is the leader of GSW.   We all know that he can only be #3 at the best.
"You give him guys like Klay, Draymond, and Iggy with Kerr coaching and he wins multiple championships with relative ease.  He certainly doesn’t get taken to six by one of the worst Finals teams ever and then get outplayed by someone like Draymond Green in the next Finals."
"youre 20 years old. the agent for LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Draymond Green comes and tells you that Philly will trash you and cannot provide a good team around you. He cites his other max contraft client and your current teammate being slandered in the press. He promises you that you can get out with Ben and to a team where you can be a starter and show out for your second contract. then he says that Lilliard is coming to Philly and you won’t play many minutes and you will lose your chance at $200 million. that’s bullshit, you’ve been a top 10 recruit your whole life, a first rounder, and you just showed out in the playoffs. you have earned this money and it’s time for you to get what you’re worth. are you gonna sit around and be a good little boy? or are you going to go out and be the all-american, all-conference, and all-whatever the fuck player you’ve been your whole life and get yours?  what would you do?"
Watching Draymond Green that one year where everyone dared him to shoot was quite fun
"Hear me out .. Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and Terrance Mann for Simmons?   How could you say no to that?   We can even throw in Eric Bledsoe    You don't like that ..  hear me out   Buddy hield, Marvin bagely, and a bag of chips    You don't like that hear me out .... draymond green straight up   Lol"
But the Warriors already have the best offball defender in the game in Draymond Green. What they needed was a point of attack defender which Wiggins has done admirably.
"I’m going to get downvoted by Warriors fans, but Wiggins is the almost the exact same player he was in Minnesota, he just now plays next to Steph Curry and Draymond Green.            He is at best league average on both offense and defense, and advance stats and eye test both back this up too."
"&gt;But all cutting his salary back realistically does is save Lacob money on tax, anyway. But tbf, Joe does need a new yacht.  Yup. That's what people seem to forget (or are just unaware of) when they're discussing Wiggins costing too much.  Warriors are already over the luxury tax line; they are already in the repeater. That situation is the same next year as well. Removing Wiggins' salary does not get them below that threshold.   Assuming they:  * keep Curry, Klay, Green, Looney, Lee, JTA, Kuminga, and Moody  * Team option for Wiseman, and Poole  * Sign 4 more of vets or rookies   they're still +$14.4M over the luxury tax line for 2022-2023 even without Wiggins.  Now, paying Wiggins $33,616,770 obviously isn't ideal because it ends up costing the Warriors between $213M-$223M in tax+salary (depending on whether they were going to run with 14 or with another vet-min as the 15th), and it puts Warriors over Lacob's  supposed $400M spending max.   So hopefully they can get him to take a discount when his contract is up in 2023.  But just for hypothetical reference if his salary was up in 2022  * Just a $2.5M discount ($31,356,525) would get the Warriors below that $400M salary+tax ""spending limit"".   * Paying Wiggins $25M would give Warriors $6,356,525 salary to play around with  * Getting both Draymond and Wiggins to take $20M each gives you $16,356,525 in salary to use in case Wiseman or Poole gonna get paid."
"I never said it was a big deal, I said it's dumb, and the reason was because Draymond said this.   &gt;“When you look at the word ‘owner,’ it really dates back to slavery,” Green said. “The word ‘owner’ and ‘master’ dates back to slavery. However it was then, if you were a slaveowner, it’s kind of your job. You owned slaves. They did the work for you. You sold the cotton.”  No, the word owner did not come into existence because of slavery, and property ownership existed before American Slavery. It's just stupid to insert bullshit into actually important conversations."
Most likely is Draymond Green. He missed one on points.
"Lebron is what makes that true. Outside Lebron, KCP, Green, Rondo, and Caruso is pretty mediocre as far as guards specifically go. But the supporting cast as a whole is definitely below average. The 4 best guys behind Lebron/AD were KCP, Green, Rondo, and Dwight.   Looking at recent championship teams, the 4 best guys behind the 2 best players were:  Bucks- Holiday, Lopez, Portis, and Tucker.  Raptors- Lowry/Siakam (whoever you think was worse), Green, Gasol, and VanVleet/Ibaka.  Warriors for 2 years- Klay, Draymond (lol), Iggy, and whoever.  Cavaliers had Love, JR, TT, and RJ. Somewhat closer to me, but still the Lakers was worse.  Warriors w/o KD- Draymond, Iggy, Barnes, and Bogut.  Spurs- Ginobili, Kawhi, Green, and Diaw.  Heat- Bosh, Ray, Chalmers, Battier.  Heat 2012- Bosh, Battier, Chalmers, Miller.  2011 Mavericks- Kidd, Marion, Chandler, Barea. This is the closest one I could find between the Lakers supporting cast, and I'd still probably lean Mavericks."
ikr I mean Draymond Green is like 100x better than Perkins as analyst
And the doubles Steph creates create a lot more confusion compared to dominant paint forces. Teams try very hard not to get confused but the margin for error is very small. If Draymond Green wasn't left completely wide open and could hit a 3 after every Curry hard double I would imagine they'd have won 1 or 2 more championships.
If klay doesn’t get injured in the 2019 finals and draymond green doesn’t get suspended in game 5 of 2016 then the warriors potentially win 2 ADDITIONAL finals further enhancing  stephs legacy and increasing the gap between Steph and KD/harden. We can play the what if game all day but it doesn’t matter at the end of the day

"The thing I think people are overlooking is if he was making OG Anunoby money I don't think the sixers are trading him. He's in the same position as draymond Green, but taking up a far larger chunk of the salary makes it a problem.   It's brutal for sixers fans but what Jimmy butler is... Is exactly what you'd want with the money you're paying Simmons. Someone that's 80-90% of what Simmons is on the defensive end + great facilitator and can run your offence in the playoffs. Rather than Simmons who becomes a dunking (or non dunking) traditional 4 every playoffs."
He's one of those ultimate glue type of players though. Sure he might not shoot well or make FTs well... but he can be some team's Draymond Green to put them WAY over the top.
"My god how did this get so many upvotes. If you upvoted this you don't know who Draymond Green is. It's not even the obvious shooting differences, Dray is a great rim protector and Ben is not."
"Well the last time the DPOY was a guard it was the glove in 96 so prolly not Marcus smart. It could however be Draymond green averaging 10/8/7, and while no one should dispute that Draymond is an excellent player he really isn't a guy you want to supermax."
"The GSW definition of primary ballhandler is not the league's definition. Some triangle hybrid is not the offense most of the league runs. In GSW's system there really isn't a point guard who dominates the ball. There's a lot of passing around.  There is no team in the league that would take Draymond and put him in the pick and roll with some big man like Ayton or Towns or Davis or whoever. I'm talking about the standard NBA offense which is run by a PG.  So while you are correct, it kind of ignores the whole context of this discussion which is Ben Simmons' usefulness to NBA teams versus someone like Draymond Green."
"He has been famous for it for a while now  this is an article from april 2017  &amp;#x200B;  “He coaches me and I coach him,” Adams said. “And by that I simply mean he is, to me, a coach on the floor. Especially at the defensive end of the floor. He also does things at the offensive end of the floor that are special, but we’re talking defense now. He has the ability to analyze the game, he has strong opinions about the way things should be done. There are times that he wants to amend what we’ve proposed to do, and that’s something that I accept.”  Green isn’t afraid of pulling teammates aside and instructing them during games. Adams said “he can step on people’s toes” sometimes, but has become a much better leader than he was three years ago. In fact, Green is so invested in helping his teammates that Adams would be surprised if Green didn’t find himself in Adams’ shoes eventually.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/to-ron-adams-draymond-green-is-the-defensive-equivalent-of-steph-currys-magic/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/to-ron-adams-draymond-green-is-the-defensive-equivalent-of-steph-currys-magic/)  Pop talks about draymonds effect on the defense this summers gold medal team  [https://www.audacy.com/957thegame/sports/golden-state-warriors/popovich-on-what-makes-draymond-special-on-defense](https://www.audacy.com/957thegame/sports/golden-state-warriors/popovich-on-what-makes-draymond-special-on-defense)"
"Trade 3 is the only realistic one that takes into account assets the teams have. 1 and 2 don't work because the Lakers and the Clippers don't have the assets to trade for a superstar and star player respectively.   Trade 3 works in terms of assets but it doesn't work based on fit, so the warriors simply don't go for it. Realistic and impactful trades that work for the Warriors are them going for either Bradley Beal or Siakam. Beal trade would be bat shit insane offense with 3 of the best off ball guards playing off Draymond Green. Siakam trade works better with fit and gives them greater offensive and defensive versatility. Firstly, a Draymond and Siakam front court is insane defensively with either of them being able to play small ball center. Secondly, Siakam provides a more versatile scoring option who is also a pretty good facilitator"

I saw Harden at the mall and he seemed nice enough when a kid tried to talk to him.  Also had a friend who ran into Draymond Green at the airport and he's apparently a really nice dude too. Even got a picture with my friend.

Draymond Green
"“Klay Thompson is also likely headed to the Hall of Fame as one of the best two-way players in the game, and he may go down as the second-best shooter behind Curry by the time both their careers end. And as a key to three title teams, Draymond Green will have a good case, too.”  -- Nick Friedell  It’s not difficult to make it into the hall of fame, nobody thinks the stats you posted are wrong you just don’t know what you’re talking about."
"Who are the 4-5 superstars lol. Only legit stars on the Warriors were Steph and Durant. Draymond Green is the definition of role player. Klay is so inconsistent on offense, but for whatever reason never gets called out for it, shows you he really is not a superstar. He can't handle the ball, struggles to finish around the basket and is a mediocre passer. He works hard and hustles for the team on defense, but is not some defensive stopper like Spurs Kawhi. Warriors just had great synergy with role players that understood their assignments perfectly, especially Iguodala and Livingston."
"He'd see the angles and timing for the passer which could arguably help his understanding as roller.  And it can help his court vision, passing, timing which can be useful as well. Marc Gasol, Jokic, Draymond Green and more centers are actually playmaking from the top. TT cannot get to that level but he might improve his skills to run some simple sets, give some passes to rolling teammates when its needed with the second unit.  In general, this is a very bad take by lebron. Players should work on anything and everything. You can be Isiah Thomas but it'd be still good to practice some rebounding, boxing out drills. Get your timing better, work on boxing out techniques. He can still suck at rebounding after the drills but he'll suck less. Same thing for centers and working on 3pt shots. Maybe it'll take couple of years to develop a respectable 3pt shot but any incremental improvement is a good thing. Big men working on handles are also good thing. They don't require to bring the ball up but just become better in this and it'll help other areas of the game."
"Draymond Green even though he plays small ball C at times, and dont have big block numbers, but is definitely a good rim protector."
Same thing is applicable with Draymond Green. Any prospect who is too small to be a 5 but too big to be a 4 and has showcased some defensive ability is the next Draymond. It’s even worse if once in college he made a tough pass.
"Draymond Green is an ELITE defender but in  imho Giannis’ size, wingspan and athleticism allow him to protect the rim, help off his man etc at a level that’s rarely if ever been seen."
"""Can you think of a name Blacker than 'Tyrone Washington'?""  According to Dave Chappelle it's Draymond Green."

DRAYMOND GREEN AND HIS TRIPLE SINGLES!   0pts - 6reb- 4 assists- 4 TO
AD with the defense of Draymond Green
"He was the best player in the game for 3 years. How people talk about bill Russell defensively, he was that.   Offensively, a significantly less than his defensive prowess, but still excellent. Great jump shooter from 20 and in. Good at handling, amazing for a PF. Post game was good. Excellent passer. Really did his damage on drives from 15 ft to about 6 ft, with spins and fadeaways. Not really much you could do if he drove. His passing ability was excellent. It was really just cut him off, body him, and hope he misses from around 7 ft because you're not blocking that pterodactyl's shot.   At that time, he didn't have a PnR guard to get him on hard rolls, his best skill imo, or a center to get the hell out of the way. In fact, the minny offense at that time was entirely predicated on taking shitty 20 footers. Like the clogged toilet offense of OKC with KD, except minus KD and RW. So, a long of KG's offensive value was left on the table.   I'd say that defensively prime kg was definitively the best defensive I've ever seen, way way better than draymond green. Lockdown 1-4 as the man defender, and most 5s too. And the best help defender that I've seen. Offensively, he was a cut below Amare as a scorer, but a great passer. So, maybe the 5th or 6th best scoring forward at that time. Just an insane combination.   If he had continued to play with marbury at the 1 and added sheed at the 5, I just don't know how you beat them, unless shaq is involved. And eventually shaq aged out."
The best of Anthony Davis and Draymond Green combined in a more athletic body.

"&gt; The question is really ""Can a 33 year old Steph, 31 year old Klay coming off catastrophic injury and 31 year old Draymond Green play 40 minutes a game and win with no bench?""  &gt; I don't really think so.  That."
"The question is really ""Can a 33 year old Steph, 31 year old Klay coming off catastrophic injury and 31 year old Draymond Green play 40 minutes a game and win with no bench?""  I don't really think so."
"this would be terrible for the Warriors, Wiseman needs reps and you’d bring Marc Gasol to do what? be a lesser Draymond Green?"
"Mate if you think I'm worked up you've never met an Australian before. I'm slinging shit about a player that coos too much flack for one aspect of his game. Draymond Green is a great example of a player that should never fucking shoot that is elite in all other areas that is a key piece to winning a chip and golden state fans fucking love him for it. That's all my point is, Philly fans just are crying little bitches who deserve everything they're getting."
"&gt; but when your star PG  Ben isn't a PG and shouldn't be considered a PG. He should be considered a passing big who defends five positions or just a weird wildcard who doesn't fit traditional positional roles. The Sixers should be starting a guy like Maxey *with* Ben, not in place of him.  There has never been any debate about whether Draymond Green can be the Warriors' point guard because no one ever labelled him that way and no one expects him to play without a point guard. For whatever reason (whether it's Ben's fault, the Sixers, or whoever), this narrative has come about largely because of that label."
hahaha  \*in Draymond Green voice\* they don't love you like that
"Simmons has a skillset. If he wants to play point, get him to Mike Dantoni and give him a 4 spread offense...watch him drop 20-10-7 and become and an mvp candidate.  Or get him to golden state and use him in a high post like draymond green.  He definitely has such an elite skillset in that hes good at everythign but shooting and really good at everything but shooting.  Its a hole for sure that can be a problem in playoffs, but you can get creative him and use him in otherways, it just may be a terrible fit with Embiid."
Draymond Green
personally I value Simmons higher than most as I think he can play a Draymond Green type role on a contender and the Sixers are a very poor fit for him
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
I think depending on what team he’s traded to you’ll see him played as he should be and that’s a PF in a draymond green type roll and not as the PG of a team  I do think once he’s out of the toxic situation he’s in he’ll get his mind right and become more aggressive on offense and maybe doubtful but maybe he’ll take at least 1 3pter a game who knows maybe a new team new situation he’d take 3s more often
"Dunk machines like Blake age poorly, as do players who miss a lot of time, so I don't think they are crazy for having BG in the mid-teens.  Blake went on to sit the majority of games over the next six seasons, the time frame projected here.  Embiid hadn't played an NBA game.  Giannis was coming off a rookie season where he averaged 7/4.  Payton was young and this is the type of shit that happens when you rely entirely on data, as this list did.  They admit that this may be a huge overranking, adding  &gt; So we have bona fide stars like Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin … and then we have Elfrid Payton?!? Is this CARMELO’s version of PECOTA’s infamous Wily Mo Pena projection? Time will tell, but Payton logged almost 2,500 minutes as a 20-year-old rookie last year while flashing excellent passing and defensive skills.   I'm just glad they provide us with some public player projection data, while I have to admit it's far from perfect it's the only gig in town so take it or leave it."
"Dennis Schroder, Draymond Green, Solomon Hill, PJ Tucker, Jae Crowder if Schroder and Hill were on the Warriors and Jae Crowder was still on the Heat"
"&gt; Zeke won in the era of Bird, Magic, and MJ. Has a winning playoff record against each of them. Especially when no one believed a small guard could lead a team to a championship.  So? Steph has still done more winning than Zeke, and didn't need to dirty while doing it.  &gt; He inspired a whole city and its kids to dream again, everyone loves him in Detroit. See Chris Webber's HoF speech just as an example.  Steph literally inspired this generation of players, as well as the whole league, to adopt the volume 3-point shooting. Zeke's influence did not even reach other countries in North America, as compared to Steph's worldwide influence.  &gt; . I think even Nash could have been better than Steph if he was drafted in 2009.  He is a great player, but you underestimate the impact of his lack of scoring ability.   &gt; Nash was a better passer and a comparable shooter.  Passing isn't equivalent to playmaking. Steph, even in his bad games, gets double-teamed constantly. His off-ball gravity is a great reason why Klay Thompson and Draymond Green blossomed to the players they are.  Steph is the GOAT shooter. He shoots about 1% better than Nash despite shooting 5.2 more times per game.   Your whole argument is infallible, and exhibits ""oldhead"" tendencies people who can't let go of the past in relation to NBA are prone to display.   At the end of the day, it's your opinion, but posting it on an online forum leaves it open to criticism."
"Draymond ""single double"" Green approves"

"All 3 are at bare minimum good defenders even if they’re not great, at least compared to their positional average. And they were replaced by , again relative to their positional average, bad defenders in devonte and valancunis. With all that in mind and considering they were 28th defensively last year, I don’t see a realistic scenerio where they’re any higher than like 24th defensively, unless Zion turns into Draymond and willie green is actually Nick nurse 2.0"
Draymond Green and Aaron Gordon are both NBA players
I don’t a direct player comparison but I truly believe Draymond Green is a top 15 player in the league. Yes I am biased.
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"Obviously, Bledsoe could've been pouting on the Pelicans, but he was the second worst defender on the team only because nobody told Zion he should try to play on both ends of the court. He also hasn't been good in the P&amp;R, which is the bread and butter of his ""ball-handling"", since Phoenix. In theory: yes, Bledsoe could be good on the Clippers. In practice though, Draymond Green is a better offensive player at this point and the guy hasn't scored in years..."
"I dont care about whether the Sixers fail.  1) Dont like Sixers fans that much, they talk a lot of trash and there is a lot of them. Every team has dumb fans, but the proportions are higher for some teams and the Sixers are one of them  2) I dont like Ben Simmons. He is way overpaid for a guy who does everything well except HALF COURT OFFENSE. He doesnt even need to shoot, just develop a post game and some midrange game and he would be lethal in PnR, both as the ball handler and the pick. But, for whatever real reasons actually exist, he hasnt gotten any better on that end of the floor. I cant comment on why, i dont know, but it says something when someone just doesnt improve. I get better at my shitty job every year, there is no reason he cant. So basically he is a defensive stopper and transition guy only...so Draymond Green but without a killer instinct in crunch time and less strength to deal with Centers? Ya he is better on the perimeter, but how valuable is that when you have to play a center with him AND he has no threat on the offensive side? That means you have to find a center that shoots 3s to mazimize him? How many of those are there?  3) I like Embiid. I like his game, I like his personality, he is better without Simmons in the playoffs. I dont see Simmons as a 2nd or 3rd best player on a championship team due to his mentality more than anything, and I want to see Embiid win. Dont care where that is, but if he wants to stay in Philly, cool for him.  &amp;#x200B;  Guess what? It isnt really about you, or about rooting for your team. Your over the top simplification of multiple issues reflects much more on you than anything else. Great job!"
"&gt; but the Warriors clearly design their offense with screens and ball movement to maximize Curry's abilities  Curry is elite with or without the ball in his hands. They run this system for Draymond, not Curry. The system maximizes Draymond by allowing the ball to be in his hands making decisions, because he's pretty limited offensively otherwise.  Curry has always been at or near the top of the league in terms of pick and roll efficiency despite not often having a pick and roll center like Capela (Curry/Green is one of the best PnR duos of all time but Green is usually making another pass on the 4 on 3 Curry creates rather than finishing).   &gt; also KD is a really good defender, and curry is not. so even if we think Curry is better offensively, he has to be a lot better to make up for the defensive gap.  Not really though. A guard's impact primarily comes on offense, defense is a luxury. Curry defends his position well but it's not going to have too much of an impact from a PG unless you are really horrible or really elite. In a 1 on 1 tournament though, sure, it'd be pretty important that Curry can't guard LeBron James mano a mano."
"Well this goes in the same direction as ""empty stats"". Stats are never meaningless, we just say it because for some reason players like Beal or Booker have been stuck on losing teams(excluding last year for Booker). KD is a phenomenal scorer and a good defender. Someone who can carry your team by himself, but this can lead to frustration for role players, who were seen as better or think better of themself, as they get outshined by KD who demands the ball. Curry on the other hand seems to be a magician in bringing out the best out of his teammates. Just imagine Draymond Green on another team, or who Wiggins was before he moved to Golden State. Or even better, think about KD before and while he was on the Warriors. He and Steph on the Court was one of the deadliest forces the NBA has ever seen as to guard KD you need multiple people around the paint, to guard Curry you need at least one person on the WHOLE court sticking to him to stop him and Currys movement creates Chaos that makes it easier for everyone. It's not that easy to explain why I see KD as better overall and Curry better for a team. Both can win you championships but one does it by himself the other does it with his team."
Most versatile defender in the league? Did Draymond Green die?
"In that series, Capela was basically taken out of the series by Golden State(credit to Draymond Green), and CP3 was hurt in those two games, so I don’t think it’s outlandish to talk about what Harden did as the primary reason we got as far as we did. The following season too, basically the entire team played like garbage outside of Harden against the GSW in the playoffs.  That being said, I think the Rockets win the Finals in 2020 if they kept CP3 and Capela. Nothing against Westbrook, those were just two terrible moves forced by ownership and not our front office."
"&gt;Don’t bother responding. Sometimes it’s okay to just eat the downvotes  Yeah, you're right.

Don’t bother responding. Sometimes it’s okay to just eat the downvotes. They are not ready. Maybe in a few years or when the average NBA fan understands basketball beyond typical 1v1 comparisons. The misunderstood cases of rudy gobert and draymond green to a certain extent is so sad but it is what it is.
"Simmons is essentially a Draymond green. Green is a betted 3 point shooter, and Simmons drives more… now I’m talking playoff ball since regular season no one plays defense and you up and down fast breaks. In the playoffs defense tightens up and Simmons game shrinks"
"I have him at 12 but he’s a top 10 talent.  I’d argue only Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are definitely better than him as a talent.  He’s in the same category as Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem as a talent but doesn’t have the legacy those guys do.    As an aside, Russell is super underrated by people claiming he’s only be a Dennis Rodman / Draymond Green type of player but he isn’t the same talent as those guys above.  Russell has the better legacy because he was like Jordan and Kobe in his mentality and played team ball instead of superstar iso ball and was an athletic freak of nature like David Robinson, Magic Johnson, prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Julius Erving, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"I'm actually steering into the skid on this one: the Ben Simmons slander hasn't gone *far enough*.  He happily signed a max deal in Philly to be their franchise guy and hasn't worked on or improved his game at all since coming into the league.  He wants all the credit &amp; benefits of being a franchise guy but isn't willing to do what it takes to earn that.  With great power comes great responsibility.  If Ben was getting paid Tacko Fall money, nobody would give a shit that he's extremely fragile and has serious limitations, but he isn't so he rightfully gets held to a different standard.  It's not unreasonable for fans &amp; media members to expect NBA players to work hard, doubly so for ""franchise cornerstones.""  Ben can't have it both ways, if he wants to be a ""young socialite"" in a major media market then he has to deal with the scrutiny that comes with that.  If he wants to be loved &amp; coddled and have a team just be happy to have him for who he is, then go to fucking Sacramento, Portland, Minneapolis or somewhere like that (no shots at those cities, typically the media in small markets are less intense).     The way he handles himself &amp; approaches his craft is laughable, and it shows on the court where he spends more time standing flat-footed as a giant, sucking negative than he does doing anything impactful on the court.  People want to say that he could be like Draymond Green which is insanely fucking disrespectful to Draymond Green.  Dray may not shoot a lot (but he IS willing to take them when he needs to), but that dude cuts, screens, scraps and fights for everything and worked his ass off to maximize his abilities.  Draymond is always locked in and is useful in the half-court, Ben Simmons doesn't do anything except stand in the dunker's spot (or out of bounds) and his effort &amp; focus fluctuates wildly.  Miss me with Ben Simmons, I've said it before &amp; will say it again: I wouldn't trade Marcus Smart for him straight up.  Ben Simmons is the most overrated player in the NBA bar none."
"Check [this](https://fansided.com/2021/02/07/draymond-green-screen-assists/) out. I would happily give props to Draymond, too."
"Bruh, Bogut had higher defensive +/- than Draymond in that playoffs run, had by huge margin the best defensive rating on the team, by far the highest number of blocks even while sitting out the last few games due to injuries. Watch the difference in rim protection and the difference in offensive actions by Kyrie and especially LeBron.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportskeeda.com/amp/basketball/opinion-andrew-bogut-s-injury-in-the-2016-nba-finals-cost-the-warriors-not-draymond-green-s-suspension  Also, Draymond’s suspension was sus as fuck, it’s extremely rare, especially in the finals, to have a call overturned like that post game. Not only that but it’s even rarer when there was no serious injury that occurred as a result. It was an incident instigated by LeBron and you can clearly see that as LeBron goes out of his way to step over Draymond when he could just as easily move around him. It should have been a double technical, LeBron clearly knew Draymond was at his flagrant limit and was trying to instigate him all game. He pushed Draymond and stepped over him trying to bait the flagrant. Officials on the floor did not call it because LeBron initiated the incident. He then petitions the league after the game to have it upgraded to a flagrant. That incident made me lose a lot of respect for him, because he’s rigging the series in his favor and made it so damn obvious."
My favorite one of these is the all Andre Iguadala team.   PG: 2017 Steph Curry  SG: 2017 Klay Thompson   SF: 2017 Andre Iguadala  PF: 2017 Kevin Durant  C: 2017 Draymond Green
"Despite his offensive issues, Draymond does not wilt under pressure and you can't Hack-a-Green him out of the game like you can with Ben."
Yea and I don't see people blaming Lebron for that loss lol I see them blame Danny Green for bricking a wide open 3  Likewise we should blame Draymond for bricking the game winning layup
"What, in terms of point guard responsibilities, is he better at then Harden? He is a better shooter. That's kind of it. Having multiple titles when you had 3 years of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green as teammates doesn't mean he's a better PG. And the year he didn't have KD, the Cavs had as bad of injury luck as this years Nets"
"Who tf looks at Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, 73 wins,  Steve Kerr with a championship already  won and comes to the conclusion ""Yeah man, true underdog story""   Dude just spouts off different nonsense every time he's asked about it."
How the fuck did Draymond Green lose?   You idiots actually run with whatever narrative you make up lol  If anything Kevin Hart lost because his foot was on the line for the last shot.
"I try to defend his shooting as well. This past season, he actually [shot well](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/draymond-green-3-point-percentage-after-april-23-2021) at the end of the season."
Difference between Ben Simmons and Draymond green is Steph curry   don’t @ me
[before](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/draymond-green-3-point-percentage-before-february-12-2016)  [after](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/draymond-green-3-point-percentage-after-february-12-2016)
"If you go with Curry you have to get defenders to make up for him. He doesn't come with Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala and Draymond Green."
"Harden had to go up against the ""scrubs"" named Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson every year lol"
"Oh that’s a somewhat different question than the one in your post. There sometimes is a player (Zion a few years ago) who can come into the league and be a top 50 player instantly, but I would say the 10 best college basketball players would be like ranked mostly 100-300 if you rate them with NBA players. I believe Cade probably would be ranked around 70th (it’s a long list so that’s just my estimate - for reference Westbrook is around 35 and Draymond is around 45 and Rozier is probably around 70). After Cade, the next best college basketball players are probably going to be ranked 100+ (Jalen Green might be ranked 90-100, if you include G leaguers). Davion Mitchell might be the most NBA ready college prospect not named Cade or Green, and he’s probably around 120.   Btw this answer would be way different 20 years ago and definitely 40 years ago when college basketball players weren’t all one and dones. When MJ came into the league in 1984, MJ would have already been a top 5 player (he lead the league in total points as a rookie). Hakeem would have been a top 15 player and Barkley and Perkins probably both top 50 players."
"Chris Paul, Andre Drummond, Draymond Green, Isiah Thomas, Jeremy Lin."
Draymond Green ground and pounding Mike Beasley at the end of round 1 that led to him getting suspended in the finals
Draymond green?
One day Draymond Green is gonna be the least deserving hall of famer in basketball history.
Can the Suns afford to run him in a Draymond Green role and keep him at PF?   But Dray seems to be doing a lot more off-ball already vs Simmons so that's already a big ask to change how he plays.
"a shooter’s reputation matters waaaay more than how they’re currently shooting. roberson would have to shoot 60% contested threes from the logo for a whole season before any defense ever takes him seriously. it’s great that a professional shooting guard shot 32% though with all five defenders eating popcorn 90 feet away daring him to pull up  i read that every team recruiting kd that year had video highlights about how he had to work waaaaay too fucking hard to generate offense. you’re reciting KD’s shooting that series like apex draymond green (he’s washed now), andre iguodala and klay Thompson weren’t swarming him on every possession"
"It’s an invalid debate. The reason ppl don’t call the Bulls a super team is because they don’t view Rodman as a super star in any capacity.  The man was pulling down 15 rpg as a specialist, a Draymond Green type of player who was elite at *what he did* which was to out work, out hustle, and pester his opponents (Karl Malone).  Those are MJ biased takes to discredit great players today who have the agency to dictate their futures like never before.  The anti-NFL.    Now while the league has remained competitive despite moves like KD to the Warriors, which I believe was a travesty bc of how easy it was to pick them as a destination given his status, it could probably be moreso, but the majority of complaints are from fan bases that never had a shot in the first place."
Okay? *Draymond Green* is not the guy who gets to say that. Dude isn’t a good enough player to go nipping at Pierce’s heels.
"Paul Pierce's attempted farewell tour.  Draymond Green wasn't *wrong*, Paul Pierce was washed and absolutely was trying to give himself a farewell tour. You can do that if you're Kobe or D-Wade.  If you're Paul Pierce, you'll find that they don't, in fact, love you like that."
"&gt;Ben Wallace had nothing to do with Draymond Green  Draymond Green:  “Ben had an incredible work ethic. Not only did he work out extremely hard every day, but more importantly, he had the heart of a lion… Here we are about 10 years later and a common story line has surfaced --- how am I able to do what I do while undersized, just like Ben. I refuse to be outworked and I consider myself to have the heart of a lion… Thank you, Mr. Wallace, for showing me that it is possible to make it to the NBA and wreak havoc while being undersized! Hopefully, there is a kid watching me and wondering the same things I did about you, realizing that man does not have the ability to judge what's in another man's heart!”"
"Ben wallace had nothing to do with draymond green. a a 6’10 freak literally won 3 straight DPOY’s right after Wallace. you’re just repeating talking points people use about Curry like that matters  if 10 years after wallace is a revolution, then i would like to thank Rick Barry for REVOLUTIONING the game in 77 and paving the way for perimeter players like MJ to finally be good enough to win a title . god bless rick barry"
He did go shot for shot with Lebron and beat him though. And he outplayed Kobe in the finals too.   Draymond Green couldn’t consider doing anything of the sort.
"I decided to take a look at all time DBPM, and Wallace is 5th all time. The only modern NBA player ahead of him is Draymond Green."
"Barkley may have been only 6""4 or 6""5, but he supposedly had the reach of a 6""10 person with a standing reach of 8""10 inches.  Height isn't as important as your standing reach or wingspan when it comes to defense and rebounding.  Draymond Green is another great example of this, as like Barkley he is ""undersized"" if looking at height (6""6) but also has a 8""10 standing reach and 7""1 wingspan."
&gt; Draymond Green: vs Pelicans - 10 pts    I wonder if Draymond's game is the lowest scoring performance among everyone listed here?
Draymond green not even on paul pierce level to even talk to him in that regard
Lol Draymond had the green light to talk all the shit he wanted with peak Warriors.
"List said stats because that's just totally incorrect. Draymond, especially back then, added a lot for them on offense and scoring was his weakest offensive quality.  2004 playoffs Prince averaged 9.9 ppg on 41/27/75. 16 points per 100 possessions, 10.3 points per 36 minutes, and 48.3% true shooting. All these stats have their flaws without context but everyone of these stats were worse than Green's 2017 playoffs.  2017 playoffs Green averaged 13.1 ppg on 45/51/69. 17.9 points per 100 possessions, 13.5 points per 36 minutes, and 58.3% true shooting.  If you're going to talk about Draymond not being much of a scorer in the finals (which is fair) then what about Prince in 2004? 10 ppg on abysmal 39/19/46 shooting splits?  I agree Prince as a scorer was better than Green but later on in his career. 2003-2004 sophomore Tayshaun Prince was not yet. I feel almost like I'm shitting on Prince which is not my intention. He was such a solid player with a respectable career. He'd be perfect in today's game and he was a great fit for any good team.  Again, I think you (and now I) are fixating on this Draymond thing too much. That's not the point of my argument."

"Hot take: Draymond Green should have been first team all-center in 2016. It wasnt his main position, but he still played a lot of center and was the best in the league at that position that year"
"“Here we pit LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook against Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Thompson.  Their best stars are roughly even. I’m willing to call that a wash”  they say this and still pick the Lakers to win, so are the Lakers big 3 better than the Warriors big 3 or not?"
"Without the jump shot, if he fixes his attitude, he can still be a more attacking draymond green type.   I just want to see him in a team that doesn't play iso ball. I so wish he played for the boomers in Tokyo. Patty played a little iso but we still had good movement."

If GSW gave Draymond Green or Klay Thompson to the Trailblazers we would have beat them in the conference finals a few years back.
Tim Duncan is a bad comparison.   Bill in the modern game would be like Draymond Green if you made him bigger/faster/stonger/quicker/more explosive.   Russel ran the fast break and could dunk from the free throw line. He was an all-world athletic freak with unmatched defensive instincts. But he didn’t have the kind of refined post game that Duncan had.
Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green might not be the best combo but they certainly set up that championship team.
Harrison Barnes &amp; Draymond Green
"They're not switchable in today's NBA and especially not against the Warriors. Plenty of bigs have gotten ""exposed"" and ""played off the court."" This would be no different. They'd do a better job than Kevin Love but the result would be the same.  I'll bring up just one of the many unguardable Warriors playtypes: the PnR.   If they hedge/switch in the 3pt PnR, they Warriors will end up a bunch of easy options. Curry/KD can get the switch and blow by the big and create a scoring opportunity for themselves or another player. If they trap, they'll hit Green/Iguodala/KD on the short roll for a 4v3 that'll result in a good look. If they do drop coverage, then it's an easy look.   Also, the Curry Durant PnR is just unguardable. You switch and then Curry has a mismatch on either Wallace and KD has a mismatch on Billups on the catch or in the post. They can also run this off ball with Draymond or Iguodala facilitating up top. If you top lock the Curry Durant screen then they can also immediately go back door (either the cutter or the screen could slip the screen) and either Green or Iguodala is more than capable of hitting that cut on the money. There's going to be so much space on that strong side that the rim would be uncontested because no one is going to cheat off of Klay in the corner.   And this is only one playtype on one side of the court. The 2017 Warriors defense was super elite and would defend the Pistons very well. In a matter of minutes they could just explode on a 20-0 run and the game would be over.   The Pistons defense was incredible. No one is scoring 1v1 in the post against Ben Wallace. Yes, they were highly switchable at the time but its different when they're asked to cover off ball actions that end up at 15 ft from the basket vs 30 ft from the basket. They can cover one or two steps to the free throw line but the 3pt line is way way farther out. Also, most defensive possessions have the whole team right by the paint. The spacing is so much different. You can't trap or double like you did back then.  Not to mention, that there's barely any off ball movement. Offenses would have one guard at the top of the key, one guy in the low post, one guy in the dunker spot, one guy at the top of the key and one guy in the corner (but not corner 3. They'd usually be a step inside) vs the Warriors that would often have nobody in the paint except for when they're cutting.  Rewatch a Pistons Lakers Finals game and rewatch a Warriors Cavs Finals game and look at how drastically different the coverages are. It's a lot easier to double Shaq when the guy you're cheating off of is just at the elbow and that shot is not that efficient vs Klay Thompson in the corner.   Again, this is not to discredit the Pistons. The 2017 Warriors are arguably the greatest team ever and I think KD Curry screen action is possibly the most unguardable play"
"There are teams that would kill for 3 years of bad 2nd round performances. Not every team has the same goals. A bottomfeeder team would absolutely pay him the max just to get them to the playoffs.  Not to mention he could work in the Draymond Green role on a different team. Part of the issue with the 76ers is roster construction. They're built around Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. You've got a center and 2 PF as your 3 best players. That spacing is going to be horrendous. Put him on a team with actual shooters, where he can play some minutes as a small ball 5, and he could shine."
"TT was playing 25 to 30 minutes a game in those final series, Ben Wallace was playing 40. He couldn't play 40 if he had to chase Draymond Green around in transition."
"The issue is that the Sixers think the rest of the NBA still think Simmons is a top talent and the plain fact is that he is not. He is a better Draymond Green that has been masquerading as a lesser Lebron James for years. He should not have been making All star games and the fact that the sixers had to take him off the floor in crunch time ended the myth that he is a top player. You cannot be a top player and need to be taken out of the most important time of the game. That is just so obvious it cannot really be debated. So now it is obvious that he is overpaid (against the cap, I dont care about the BS argument that 'all players are overpaid', spare me please.) If the sixers want someone to take on the contract, they will need to sweeten the pot, not the other way around. Not saying Simmons isn't a really good player that would be a good piece to have on your team, he is not a 170Million dollar player. That is the reality. Those that say, 'if he learns how to shoot', he has had 5 full seasons to practice and has not. Why would you want a 170Millon dollar player that has put more effort to be a kardashian than he has to make himself the best player in the game?"
"why? it’s a really dumb reach lol. this sub is getting bad. like two weeks ago “wHaT iF nBA pLaYeRs wErE tHeIr nAmEs!” had like 5K upvotes and it was just some lazy shit like photoshopping Draymond to be green.   there’s potential for this to be funny, but OP just had to make a reach about two players, that were in college 8 years after the song and didn’t even play each other— this is just lame imo. Jerome isn’t even the player’s first name, it’s Ty. let’s not reward garbage like this"
"Ngl, I didn’t think I would be comparing Draymond Green to Madonna when I got up this morning."
"To carry an injury riddled team (in development mode) about one draymond green missed layup from playoffs (thus turning 2 lotto picks to moody and kuminga). After breaking the league over the previous 7 years. He owns lebron. He owns KD. He owns harden. I see the argument for any of those guys, but in their head to head matchups he’s come out on top year after year. Only top 5 player that has not been splashed in the face by Curry is Giannis. Looking forward to that finals matchup this year."
But what if Draymond Green punched Jordan in the dick?
How much more valuable is Ben Simmons than Draymond Green? How many 1st round picks would the Warriors have to throw in for that to be a fair trade?
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Yeah he needs to go tell Draymond Green, Steve Kerr, and Gregg Popovich this because he seems to have figured out something that basketball geniuses havent “figured out” in 19 years 😂"
[This article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/draymond-green-records-nbas-first-triple-double-scoring-fewer-than-10-points/) says that Draymond was the first player in history to do it scoring less than 10 points. So given that it hasn't happened since I'm guessing Draymond is the only one.
"nah i disagree, if you look at the play again, durant and green had shadowed both the left and right hand side both zoning at the freethrow line. Thats exactly why hill was open for the cut cause draymond literally ignored him and why Thompson had to foul. Have a look again. If you wanted him to pull up for the 3 against curry then I guess you had a point but there waa no way he was gonna be able to drive."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"It actually is for the most part.  I remember Draymond being pissed to a pretty ridiculous level one year when MSG decided to do no music for the first half to have basketball in its [""purest form"".](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/03/06/madison-square-garden-silence-draymond-green-knicks-warriors)  &gt;“It was pathetic. It was ridiculous. It changed the flow of the game, it changed everything,” said Green. “You get so used to playing the game a certain way, to completely change that, to me I think it was disrespectful to everyone from [senior VP of entertainment] Michael Levine to [Warriors executive] Rick Welts and all these people who have done these things to change the game from an entertainment perspective and give the game a great vibe. That’s complete disrespect. You advance things in the world to make it better, you don’t go back to what was bad. It’s like, computers can do anything for us. It’s like going back to paper.  &gt;“They need to trash that, because that’s exactly what it was.”"
"LeBron James, Steph Curry and Draymond Green honestly.  Draymond already did a good job on inside and might be another controversial head who could back it up, while having a better understanding of the current game than Chuck, Shaq and Kenny.  Steph because he seems to have a great understanding of the game, same reason with LeBron. It's always a blast to hear players who understand the game to a high degree talk about it. Kobe was another example of that. I really loved listening to him when he talked about different parts of the game, and especially tactic."
"That is not what ""the exception proves the rule"" means. This is a pet peef of mine (singular of peeves is peef). ""The exception proves the rule"" means that an exception in one case means the rule (as in a human written law) is the norm. It doesn't apply to the laws of physics. You wouldn't say ""this apple fell up, but apples are the exception that proves the rule of gravity"". It applies to for example a sign that says ""you have to stop at this intersection"" which implies you don't have to stop at other intersections without the sign. There, the exception proves the rule.  The fact is you don't need a god tier big man to win a championship if you have Draymond Green and Steph curry"
"Dejounte murray, draymond green, mason plumlee, lonzo,"
"Lamelo, Dejounte Murray, Draymond Green, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis, Ben Simmons 😖"
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
Translation for the nephews: Imagine Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green going to federal prison with 17 other players for PPP fraud.
"He is the Russell Westbrook of defense. His MVP season especially, he broke advanced stats. But would you really say he had the best season ever?   Gobert’s team creates a fundamentally flawed system that boosts his regular season stats, and gets exposed in the playoffs every time. While maybe any one of his DPOY awards could be argued as deserved, he is racking them up and could very well become the most decorated defender of ALL TIME. It’s clearly time to stop giving them until he can actually show his worth in a meaningful game.   There is clearly a problem with how the awards are given if Rudy fucking Gobert has more accolades than Duncan, KG, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green, Dennis Rodman, Mutumbo, or Kawhi. 6/7 of these players have led their teams to championships with defense. Gobert is a class below."
"True but it is an underselling story, probably becuase the average age here is getting lower and lower (or im just getting old) but some of these names were big back then. Tony allen going to prison is crazy. A similar active player would be like Rudy Gobert or Draymond green going to federal prison"

"Diaw was a better shooter and post scorer than Green, while being an equal passer, but Draymond is faster and demanded a bigger offensive role even though Diaw was more skilled.  Draymond is much better on defense."
So far you’ve got three with Boris Diaw/Kyle Anderson/Draymond Green as being similar in archetype- what other two players would complete the starting five in that same mold?
"Draymond ""Gamebred"" Green"
Draymond green as well. Always love when he's on Inside the NBA as a guest commentator
"lol, I think thats also a combiantion of the ncaa being so exploitative now it would be common not to play through injuries or even just spend the year training. LSU made a lot of money off of him, got on national tv when they wouldn't have, the coach and all probably made big cash. Simmons got to be 'showcased' when he would've been a no one pick had he not set foot in LSU.  Definitely can rargue abotu his headspace, but college basketball is a sham for these top top recruits. STeven adams even talked about how he was curious about college and they wouldnt even let him take real courses, he was essentially an employee to produce basketball.  T-macs criticism may be more valid, but its also an 18 year old who may not know how to act as well.  The real criticism is the mental hold up or lack of progress on his shot thats apparent and culiminated in the playoffs last year.  I give him credit for take ownership and pride in his defense, the least celebrated part fo the game and finding ways to contribute as he did in that  game, but ultimately that shot and his inability to get over that hump for wahtever reason will shift his trajectory from star to more aroudn draymond green, an all star level player who finds ways to contribute to winning with the right peices around him but not someone you can build around."
"&gt;because they dont allow current players to speak this freely in America or a lot more would.  Well when players like Lebron, Kyrie, Draymond Green, etc. keep saying dumbass shit about vaccines, why are you surprised?"
Finals winner - Bucks   MVP - Luka  ROY - Jaylen Green (he's a future mvp too)   DPOY - Ben Simmons (if he gets traded) if not then Draymond
Could the Nets win the title if they added Ben Simmons and Draymond Green? Yes. Yes they could. 16-0 in the playoffs? Probably.
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
"It makes me uncomfortable because nobody really knows anything about Rich Paul. If he is as bad as is being made out to be, you would not have players like Draymond Green and AD joining Klutch.   Also, I have no clue whether he is the only person handling every player and their contracts either. The likelihood is he has lawyers and other agents in his agency who handle all intricate details that he doesn’t have the best grasp on. I don’t like or dislike Klutch, but there’s a lot of assumptions thrown around that makes me uncomfortable."
"Draymond Green is like an upgraded version of Simmons in all aspects except Simmons is a better ball handler. Even from a defensive perspective, Draymond anchored some top defences while Simmons is debatably not even the best defensive player on his own team."
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."

"and then the ones who should be about the public health of our communities, lebron james, not just refuse to speak out for it, but support nutshites like draymond green in their asinine takes."
draymond green is a max guy. Do you think ayton doesnt at least have potential to reach green level?
"Lakers superstar LeBron James recently said that it is everyone’s personal decision whether or not to get the vaccine. Those comments didn’t sit well with Abdul-Jabbar.  “I’m a huge fan of LeBron James, both as one of the greatest basketball players ever and as a humanitarian who cares about social injustice,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar on his Substack. I have written his praises many times in the past and undoubtedly will in the future. I admire him and have affection for him. But this time LeBron is just plain wrong — and his being wrong could be deadly, especially to the Black community.”  James, 36, commended Golden State Warriors titan Draymond Green over a powerful statement he shared about the vaccine, which also promoted personal choice.  However, Abdul-Jabbar was not fond of James signing off on the comments from Green.  “After Golden State Warrior Andrew Wiggins received criticism for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine for personal reasons, his teammate Draymond Green said the public needs to ‘honor’ that decision: ‘There is something to be said for people’s concerns about something that’s being pressed so hard,’ he stated,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “‘Why are you pressing this so hard? You have to honor people’s feelings and their own personal beliefs.’ To which LeBron responded that he ‘couldn’t have said it better myself.’ Actually, it couldn’t have been said worse.  “On the surface, it appears that Draymond and LeBron are arguing for the American ideal of individual freedom of choice. But they offer no arguments in support of it, nor do they define the limits of when one person’s choice is harmful to the community. They are merely shouting, ‘I’m for freedom.’ We’re all for freedom, but not at the expense of others nor if it damages the country. That’s why we mandate seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, car insurance, education for our children. For example, seatbelt compliance is at 88% in the U.S., but that 12% that doesn’t comply results in 47% of car accident fatalities (17,000) and costs U.S. employers $5 billion a year, and those costs are passed on to us. They made the choice, but we survivors are left to deal with the grief and the price tag.”  The NBA icon also bashed Washington Wizards star Bradley Beal for his poor reasoning on not getting vaccinated. Abdul-Jabbar took the time to rip apart Green’s logic as well.  “The only support for Draymond’s statement is his belief that when people ‘press hard’ there’s something inherently wrong with their opinion,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “There is no logic to that statement. If I press hard against institutional racism, if I press hard against police brutality, if I press hard against recent laws making it harder for minorities to vote, if I press hard against child porn, if I press hard in support of MeToo am I automatically wrong? On the contrary, the passion of those urging vaccines might suggest there’s some urgency to their opinion. That the situation is serious and we need to take immediate action to protect people. That thousands are dying every day, mostly among the unvaccinated. That the Black community, where vaccine hesitancy is high, are dying at a disproportionately higher rate than whites. That publicly talking about honoring opinions that contribute to their deaths is irresponsible.  “The country also mandates against drunk driving, ‘pressing hard’ against the freedom to drive under the influence.  We do that because drunk driving kills 11,000 Americans every year and costs us more than $44 billion dollars. Vaccine deniers and those who want to ‘honor’ them are like drunk drivers who are convinced they’re okay to drive. When they make it home without an accident, that means they were right. Until they aren’t. Which is why 97% of COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated.”  The 74-year-old closed out his piece by sharing a strong analogy, putting the onus on celebrities to help spearhead the rescue mission within the pandemic.  “I think of the situation like those old fire brigades when people stood in a line passing buckets of water to save their neighbor’s house from burning to the ground,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “Maybe some people were afraid to join the line. But when the town leaders joined in, it encouraged others to do their duty. Today’s celebrities and athletes are like those town leaders. You either join the line to save your neighbor’s home, or you stand by and let it burn because you don’t owe them anything.”  While Abdul-Jabbar is extremely adored in NBA circles by his colleagues, he may receive some flack for going against some of today’s faces of the league. He recently spoke about the possibility of James surpassing him on the all-time scoring list."
"LeBron agreed with Draymond saying that what Wiggins was doing (looking for every last excuse to take a proven safe vaccine in the middle of a raging pandemic, before finally relenting and getting the shot the other day) was akin to a woman missing work due to labor. Ted fucking Cruise then used that as ammo to help spread his rethoric. Let that sink in a little.  I mean damn, I love LeBron but sometimes he uses his stature in all the wrong ways. This and the China incident were not good, he makes mistakes and he should own up to it just like he demands others in positions of influence and power to own up to their mistakes when it impacts him. And I'm glad that people with influence in his community like Jabbar are using their own platforms to point that out because people are far more likely to listen to him than regular Joes like me and all the other people on Reddit and other platforms who have been *extremely* disappointed in LeBron, Green, Beal, and so forth."

"Not sure why you believe that when it took a Draymond green suspension &amp; Andrew Bogut injury just for the Cavs to squeeze buy in 2016. You don’t seem to want to admit how good that Warriors team was. They were top 5 on offense &amp; defense, had 3 all stars, and broke a previously untouchable regular season win record for a reason. They didn’t need KD. They were gonna win those titles whether he joined or not as long as they were healthy."
"The explanation is that Curry and KD are close to each other in greatness. So obviously their playoff numbers will be similar. But the sample size is also much smaller in the playoffs. They play way more minutes together than they do apart. If they’re both playing 36+ minutes per game in the playoffs, there is going to be very time for them to play individually.  Obviously the reason for the regular season discrepancy is that the team built for Steph Curry, not KD. For example, when Steve Kerr became head coach he had Curry start to play off-ball much more. He had Bogut and later Draymond Green facilitate a lot of the time. This allowed Curry to run through off ball screens and get open for catch and shoot 3s. You wouldn’t need to get a playmaking big for KD since he isn’t a point guard/playmaker. You could just use your traditional PG for that.  Idk why KD fans get so butthurt any time someone suggests Curry might be better than KD. It’s pretty obvious Curry is better. Curry won a ring without KD. KD couldn’t win without Curry. Curry is the ONLY unanimous MVP in history. Curry literally changed the game. No one was taking hundreds of 3s in a season until he started to and showed that it could be a powerful weapon at high volume."
"sure, hes gonna be good of course but theres no real correlation with the change in defensive rules and efficiency. and even if there was its not like he's gonna get a bucket every damn possession. Shaqs playoff career high is 46. His ts% in 2001 was 56.4. Curry had 65.9 that year at 28ppg. Durant had 29ppg with 68.3ts%. KObe had 29ppg on 55.2ts%. If you just look at scoring curry and kd are clearly better. Thats not counting assists or off ball movement. Curry and kd still win in assists. Curry is goat off ball player. Shaq is frozen. They're simply gonna be outscored from three. Kobe was the best 3 point shooter on that team and he had less volume and 3p% than the Draymond fucking Green"
"Which is exactly what Adam Silver actually said.   &gt;""I don't want to overreact to the term because, as I said earlier, people end up twisting themselves into knots avoiding the use of the word 'owner,'""   &gt;""But we moved away from that term years ago with the league. We call our team owners 'Governors' of the team and 'alternate Governors. So I think it makes sense. As I said, I don't want to overreact ... but I'm sensitive to it, and I think to the extent that teams are moving away from the term, we'll stick with using Governor.""   &gt;""Players have gone both ways. I think a few players have actually spoken out and said the greatest thing that ever happened was when Michael Jordan was able to call himself an owner.""  &gt;""But, of course, Draymond Green has been very public about the fact that we should be moving away from the term ... and I completely respect that.""  So nothing has really changed, except for fans now getting upset about the term ""Governors"" for some reason. In other words, the only people policing the terms are fans mad at imaginary people policing terms. Lol."
"&gt; This is probably statistics noise, but a case can be made that late first round picks get picked up by play-off teams, thus landing in a place where they have a better chance at developing than say.. Minnesota or Sacramento (sorry, I had to).  From a Warriors perspective (more than a playoff team over the last several years) it's a pretty interesting take. Look at who we picked:  We have Jordan Poole at 28th who is looking to become a real NBA contributor and a possible 6th man of the year candidate. But the more interesting thing is guys like Jordan Bell (38) who is garbage now but was useful for us in the WCF and Finals in his rookie year. Damion Jones (30) who was never useful in the playoffs but definitely had a window where he was looking like he could be a solid guy for us. Patrick McCaw (38) who was clearly a playoff contributor when KD was hurt he had to start many deep playoff games and Finals in his rookie year and delivered. Useless now wherever he is. Kevon Looney (30) is our starting Center and was our best center option against James Harden and other teams who switched everything making traditional centers unusable. Draymond Green (35) don't need to say much there. My point being the guys that were pretty good for us, left and did nothing. I can't think of any of these guys doing anything beyond what they did for us while contending."
"Sure, but Governor is the legally accurate term and has been used by the NBA in their official documents for decades. Nothing has changed with the terminology.   People like you only started clinging to ""owners"" because Draymond Green said something about it once. Lol."
"I know Siakam stock has fallen around here but ""at worse a great starter"" is a pretty low bar for a guy who made All NBA second team, won a title, and dropped 32 on draymond green in his first ever finals game."
"&gt; but if you look around the league and who wins championships, the part that teams struggle with is getting the superstar  No it isn't.  The part that teams struggle with is putting a good enough roster around that superstar to have a shot at a ring.  That's why the Cavs couldn't even get there with LeBron goddamn James the first time around. Why the Rockets never won a championship with James Harden, why the Thunder couldn't do it when they had Durant.  The Warriors got their first (in recent memory) with Steph Curry AND Klay Thompson AND Draymond Green and an extremely fucking solid roster all the way down.  Having ""a superstar"" isn't enough."
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
Draymond Green even believes he's smarter than Fauci. He's so dumb
"I think Russ is actually a pretty bad pick and role player. He was at .71 PPP as a pick and roll ballhandler last season which is pretty terrible. There will be some flashy plays but I don't expect the Russ/AD pick and role to be that great. I'm interested to see what the rotations will look like.  The Lakers just haven't been a good half-court offence since LeBron came there. The bottom half of the league the last 2 seasons. I think almost entirely that has been down to team building. For W/E the Lakers have gone away from shooting and always brought more playmaking. Russ will push the pace and get the team moving, but Russ is not a half-court player so I think the Lakers will struggle in the half-court again.  I dunno that have more shooting than people think. LeBron is pretty much dead bang league average. Everyone has a 4 that stroke. AD for whatever reason is thought of as a stretch big, but he shoot 28% from 3 last season and has a lower career 3 point % than Draymond Green. I don't know that you AD taking more 3s.   Monk, Ellington, Melo. Those guys are good shooters. But, you are in a situation where you only have 2 good defenders on the court with the big 3. Or you play Ariza, THT and another big and you giving shooting. In the last 2 seasons, the Lakers played no bad defenders other than Drummond.LeBron and AD are going to have a big burden on defence but they are capable of carrying.   I'm not that high on adding Russ to the Lakers, but I could be proven wrong. He's not that guy I would have wanted to be paired with AD. Is AD's role going to even be big enough to be an MVP calibre player? I'm not sure that Russ is capable of not having a super high usage. And, if he doesn't have a high usage I'm not really sure what he is going to be giving the team. He just doesn't do much for like a decade when he doesn't have the ball. Maybe this is the year he is going to set screens and cut so we will see."
"Listening to recent comments by NBA players has popped the old Charles Barkley quote, ""I'm not a role model"" into my head. If more people relied on the opinions of experts than the opinions of guys like LeBron or Draymond Green on things like public health, we'd be in a much better situation."

"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
"Draymond Green is hella dumb, but gets treated like some intellectual. Not just here, but in media as well."
"I think that his offense is just as amazing as people on this sub think, what he gets a pass for is his defense   A lot of people cite his on/off DRTGs to say he's a decent defender while ignoring that he basically shares his minutes with Draymond Green  Ja was targeting him quite a lot in that game and so do a lot of teams when they play the Warriors"
"That’s better at least but from what I can gather Simmons and Embiid still even get along on a personal level (well, maybe not after this week’s events). The “chemistry” issues we’re seeing are pure basketball related ones: Simmons doesn’t shoot outside of 10 feet, and when Embiid is in the game he demands the rights to the painted area (as well he should, given that he’s the best post scorer in basketball). When Embiid is out of the game or missing the game due to injury or load management, Simmons is actually kind of decent scoring; it’s only when the two are on the floor at the same time, which of course happens all the time in the playoffs, that Simmons shrivels up into nothing in the offensive half court. Simmons has even said as much himself.  The point here is that the Trailblazers do not have the “problem” of having a dominant low post player at all. Far from it. They could probably even get away with moving him to the 4 and using him like a faster, higher scoring version of Draymond Green depending on who/what they’d be giving up in a 3 team trade (if it’s McCollum I’d probably just keep Simmons as a guard). And in the offing he would more than likely have a huge effect on that defense which was not just bad, not just worst in basketball, but historically awful.  TBH what I see with Simmons is years of the team sitting there with this gross incompatibility and just sitting with it. From what I gather Simmons has really been on the outs since the Harden deal blew up last year, but it’s really been at least 3 years now since people around the league have said that those two guys don’t mesh well, not in a personalities sense, in a game sense. You wouldn’t put Dame and Steph in the same lineup, no matter how nice those guys are. This is the same and arguably worse since there’s a lot more real estate deep than under the basket."
why did draymond green ever became respected by /r/nba again..?
"Bring up Boris Diaw and how underrated he was every chance you get when watching a game   “That was a good play by Draymond Green, reminds me of Boris Diaw, one of the most underrated player ever”   “Sure Karl Anthony Towns put up 27 this game, but he’s no Boris Diaw with all the little things Boris did to affect winning.”"
"Exactly. 2016 and 2017 Cavs were insane trams, just look at the 2017 offensive stats for that team in the playoffs. They were great teams.  They also beat the 73-9 warriors in a game 7 where draymond green had 30+ points on 7/7 from three…"
"Like how LeBron has AD? A very similar player to Embiid? And often another center on the floor too? Lol  Last season Lopez shot 34% from 3, Embiid shot 38%.  Simmons cannot be a point guard on a high level playoff team, he's Draymond Green, not LeBron or Giannis."
Draymond Green
"Great off ball defenders need to do the following:  - help on dribble drives - close out on shooters - chuck &amp; bump cutters - jump passing lanes - communicate &amp; coordinate with teammates - protect the rim - not foul or bite on fakes - be able to switch onto different types of players and hold their own  - watch tape so they are familiar with their oppositions plays and tendencies - play defense with an ""offensive"" mindset  To me the answer is clearly Draymond Green."
Draymond Green was not in the movie.
Breaking news: Draymond Green is dumb
"You are a fucking idiot if you take health advice from Draymond Green or Lebron james. Not to mention Kyrie Irving.  I'll say what needed to be said, im asian, Indonesian. But for god sake african americans, not everything is white conspiracy politics propaganda that you think always happens.   The world is bigger than that, you might be surprised about how big the world is. You are not above society, dont let that virus take ur loved ones to make you realize you might be not as smart as you think you are."
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."
"Wow, this must be really triggering for all you reddit commies. Good for Draymond that he's not going to bully his teammates over their health choices. You guys have all gone insane. You want to force every single person to take a medical treatment against their will and see nothing wrong with it. You're sick bullies without any integrity. I don't know much about Draymond Green off the court, but at least he seems to understand something about freedom and American values."
"For one, the players travel constantly, and there are dozens of opportunities to spread it every day. One person spreads to several, those spread to several more, it increases exponentially and one person's impact (especially with the NBA routine) is significant.  They also have a chance to cause breakthrough cases, spreading it through vaccinated players. The chance is much smaller obviously, but still there. The chance of the vaccine causing harm is still beyond miniscule compared to the potential harm of any spread through those vaccinated.  There's also the position of these athletes as prominent figures, both in people who look up to them (of whom there are a lot) and the racist idiots who are psyched to be able to post NBA players agreeing with them so they can look less racist (see: Ted Cruz posting Draymond Green). Every influential voice spreading misinformation about the vaccine is harmful.  Last, these guys are just idiots and this is a forum for discussing NBA players. All throughout NBA history we've talked about players doing dumb shit, so even if it didn't have a negative impact, there's nothing abnormal about NBA fans calling out the stupid shit NBA players do. NBA players participating in a movement that is literally killing people deserve to be mocked. Why *shouldn't* we talk about those representing the worst of us during a historic global crisis?"

"Lol. Pennies on the dollar? Some of the nephews on here really overreact to the off the court drama.   Ben is still going. He is still a top 5 defensive player in the league. He is an elite playmaker.   A 25-year old who is going to give you 15-8-8 a night while being a defensive POY candidate every year?   He is still a highly sought out player by other teams.   But nobody is giving up an all star player and four first round picks for him now. Last year they might have gotten that package.   But with his playoff meltdown and diva attitude, Philly has to lower their asking price.   But pennies on the dollar? Not a chance. Every team in the NBA would make an attempt if that was the case.   Simmons will be fine if he can go to a team where he doesn’t have to be a primary scorer. Draymond Green is a terrible shooter and he is going to the hall of fame. Simmons can do that. Not every player needs to average 20 points and be an alpha male scorer. Do people say Draymond sucks and is worthless because he can’t shoot?  Switch it around and would there be this much downgrading him? What if there was a player averaging 30-8-8 per game but was a horrible defender?   We would talk about his flaw. But it wouldn’t define him completely as a player."
"Yes. Positioning, communication, anticipating plays and not falling for fakes are all together more important than sheer athleticism. Prime Gasol was so good at these things.   Another good example would be Draymond Green in a small ball line-up. There are a lot more athletic guys than him, but his defensive BBIQ is incredible."

"Draymond also has been accused of harassing a woman along with his boys and beating the shit out of her friend. Draymond is a piece of shit all around.  From Wikipedia: “On July 10, 2016, Green was arrested for assault in East Lansing, Michigan.[153][154][155] The night prior, he had a confrontation with Michigan State defensive back Jermaine Edmondson. The arresting report cites Green went to Rick's bar and had bumped into Edmondson. After a verbal exchange, two associates of Green allegedly choked Edmondson and his girlfriend. The next night, both Green and Edmondson attended Conrad's Grill in East Lansing where Edmondson confronted Green about the incident the night before. Green allegedly poked Edmondson in the chest and either slapped or punched him in the face. The arresting officers stated that Green had a blood alcohol level of .10 and admitted to slapping Edmondson and asked to apologize to the victim. After posting a $200 bail, Green was released four hours after the arrest.”"
"Draymond Green may be rich as fuck, but he is uneducated"
"One of the saddest part about this is that there are some kids out there that genuinely believe this is some amazing analogy and that Draymond Green is making a cogent argument.   Please learn to think critically. Like forget who's saying it, I don't care if it's Draymond, LeBron, or a McDonald cashier. Think about what he is actually saying.   This guy is comparing getting a vaccine shot for a virus that has killed 700k+ Americans to a wife giving labour.   Are you fucking kidding me?"

"&gt; It might convince members of the public to get vaccinated. This isn’t just about Andrew Wiggins,  okay, so this whole thing isn't about Wiggins anymore, you're saying this is about advertising the vaccines. You somehow believe that Draymond Green telling people ""everyone should get the vaccine"" in a Golden State Warriors press conference is going to convince anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists, ""personal-freedom"" libertarian/conservative to go get vaccinated.   i'm sorry, Draymond telling these people to ""please trust Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J"" isn't going to work out like you think it will. These are not issues that Draymond Green can solve, these are much bigger issues relating to a general distrust in the federal government after decades of austerity/means-testing/defunding of social programs, not to mention their distrust of big pharma as well.   To suggest Draymond isn't being a ""moral human being"" because of this is just laughable"
"Draymond Green [did this stuff religiously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5DEZexz-sg) until he got suspended in the NBA Finals for it. Afterwards: not so much. Enforcement does work, they just have to be consistent, which: I'll believe it when I see it."

"Would love to see video of Dame doing that regularly, because I watch the Blazers and he doesn't have a leg kick in his kit. He's one of the poster children for jumping back into a chasing defender to get a call but he doesn't kick out his leg.   The name that comes to my mind for that is Draymond Green."

"Big Billy Bob was closer to a Rodman/Draymond green combo than Rudy Gobert.  He was an insanely agile, playmaking defensive big. He didn't score much relative to the volume scoring players of his time. But he was the ultimate team player.  Rudy is not the best comparison. Since Rudy is HUGE and Bill was undersized. Think Ben Wallace but without the muscle.  But there's really no other player like him. Draymond/Rodman are the closest but even then."
Draymond Green punching the air right now
"Offense rating is very shaky data. Steph should have the highest offense rating by leaps without a doubt but his time with Wiseman on the floor completely lowers it.   Wiggins and Oubre have bad offense rating accumulating from playing with 2nd unit whereas someone like Draymond exclusively plays with Curry based on Kerr's rotations. Neither were great at leading the 2nd unit. There's also the fact that in January the team played like complete trash and that kinda weighs certain lineups down more than others.   In terms of how they looked as a starting lineup:  Curry/ Green / Wiggins without Kelly on 658 minutes is 11.86.   Curry/ Green/ Kelly without Wiggins on 205 minutes is 12.77.   Both played fine in starting lineups (without Wiseman) but once you put either one or both of them with the 2nd unit, their net rating (especially offense rating) plummets like crazy. One of the reasons JTA's numbers look really good is he avoided the first part of the season and shared it with a much better 2nd unit leader in Poole. Without Wiseman:   Kelly/ Curry / Green lineups without Wiseman / Wiggins is 13.68 on 134 minutes.   Here's a surprising one: Wiseman without Curry /Green/ Wiggins / Kelly is a 14.95 on 82 minutes. Or 11.05 when we use Curry/ Green/ Wiseman/ Kelly lineups without Wiggins."
"You’d think people would appreciate serendipity more, considering Draymond Green."
"2011 Game 1 Starting 5: Monta Ellis, Steph Curry, Dorrell Wright, David Lee, Andris Biedrins   2021 Game 1 Starting 5: Steph Curry, Jordan Poole, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney   This would actually be a really fun game.  2011/2012 Steph Curry was one year away from breaking out and becoming All Star caliber.  Monta Ellis and Jordan Poole are both high octane offensive guards with questionable defense.  Dorell Wright was a decent 3 and D wing that would match up well with Wiggins.  David Lee and Draymond Green are opposites in that David Lee was a fantastic offensive player with questionable D as opposed to Draymond's elite D and questionable offense.  Biendrins and Looney are both decent defensive players that don't add a whole lot offensively.   I will rock with this years team because it has the far superior version of Steph.  Wiggins is a better player than Wright was, though Wright was a better shooter and would far better now than he did then I think.  A lot of 2011 Warriors offense came from Ellis and Lee who were not 3 point shooters, so it would be interesting to see if they could score enough points to keep up."
"Your youth can’t lead a team. You’re a legit contender because you have Steph Curry and Draymond Green. Plus Iggy, Wiggins, Klay, Otto, etc. Take away the vets and y’all are the worst team in the league. The only starting quality young player is maybe Poole."
1. The Bucks are pretty good. 2. It kind of feels like the Lakers won't be in the conference finals. 3. Draymond Green still looks like he is smelling a fart.

Draymond Green is one of the most overrated players in NBA history. Dude looks like Bambi on ice out there.
"&gt; You literally compared them to the 2015 squad and said ""I think this unit has that potential""  Which is really not unreasonable.  Steph is better now than he was then.  Draymond Green is supposed to be more aggressive again this season. Klay will be coming back.  And the rest of the team is a bunch of young guys who are still on the rise instead of late-career veterans reaching the end of theirs.  Jordan Poole can give us what we had from Barbosa and BRush. Wiggins is as good as or better than Barnes. We don't have quite what SDot was for us but Looney is as much of a contributor as Speights. We're weaker at C but I like Wiseman's potential with the coach who taught Jokic how to play and the mentorship of Iguodala."
Screw Draymond Green
"The west just had a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis as the 7 seed, and a team with Steph Curry and Draymond Green completely out of the playoffs."
MVP: Giannis  DPOY: Draymond  ROTY: Jalen Green  6MOY: Rose  MIP: Herro  COTY: Ty Lue
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"
"MVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Draymond Green  ROY: Josh Giddey  6MOY: Tyler Herro  MIP: Jordan Poole  COY: Chris Finch  I don't think Poole is going to get 6MOY because he's probably gonna start for half of the season with Klay out, and still might start after he comes back depending on what he does this year"
"MVP: James Harden   DPOY: ~~Ben Simmons~~ Draymond Green   ROY: Cade Cunningham   6MOY: Jalen Brunson   MIP: Michael Porter Jr.   COY: Jason Kidd  One homer take, and one spicy take involving the Mavs. I said what I said."
Such a shame because Ben is already so damn good as is. If he just shoot at an average NBA player's rate he is a top 5 player EASY. He would be Draymond Green on steroids.
Draymond Green in shambles
"Speaking for just the 538 model here, and it's that [they're not confident Klay will be back to top form](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/).  It also looks like [Curry has a wider variance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/stephen-curry/), possibly in part due to the change in the rules for drawing fouls.  &gt; We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 **RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player**. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with **only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives**, among the team’s projected rotation players."
That’s like asking why draymond green isn’t carrying the warriors in scoring. Ben isn’t that type of player and the fact that the coaches or gm haven’t realized that is mind blowing.
"I don't know about the plausibility of if this would actually go through or not but no lie I love the idea of Simmons just infinitely spamming passes to the warrior shooters and never having to take a shot again, and draymond green roaring around in Minnesota and pumping people up And becoming the big brother the teapups have always needed."
"Draymond Green is a fucking idiot, also is water still wet? Tonight at 11"
"oh boy not like the millions of viewers saw simmons lack of aggression show itself this series, something which was on his draft report and damn near every coach and player he's played with has asked him to address  but oh no it's doc rivers fault this man is a 6'10 draymond green who refuses to shoot"
Man....guess Draymond Green was totally right that Sport news will talking about Ben all day soon
"Kind of funny that if you look up Draymond Green on YouTube, his new show has clickbait titles, and discuss nothing about actual ball."
Naaa we have also further learned that Draymond Green is an ignorant tool.
Alternative headline: Draymond Green pleads for show where he can learn about basketball
"""Why can't people focus on real basketball issues? Find a new slant."" - Klutch Client, Draymond Green, probably"
"Good point but let’s be real Ben Simmons is pretty much a more athletic draymond green at this point with better passing. If you’re expecting anymore from him after 6 years you either need a better head coach, analytics department or a better team. Rip the process"
r/nba 3 hours ago: Draymond Green is right. The NBA is all about drama.   r/nba right now: INJECT THIS RIGHT INTO MY ASS
"Yeah. It's 2021. I'm not a young man but my son is 19. Not only does he NOT own a TV, he doesn't want one. You can get whatever content you want on the internet. Draymond Green should stop worrying about what's on the ""TV""."
"(agreeing) - Much like with most things, great content takes time to produce. If I made a one hour special showing how Draymond Green carves up an offense, it would be as popular or less than one tweet from these ESPN stories. People want better content but still choose the junk."
"I 100% agree with Draymond Green with his sentiments.   I also though feel like damn, we as a whole demand this clickbait news. And I too an wondering his status with the Warriors, as you know it's in the back of your head like ""....is he going to be a Warrior at the end of the season???"""
ESPN: “This just in: Draymond Green says Ben Simmons does not want to play for the 76ers.”
HEY DRAYMOND GREEN --&gt; ALL THE BEST BASKETBALL SHIT IS ON YOUTUBE
Did I just agree with Draymond Green for the first time? He makes a damn good point.
"Just in: Draymond Green has been fined $25,000 for tampering. Tune in to ESPN for the latest on how this effects his legacy."
"&gt; “I wouldn’t necessarily say it killed my pride because at the end of the day I knew that there was only one person in this league that can talk anything to me about anything basketball,” Green says. “And that’s LeBron. That was the only guy who could really talk shit about accomplishments or the game of basketball in this league.”  From [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/10/18/22728821/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-nba-2021-22-season), ultimately"
"Didn't you know? Green is the only one who could possibly have anchored the defense for the Warriors, oh hey Bogut, you managed that as well without KD huh.   And no I'm not saying Bogut is a basketball genius, that would be as dumb as saying Draymond Green is."
"Thanks for doing tiers, way better. I'll do it too.

"Seriously. Rip Hamilton would be a better version of Klay Thompson. Rasheed Wallace would be a better version of KAT. Ben Wallace Would be a better version of Draymond Green. Chauncey Billups would be a better version of James Harden. Tayshaun Prince would be a better version of Ben Simmons. Don’t forget they beat a team of Kobe, Shaq, Karl Malone, and Gary Payton all in their primes."
" When Draymond says that fighting for a play-in game does not motivate him, because he wants to win every game he plays in, at some level you got to contrast with the 2019-2020 year where he clearly wasn't interested and call BS  &gt; No. I want to win every game I play in because I hate losing. That s*** really bothers me.   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/04/02/draymond-green-no-play-in-game-is-going-to-motivate-me-at-this-point-of-my-career/  Yes, it may bother you, but you clearly don't respond to every game the same way, Dray. We know. Play-ins matter more than the bulk of the 2019-2020 season games."
"So what defines a role player? Being a scorer? Draymond was crucial as a DPOY, game-breaking anchor. If Green is a role player, then Thompson is too, being an incredibly impactful facilitator and defensive superstar is not a ""role"". Jrue Holiday isn't a role player, neither is Draymond, not scoring well =/= being a role player..."
"Is this you, LeBron, from July 2015?  https://www.instagram.com/p/42M-exFCOt/  “It wasn’t until late 2015 when fans learned just how into wine the best basketball player in the world was. Golden State Warriors forward and current (not so) arch-nemesis to LeBron, Draymond Green, made a bet with the King regarding the result of a then upcoming college football matchup between Green’s alum, Michigan State, and LeBron’s favorite college team, Ohio State. The bet? $2500 worth of wine. Michigan State would win the game and LeBron followed through on his bet, sending Green some 2010 Silver Oak Cabernet, which retails for $110 (so he sent him roughly 22 bottles of the stuff?).”"
"Actually I think players are worth it just for being high level shooters.  Davis Bertans and Joe Harris got around $80m and they are basically OTP's.     And regardless, Jaren doesn't stink on defense, nor does he have to play Center.  He most likely will always be a part-time wing.  Defensively he has a fouling problem, and that's pretty much the extent of it.  Many eventually great defenders had comparable foul rates when they were young (Tyson Chandler, Draymond Green, Ron Artest).  It's not reasonable to expect that to continue."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"&gt; when things get hard, he's not really interested?  Our 2020 roster wasn't just a ""hard"" situation it was an impossible one, Draymond and Looney were literally the only guys playing from the 2019 squad, the rest were mostly G leaguers and Rookies.   Jordan Poole, Mulder, Lee, Burks, GR3, Chriss, Spellman, Smailagic, Jacob Evans... You're delusional if you think there was even the slightest chance to even make the playoffs, even if Green played the best season of his career."
"Draymond Green, no question."
You should be more worried about your own team:  * Steph Curry has missed 115 games in the last five years due to various injuries  * Klay Thompson has missed each of the last two years and won't be back until December or January  * Wiseman missed half of last season and is at least going to miss the first couple months of this season with an injury  * Otto Porter Jr. has missed 120 games over the last three seasons with injuries  * Kevon Looney has missed 56 games in the last two years with injuries  * Andre Iguodala is older than anyone on the Lakers (which is saying something)  * Draymond Green has missed 47 games over the last 3 years with injuries
“Greasy” Draymond Green
Jokic does what Westbrook does and does it better. Draymond would help a ton on D. I still prefer Green.
"Draymond green. He brings much more than defense such as leadership, passing, bbiq, and desensitizing refs"
For the Nuggets ..we don't need a playmaker who dominates ball possesion. SO I would take Draymond Green.
Draymond and it's not even close.     Russ will just make the tankjob that much harder and takes the ball away from jalen green and kpj.
"With all the due respect, a team with Curry and Durant will always be the favorite. Oh yeah they had prime Draymond Green too and a decent supporting cast."
"It's really only the fouling holding him back.  On a normal foul rate he'd be an elite defender.  And you could have said the same two sentences about Ron Artest, Tyson Chandler, and Draymond Green early in their careers."
I just gave you a list of 13 dudes.   I can’t give you a full list cause draymond is so far down on it that it would take too much research and effort to find every dude above him.  You’re mentioning Kyrie and Harden so I’ll reply to that: yea they both have far more NBA accomplishments than draymond green.  Do you think Robert Horry has more NBA accomplishments than Michael Jordan?
"I’ve struck a nerve with you and I apologize for that. At least you think I’m funny.   I can’t live a lie that Draymond Green was a top 15 NBA player two different years.   I respect the hustle though. Play with absolute legends, never shut up, and rake in individual accolades based on their performances."
"Yeah, I guess my key point is it’s hard for me to crucify green for not stepping his offense on a lottery level team. Calling the shooters around him that year average is even being generous.   Either way, I’m with you that Draymond owes Steph big time for 90% of his legacy, but I think he’d still prove valuable for more than 50% of the league despite his awful offense.  (Ps - I’m not downvoting, appreciate the debate/convo)"
"Xavi is 2nd in the all-time assists leaderboard in La Liga (only behind Messi). Iniesta is at 6.   Not to mention that football is a game of 11 players on a team, with on average 2-3 goals scored in a game. You can't compare points/assists in the NBA to football.   Xavi and Iniesta are two of the best midfielders of all time. Draymond Green, while a great player, is not comparable to those two."
"Dude said Draymond Green is the smartest player in the league.  If Draymond won zero titles, no one would be saying this.   Draymond gets insane individual recognition for team accomplishments."
I’m not really sure what you’re trying to say.   MJ deserves individual recognition for team accomplishments.   And somehow Draymond fuckin’ Green gets similar recognition. Clearly not deserved.
Draymond Green dreams of being as good at basketball as Xavi and Iniesta were at Barcelona.   Drug test this man.
are you implying multiple all star and DPOY Draymond Green is a bad player?
"LeBron James is obviously more talented than Draymond Green, but to extrapolate from that that Draymond is a “fraud” is some grade A nephew shit"
"Draymond actually pretty much always plays the point guard role like LeBron. Handles the ball far more, pushes in transition, make vast majority of half court plays and passes, etc. This isn't because he is a better point guard than Steph. When he doesn't have the ball, teams sag off him hard because he cannot threaten a screen or handoff. And it allows Steph to have an off ball game.   It was quite awkward having DLo + Green out there because they both needed to be on the ball."
"&gt; there’s actually no chance we win this game,” Green says. “Not only do you know you’re going to get your ass kicked, but the other team knows they’re going to kick your ass and they’re not even taking you seriously.”  Draymond driving to the game to play the Timberwolves"

Was usually a center, but in his prime no one had an efficient night against Bill."
"Simmons,Kirilenko,Marion,Draymond Green,Artest,Covington,Gerald Wallace,Mbah a Moute,Tayshaun Prince."

"Rodman, Pippen, KG, Ben Wallace, Prime Lebron, MWP, Draymond Green, Giannis.    Anthony Davis can sometimes."
Draymond Green? He literally does every night
"&gt; +/- isnt really a good indication of an individual's player defensive matrics buddy.  Actually yes it is and it is extremely consistent and predictive season to season, much smarter people than you and I use it for analysis.   &gt; Please dont forget Warriors had Wiggins, Draymond, Looney as well. As much as I feel Oubre doesnt fit well with the team, he was a good defender.  You keep changing the argument, all I said was Bazemore would be perfectly fine for 20 minutes. Your argument supports my point that basketball defenses is 5 vs 5 and even 1 vs 1, Bazemore isn't some weak line of attack. If anything that's Westbrook and LeBron when they are in coasting mode and have lazy lapses on defense.   &gt; Warriors fans complain about Mulder because they expect too much from him because they literally have no good shooters  Warriors had plenty of good shooters. The problem was dealing with a starting lineup that had 2 awful - literally non-existent - shooters in Draymond Green and Looney. Even Oubre shot close to 50% on wide open 3s after his awful start. The problem isn't having good shooters, it's having good shooters that can also play serviceable defense. This is the reason Quinn Cook doesn't see play and easily the biggest limitation to Mulder."
Draymond Green
Draymond Green and Danny Green are not related
"I think Draymond Green sucks because he's a petulant child who says some of the dumbest stuff in the world.  Very good basketball player who does all the little things right and knows where to be even when his athleticism has been declining.  But a stupid, stupid person off the court."
"No he wasn't.  Top defender, playmaking non-shooter is not a max contract player. Draymond Green is an ACTUAL DPOY and isn't a liability in the half court and he isn't on a max contract. Simmons should be on Andre Roberson money."
Draymond Green with a midrange shot
"Looking like draymond green out there , I like this guy he's gonna win a lot"
In case people wonder how important Draymond Green is. This wasn't even a game until he got injured.
the importance of draymond green on display rn
Great defensively but timid and sloppy on offense.  He seems to turn into a Draymond Green type of player but it could be just an confidence issue.
By this logic Cade Cunningham would be the worst player dude is shooting like ass (27% TS). Would I take him over a bunch of 0 minute roleplayers. Absolutely. You can't look at box score and say this dude is the worst player. Using that logic Draymond Green is a terrible player (triple single). There are a lot of things that stats won't tell you about someones impact on the game.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are too 75 players of all time.
What has draymond green done this season already to be in DPOY convo?
"If he has all star type seasons in the next 3-4 years, no one is going to care about past 4 months.   He is a draymond green type player. He will be a great in a team like trialblazers or the nets where he is just the facilitator and play defense.   His demand is still high across the league. But 76ers are asking for king's ransom."
I thought he had a nice play vs the warriors on that massive jalen green slam dunk  It was a transition dunk and KPJ got back and set a screen that caught both draymond and steph giving jalen a wide open lane
"He was normally like Draymond Green, with some “questionable” moves that resulted in other players getting hurt but not really injured. Other times, he was like the Morris brothers and legit tried to take someone out of the game."
"I do feel like Ayton would be the x factor. He's a terrific defender but bigs can definitely look bad facing Steph Curry. On the other hand, he'd be a tough cover for anyone not named Draymond Green or a healthy Kevon Looney (which is very far from a certainty). Would be really interesting."
"ARE WE FORGETTING DPOY, TOP 5 IN ASSISTS DRAYMOND GREEN???"
"Nah steph is clearly on another tier then Dame, and the gap between the 3rd best player in the league to the 12th player in the league is much greater than the 12th player to the 21st player. Warriors also has Draymond green who has great synergy with steph and is probably the leading candidate for spot right now"
"caruso was not a dealbreaker, we need to stop this. if he was, they would've beaten the suns or had a more competitive series with own AD down. guys who can't score  should not be getting big contracts unless they're draymond green."
"Neither did Alonzo Mourning or Dikembe Mutumbo or Draymond Green. All 4 clearly should have been on the list. Remove Dame, remove 2 of the 70s Knicks. Be a bit more ruthless in regards to some of the less deserving guys from the 50s, 60s and 70s and bring in people who should have been on Lanier springs to mind. Then add in those 4 plus Jokic, Embiid, Pau, Parker/Ginobli, Payton, Wilkins.   There is a clear bias against international guys in the list. Are you seriously telling me only Hakeem and Dirk deserve to be on the list when you think about all the great international players."
"What do I need to address, there is plenty of sample size? I don't know what your definition of large sample size is. For me even 200 minutes is more than good enough with the right filtering. You're comparing it to OKC that played like 6 different seasons. GSW only used Steph/ KD/ Green/ Thompson lineups for only 3775 minutes in 3 seasons, including playoffs, for comparison. That's the maximum sample size you're going to get.   Curry without Green/ Klay/ KD is a 9.36 on 295 minutes. Steph with just Klay is 9.66 on 249 minutes. Steph with KD is 13.48 on 734 minutes.   Now let's compare this with other combinations to see who is doing the heavy lifting (these include playoffs):   Steph/ Green / Klay: 11.08 on 1228 minutes   Green / Klay: 0.89 on 1179 minutes   KD/ Green: 12.68 on 213 minutes (very high for whatever reason, this drops to 9.91 on 97 minutes if Iguodala is excluded as well)   KD/ Klay: -0.77 on 1179 minutes !   Klay: -1.16 on 682 minutes   KD: 6.06 on 649 minutes   Green: -5.33 on 236 minutes  The overall conclusion we can draw is impact metrics hate Klay. KD does fine alone and with Draymond, but not to the extent of Curry. Very similar to OKC numbers of 6-8 net rating. He also doesn't improve the team nearly as much as Curry, not even close. Draymond can improve the team more than KD but is awful as a single option. This should all make logical sense.   &gt; Do you honestly think that a team with Curry and 4 mediocre to average players wins 70+ games if they are all healthy for the full season?  It's not a matter of health, it's the fact that Curry can't play 48 minutes. So you're only playing on a 70 win pace for partial minutes a game.   &gt; If so you are literally calling him the GOAT lmao  I'm just repeating what the stats are showing me. Curry's impact metrics do in fact eclipse the likes of MJ/ LeBron/ KD/ Bird / Robinson etc. They are historically good. And we know it's not the other players inflating his stat"
"&gt; The Curry with no all stars rating was a small sample fluke  3 seasons worth of sample size   &gt; By that logic the Warriors should have been on a 70 win pace last season  Steph had a net rating of 8.75 on 1618 minutes in non-Wiseman lineups, along with a bunch of other factors that led to a disastrous NBA start. A net rating of 9 is typically a 60 win team, which already surpasses whatever KD did at OKC. If we just include one ""all star"", Steph with Draymond Green in non-Wiseman lineups jump up to 11.17 on 1314 minutes last season, which is historically good but the norm for Steph. For reference the Jrue/ Giannis/ Middleton lineup was a 11.33 last season.

"I don't see why narratives are relevant. It's probably even the case that Wiseman was worse than what most people thought last year. I mean, he was making Stephen Curry and Draymond Green look human lol.   Once again, he had a lot of things going against him that year. Lack of practice, injury, tough schedule, hard system to integrate into and lack of easy PnR plays. I have hope he can be a great NBA player. It doesn't change the fact that he was really bad that year."

Then my man draymond green is the guy for you
"Bjelica obviously isn't the defender or playmaker Draymond Green is, but he gives them another big who can pass and generally make the right play on offense, plus he can space the floor. Great pickup."
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker).

"2 techs really, the third was a second delay of game. I don’t thing anyone would argue the delay of game wasn’t warranted. Watching the clip without the full game context I would expect the delay of game and Melo’s tech to be called. The tech to Russ was highly questionable. Usually refs hit a guy with a tech and then let them vent. From years of watching Draymond I’m aware that first tech is a green light to say what you really wanted to say all along because they aren’t going to eject you unless you go way over the line."
Dame compares...  Id rather watch melo than look at draymond green/iguodala holding the ball waiting for curry to get open around 20 screens

Draymond green been in the league 10 YEARS??
"Draymond green was an elite offensive and defensive player in 2016. He was probably a top 9 player in the league that year (Better than Dame, Klay, Butler, etc)  People already starting to forget that Draymond fell of a cliff offensively, they used to run sets for him and was a good 3pt shooter (For a limited time)"
We definitely missed out on Draymond Green giving us a detailed comparison between the color of a basketball and Trump
Draymond green eats “legit bigs” for breakfast every playoffs
"This is why I think a Ben-Brown trade could actually really be a win-win trade. Ben will be at the 4/5, not the 1. Adding playmaking at that position is purely additive, and we all know about Ben's defensive prowess. Put Ben in the right system and he could be an athletic Draymond Green."

The answer is always Draymond Green. Dude is so polarizing to NBA fans.
Jarrett Allen and Draymond Green
Draymond Green happened.
"jta is good because hes strong and cant get backed down by bigs as easily and he has good passing, thats the whole point of him being there along with players like draymond green and iguodala."
Deni “Draymond Green” Avdija
I would argue that Draymond was a better defender than Simmons last season.  Those warriors were a top 5 defense with only 2 plus defenders (Green and 2 way Wiggans).
"Doesn't mean he's right tho. He called them out for not trusting their teammates, but their teammates have been shooting like absolute trash.  Anyone pointing to the Magic or Heat game obviously didn't watch it.  Despite blowing both teams out, the offense was still trash.  They won because they held both teams under 80.  In the Magic game, removing Brown's shooting, the team shot 37/24/61.  How the fuck is Brown supposed to trust his teammates when they get open looks and put up those shooting splits.  Smart is shooting 31/28/70.  When he's been handling the ball, he's not getting guys open looks, not because he's a bad passer or playmaker, but teams are treating him like Draymond Green.  They're sagging off him really hard because they want him to shoot the open 3 or floater.  It's the same when Schroeder/Brown/Tatum drive, and draw a double.  They start swinging it out and when it gets to Smart, teams are practically begging him to shoot it or he has to pass it to someone with a guy on him essentially wasting the initial play.  That's what's happening with the offense right now.  And when the ball is swung to everyone who isn't Brown or Grant Williams (somehow), they're missing open shots."
"Too on the nose. Should have brought a ""Why not? Draymond Green says it"" sign"
"Bro what is with him. He is one of the biggest players in the league and he so totally irresponsible with that body of his. Always falling on players, elbowing people, like damn he's gonna seriously injure someone one day. He's like Draymond Green a few years ago"
"Dude is repping Draymond Green, a player best known for blasting players in the nuts. No taste, no class, no point arguing"
"Klay took a much bigger than expected leap between 13-14 and 14-15. That’s why the Kevin Love deal was even on the table and why his big contract that offseason was met with skepticism. Besides that, Draymond Green was at best a backup tweener forward. David Lee’s injury granted the opportunity, but Kerr and Adams’ switching defensive scheme and the audacity at the time to use him at the 5 turned him into the league’s best defensive player (still a travesty that Kawhi won the 2015 DPOY). The team may have gotten marginally better due to the real improvement by the players, but the gap between where they would have been and the all time great dynasty they became is entirely due to Kerr."

"Yeah, the title of GOAT is secretly waiting for Draymond Green Jr."
"The trouble with that is that it's good and necessary for players to be able to *discuss* calls with the ref. Ask what the ref saw, ask the ref to look out for something you think another player is getting away with. If you don't know why the ref made the call they did you can't adjust your play accordingly.  And if they T up ""every time the player argues"", then fans will start bitching endlessly about inconsistent calls because from the broadcast you *can not* always tell what the players are saying.  I remember one game where people were outraged in the game thread about Draymond Green not getting teched for ""barking"" at the refs, and then the broadcast showed a closeup where the camera had picked up audio as well.  What Draymond actually said: ""Good call! That was a good call!""  (Because Draymond always looks angry when he says anything.)"
Draymond Green look like that kinda who dude who always sound like he’s saying something that matters but it really doesn’t
He doesn’t need to be a big scorer if he can be a Draymond Green type of player for us to be honest.  The defensive potential of this team going into the future is a good sign.  Both Hachimura and Gafford are physically gifted players with 7.2 wingspans and a huge defensive potential.  + Avdija’s defense with increased ball movement skills  And you will end up with one of the toughest defensive teams in the NBA.  They just need to develop them properly.
"Mobley is good but I see his ceiling as a Draymond Green type player. Hall of famer, but not a franchise level player like Scottie."
"&gt;Wait KD isn’t in the running because of Harden, but Steph having Klay and Draymond is fine?   Steph doesn't have Klay and please don't tell me Harden is magically equal to Draymond Green..... I love Green but BRUH."
"Is he though?  Dude faked an injury, and is now faking mental health problems.  He's shown to be incredibly immature and toxic not only towards the organization but to his teammates.    His game is basically a more athletic Draymond Green without the fire, competitiveness, and genius IQ that makes Draymond such a terror.  And surprisingly, a worse shooter.  On a Max contract...  His play, contract, and character issues kind of make him undesirable to anyone.  No contender wants that.  No rebuilding team wants that.  I wouldn't be surprised if his NBA career is over already."
"Mostly Plumlee. Leaves the leave wide open on the strong side to defend not only a non shooter, but a non scorer. Plus he's fully committed to helping defend another relative non scorer in Draymond. Lack of awareness by Plumlee.  Ball looks bad but he was put in a pretty bad situation by Plumlee. Hard to fault Melo for rotating to a wide open cutter right under the basket.  All that said, you could probably argue no one is really at fault. Good offense beats good defense a lot of the time, and as soon as Green gets the step on Bridges, the play has a good chance of converting."
Draymond is Green Lantern.
"No, It's not about his offense, it's the mold. The impact he has over NBA defense for years to come is criminally underappreciated. Most NBA teams are looking for the next Draymond Green, the whole league is about looking for the 4 who can play the 5 and survive defensively, to soup up offense and pace to support their primary offensive players. Him having just 1*DPOY doesn't even seem fair. There are basically 5 guys every year in the draft, who are picked to service as the next Draymond."
"&gt; no personal accolades  6* All NBA; He is obviously a great offensive player, but for me team accolades like the championship should matter aswell to replace the lack of some personal accolades.  My pick would have been Draymond Green."
"Probably a bit of an overhelp by Plumlee, but honestly just a really smart play by Looney and Draymond... Plumlee did need to slide at least a bit to help contain the Green drive, and that would've opened the cut for Looney, and Ball did need to rotate to cut off Looney, leaving Poole in the corner. Ball maybe could've helped better by playing the passing lane rather than the cutting lane, but that's a tough read."
If he can use some of those handles and his height to his advantage you got a Draymond Green type beat

"I'd say given current skill-sets, both Draymond Green and Ben Simmons would be able to do it. Or at least, if they did do it, I wouldn't be surprised."
Draymond Green?
Bitch you're gonna have to change your name to Draymond Green
"Draymond’s great no doubt, but you don’t have to put down the rest of the team to talk him up. Those warriors teams were stacked. The truth is, you just don’t have a top 1-2 defense with only one good defender. There’s a reason that the warriors defense hasn’t been top-10 until last season when they got Wiggins.   &gt;	 Whilst Bogut, Klay, Iggy are great defenders in their own rights, they aren't driving high end defences. Which Duncan and Danny Green could do  Danny green can’t drive a high end defense. He’s great but he’s nowhere near that great. Bogut probably could at that point, you’re really underselling him. He was a hell of a rim protector. And yea, you’re right the spurs had better defenders off the bench, but they were pretty similar 1-5.    &gt;	 it's pretty obvious Dray should have won both DPOYs in those years.   Idk, this argument has happened a million times. At this point it’s just whatever your opinion is. People wouldn’t be upset if Draymond had gotten DPOY over Kawhi, it could’ve gone either way. It just depends what skills you value most.    I hate the argument against Kawhi though. I’ll die on the hill that Kawhi was more than a one on one defender. He was one of the best defensive playmakers I’ve ever seen those two seasons. He jumped passing lanes, had great help defense, and  routinely made clutch blocks and steals. It’s just flat out wrong to discredit his defense by saying he was “only” a one on one defender.     I think people forget because he hasn’t played with quite the same intensity on defense the last few years since his offensive role expanded so much."
"My point is more that Draymond was the system. Kawhi was like the cherry on an ice cream sundae. His defence back then is the equivalent to KDs offence. Amazing one on one player go can help a team. But when forced to carry the majority of the burden it leads to subpar results. Duncan still averaged 2 blocks a game and was an all-star in 2015 primarily off his defence.  And Whilst Bogut, Klay, Iggy are great defenders in their own rights, they aren't driving high end defences. Which Duncan and Danny Green could do. Also you had David West who I know was still a a very effective defender until 2018. I'm obviously not sure how slow-Mo was in 2016 but again he's been a historically good defender.  Now I can't comment on the rest of the supporting cast defence wise for the spurs so you'd have to tell me. But for the warriors at least outside the ones you mentioned, Steph, Barnes ish and Livingston the rest of the roster was pretty disastrous on defence. Mobuckets, Barbosa, Clark even Rush were pretty bad on defence at that point.  I think it's pretty obvious Dray should have won both DPOYs in those years. He should ahve at least 3 to be on par with the guys he's actually on par with historically in terms of defensive impact."
"Some dumb shit, I'm not going to try and remember it.  “We’re dealing with something that, to me, feels like has turned into a political war. When you’re talking about [vaccinated] and non-vaccinated, I think it’s become very political. And for someone who’s not extremely into politics, when you make something so political and not everyone is into politics, then you can also turn those people off, you know?”  This first part ^ was actually not too bad. Then he said this.  “I think there is something to be said for people’s concern about something that’s being pressed so hard. Like, why are you pressing this so hard? Like, so much, just pressing and pressing and pressing. I think you have to honor people’s feelings and their own personal beliefs – and I think that’s been lost when it comes to vaccinated and non-vaccinated. And it kinda sucks that that’s been lost, because you’re essentially not giving anyone… you say we live in the land of the free? Well you’re not giving anyone freedom because you’re making people do something, essentially. Without necessarily making them, you’re making them do something. And that goes against everything that America stands for, or ‘supposedly’ stands for. And so I don’t think… no, I know I’m not in any position to go tell him what he should or should not be doing. And as a leader of this team I’m not going to go to him say ‘hey man, we really need…’ Nah, the hell, you do what you feel you want to do. I’m not going to go ask him did he get a polio vaccine. So why would I go ask him if he got a COVID vaccine?”  https://sports.yahoo.com/draymond-green-sounds-off-vaccine-194957091.html  Source if you want to read the article ^"
I'm not sure a dude who can't figure out why Draymond Jamal Green can say the N word and Robert Sarver can't is smart enough to work a video game.
"I don’t know if this is definitely true. The warriors had Iggy, Klay, and Bogut in addition to Draymond. The Spurs had Duncan, Danny green, and Aldridge playing the best defense of his career.    I’d say it was pretty close. Duncan might push the spurs over the edge. I think the main point is Kawhi was more than just a one on one defender. He got plenty of steals, forced turnovers, and made plays."
"We had a game where one of our players was teched for using the word on the court.  Draymond was, in the same game, using the same language consistently.  The tech against our player was later rescinded by the league.  &gt; After the loss, Suns majority owner Robert Sarver entered the coaches locker room, Watson told ESPN.  &gt;""You know, why does Draymond Green get to run up the court and say [N-word],"" Sarver, who is white, allegedly said, repeating the N-word several times in a row.  &gt;""You can't say that,"" Watson, who is Black and Hispanic, told Sarver.  &gt;""Why?"" Sarver replied. ""Draymond Green says [N-word].""  &gt;""You can't f---ing say that,"" Watson said again."
"Draymond ""Kyrie Irving"" Green"
How the fuck would Draymond Green know what Sarver is like when he's never played for the Suns or been courted by the Suns in free agency? Just stop with the revisionist history.
"This is not even remotely like that. Declining to censor yourself while you bitch about shit Draymond Green says is bad behavior, but it’s nowhere near the same as asking your mistress not to bring black people to basketball games, and talking about your wife sucking your dick is not the same as sexually harassing different women for nearly 20 years."
"Lot to go over...  &gt; ""You know, why does Draymond Green get to run up the court and say [N-word],"" Sarver, who is white, allegedly said, repeating the N-word several times in a row. &gt;  &gt; ""You can't say that,"" Watson, who is Black and Hispanic, told Sarver. &gt;  &gt; **""Why?"" Sarver replied. ""Draymond Green says [N-word].""**  Wait, is Sarver my grandpa?  If I had a nickel for every time I heard an older white person say this, maybe I wouldn't be on Reddit all day.  &gt; Sarver did acknowledge using the word once many years ago. ""On one occasion a player used the N-word to describe the importance of having each others' back,"" Sarver said through his attorneys. **""I responded by saying, 'I wouldn't say n---a, I would say that we're in the foxhole together.'** An assistant coach approached me a short time after and told me that I shouldn't say the word, even if I were quoting someone else. I immediately apologized and haven't said it ever again. The N-word has never been a part of my vocabulary.""  ""The only time I've ever used the N-word was to heroically correct someone! In my heroism, I had no idea what I did was wrong. My bad.""  &gt; ""These [N-words] need a [N-word],"" Sarver told the staffer of his largely Black team, according to the executive. &gt;  &gt; **""I don't like diversity,""** Sarver replied, according to Watson and a basketball operations staffer with knowledge of the interaction.  The more you read on, the more it seems Sarver is *old-timey* racist (or maybe modern again? that's a whole other discussion).  &gt; **They also pointed out that ""six of their last 10 head coaches were Black, including the current head coach Monty Williams, and GM James Jones.** These men were hired because they were the best applicants to fill their respective positions.""  This definitely felt like a, ""Look at all my black friends!"" thing, with adding the last part because lawyers know it too.  &gt; ""I said, 'The only common denominator is you,'"" Watson recalled. ""'This cemetery runs deep of coaches, GMs, players. You're the only common thread. It's you.'"" &gt;  &gt; Watson said he told Sarver that he was toxic and that the Suns were toxic because of him. &gt;  &gt; Sarver screamed back. &gt;  &gt; **""You're f---ing toxic!""**  Sarver then added, that he is rubber and Watson is glue and there is no point in responding cause any insults would just come right back at him.  On thing with his wife:  &gt; Sarver responded through his legal team: ""This is a perfect example of how things get twisted,"" he said. ""In the first year of my ownership, a local apparel retailer had recently been awarded the license to sell official NBA branded swimwear. The retailer sent my wife and me a sample along with a brochure, and I took a picture of her in the sample. **I took the brochure and picture of her and gave it to the people at the Suns in charge of overseeing merchandise with the message: 'Here's the catalog, this is what the swimsuit looks like, and if you have any interest in carrying this line in the team shop, then here's the number to call.'**""  What a dumb fuckknuckle. ""Here's what it looks like!"" Oh gee, because people don't have the imaginations to think of what a bikini looks like on a woman.  &gt; Four former employees said that in several all-staff meetings Sarver claimed he needed to wear Magnum or extra-large condoms.  Sarver quietly exclaimed, ""I don't get why they keep falling off, though.""  I feel like Sarver is someone who would *definitely* wear a shirt that says ""LARGE PENIS COMING THROUGH"", if someone gave him one.  &gt; Sarver instituted unusual and frequent demands, former coaches and basketball operations staffers said, and during part of that 2018-19 season he told Kokoskov's staff that they shouldn't hold pens, papers, notebooks or anything in their hands on the sideline. They had to stand and cheer.  ""Be more like Jason Garrett!""  &gt; Suns chief financial officer and general manager of the Phoenix Mercury Jim Pitman said, ""[Sarver] has been consistently on the side of women and the WNBA."" **Executive director for Phoenix Suns charities and vice president of social responsibility Sarah Krahenbuhl said, ""[Sarver's] not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but how he pushes us is for the greater good.**""  That reads like something out of an abusive relationship. ""Sure, he gets angry sometimes, but he means well! He only does it to help me be bettter!""  Sit and think about that. Sarver and his team *read that sentence* and thought it would be good for others to hear. As part of their defense, they quote a female executive with a quote that sounds like she's been held captive for years.  **That's a positive quote to them.**  For motherfucks sake."
I swear the NBA racists always use Draymond Green in their examples
"&gt; ""You know, why does Draymond Green get to run up the court and say [N-word],""  He is on to something and almost has a point, but it’s the wrong point. In NBA arenas players are so close to the fans, they should probably be watching their language a little more. In my opinion, it’s very trashy to be using so much profanity."
"Pretty sure that's the point he was trying to make. If a guy who never really said it, like maybe Steph, suddenly started letting if fly, he would be T'd up immediately. Sarver would have no reason to call out Draymond Green if 75% of the league is black. He must be able to say a lot more than other players."
"Half this shit feels like if Michael Scott was a real person. Just a wild asshole who thinks he's being ""fair"" (the Draymond Green incident and the coaching line about black guys needing black guys to coach them). That stripper line sounds directly like something from that show, a lousy and crass ""joke"" that doesn't land with anybody."
"According to this, he’ll just internalize the belief that he didn’t do anything worse than Draymond Green, but that he was punished “because he’s white and Draymond is one of those damn n-words.”  The pure lack of empathy and nuance is astounding. People like Sarver never try to understand another person’s perspective. They just search high and low for anything they can claim makes them, “the one facing real discrimination.” It’s all about them."
"&gt;""You know, why does Draymond Green get to run up the court and say [N-word],"" Sarver, who is white, allegedly said, repeating the N-word several times in a row.  Ffs, the entitlement.   Yes it's just a word but given the history of that word, I think when they ask us not to use it anymore, that's a pretty reasonable request"
"Just from watching this game against ya'll its clear you guys need a draymond green esque player because this team is dying to run a true small ball 5. You guys have the youth, speed, and the explosiveness for it. Mason Plumlee just doesn't fit this team at all.  You can tell this is still a young team that just need a defensive captain  and the sky is the limit honestly"
"&gt;""You know, why does Draymond Greenget to run up the court and say [N-word],"" Sarver, who is white, allegedly said, repeating the N-word several times in a row. ""You can't say that,"" Watson, who is Black and Hispanic, told Sarver. ""Why?"" Sarver replied. ""Draymond Green says [N-word]."" ""You can't f---ing say that,"" Watson said again.  Wowww"
"&gt;""You know, why does Draymond Green **get to** run up the court and say \[N-word\],""  What privilege Draymond has! If only a rich dickhead could just buy the right to say the N-word.  This fuckin guy."
"I’m sure sarver is racist, and I’m sure everything in here is true.  But they are really dining on that draymond green “can say it too” quote. There isn’t a ton of explicitly damning anecdotes in here. Toxic bad work environment, yes, but this honestly isn’t nearly as damning as I thought"
"Sarver to Kerr: Yeah, but why does Draymond Green get to say that word though?"
"Draymond ""Martin Luther King Jr."" Green"
Draymond Green: Mrs. Obama I’ve done it. I have stopped racism!
Draymond Green: Hero of the day
"Am I restricted to current players only? If not  PG: Steve Kerr  SG: Kyle Korver  SF: LeBron  PF: Draymond Green  C: Ben Wallace   Replace Kerr with any other elite shooting PG but I couldn't think of anyone else. LeBron/Dray/Ben is the GOAT defensive front court, Korver/Kerr are all time great shooters, and prime Dray could stroke it from 3 too. Easy ring"
"Eyesight isn't all that important for an NBA player. Steph and Danny Green both got Lasik surgery in the middle of their careers, but their shooting percentages were damn good even before the surgery. It's not like baseball where you have to judge micro-movements of a small ball moving 100 mph. A basketball is pretty big, and the hoop doesn't move.  And Draymond actually has good athleticism for his role -- huge wingspan, great core strength, and quick feet. NBA scouts at the time had a too-narrow view of what an NBA athlete looked like."
"NBA handed him a stimulus package with the suspension of Draymond Green, paired with the unfortunate injuries to Iguodala and Bogut. Series would've been over in Game 5 otherwise."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Curry bout pull up.. Draymond green gets hacked up top.  We may have something here...
https://twitter.com/DozMan98/status/1463695526616973312  Zach Lowe says Giannis is right there with Draymond Green as DPOY. Adds teams are shooting 46% at the rim with Giannis as the nearest defender and he might legit be the best rim protector in the league up with Gobert
Draymond green is the runaway.   Best team defensive rating   Best team defender  Best on ball defender  Best defensive anchor
Pretty much looking like Rudy Gobert vs. Draymond Green right now.

fight Draymond green in the nba finals? with punches thrown? dumb mf
"JTA yelled, “There you go!” Andrew Wiggins gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond Green belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, injured Warriors star Klay Thompson hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Draymond Green?  He doesn't like hitting balls. Colour me skeptical sir.
Draymond and Danny Green pretty good
"Kawhi had 6-22 and 4-17 games, and was overall less efficient while averaging 5 points less, and doing so against Jerami Grant and will Barton while kd was playing Andre iguodala and Draymond green"
One player is not going to single handily change the defense Lowry. Stop trying to make Lowry seem like he’s Draymond Green
Maxi with that Draymond Green line.
&gt;Only Stephen Curry (42) and Draymond Green (38) have more but both stars have played more than half the minutes as Payton.  Yes... Steph and Draymond have played more than half of GPII's minutes. This is technically true.
"The warriors didn’t win because of stephs defense, lol. And iso doesn’t mean you aren’t getting help from one of the best help defenders of all time in draymond green."
"I am a life long MSU/Magic/Lakers fan, but became a warriors fan when Draymond Green got drafted. I went on to be a Curry fan. I hate that Kevin Durant left the Warriors but also hate that he made it obvious that he was better than Curry, while they were teammates.  I have long hated James Harden for on-court reasons. Among my favorite recent NBA moments were the warriors beating the Rockets in the playoffs. I have long hated Kyrie Irving for off court reasons.  I like rooting for the Nets to implode even more than I liked rooting for the Rockets to implode."
"Assuming the starters are: Jokic / Davis / LeBron / Luka / Steph, then you have back up guards (2) back up forwards (3) and 2 wildcards. So in theory KP has 5 spots to compete for.   Booker, Westbrook, Paul, Paul George, SGA, KAT, Gobert, Mitchell, Lillard, Green are all going to be competing for those 7 reserve spots. I feel Booker, Gobert, Mitchell, Paul George and Lillard are locks, which would be the 3 forward spots and 2 guard spots. KP would have to beat out 4 of Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, SGA, KAT and Draymond Green. Not impossible, but coaches always tend to vote longevity so I'd bet on CP3 and Draymond getting the coaches nods."
"Given the choice between a ring with a core you drafted and watched develop or a bunch of dudes from other teams who all shipped in thirty seconds ago, I think one of those definitely feels more meaningful.  Golden State fans went from memes about Klayups to memes about Klay's toaster. Saw Steph Curry get benched for Acie Law, saw Steph Curry tweak his ankles, saw Steph Curry win two MVPs trophies. Watched Draymond Green single-handedly turn tweeners into appealing prospects.  Better yet, we've got young guys who are clearly showing the benefits of being mentored by our stars. You don't see other superstars doing that. They don't have time for young, developing players. LeBron ships those dudes out to bring in other vets.  Chicago didn't draft all their guys but they're *building* something. It matters whether your players' greatest moments were with your team or not.  It's not like fans get rings. Watching your team win a championship when it's guys you've been supporting for years means so much more imo than a bunch of dudes who put on the shirts for the first time that season. That's the epitome of *you're cheering for laundry*."
"He's apparently every young guy's favorite person in the locker room, much like what young players have said about Draymond Green. Incredibly similar players, all things considered. Passing wizards, defensive whizzes, lacking in the scoring department, with very volatile personalities."
Draymond Green was referring to getting better calls in games. There's no ambiguity. I'm not sure how you're at all confused about that. Read through the thread again with the knowledge about what Draymond said.
Draymond green has a show? When did it start?
"&gt; I'm saying the Warriors haven't shown us anything that would suggest they would even a contender.  15-2 record, best point differential by a country mile, 1st in offensive rating, 1st in defensive rating, Stephen Curry, etc. All of that while having Draymond Green as the 2nd player in that team.   But yeah, they have shown absolutely nothing that would suggest they're a contender lmao.  It's getting really hard to tell if you're just *that* clueless or a high effort troll."
"Warriors whenever someone dares praise a player not named Steph curry, draymond green or klay Thomson"
Weird way to say Draymond Green sitting on Wiseman’s shoulders to form a human mecha
Don’t ever want any team with Stephanie curry or okay Thompson to win a championship again. Same with draymond green.
"Klay in one corner, Jordan Poole with his feet set in the other corner, you can't help off of either so it's Draymond Green going 2 v 1 downhill in the middle of the paint. Good luck."
Draymond green is the best triple single machine and it ain’t even close
The draymond green show is gonna be an all timer.
Draymond Green show is going to be so good. There's no other current important player willing to be this unfiltered on camera.
“That wasn’t even ash that was fucking scales”   - Draymond Green 2021
"Y'all are scary good, I'm happy for the Bay Area. I still remember that 2006 Barron Davis/Jackson/Ellis/JRich team. Highly entertaining! My hope is Keldon Johnson turns out to be Draymond Green light, that'll be ideal!"

"Draymond Green will never be a top 75 player all time. I don’t care what he racks up accolade wise, it is painfully obvious that if he was the #1 option on a team they would clearly suck. Like not just 8 seed suck, but top of the lottery yearly suck."
"Honest to goodness agree with you that the collection of potential/talent is there and this team ain’t that bad in *theory* but what Im saying is the players themselves are “bad”. I don’t know how else to articulate this. Id rather have floor level ingles, brunson, theis, mcconnell, zeller/thad young than peak (in theory) kpj, green, wood. It’s hard to coach low iq bball players is what im trying to say. The warriors had to unload some of those last season and although steph and draymond are hard carrying them rn, the combination of players who know how to play *team basketball* contributes to wins. It takes so much time and effort and did i say time? To build an environment and routine where you get to teach young players (especially iso oriented/3&amp;d oriented) how to play team ball. The rockets aren’t there yet. Can someone like Vaugh help them develop better? Prolly yeah. All im saying is im reserving judgement on silas cos this team sucks."
I think his floor is a poor man's draymond green if he never develops his offense
"I hate Draymond green for literally no particular reason, I just want him to fail because he seems like he would be a dick in real life. There is no evidence to support this. I just believe it for no true reason"
"It really isn't premature.  We're 17 games in and lost twice.  That's really impressive no matter how you cut it up.  That's not to say we're definitely going to finish with the best seed in the west and maintain this pace, but it's safe to say we're a really good team that's probably going to get a top seed.    I'm not sure why reddit is so hesitant of giving credit to teams with great starts.  It's not like we're some new up and coming team that's never been here before and could just as easily slide back down.  This is freakin Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Steve Kerr we're talking about.  These guys don't go on extended losing streaks."
Need Bulls Got Next from Twitter to get absolutely knocked the fuck out by Draymond Green
"Tony Parker, Kobe Bryant, Gilbert Arenas, Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman, Rasheed Wallace, Dwight Howard, Jason Kidd, PJ Tucker, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green all could be on the list"
"Sure he's 23 but all those 4 years are in college  Yes drafting older players should mean they have more experience, but not everytime they are. Davion is just one of them  The college and the NBA have a really humungous gap, so thinking he would fit in REALLY QUICKLY is really crazy to believe. Some will, and some don't directly  Draymond Green took forever to pan out, he might have somewhat that role, as a gritty defender, can playmake well, and have a respectable three  Even like Will Barton, he came in the league when he was 22, he didn't blossom until he got traded to the Nuggets when he was 26  Both of them are 2nd rounders, they are, but that just proves that just because you ain't doing well during the start of your career, ESPECIALLY 18-20 games, that don't mean nothing  so yes, the rookie excuse especially since we ain't even 1/3 in the season, heck technically some teams aren't even 1/4 in their games."
"I mean her still is.  That is the man who got draymond green suspended for a game in the NBA finals getting teabagged by Lebron.  Stewart’s an idiot and deserved a longer suspension for his reaction, but one game was very very light handed."
"But it's not your place to question it, either. And of course not all Black people agree with me - we aren't a monolithic people, contrary to popular belief. I know good and well where it stems from; it's long before the 'One Drop Rule' came into play. I'm sure your research was extensive and reviewed by peers and also an entire crock of crap. You found one article with two dudes who aren't the brightest and Draymond Green is one of the loudest mouths in basketball - him and Barkley both.  But yeah, you ain't gotta like it. You should probably stay in your lane, though."
"Eh I did some research on my lunch break and it seems to be you're just trying to stop people from ""peeking"" over the fence and questioning blatant racism/colorism.  It's also stems from the one drop rule.   Also, not all black people agree with you. Ie.

I also think /Giannis/Bam/Butler/Gobert/Jrue Holiday/PG13 are all extremely close to Draymond green defensively. Draymond is great but he isn’t worlds above any of the guys I listed above and it’s not even close

"&gt; Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who wouldn't be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call limited.  I mean, obviously you don't watch games, but you could at least read what you're replying to."
"Steph Curry's defense is severely underrated.  Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who *wouldn't* be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call *limited*."
Draymond Green and Bam after hearing Jared in the tunnels: [...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI0XWAMQgxc)
"They're not really comparable players at all.  Horford's BBIQ, playmaking, shooting and defence put him over Thompson by a pretty high margin, not to mention he's one of the better vet leaders in the league.   Brown, Smart and Robert Williams all worked out with him right before taking big jumps as players.   Horford is like Draymond Green, you're not really looking at the stats so much as his ability to do everything else."
"Marc Jackson to Draymond green, that is fucking wild. Well done OP"
That’s Draymond Green numbers
"Suns, because of course.  But, also... fuck Draymond Green. Dirty POS."
Draymond Green is one of the defenders of all time.
"Is this serious? Instigated? An aggressive box out where you shoving the guy is just stupid play. Looking at a man and back fisting him over that is absolutely ridiculous. People get fouled hard af all the time. You can’t fucking bust someone in the face over it. What Stewart did was just a stupid offensive foul. It wasn’t dirty and LeBron wasn’t at risk of being injured because of it. He absolutely reacted like a bitch and sucker punched that dude out of anger. 99% of the players in the nba wouldn’t have reacted that way. You absolutely can’t intentionally hit a dude in the face.   Draymond green used to literally kick people in the nuts on rebound attempts and nobody hit him in the face.   LeBron was wrong and he absolutely started that entire thing. If it wasn’t intentional, LeBron wouldn’t have been trying to call the dude today to apologize. He knew he fucked up and it looked dirty so he was doing PR damage control."
"Lol, the point that I’m making is that, regardless of expectations _heading into_ the season, that Warriors team is undoubtedly considered to have been all-time great. You had an MVP, two top 10 scorers, the undisputed greatest shooting back court of all-time, a truly incredible defensive anchor and offensive facilitator in Draymond Green, and one of the deepest benches in the league.   99 out of 100 NBA fans would consider that team to be an all-time great squad, with the one exception being your dense ass. Did they exceed initial expectations? Maybe, I don’t know. Pre-season and early-season projections are a crap shoot. People thought last year’s Suns were going to be a fringe play off team and a first round exit. Do I dwell on that for the chip on my shoulder as a fan? Fuck no. I truly don’t give a shit and just enjoyed the ride.   Take the compliment of your team for Christ’s sake you unbearable goofball."
"For real. I think LeBron thought he was a lock to surpass Jordan and the Warriors stopped him threepeating and then took him down in five games and a *sweep*.  And he can claim all he wants that 2015-16 made him the greatest player of all time, but he knows as well as everyone else that he's not winning that series either without help from Donatas Motiejunas's back sweat and active intervention from the NBA.  If you watch the incident that actually got Draymond Green suspended - Draymond *didn't touch him*. LeBron just got huffy and complained to the NBA.  My conspiracy theory is that Nike was also involved because they didn't want non-Nike stars beating Jordan's 72-10 *and* winning the championship that year. Like, I think that was the year Air Jordan actually released the 72 and 10 shoes. Can't have LeBron (Nike for life) losing to a team that will *also* outshine the Jordan Bulls if they win.  The Warriors didn't actually recruit KD because they needed him to beat other teams so much as because with KD they could win even when the games were rigged against them. (The refereeing in game 3 of the Finals the Warriors swept was *comical*.)"
"You really want to use this series for “context”? Are we just going to totally ignore draymond green? And that fact that every cavs/warriors series was in fact, a dirty battle on BOTH sides. This is a shitty post."
"Nope. With that Game 7 it was Draymond easy. He was god mode on defense, LeBron was getting taken out of the series for quarters at a time, frustrated out of his mind on every drive until Green got suspended. No one was giving it to an injured Curry. He had the narrative of being their best player in the games Curry had missed too."
"Saw someone else mention this first, so the credit is theirs, but Scottie Barnes does remind me of a taller and remixed version of Andre Iguodala. Taller, with similar vision and pass first instincts, not as explosive of an athlete, but much longer on defense.  Maybe a mix of Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Shawn Marion, with emphasized poise and passing ability? I am very bullish on Scottie Barnes with a solid organization developing him. Can see him as an impactful championship team player."
Suns.  The 2016-2019 warriors ruined basketball and parity. So i will forever hate them. Id cheer the Lakers over them.  Fuck Draymond Green. Fuck Klay. Fake tough guy.   Respect Curry and Kerr though.  Above all fuck the shit show that is SF
"Actually watching the games helps Curry here, too. Draymond is a great passer, but a lot of these passing opportunities he has are the result of what Curry is doing for him off the ball or getting off the ball quickly when the trap comes. Steph’s constant movement off the ball is what frees up Iggy and company to get those back door passes from Dray.    Green was more important than Klay, but Curry and Klay aren’t in the same class as far as what they’re creating out there. It was Curry, Green and Klay in that order for the offense. To cite watching games against Curry is backwards."
"It was *not* a double tech. That would probably have been the right call, but that isn’t what happened. James got a tech, and Green got a flagrant 1. Green was then suspended for his flagrant points, not techs.   Had Green been given a tech, he would not have been suspended (he was still 2 techs from suspension, IIRC).   That is part of what people cry foul over; the league’s decision seemed to be based on what would result in a suspension rather than what happened on the court. Still dumb of Draymond to let himself get provoked, though."
I don't mean to brag but I'm basically Draymond Green.
Stocky forward who might be good on defense = Draymond Green  This is both a point of praise for Draymond (he inspired a whole new player archetype) and kind of an insult (imagining that these players could come close to his level of defensive genius)
Undersized big with long arms?  That must make you...   DRAYMOND GREEN!
"I don’t give a fuck about passing the Celtics tbh, but give me championships all day.   Agreed it’s only weirdos who care about home grown players. If Pat Beverly and Draymond Green get traded to us and wins us a championship, consider them my favorite players."
Recently it’s been the Draymond Green archetype - the stocky undersized big
"Nobody in this comment section has seen Stewart fight bruh, if he wanted to swing he woulda swung, he dragged it out when it was over, he wasn’t gonna get to Bron and if he was really gon hit somebody he coulda snuck DeAndre Jordan, he’s more Draymond Green than Zach Randolph"
"And I don't think anyoen is saying he didn't do a dirty play. He clearly did, but to label him a historically dirty player is another, which is what this post is trying to do. Lebron is not a historically dirty player, though yes, he has done dirty play here and there in his 19 year career. But he's not exactly Draymond Green out there."
"In my experience, they don't need to play good defense. Literally any kinda stocky dude between 6'4 and 6'7 who plays up front is Draymond Green."
"There are definitely some dirty plays here but this and some of the other clips are OP finding intent where there isn't one. Actually feel a slightly deeper look could've found more plays with clear malice or reckless endangerment, but this clip doesn't really make a case for anyone unless they are already anti-Lebron.  &amp;#x200B;  Also the first two ""nut shots"" are completely within the normal range of motion incidental contact. The third one is clearly an offensive foul but it's not Draymond Green without the ball just nut stomping or a Chris Paul uppercut to the dick."
Draymond Green is not a fucking role player.
What in particular did I write that you thought was dumb on politics?  And I just hate draymond green. I haven’t watched a single warriors game this year 😂
"every undersized PF that can D up is Draymond Green, every white shooter above 6'10 is Dirk"
"Calls Lebron dirty. Posts only 10 examples in close 19 years of his career. Blames ""Lehive"" mind instead of his poor argument....yup. this is /r/nba alright.  And not defending that Lebron has done dirty plays in his career. All players have except for maybe Steph Curry which I can't find evidence for. That's it. John Stockton and Karl Malone did NOTORIOUSLY dirty plays throughout their careers. They aren't remembered as dirty. Draymond Green literally punched 3 different guys inthe nuts in ONE post-season run. CP3 is an all timer in doing dirty plays subtetely here and there without drawing refs attention but clearly seen on TV. But no, let's hone in on one player and if you are against this poor argument, you are just a hive minded individual."
&gt;Just imagine if a roleplayer had this kind of track record - would he be known for anything other than dirty plays?  probably depends on if they were good or not. pj tucker can have a compilation like this and nobody thinks he's dirty. draymond green as well.
"exactly this. OP is being disingenuous because everyone knows what it takes to get a reputation as a 'dirty player', just look at Markief Morris or CP3 or Pat Bev or Draymond Green. When media and fans can see a CLEAR trend in dirty plays across seasons, then yeah - you're a dirty player. Players have incidences of being frustrated and what Lebron has done can be considered dirty plays but out of the OVERWHELMING majority of his plays, he does not make dirty plays.      This is just as bad as Nets homers saying Giannis is a dirty player for what happened with Kyrie in the playoffs + a smattering of dirty plays people plucked from his last 7 seasons."

"LeBron has been an instigator stuff his entire career,  just ask Draymond Green. The league generally does nothing about it."
Russel was like a taller stronger version of Draymond Green who was a much better rebounder of course he would be star in today’s league.
"He's 5 spots below Draymond Green in BPM. Does that expose Green, or BPM? He's doing well on ws/48 and TS%."
"Honestly, I’ll be surprised if the NBA doesn’t suspend Draymond Green for what Lebron did tonight.   It reminds me of the time the NCAA got so mad at Kentucky that they put Cleveland State on probation for 2 years."
They will find a way to suspend Draymond Green for this!
"1) Poole, JTA, and GP2 have more experience under their belt.  They have a better idea of what they should be doing on the floor both with and without the ball.   2) Addition by subtraction.  Oubre and Bazemore leaving eliminated our two lowest BBIQ players.  Both of them would frequently make terrible decisions, both of them were black holes on offense, and both of them often lost focus on the defensive end.  They were the worst type of players for the offense we try to run, but they both got big minutes.   3) adding veteran leadership in Iguodala.    4) adding capable decision makers and scorers in Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr.    Between all of this, you end up with a roster with 10 players who can pass well, defend actively and intelligently, and can hit open shots.  That’s as good a base to build off of in the NBA as you can ask for.  Furthermore, considering Kerr’s offense is all about off-ball movement and making the extra pass, having intelligent players willingly moving the ball opens up everyone.  Add an MVP candidate in Steph Curry and a DPOY candidate in Draymond Green and good things happen."
"Great defence is something that is missing in the league in abundance, why do people act like it's nothing? Is this not why people like Draymond Green make the ASG? Averaging 18.3 points is no mean feat either, and with his team currently 15-2 he is definitely at all-star level."
You are high as fuck or dumb or both if you legit think that Draymond Green does something worse than _punching a man_ every night.
draymond green does something worse than this every game lol he can't keep his nails out of other players eyes
"It's actually hilarious that a comment that says LeBitch made you open a new tab, type in ""draymond green ditry player xD"", copy that url, and then respond to the guy above. Rent free"
Now if Draymond Green would do that…
draymond green could do that and get a single tech so idk but yeah probably
“We’ve completed a thorough investigation of all parties involved and have come to the conclusion that Draymond Green will be suspended 3 games.”
The NBA is more likely to suspend Draymond Green for this on behalf of Lebron than actually suspend LeMalice
"It's just a matter of team demand. Fox is talented and disruptive enough to be a #2 player on a good team with a lot of offensive responsibility. Now if you own the Brooklyn Nets running Harden and KD in your best lineup you may very well be better off with Lonzo because he does the things a Star player doesn't pay as much attention to with a lot of skill and hustle.  Elite roleplayers can impact the floor very well once you have a strong framework in your roster and only then they can be more impactful than (low-level) All-Stars because once they can invest all their energy into the things they're good at they will excel. If you have a struggling team that needs leadership and a guy to make your offense dangerous you'd rather take John Wall, Fox etc.  A bad team would take one of those scoring wings over them but a great team would blow the roof open once they got a guy like Draymond Green to name another example."
"So i used to watch the Lakers pretty regularly. And you can check out my post history to see if im qualified to talk about coaches.   Luke Walton was one of the worst coaches i have seen purely based on on court product.   His Xs Os are extremely simplistic leading with one action and no weakside or offball actions to setup counters to defensive counters. This means if the action is stopped, the play is dead and often in the old Lakers days this meant Jordan clarkson iso. Or Nick Young.  In fact, i dont remember the exact specifics but i predict if you look at the Lonzo era stats the team was probably #1 in transition offense and dead last with a half court set.  I remember Larry Nance Jr the first year without Walton saying in an interview how practices were very different than previous because they were much more structured.  I think Luke is a great player development coach, because by all accounts Draymond Green credits him with his development. Which i can see as a pinch post, triangle postion passer. But he’s not head coach material and it was evident from early in his Lakers tenure."
Steve kerr is coaching a team with the 7th and 2nd overall pick in the drafts. Stephen curry and draymond green with Wiggins to make a big 3.   The warriors are legit the same team from last year... except kuminga. What happend last year ? 8th seed....     Nash is coaching a team missing their third best player. And is at the top of the east just like the warriors are top of the west ??????
Wait I love Draymond Green
You know the world is topsy turvy when I agree with something that Draymond fucking Green said
"I'm sorry, that's simply not true. Maybe you mean ""not a fragrant foul."" But that is still wrong, if Draymond Green grabs Kawhi's neck but Kawhi isn't hurt by it....Green committed a flagrant 2. Also, if you mean a foul in general...then fouls would never be called lmao.  Mods should delete this comment for misinformation."
Oh shit. Do I like Draymond Green now? This is a really weird feeling.

Randle is a work out beast though. His body and nutrition has been top notch since his second or third year. He cut a bunch of fat and got ripped  People all clamor about Ingram but I thought randle really had the most potential. A point power forward who has the potential to play like draymond green? That’s a monster. (Of course he doesn’t have greens iq though)
"😂 smfh  Lemme guess...’YoU cAnT jUdGe hIm oFf sTaTs’  His fans are an absolute embarrassment to basketball. To continue to suggest that 100s of years of stats are irrelevant  only when judging Draymond Green. Apparently he is the first player in nba history to average 5 points on 15% fg and do nothing on the court but set screens , make passes to open men, and communicate on  defense. And these things save him from being deemed trash.   He. Is. trash."
It was a Draymond Green bitch move that's why it's a flag1
"My thoughts exactly. Draymond Green always the litmus test for determining true nephews on this sub...  These dudes clown on the guy when the Dubs lose and then prop him up when they go off as being ""THE difference maker, he goes beyond the box score"" yet they can't decide if he's washed or is still DPOY level, just depends on what narrative they wanna run with lmao"
Everyone knows Draymond Green is bad at scoring yet we get a post about his scoring every time he plays
Monkey's paw twitches. Wish granted.      Dame is traded to GSW for Draymond Green and a copy machine the very next day.
The capitol police didn’t stop the rioters for the same reason Draymond Green doesn’t guard Steph Curry
Actually if you look closely at the clip you can see that infact Draymond Green is the one committing the foul and not the refs
Shut the fuck up Mark Jackson. Of course it's a flagrant. It's Draymond dirt shit green. You're the fucking idiot that enabled him
Draymond Green numbers without the +/- lol
Draymond Green making threes the old fashioned way
Draymond Green hasn't attempted a shot
"So basically, it's just Danny  Green and Draymond Green."
"Ever since that fateful day the blazers (along with nearly every other team) passed on Draymond in the draft, he's been the missing piece.  I'll say it till I die, Draymond Green is the most important player on the warriors.  He's their leader."
Draymond Green effect...  Except DG is really good in D...
Damian lillard has been traded for draymond green
Draymond green is such a douche bag
Never before and never again will Draymond Green be compared to Margot Robbie
"You're drastically under-valuing how good Draymond is, to the point where it's a laughable comparison.   Covington is a good, versatile defender. Draymond Green is arguably the best all-around defender that I've ever seen. While there are a few guys who are probably better than him one-on-one (e.g., Scottie Pippen, Kawhi) I honestly don't think there's ever been a player who was so disruptive all over the floor on defense.   It's shocking how good he is at knowing when to leave his man to disrupt a play. It's like the dude can just apparate to where he's needed. (Comparing him to &lt;2006 players in this way isn't entirely fair, because the rules give him more freedom than they gave those guys, but there's no reason to give the great defenders of that era credit for his defensive IQ because it's not like anybody else in the league has his defensive IQ today.)  I haven't really seen Covington do that kind of captaining-of-the-defense that is Dray's real value: reading sets, and switching off-ball so that he's brought into the play by the offensive action. Also Covington isn't the rim protector Dray is."
Are we really going to act like draymond green has that much value in 2021 just because of the last 2 wins?
Draymond Green
"Giannis is a DPOY candidate every year and scores 30 a game. You can be a DPOY candidate and still be a role player. Gobert excels in defense and rebounding and is average/poor in other facets (scoring, passing, spacing, FT shooting). The fact that he excels in limited areas is the definition of a role player. And there is nothing wrong with that, I think most people would call Draymond Green a role player too. He and Gobert just happen to be 2 of the better role players in the league."
"Draymond Green is one of the most unique players in the league. With him it's the IQ first and foremost. He is short enough to stay in front of a lot of guards but has the strength and wingspan to be effective guarding bigs as well.  But it's not just the defense, he is one of the best facilitators as a big/wing in the league. Dame would love to have Dray setting screens and then dumping the ball off to Draymond when teams trap, resulting in a numbers advantage that Draymond is the best at taking advantage of.  He's the missing piece for this Blazers squad."
This is what I mean Ben Simmons is criminally underrated on this sub. People now questioning if Draymond fucking Green is a tier above him.  I blame 2k. People just don't know basketball anymore.
/r/nba: rides Ben Wallace’s dick   Also /r/nba: Draymond Green sucks because he can’t score
"Signing David Lee, Drafting Klay, Harrison Barnes, Festus Ezeli and Draymond Green. Trading Ellis for Bogut. Signing Iggy, Livingston and Barbosa."

Connor Mcgregor flaming the fuck out of Draymond Green will always be the funniest shit ever to me!!
If DeMarcus Cousins or Draymond Green did that they would've received a 5 game suspension lmao
How mad are you? 3 all nba players in their prime cried for the second best player in the league to come carry them against an old lebron because they were terrified of him.   Legoat dropped 40 with green gone then dropped another 40 on his head when he came back to shut the brain dead haters up for life   I honestly feel bad for draymond though. He would have had a finals mvp in 2016 if only he had some help in that game 7. That’s when he knew he needed to beg for kd to join

"Nope, we're not gonna be doing this revisionism.  ESPN's 2020-2021 preseason player rankings had Draymond Green at 44th and no other non-Curry Warrior in the top 100.  ESPN's 2016-2017 preseason player rankings had Steven Adams at 36th, Victor Oladipo at 48th, and Enes Kanter at 80th."
"LOL, [he literally swatted LeBron's balls after failing on a take down attempt](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/11/lebron-james-draymond-green-scuffle-game-4-warriors-cavs-finals) and then took another swat at his face but missed.  Regardless, let's say it was a BS call, what about Games 6 and 7?  Too mentally weak to bounce back?  Nah, I'm sure that you think Curry's ejection in the last minutes cost them the game *and* was bullshit too?"
Honestly I’m excited to see warriors vs Lakers and Clippers match up. Lebron always plays top notch defense and is aggressive against Curry. I’m also excited to see Draymond and Wiseman against AD and Gasol.   Gasol has the frame and the experience advantage but Wiseman is much faster and more athletic in general.   I also look forward to seeing Wiseman vs Zuback. The LA teams are a measuring stick in the league and even if you get beat you have Film to review and to see your weakness.   It’s going to be interesting. I don’t think Kawhi and PG see’s Steph and the warriors in general as big of a threat that Lebron and Vogel do.  Lebron probably can’t wait to play steph and Green again. The GSW are probably his biggest rivals second only to the spurs/Kawhi in general.
LOL! Draymond Green would be out of the league if it wasn't for the Warriors. Dude sucks.
"Draymond ""triple single"" Green in his first 3 games back. 4 assists, 8 assists, 5 assists. Still playing limited minutes due to recovery from COVID.   Draymond's impact is very clear. This team is finally starting to play like the Warriors and force teams into making tough decisions. He's also helped shore up the defense.  They will be really tested this month as they face the Clippers twice, the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Raptors and Pacers. Can the Warriors go .500 over this stretch? Can they not get blown out by the better teams?   This will be a really good test for a team that's just starting to click a little and finally has their second best player on the floor."
"Kendrick Perkins is Draymond Green minus the IQ, wit, and personality."
if draymond green said the ninja carried their teams then he obviously carried their teams. were you on the team to know or you just a fuicking fan bullshitting?
"Pair Dame with a player of Klay, 2014-2018 Draymond Green, and three years of Kevin Durant and we'll talk."
"per isn't really an advanced stat even if its being sold as much. it doesn't measure anything that isn't measure by box score stats, it just gives them a weight and adds them up. ditto for bpm.   the best advanced states we have for jordan are win shares which is kind of an antique, and two years of rapm. he does lead in bpm and winshares/48 also. the rapm is a bit complicated, it's usually pretty noisy, and you get weird results like terry mills beating him out for first in 1997, and harper beating him out for first in 1998 playoffs, and year to year you get draymond green having the all-time rapm season in 2015, but generally mj looks about as much of an all-time player in rapm as you can considering how noisy it is, it's the last years of his bulls career, and it's a multi-year regression, so i'm not sure how it weighs jordan's wizards years in the 97,98 if it brings it down or not."
he was serious.  look at this clip  https://youtu.be/wY73oq4OTd4?t=38   warriors about to win a title. steph wants to pump up the crowd and celebrate. draymond is still locked in and yelling at steph to take the ball up the court.   that's draymond green.

"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."

"Draymond fucking Green, makes me proud to be from the same alma mater. Sparty on."
Not sure about that. It sounds absurd but I'm pretty sure Haliburton is like the Draymond Green of this team that holds everything together. A lot to ask of a rookie but they play so much better with him out there.
Draymond Green is the most important triple single player of all time.

I had no idea I loved Draymond Green so much until last year. It's strange how opinions of players change over time. I hope the Warriors do well this year and in the future.
"Dellavedova shut Curry/Warriors down in the 2015 Finals    &gt; Stephen Curry missed an NBA Finals-record 13 3-point field goals (courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau) in Game 2, in large part thanks to Dellavedova's defense. Curry was 0-for-8 when guarded by Dellavedova on Sunday, including 0-for-5 from 3-point range, his worst shooting performance against a defender in any game this postseason. - [source](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0608%2FFSNBAFINALSDellavedovadefense.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg)   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Overall, Dellavedova held the Warriors to 3-for-15 shooting, including 0-for-6 from 3-point range, and forced six turnovers as a primary defender in Game 2. That's the most turnovers forced by a Cavaliers player in a game this postseason, and only Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton have forced more turnovers as the primary defender in any game this postseason.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Warriors shot 1-for-6 from the field and turned the ball over three times with Dellavedova as the primary defender; the Warriors shot 8-for-18 and turned it over once when guarded by anyone else in the half court over that same span.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Although this number is expected to be high since he was guarding Curry, it’s worth pointing out that Dellavedova contested 11 shots in Game 2, more than any other Cavaliers player."
"CP3 is the last I would blame for the Clippers' failures. Blake Griffin was injured just as often. DJ was not the same level of player as a Bosh or Draymond Green and they even at times had to take him out at the end of games because of his FT%. Jamal Crawford almost always shot the ball like ass come playoffs. Doc Rivers deserves some blame too.  Chris Paul averaged 21/4/9 and 2 steals on 48/39/88 shooting in the playoffs during his time with the Clips. If they had a third guy who was a bit more versatile than DJ or even a bench guy like Manu/Harden instead of a one-dimensional player like Crawford I think they would 100% have done better. Again, CP3 is the last of the bunch that I would blame."
they're not going to salary dump draymond green lmao.
"People's opinions on Draymond Green are literally my bellwether for how well they understand the game of basketball.   It's also why I laugh when people try to talk about declines or trading him or his contract (which as a max extension, not max new deal, is a good value). One of my friends was telling me the Warriors should *trade* Draymond."
That's what leadership sounds llke. Draymond green is a winner
what? the guy had the best comeback against Draymond Green.  I would not say he is annoying besides the COVID thing.
"Yeah they gave Steph the green light to kill and Klay got comfortable in the NBA and they become the most lethal shooting duo ever. I’m not saying Draymond is a bad player but he is most definitely a beneficiary of playing with. Hall of Famers such as Steph, Klay, Iggy, KD."
Draymond “Mr Miyagi” Green. What a great teacher.
attacking gobert for not being worth the money is fucking stupid when he's been the best player on a west playoff team like 4 years in a row now  shaq doesn't understand basketball. He probably thinks draymond green is overrated too
"I don't like Draymond Green, but I could listen to him talk about defense for an hour. He is a really smart defensive player."
How is their current team not a total mess? Draymond green is their second best offensive player
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
"I don’t care what anyone says, Draymond Green is the most overrated athlete of all time."
These posts are cringe as hell. I think it’s tough to evaluate Draymond Green because he’s never been on a team where he wasn’t surrounded by two or three of the best shooters of all time. In his peak people would have you believe he was a top ten/top 15 player in the NBA but I don’t think that was ever the case tbh
Draymond Green is good at the game of basketball.

"Curry is back, Draymond Green is in the house, and I am back in love while my actual team is literally *the best in the league*."
"I read this as Draymond ""very long quote"" Green. Was disappointed there was no Green at the end."
"&gt; heavily underrating prime klay and Dray  Klay and Dray did not truly make a leap into ""elite"" territory until the 2016 season.  Klay was the second best scorer on the Dubs and in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 playoffs he averaged 15,16 and 18ppg. Those are just straight up average numbers for someone expected to share a burden of the scoring load. The Warriors don't even make it past the Rockets in the 2015 WCF when both Ariza and Dwight Howard outplayed Klay, who averaged 17ppg to Steph's 31ppg.  I've watched the Warriors since the 2001 21-win team, followed Steph since Davidson and watched both the rise of Klay and Draymond supplanting David Lee in Kerr's system.  There is absolutely no way in hell Klay and Dray were close to carrying Curry between 2013-2015, and no way in hell they sniff the WCF in 2015 let alone the Finals without Steph.  You wanna know what the hot takes were between 2013-2016?  - ""Klay would be average on any other team, outside of Steph's gravity and Kerr's system. He's basically a glorified Kyle Korver with better defense. He'll never be a primary scoring option.""  - ""Draymond Green would be average on any other team. He can't score consistently enough and is replaceable with pretty much any traditional big. He looks better than he does because he's surrounded with the best backcourt in the league.""  Yeah...the other two guys always mentioned in the same breath as Steph were being clowned as ""role players"" who would be nothing without Steph or GSW's system. And yet you want to try to convince the people who were watching these games 7-8 years ago that Klay and Dray were HOFers from the moment they set foot on the floor with Steph? FOH. Obviously, Klay and Dray took the next step in 2016, but prior to that they were parts in a system in which Steph was the engine. Put those three together and the system was always much greater than the sum of its parts, but absolutely none of it works without Curry at all.  Even the 2016 Warriors (who were ""stacked"") en route to winning 73 games in the regular season had a straight up NEGATIVE offensive rating ANY TIME Steph was off the floor. I don't know how anyone can forget the starters building a 20+ point lead through 3 quarters, then when just Steph (Klay still rotated into the 2nd team quite a bit) sat out that lead would evaporate and Kerr would have to throw Steph back in to keep the offense from looking lost.  So please - next time you are trying to convince people that they're ""underrating prime Klay and Dray"" actually make sure those people weren't watching those very same players more closely than you and/or state some facts to support your argument, cause the numbers don't lie; Steph carried his teammates, especially so in 2015."
Wiggins and Oubre (1-5 Brothers) sitting all alone in the two corners while all the Blazers defense pays attention to Steph and Draymond “ShortRoll” Green on every possession.
Draymond “Kwame Brown” Green
"In this subreddit, there were posts asking if Steph was the guy who could make everyone on his team better for GSW, right below videos of Draymond Green teaching James Wiseman how to be better on defense.  Steph does help his teammates, but Draymond seems like he takes a lot of pride in coaching the people around him. It also seems like he is going to be in Wiseman's life a lonnnng time as a mentor and a dude Wiseman can text and ask BB questions even when he's no longer a rook. Draymond Green seems like he takes pride in being that dude for his team."
"I'm confused. I never argued Steph was the best PG of all time. I recognise that he's second behind Magic.  And yeah, you build your team to make up for your star's deficiencies/build the team to benefit your star's strengths. Curry has had teams that fit him well. It's not like you place CP3 in that 2016 Warriors roster and they still win 73 games. The Warriors were blowing teams out by the end of the 3rd quarter because of Steph's offensive superiority.  Teams have hunted for Curry in the playoffs to varying degrees of success. Cleveland succeeded in 2016, but the Rockets failed in 2018 and 2019 and Cleveland failed in the other years as well. Targeting Steph for mismatches wasn't completely because of the mismatch, but also to avoid having to iso against Klay, Draymond, KD or Iggy. Steph's just always been the weak link relatively, not due to his actual weaknesses as a defender.  Once again, I'm not claiming Steph is a great defender, just a good one. He has active hands to steal balls, rebounds defensively, rotates very well, switches well, plays according to the defensive scheme and either doesn't let his defender blow by him or guides his defender into the help defense of, say, Draymond Green. He absolutely gets bodied in the paint, can't block jumpshots and stars can blow past him. None of these are large enough factors to deem Curry an average or below average defender though. Even in an all-time match he would get targeted by the opposing team, but certainly not abused, especially with some all-time great defenders on his side too to help double and rotate."

It's so cute how she's interested in the game"

Has Draymond Green ever considered removing the invisible backpack before shooting?
"Ball dominant doesn't mean you don't pass the ball, it means that the ball has to come to you a certain number of times.  A big part of the falling out in Golden state was because durant stopped buying into the system their second year and started asking for the ball more.  That was the root cause of the blow up between him and draymond green.  But you probably didn't know that because you don't pay attention, thats OK just don't accuse others of it as well."

Being directed by Draymond Green makes you a significantly better defender
"Sure, technically ""Look at these scrubs DPOY candidate Draymond Green has to play with"" counts as in the conversation."
"I think we’re giving Simmons too much credit if we are saying he’s a better version of draymond, if for no other reason than Ben being possibly the only starting forward in the nba who doesn’t shoot better than him. He’s also not as good of a defender. I think it’s more accurate to say Ben is draymond with a green light to score."
Draymond Green is honestly the best I've seen in a long time.
"I get that he could be a perimeter version of Draymond, but that's a very special situation where Green has been surrounded by two of the best shooters of all time.  Those are not easy circumstances to come by."
"OK? Shake Milton is scoring way more on better efficiency than Draymond, so clearly the Shake &gt; Draymond Green. It's an utterly stupid argument, Steph has looked horrific defensively while LeBron has looked really good defensively. Steph putting up more PPG on better efficiency does not mean he's playing better."
"&gt; I noticed you haven't brought up my issue that he can't shoot to save his life.   Because he's still a top 25 player without a jumper? Not factoring in what else he brings, his career TS is 58% and he's scoring 16 a game. His lack of jumper adds to his value in a way. How many poor shooters became decent as their careers progressed? I'm not saying Simmons will, but the point is even if he doesn't add a jumper,  you still have a top 25 player. At his age and experience, that is the easiest thing to add to his game. Worst case scenario you have Simmons as is. That's a lot better floor then what those draft picks could end up being.  &gt;Houston isn't Minessota or Sacramento, young free agents will come to Houston with or without Simmons  Who were the last players on Simmons level to leave there teams through free agency? They went to L.A, Brooklyn, Golden State, and Miami (unless you count Howard in 2013 going to Houston). And you know what all those teams had in common? They were good and/or had some established players (Lakers maybe not as much).   &gt;I'd rather have Draymond Green in his prime on a cheaper contract than have to over pay for Simmons. Green in his prime put up similar numbers as Simmons but can actually knock down a 3 or two.  Draymond's one year prime where he was the second best player on a 73 win team. A year he never was able to repeat. If you can find a player that was as good as Draymond was in 2016 who can keep up that production in either the draft or as a cheap free agent you should be executive of the year. Comparing someone to Draymond at his best isn't the insult you intended it to be."
Just pack the rim; he's too weak to finish through contact and he won't develop his offensive game to extend beyond 3 feet from the basket.  I saw the Ringer make the comment that at this rate his ideal role is either turning into Draymond Green or run him as a small-ball 5. I'm inclined to agree.
"I think most people here are agreeing but the Sixers should have taken this 100%. This roster wasn’t even good enough to win before, now they’ll be competing with the Nets on top of everyone else in the East. Best case scenario Maxey becomes the next harden and even that is 5+ years away best case scenario. Meanwhile Simmons is playing like Draymond green but they need him to be the next LeBron if they want a shot at this."
Draymond green generates a lot of open threes for himself too.
"They just need to help Maxey learn more and put him gradually as the playmaker. Ben can become more of a Draymond Green as the 3/4. That will maximize their strengths with both Him and Jo playing bully ball downlow with Harris, Curry and Maxey roaming around."
Ben Simmons checks off the eye test some nights and fails completely other night. He really needs to be perceived as a draymond green type of player instead of a Lebron or rondo type.
"&gt;I watched those seasons too. On what basis are you arguing they had better seasons? Because LeBron was better offensively and defensively than all of those guys and he had a better season  What seasons are you talking about? KD, curry, harden and Gianni's all had more offensive impacts in there regular season MVPs then LeBron did in those seasons. Your forgetting LeBron gives 70% effort in the regular season. Just because he dominated in the postseason that year doesn't mean he deserved MVP. It's like people who thought LeBron deserved MVP last year. He was the best player in the NBA last season but Gianni's was a better offensive and defensive player in the regular season..   I agree +/- can be flawed but when it's consistent over many seasons that tells you something. Draymond green also has one of the highest +/- of all time for a season and that purely came from playing with Steph..  Lebrons amazing but he deserves one more MVP then he's won."
Draymond green is my pick
"When Draymond was in, KD was playing the 4 anyways so he wasn’t really a small ball 5. Also he’ll play small ball 5 in opportune times for a few minutes. Not for super long stretches. In the playoffs rotations tighten which means less minutes for guys like DJ and Reggie Perry and more for the stars and Jeff Green."
Draymond green.   People still acting like his 4/2/2 average is acceptable cause hE mAkEs nIcE pASsEs
I think to have a draymond green role atthe warriors
"Draymond had a 3-5 year peak of being an elite player. Pierces was around 12 years, and in each of those 12 years he was a better player than green. I agree that draymond is a great player, but pierce was a finals MVP. The first option on a championship team."
That draymond green tweet about 'he hasn't earned that call' talking about herro I think last season wound me up so much
Draymond Green.
I agree. It’s basically building a team around a more athletic 2015 Draymond Green but you have to pay him 40 million a year to do it and without Steph and Klay
Draymond Green isn’t worth his bloated contract and contributes nothing on the offensive end of the floor. We could start Eric Paschall in his place for rookie money and nothing would change.
"He should be given a role similar to draymond green.  He could leverage so many advantages with his passing skill and he seems like he'd have no problems hustling off ball, hitting the lane forcing defenses to collapse."
Manu Ginobili  Paul George  Danny Granger  Draymond Green  Kevin Garnett
Kuzma-Zion-Julius Randle- Draymond Green - Kevin Love
"im gonna start muting ""draymond green"" on this subreddit holy shit"
Draymond Green is completely worthless without multiple stars around him
Draymond Green to see just how much there is to communication on defence at an absolute elite level.      Chris Paul to see just how much there is to communication on offence at an absolute elite level.
Eat the sunk cost and just play Ben as a Draymond Green. It’s unfortunate but he will never be more than a high end role player with his lack of shooting
"Just watched the last 5 min and it happened every time. His quick to drive up the full court and into the key but doesn’t make any dribble moves to the basket to score. Doesn’t even look to score. No dunk, no floater. Nothing. Predictable as shit. Everyone just sticks to their man.   He’s just a taller Draymond Green. At least he attempts to score."
Klay Thompson and draymond green
Only if draymond green is traded to one of them
This has really flipped so much. I remember we used to say Green was the 2nd best player and plenty of people would still have him there in their championship years. Maybe the big shots are easier to see than the cold nights or all those things Draymond does that fans aren’t watching.
"lmao moe harkless, draymond was even talking trash about it during their series because of that iirc  source: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/blazers-warriors-draymond-green-gets-in-harkless-head-with-very-specific-trash-talk/  “You ain't gonna shoot it. You're still chasing that petty-ass change”  lmao draymond also said “If you hit this, I might think about contesting the next one”.... goddamn"
You're 100% right but casual fans won't know what you mean. The people who think Draymond Green is overrated. The people who don't have a defensive mentality.
"I saw a ""who is better: Pascal Siakam or Julius Randle?"" Post on here like three days ago.  You're comparing a guy on one of the worst teams of the decade to the guy who hit the championship-clinching shot over Draymond Green in the 2019 Finals but sure okay."
"There were two major disconnects, but the major one was you saying that AK47 couldn't even be compared to Draymond Green. The other was your definition of ""all time player"" which is much more expansive than mine.   Also, Draymond is a shoe in for the hall of fame lol"
"Idk if I can say simmons is a top 25 player. He will be  a better draymond green if paired with stars.   But yes, my main issue with simmons is he has all the job security in the world and the sixers would have no problem with him shooting a low % to improve his shot and become more well rounded, yet he still doesn’t. At all. Passes up open shots, isn’t able to close games, etc."
Is Alex Caruso the new Draymond Green?
"r/nba is a tale of two cities. On one hand, you get some decent basketball evaluation and threads like the Draymond Green play-breakdown. And on the other, there's this.  If this is somehow unironic, every single possible metric tells you that Trae Young is much much more valuable. Even when he's playing like an absolute bum so far in this small sample size, he STILL has a higher RAPTOR and WAR than Dort. And last year, it wasn't even close. Trae Young is a top 25-30 player with an All-NBA ceiling. Dort will be a fantastic role-player/defensive specialist/3rd-4th option on a good team. Maybe even a part-time all-star if everything plays out in his favor.  Trae Young is so much more impactful. The discussion we're having here is like comparing Tyler Herro to Giannis. I love Herro, but this is comical."
"Not really a nobody, but I am a huge fan of Draymond Green. Mr.Triple Single has won my respect."
"He can't be GOAT teammmate.  Competitor, Passionate, vocal leader, ceiling raiser, yes.  He played a part in getting KD to GSW and also in getting him out of GSW.  A GOAT teammate can't get [suspended](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/14/18094749/draymond-green-kevin-durant-bitch-suspension-warriors-gmib) by the team for conduct unbecoming (for calling KD a bitch)"
"it seems morey and the now stone both feel that someone being undersized is easily on how he can get overlooked.  Tate looks like a hybrid of pj tucker and Draymond green, type of guy who can just add to any squad hes on. Incredible find and for 3 years."
"This sub if filled with dumbass 10 year olds who look for any and every chance to meme. Somehow a 6’11” guy not shooting 3s became the biggest meme on this awful sub because he’s listed as a PG on b-ref I guess. The Simmons/Embiid pairing on offense will never be perfect, but defensively it’s special and Simmons is a helluva player. I like the idea that’s been floated around of the Sixers trading for Kyle Lowry. He can be the primary ball handler in the half court and Ben can function as a something of a Draymond Green on steroids."
Draymond Green has played multiple playoff series where he was better on offense and defense than Gobert ever has been.   There is so much more to offense than points and so much more to defense than blocks.   Draymond's incredible passing more than makes up for Gobert's lob catching. Both are great players than shouldn't be summarized with box score stats though.
"I think he's a more athletic draymond green, a nice 4."
I'd take him over simmons as well. It's becoming more and more likely that simmons turns into a draymond green like player than a true superstar. There's nothing wrong with that but 2 years so you might've hoped he improved his scoring by now. That just doesn't appear to be the case and seems unlikely he ever will be a 22 ppg scorer.   Brown on the other hand just continues to improve and I just see him fitting better with more players. Simmons is a very unique player who in the right system could be monstrous but needs a lot to fit. Brown is essentially your dream wing that you can fit on any team.
"&gt;I understand the miscommunication...  What miscommunication? We said 4 points a game isn't enough. You pretended that this meant we were complete idiots that didn't realize the incredibly obvious fact that most of Dray's value comes on the defensive end.  Was that actually miscommunication? Or were you just going out of your way to be a dick?  &gt;... but I really thought it was understood that we were dealing with a small sample size and nobody in the Warriors organization is losing any sleep over Draymond scoring 4 points instead of 7.  Sure it is a small sample size, but that doesn't mean that he needs to do better as the season goes on, right?  If you say that, yes, he does need to do better than 4 points a game, does it mean you don't understand Green is an elite defender?  &gt;It's like fretting that Clayton Kershaw is batting is 1 for his first 20 at bats when he should have a batting average of .150.  That's a horrible analogy because of how much more interconnected offensive production is in the NBA compared to baseball. I mean, there are tons of plays where the defense just completely ignores Green to double team other players. Green gets the ball and he still can't do shit productive with it *despite not being guarded much of the time.*  The increased stress that places on the rest of the offense is hard to replicate in baseball. It would almost be like if Kershaw going 1 for 20 meant that the next 5 batters only got 2 strikes before being called out.  If that was the case, then yeah, Kershaw's struggles at the plate would be a problem. It probably wouldn't be enough to make him a net negative compared to a pitcher on the equivalent of a two-way contract, but certainly might be bad enough to question if he deserves a $31M a year contract.  &gt;It's not nearly enough evidence to say he's dropped off as a scorer/batter.  Saying that the scoring will pick up doesn't mean that we are wrong to say that 4 points isn't good enough.  &gt;We know this because we've seen Draymond dominate scoring less than 10 points for a long time now.  Have we? He was under 10 ppg his first two seasons, which I wouldn't call ""dominant"" years overall. Then he had 4 years scoring 10 ppg or more. KD's last year, Green was at 7.4 before going 8.0 ppg last year and 4.0 ppg this year.  How many of those years under 10 ppg would you say he was ""dominant""? The last KD year is probably the only one you can make a case for. One year isn't really ""a long time now"" though, is it?  On top of that, I think most people can accept that lower scoring from Green when you have a 30 y/o KD, 28 y/o Klay, and 30 y/o Curry. When you have no Klay, no KD, and a 32 y/o Curry, you might need Green to step it up a little more than the 7.4 ppg he did that year."
I understand the miscommunication but I really thought it was understood that we were dealing with a small sample size and nobody in the Warriors organization is losing any sleep over Draymond scoring 4 points instead of 7. This entire thread is summarizing Draymond's game using stats that we all know aren't measuring what Draymond green has proven to be elite at the last 5 years.   It's like fretting that Clayton Kershaw is batting is 1 for his first 20 at bats when he should have a batting average of .150.   1. It's not nearly enough evidence to say he's dropped off as a scorer/batter.  2. It's really not all that important to what he brings to the table as a player. We know this because we've seen Draymond dominate scoring less than 10 points for a long time now.  3. Its especially silly in Draymond's case because his passing has completely unlocked Curry's offense and anyone watching the games could tell you this.
"Okay Draymond has played 8 games so far. I think we are both smart enough to realize that him improving from 4 points per game to 7 points per game is what is most likely going to happen. We don't have to go crazy with small sample sizes.   I saw Draymond Green completely destroy my team in 4 straight games in the western conference finals I think it is incredibly premature to say he isn't worth his contract just 18 months removed from being the 2nd best player in the west finals. He's feeling things out and his scoring numbers are very far down the list of his and the warriors priorities right now.   Ben Wallace never averaged 10ppg and was easily worth this kind of money even though he doesn't bring anywhere near Draymond's play making skill. It's just not a very useful measuring stick to evaluate his value as a player when we know its not what he's being paid for in the first place.   To be clear though, if Draymond actually averaged only 4ppg on 40% TS for the full season then it would be unlikely for him to be worth his contract. I thought we were smart enough to assume some regression to the mean."
"I will preface this by saying I have never liked Draymond Green.    I don’t care what you people think. Sure, during Steph Curry’s 63 point game Dray led the team in plus minus at +22 on like 5/5/5 splits (Wiggins was +20). He’s been shit. He was bad all of last year and he’s still bad. It his hype reminds me of Hibbert in like 2012. He’s a great vocal leader and organizer of the defense, but at this point he’s a detriment to the team when he’s on the floor. He may as well take a Haslem role.  Edit: spelling and such"
You don’t watch basketball. Draymond  has been great this year   Peoples opinions on draymond green is a great litmus test to see if they actually understand basketball. You failed
Ben Wallace has lead the league in rebounding and block shots before. Draymond Green has never lead the league in anything.
"There was a report just last week that Dame wanted portland to trade for Draymond.    https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/07/report-damian-lillard-has-lobbied-trail-blazers-to-trade-for-warriors-draymond-green/   I believe the overwhelming reponse was the Warriors wouldnt entertain an offer, and I highly doubt that position has changed."
"Blake Griffin would be great on TV. I’d probably want him or Embiid, Draymond Green, and Redick"
You're getting off topic. I was saying a Draymond green trade for Horford wasn't a good idea imo.
"Come on, man. I find it a bit offensive that someone with Steph Curry and Draymond Green on their team is willing to say LaMelo has *elite* court vision. He has *good* court vision, but he's not even on the same planet as CP3, Curry, Harden, LeBron, Luka, or Jokic. Give him a couple of seasons and then we can have that conversation."
"I think I share all the same doubts with you but there’s always the chance. Blazers continue to be cursed with Nurkic breaking his wrist and they don’t have a backup guard but maybe Collins and Simons step up like people have been expecting.   Losing Grant hurts for Denver but I think once Jamychal Green gets integrated he can replicate some of that defense and add some more BBIQ at the cost of the energy Grant brought. Murray also needs to become consistent for anything to happen there.   With the Warriors, I just think that Steph-Draymond guarantees at least a playoff berth, and if Oubre/Wiggins/Wiseman can at least be ok collectively instead of starting off the year shooting 5% from three (lol) that elevates a little.   Gobert’s been fine - he does what he does and can guard on the perimeter capably. Their bigger problem seems to be Mitchell’s inconsistency (like Murray) and the fact that they can’t seem to get the best out of the combination of Mitchell/Conley/Bogdanovich at once.   All this to say, I think I would also put Mavs in tier 2 and top 4 but think it’s kind of shaky ground still."
"&gt;Wonder what's going on.  Normally Draymond threads (and Warriors threads in general) are pretty polarizing so not much meaningful discussion goes on. No matter what you say, you are almost always labeled a fan boy or a hater.  With that said, I'm willing to stick my neck out and offer up the idea for discussion that maybe Green has trouble self motivating. I know that's going to sound crazy, but hear me out.  Before last season, we've pretty much never seen him as a key player on a bad team. His Michigan State team went to the final four in his first two years there and won the conference his Senior year. His worst season was as a junior but they still made the tournament that year.  In the NBA, his worst season prior to last year was his rookie year where they still won 47 games. Over the next 6 seasons, the Warriors *averaged* 62 wins on their way to 5 finals appearances and 3 titles.   Even with all that success, it was still a pretty widely accepted fact that Green was perfectly willing to coast during parts of the regular season. Normally, success makes motivation *easier.* If he was part of historic levels of success and *still* did things that illustrated potential issues with self motivation, I don't think people should be that surprised if he seems disengaged during a season where his team probably tops out at a first round playoff exit."
"So Draymond Green is the first guy ever that we can’t look at the box score to determine  his value? Or to put it better, he’s the first guy whose contributions can’t be quantified? Really?   Dennis Rodman is one—-well actually no his talent showed up in thr box actor with 16, 17 rebounds per game.   So Draymond is the only guy in hoops that we can only judge by eye tests and some fake sense of basketball iq (‘you just don’t get it it’s more to the game than points’) Really? Please"
"green has amazing tangibles but unless hes on and sharp every night, his offense is diminishes his value.  everything else you are saying is trash though. Draymond is still a positive asset and many teams would trade for him immediately."

"If you kind of think about it and squint really hard Ben Simmons is just a more athletic Draymond Green  Edit: I know he’s better but there games are pretty similar, also Ben doesn’t kick people in the balls as much"
"its fine, enjoy draymond green on your team"
have you seen draymond green play basketball?  these comments baffling when hes clearly garbage if you watch
"Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green and Damian Lillard"
So a regular draymond green game
"I'm still a heavy Draymond Green defender because of his passing and defence, but for one play against the Raptors he was literally left wide open at the three-point line (like nobody within 15 feet of him) for several seconds and he didn't even try to shoot the ball. He's legitimately one of the worst scorers in the entire league."
He is a above average player that has been in a excellent situation most of his career.  Even green fans will tell you he was better a few years back but they try to act like it's a natural decline but he is only 30. His decline has came from injuries to Steph and Klay and reduced quality role players.  Hey s defense looked better when teams were worried about being outscored and forced bad quick shots. His playmaking was better because he had all time great shot makers around him that put his passes in the basket and his teammates allowed for very little focus on him. Even at his peak draymond was only a good rebounder and not great.
Draymond Green (Chuck)   Joel Embiid (Shaq)  CJ Mcollum (Kenny)
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
Draymond Green is one of the best Assistant Coaches in the NBA
"Shannon, don’t clown Alfred like that, he is more a draymond green who brings the entire team together, the ultimate glue guy. Kylie is more of Jean Paul Valley (Azrael).  Brought in to cover for Batman but ends up being a murderous dollar store variant."
Draymond Green. I feel he is under appreciated because he doesn’t score a lot. But he’s probably my favorite player.
Because Lebron doesn’t also have prime Klay Thompson and Draymond Green
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
Simmons is more of a super role player than a superstar. He'd be great if he was the equivalent of Draymond Green on a team that had 2 great offensive players.
Man his style like prime draymond green. You can't win with that when you can't score points  I know they can't be one dimensional but he needs to be the third option like the dude said  What philly needs is bradley beal honestly. I could see them making the finals with him. Without no way they ever get past ecf. You shut down embid and you think simmons going to win you the game? He literally can't score enough points
"He's like some sort of draymond green, you gotta pair him with other stars to make his game shine, but him alone they aint got any chance. Def overrated"
The question mark wasn't meant to imply that OP didn't know if Draymond was better than 34 year old Jeff Green. The question mark was because no one knows who is going to be the starting power forward on the Nets now that their depth is gone
"Draymond &gt;&gt; Jeff Green if you take intangibles into account (things like locker room, defensive presence, etc.)"
No lol  Curry &gt; Kyrie  Klay &lt; Harden  2017 KD &gt; 2020 KD  Draymond Green &gt; Jeff Green? lol  Zaza/McGee/Jones = Jordan
"Absolutely. Especially since all 3 (kyrie, harden, KD) cry about it passive-aggressively if they dont get their way. Hard examples  1. Kyrie with Lebron cries hes not alpha and wants to leave and lead his own team. goes to new team and doesnt lead and cries more if it doesnt go his way. Definition of Beta. Did that with Boston doing it now in Brooklyn 2. KD in his last year with GSW starts to complains how he feels like hes not the first option, feels like he should have the ball in his hands more. To a certain degree valid.. but passively agressively dropping hints about it on twitter/social media without talking it through with teammates. Not right not a leader. Draymond green was the one that pointed this out after he left. He's a prolific score no doubt.. but its not like steph is not the greatest shooter of all time and not a 2 time mvp. or Klay is not a HoF caliber shooter (sarcasm just incase yall dont see it). The right steps towards good communication with that much firepower ... couldve evolved that squad if it weren't for injuries. 3. James harden really tried sticking with the rockets man. BUT, again recently passively aggressively saying its not working, ignoring Covid protocol, not showing up for camp while being seen partying and in clubs? Not a leader. its also an issue when 2 HoF point guards complain about the same thing. lack of defense and no interest in helping the offense off ball. not even spacing wise.  KD and Harden are HoF no doubt, but KD's ignorance about saying he didnt take the easy way with Golden state makes no sense. His thunder were up 3-1 against them right before he went to GSW.  TLDR: yes and it should. Still the strongest offensively talented trio the game has ever seen put together. It will be fun to watch them implode. If they make it work though... Lord almighty."
"I think you can be useful without scoring, but I have seen Ben become useless on the offensive end in the playoffs. Like he stops attacking the rim to score with any force so he becomes an offensive detriment. Draymond can do what he does because Curry and Klay are so dynamic. He was pretty much useless last year without them. Ben is far too gifted to try and limit him to Draymond Green on offense"
"I honestly hate this trade. We gave up two perfectly good pieces for what? Sure Harden is one of the best players on the planet, but it doesn't make up for losing our frontcourt. Allen was playing leagues better than DJ. Plus LeVert was such a great piece at getting plays going when neither of our stars were on the floor. At least we finally got rid of Prince. But what is gonna happen with our frontcourt. We can't play KD for all the minutes at the 4 every game. And DJ ain't gonna cut it. Jeff Green better be able to play big at 6.8 (but he ain't no Draymond). I hope we get better with this trade, at least when Kyrie and Harden aren't clubbing together while COVID is showing its ugly head still."
What would happen if PJ Tucker and Draymond Green played in the same lineup?
The Sixers are going to regret not trading Draymond Green with better handles for James Harden
"I don't want to defend Mark Jackson the coach, but this is really overdoing it. Draymond didn't play the 4 much his rookie year because the Warriors had David Lee and Karl Landry, but when lee got hurt in the playoffs Draymond played 20 minutes a game. Then in his second year Draymond played in all 82 games averaging over 20 min a game, which went up to over 30 in the playoffs because Bogut got hurt.   Obviously Lee getting hurt and Kerr giving the starting spot to Green was huge for the jump Green took. But to say that Green was not playing and almost out of the league is completely disingenuous"
"Klay Thompson was the premier 3, and D guard in the league before his injury. Green has 2 DPOY.  That has nothing to do with the front office, or Kerr. That was all training from before Kerr took the job. Mark Jackson put that dog into them. You all kids hate people who are demanding, but demanding people get results. Mark, for all his crazy tactics, demanded they play tough defense. Draymond, and Klay were arguably the 2 most important defensive pieces on that team. Despite Boguts claims, he was just a token big man who's job was made easier by the outstanding team defense.   Gotta give Jackson his due. Hate on everything else, but to not give him credit for molding them into defensive players, is just silly."
"This is coming from Draymond ""PR tour through apartheid state Israel"" Green.   They weren't fucking terrorists they were a bunch of mentally regressive morons doing exactly what the president they voted for and the news stations they trusted told them to do. Fox news has been blaring how the election was stolen for months and so has the president. Just cus you recognize they are a bunch of liars doesn't mean a bunch of idiots don't recognize that the PRESIDENT and one of the LARGEST NEWS NETWORKS IN THE COUNTRY do.   They literally got up in there and took selfies. Some cop got hit with a fire hydrant and some lady got shot. Woopdie fuckin do, still isn't a coup. It was a fucking spectacle that attempts to set apart the incoming administration from the outgoing one, as if it isn't a whole lot more of what we've had for 40 years. As if it isn't being ran by people who have been fucking this country up for decades."
"[Simmons averages](https://prnt.sc/wmxc5c) [Harden averages](https://prnt.sc/wmxcio)  Also, if you watched both respectively you would see Simmons entire role gets drastically modified from ball handling point guard to dunker spot with less spacing than Draymond Green. The 76ers were more comfortable getting JJ Redick to be playoff ball handler than their all-nba PG Ben Simmons. And I love both of these players."
"Lol i come with real arguments and you come with this ad hominen shit "" for years the litmus to test to see if somebody watches basketball or watches box scores is their opinion on draymond Green and you failed the test"" hahahahahahhaha Wtf grow up kiddo, start watching Warriors games too btw"
"Such a shit take. He is the best defender on the team and still one of the best defenders in the NBA, he is one of the best playmaking forwards in the NBA, he is basically an on court coach his synergy with curry changes the team   Admit it you don't watch basketball. for years the litmus to test to see if somebody watches basketball or watches box scores is their opinion on draymond Green and you failed the test    You see somebody who isn't a scorer and just call him trash. you don't watch basketball and if you do than that's even worse because you have no idea what you are watching"
He's too much of a vet to make such a dumb panic move. If Wiseman did that he wouldn't get half the hate because he's a rookie. 3-time champ and Draymond Green can't be going around make those sorta panic plays. It doesn't matter if he's not paid to score.

"Ok, so my starting lineup is Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Jared Dudley, Draymond Green and Boban Marjanovic. My Bench is KC Jones, Dennis Rodman (at SF), and Ben Wallace / Noah as the bigs.  Boban is going to be involved in every minute of the game, probably getting a dunk on nearly every possession. The rest of the team bust their ass playing 4-on-5 defense while he jogs back and just camps under the rim."
"&gt; you don't have to watch a guy play to see they aren't doing well  You're proving with these comments how wrong this statement is. IMO Kuzma is having the best year of his career, and if you're only looking at stats and instead think he's been a disappointment then that proves that you need to be watching him play. His scoring is down this year, but the guy is on a team that's absolutely loaded with offensive weapons, starting with LeBron and AD, but also with guys like Schroder and Trez.   Kuzma is playing so well because he's contributing in other areas. His rebound % and block % are both at career highs (as are his numbers there per 100 possessions), and he's shooting a career high 39% from 3. Do the Lakers need Kuzma to be a big time scorer? No. What they need is for him to be a capable defender/rebounder and to be able to hit open 3s if he's left alone by the defense, and that's exactly what he's doing this year. That's probably a big reason why his win shares/48 minutes is also at a career high.   Kuzma came into the league as a guy who was basically just a scorer. He could absolutely go off for 20, 30 or even [40 points](https://youtu.be/hwm7xsnZtCQ) in a game, but who gave you little else. With LeBron and AD on the team though, Kuzma got pushed out of the starting lineup and has had to re-work his game to fit that of a role player, rather than as some ""3rd star"" or something. Kuzma is doing exactly what coach Frank Vogel asks him to do: he's being a star in his role. It's why people who are paying attention are lavishing praise on his play this year, people like [Draymond Green who just tweeted the other day about how impressed he was with him this season.](https://twitter.com/Money23Green/status/1357559866370502658)  I'm telling you, if you're not actually watching a player play, then you should hold off on coming with such declarative takes about their game. You don't know what you're talking about and it shows when you talk so authoritatively about something you're woefully uninformed about."
Shoutout Mr. Silver suspending draymond green
Why you gotta disrespect to Bill Russell? He would be a bigger/faster/stronger version of draymond green.
That one user on here who made a post about  Draymond Green possibly being autistic
Aye. And also Draymond Green (all the 10 year olds on instagram said he was carried by Curry and KD)
"KG wasn't near as good a playmaker as Draymond, tho he has the size and shooting advantage. Green is a phenomenal passer and has very good ball handling ability for his size"
Draymond green is one of the most sought-after defensive player today who cant shoot to save his life. He would probably still be good today because he won 4 dpoy even without a reliable jumper
Draymond Green?
"Rodman all time, past few year's it's been Draymond Green"
"Who do you cheer for?  Why won't you answer that.   Also Porter hadn't jumped when Lowry starts tracking the ball.  But you just admitted you think Lowry would risk an injury to himself to make it look like an accident that he injured someone else.  Are you high?  His motivation was to go box out.  He plays with a very high motor, and he was trying to make a hustle play to help his team.  The thing is sometimes when you're going full tilt you make poor, reckless decisions.    Zaza Pachulia, Bruce Bowen, Draymond Green, Kevin Garnett - those are dirty players.  Lowry is aggressive, he's definitely borderline with some plays, but acting like he's even in the same stratosphere as those guys is ludicrous.   Although reading how you write, I'm not surprised you think a handful of YouTube links and a bunch of lies is an education."
Wasn't Griffin a decent passer and midrange shooter? He can try remodeling his game based on Draymond Green. He has to retool or else be irrelevent.
Draymond Green should make the Hall of Fame. He has enough accolades to make it in my book.
"The supporting casts of the 80s Lakers and Celtics made it... using that bar, Draymond Green getting in is consistent I think."

"I live in America but I only got into basketball last year. I'm from Michigan, but I don't have any strong affiliation to the Pistons. I feel like that home team spirit is something you get from being a kid and watching everyone else root for them.  Instead, I just root for the players I like watching. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Jokic and most recently Lamelo Ball are players I root for."
"I think these two could be good in a half time show. Add Draymond Green and idk, Steven Adams"
"I read the article, it's stupid. It's basically arguing that employees should have the right to determine if and when they work. We have a term for that type of setup, it's called ""self-employed.""  &gt; The Cavs took him out of the lineup because it’s the best thing for their team. But if Drummond had demanded a trade and chose to limit his own minutes to do what’s best for Drummond – sort of like what James Harden just did in Houston – the narrative would have been much different.  If Drummond wanted to sit out, nobody could or would stop him. No one's gonna put a gun to his head and force him to play. However, there are contractual penalties that come with refusing to work in the NBA, the same as there are for refusing to work in any other job. If Frank Vogel or Pat Riley or Doc Rivers refused to do their job, they'd also face penalties.   NBA contracts are payment for services rendered, it's not just free money for being a cool person. You don't render the service, you suffer a financial penalty. If Tom Cruise signs a contract to star in a movie and then backs out halfway through filming, there's financial penalties for him doing so.   &gt; “At some point, as players, we need to be treated with the same respect. And have the same rights that the team can have,” Green said.   If players have the same rights that teams have, does Dame get to make roster cuts and draft picks for the Blazers? Can Jordan Poole trade away Steph? Can Lebron relocate the Lakers to Akron? Does Draymond have to revenue-share his salary with Juan Toscano-Anderson?"
"Jeff Teague, Wannamaker, Blake Griffin, Draymond Green, Aaron Baynes."
"There were some hating clowns after the BK game (in December) that said that Curry cannot carry a team  This team is playoff bound, above Dallas, NOLA, the Rockets, the Nuggets and Memphis.  This team consists of players like Wiggins, Kelly Ouble, Paschall, Kent fucking Bazemore, Brad Wannamaker and a not-so-effective Draymond Green.   Yes, Wardell is carrying this motherfucker, big time.  Shut the fuck up."
"I didn't say 2nd best but it's not so outrageous. We're talking about an era of basketball where Jahlil Okafor would probably be called top 5, and draymond green wouldn't be in the league unless he fucked people up more than he currently does"
"Meanwhile Draymond Green has no visible tattoos, bejewels?, or cornrows. Nor does Kyrie (he has some basic bitch dreamcatcher tattoo you see on your average white girl) or Drummond who he was talking about.  This writer is literally just writing an article not based in reality, but based on some imaginary tumblr universe where rednecks in hoods are running down poor black families in their general lee. It's wild that this type of nonsense is so mainstream now."
My comment has nothing to do with Draymond Green.
"What? That was just the most obvious example of a defender I think is historically better  Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Draymond Green, Ben Wallace, David Robinson, Hakeen Olajuwon, Wilt Chamberlain, Dikembe Mutombo I think all have fair arguments over Gobert  But I still think.Gobert deserves it this year"

"Son of a BITCH do I hate the Warriors. I know most everyone does but for me it goes much deeper than that. I am beyond hate. 4 straight Finals. 4 straight Finals have I put up with the Warriors and their nonstop Warrior winning wats. I have had to watch Draymond Green eat his fucking W's for the past half decade. My friend is a Jazz fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe WaRRiOrs tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them FOUR TIMES A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of baby faced, chewing on his mouth guard, cocky little fuck Steph Curry when he dad dicked the Thunder and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. FUCK.  And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a Clippers and a Saints fan. LA (louisiana) DIDN'T HAVE A BASKETBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH. I CHOSE THE TEAM WITH THE PRETTY COLORS CAUSE I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WOULD HAVE SATAN AND HIS SNEK AND DONKEY IN THEIR DIVISION. I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a warriors flair talking about Curry. Every warriors fan would let steph curry shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search ayesha curry feet until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt curry people would think this was cool"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Steph Currys DICK in their mouth.  They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Steph Curry gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his teammates who works day in and day out for him, because the warriors are only up 74 - 8, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 3 times, and then once more for good measure. And I'll watch that shit on youtube for the rest of my life. I'll be there at his funeral to comfort Ayesha with hors d'oeuvres but when it's my turn to sprinkle dirt on his coffin I'll drop a picture of LeBron James instead. And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear step currys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Ayesha is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of vegetable curry ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning. I am home now. Some days are good. Some days aren't. All I can do is live what life Curry has left me."
"If your talking about mvp convo, yes dame and steph are in same conversation. I could see why dame would be ranked higher for mvp than steph. In terms of better overall player, most will still see steph as better player overall today. Hes the ultimate defensive nightmare with all of his offball movement and demanding double to triple teams beyond the 3 line many times. He forcibly changes how opposing teams play defense when they face warriors. So many times this year, you see opposing teams double team him hard beyond 3 point line just to force the ball out of his hands. But his insane offball movement and the screens still allow him to get okay looks that he drains. Its actually crazy how effective and efficient steph is at scoring, considering opposing teams know they can abuse steph and trap him early since there is no klay.  They try so often to force the ball out of stephs hands, but he still scores, and scores a lot with sub par looks.   Steph has also historically torched dame and the blazers in the playoffs if we are considering head to head records.   In terms of playmaking, its not fair to compare the two, esp based on assist numbers. Dame has the ball in his hands way more and the offense is built for that. Steph moves offball many times and draws double teams nearly every time beyond 3 point line, in which he makes a pass to draymond and draymond passes to the open man for easy bucket. Many of stephs ""assist"" making comes from a 2nd pass because of his gravity rather than a direct pass from steph. In my opinion, it doesnt make sense to say dame is having much better playmaking season then steph, esp based on assist numbers. Steph does sooo much playmaking that is way beyond the statline and everyone knows that.   Also consider that steph has not played basketball for basically like a year and is still having this kind of season. Warriors also chnaged their entire squad. The only players that steph has experience playing with in recent years is draymond green and kevon looney. Their entire team changed so its inevitable that the warriors will not be as great offensively and defnesively this year since there are a ton of learning curves and experiences they have to go through.   Thats not to take away from Dame tho. The dude is beast and top 3 point guard no doubt. I could def understand and see dame winning mvp if he keeps this up and their record stays this strong. Ppl slept on dame too long. Its just so fun and great to witness these kinds of talents right now."
"[""Right ankle soreness""](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2021/2/17/22288729/warriors-heat-draymond-green-ankle-soreness). No if that's actually true or it's just rest"
"You keep saying they ""expected"" to be great like that matters.  The fact is, the Heat were average when Lebron joined them. And lost rotational players in order to add a slightly overvalued Bosh. Take Lebron off that team and they are only good and certainly don't make the finals. Take KD off GSW and they are still all time great and probably win in the finals anyway. The fact there are small similarities to Lebron and KDs moves does not make them the same. Its delusional to think otherwise.   Hell Birdman and Chalmers started on those Heat teams. The 4th and 5th players on GSW were Draymond Green and Iggy. That's to say nothing of the fact that Curry and Klay are much better players than Wade and Bosh... especially in supporting roles.  One player left the worst organization in sports to play for a good team. The other left a very good organization to join an all time great team. Completely different. Its an objective fact."
I see Draymond Green being an analyst or on their announcing team too. He always impresses me with how well thought out his points and arguments are during postgame interviews. And he's funny and kind of a dick so he can fit in with the older guys
"I mean this is why warriors were good draymond green getting paid literally 900k in 2014-2015 season lol  curry, klay, draymond were getting a total of like 15M combined"
"For sure, but I see a lot of people acting like this particular statement by Barkley is out of line when really there's a lot of truth to it. Don't forget Draymond once said that Barkley ""couldn't talk"" since he had no rings. That's where Chuck is coming from when he says that Green thinks he's ""Great Great""."
"I mean Draymond went 10-33 last season without Steph..Barkley led the league in MVP first place votes in 2 different seasons.       Obviously Green is great when he plays his role but there's obviously a difference between Draymond being great and Barkley being great. Draymond can make a great team into an elite team as a ceiling raiser but Barkley is more of a floor raiser which could honestly be regarded higher, as he was able to lead his team to deep playoff runs as the number one guy and almost win a final against the Jordan Bulls."
wat? how is Draymond Green who was an allstar and DPOY around that time make him awful?  Iggy was still a better player than anybody put together outside of the big 3 in the Heat...
The Draymond Green special
"MVP Steph Curry / All-NBA All-Defensive Klay Thompson / MVP Kevin Durant / All-Star Chris Mullin / All-Star DPOY Draymond Green   Bench: Andre Iguodala Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Chris Mullin, Monta Ellis, Harrison Barnes, David Lee, Andrew Bogut, Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell... sure I'm forgetting some people   Good luck Lebron lmao"
"I don't disagree with you.  If you can punish on the perimeter as a big, you should be able to punish on the inside too.  Play your matchups accordingly.  There's 29 other teams and there's not 29 other big men that are equally as skilled as KAT.  I look at someone like Draymond Green.  Undersized and not a good scorer, but is absolutely elite at showcasing his strengths playing the 5.  Granted, he was surrounded by 2 of the best shooters in the history of the NBA, but he absolutely locked in on playing the 5 at an elite level.  The Timberwolves have far more problems than KAT choosing to play out on the perimeter too much.  I just don't think the team gels very well and the desire to win is just not with them, at least how they're currently assembled.    I think Charles is right in the fact that KAT should play a game that is more inside out.  There's not a lot of NBA players that have his skillset at his height.  However, this is an issue that goes much deeper than how KAT should play and approach his position as a 5."
"&gt;no one in the league is better at doing that off-ball than curry. no one can do what he does  Unfortunately when we're talking about ability to carry a lesser roster, being on ball makes you more impactful.  And that's what we're doing. Harden just took down a Suns team with $75m worth of players inactive because of what he does on ball. If you have a Draymond Green, you can get away with an emphasis on off ball movement. If you don't, refer to the start of the season where they were getting blown out.  not saying he's a scrub. But his ""intangibles"" do not put him ahead of Harden. We're comparing elites, not Curry vs Kemba"
"if you just watched this golden state team for the last 5 years and honestly believe draymond green is their playmaker, i cant help you  drays incredible, a great defender and was vital to their success. curry is on another planet compared to dray"
"1. Eye test. Just watching.  2. 538's RAPTOR generally paints a solid picture, but you have to contextualize by watching the games. If a player spends heavy minutes guarding every other team's best player, they'll look worse than a guy who's a solid bench piece but guards scrubs. RAPTOR currently has Garrett Temple as a better defender than Draymond Green, but that's obviously not true to anyone who watches the game.  3. Look at opposing player field goal percentages. SAP (stats.nba.com) shows total defended field goal percentage and defended field goal percentage by zone. This tells you how many field goals per game a player is facing, where they're facing them from, and how often an opponent scores when guarded by that player."
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"One point I wanna make:    In a team-based sport like the NBA (or NFL/MLB/NHL), fans are generally fans of teams, not individual players. I think expecting fans to be loyal to players and not teams is kinda unrealistic. Why doesn't Draymond Green become a golfer/tennis player/boxer if he wants fans to be loyal to individual athletes? Its almost like he wants access to a greater fanbase that a team sport gives him, but also wants fans to be loyal to individual players. I think most of us here would trade any player if it meant their franchise could get a ring. I don't think any of us should feel bad about that because the game of basketball is inherently a team-based sport and NBA franchises represent a specific region or city. Also, is Draymond gonna criticize superstars pushing to trade teammates for another superstar?"
"LeBron ""Runaway MVP favorite"" James has never shaped a narrative before.   I will always say the most impactful thing he did to win Cleveland's title was get on TV and say ""the NBA will not suspend Draymond Green."" Basically daring them not to suspend him lol. One of the smartest things I've ever seen an NBA player do and I respect it."
The American labor force needs a Draymond Green to fight for us. Power to the people
"He averaged 13 and 6 in 2014. 14 and 7 for the entire playoffs. I don’t see how he was better then Draymond green in 2015 who was arguably a top 2 defender if not the best and most versatile defender in the league, or klay Thompson who was also a great defender and averaged 22 on 44% from deep"
"1. About the Drummond situation, I don't think that Draymond has a problem with the Cavs not playing Drummond because he is on the trading block but rather how he was pulled from the bench and had to change attire, and continue to watch the game from the sidelines. If the organization wants him not to play, the proper way would be to inform the player before he arrives to the stadium to play to avoid the embarrassing situation that occured yesterday.   2. About Harrison Barnes being traded during a game and other players finding out from third-party or being straight-up lied to by GMs about where they stand with the team, players should be the first ones to find out if they have been traded so they can start preparing themselves and their FAMILIES without facing unwanted extra media attention. Furthermore, players should be informed if the team is entertaining trade offers for them so that they can mentally prepare themselves and their FAMILIES that they might have to relocate.  3. Thirdly, if the teams can publicly announce that they are going to trade a player, why can't a player publicly demand a trade? The team doesn't have to trade them if they don't want to. It's not like teams never leak information on players to the media without informing them.  4. If a player is going to be traded, and is not going to play why should he have to attend the games? What sense does it make for him to attend the games if he will inevitably be traded?  5. There is a reason trash teams remain trash. If Draymond was drafted by almost in any other team by the warriors, he would probably be out of the league right now. While young players like Markelle Fultz in Philadelphia, Lonzo Ball on the Lakers were constantly ridiculed for not living upto their potential; organizations such as the Portland Trailblazers never receive any backclash for ruining the career of a promising talent like Greg Oden by using experimental medical techniques; the San Antonio Spurs medical staff giving Kawhi Leonard the green light to play even with his constant protests, and later it was found out that he had several problems such as hematoma, tendinopathy, etc.  Finally, the NBA cannot be analysed in isolation of fans and media as they all exist in a nexus."
"Draymond spoke for a little over 2 minutes and not once did he ask for a rule change. What he’s asking for is that front offices across the league get their shit together. Danny Green went on JJ Redick’s podcast and praised the Lakers for how  they handled his trade this past offseason, and Quinn Cook had similar remarks about being waved by them. You misconstrued Draymond’s very first sentence, where he talks about seeing Andre Drummond begin his pre-game warmup then return from the locker room in street clothes because he had only just then been informed that he was being held out.   I think Draymond stumbled a bit when he brought up Harden because the heat Harden took was less about his trade request and more about the fact that the organization bent over backwards to put a winning team around him, shuffling in one all star after another and constructing the roster specifically around his offensive talents, all for him to say “we’re not good enough” when the reality is that he’s been underachieving. But even then, the fallout from his trade request was something Houston’s FO anticipated. The GM was quoted as having said “We’re prepared for things to get uncomfortable” and that’s what happened.   Draymond overall point is that there’s a right way to do these things, and when an organization fumbles away a player’s prime years-or even when they don’t and they just wanna trade that player for whatever reason there’s a way to go about it. When Harrison Barnes was traded mid game LeBron spoke up about it that very night on Twitter. There was no reason the team’s broadcasting crew should know before the player. Maybe you call that player before he leaves for the game and tell him he’s being held out because you’re close on a trade? Maybe you tell DeMarcus Cousins before he leaves town for AS Weekend and that you’re working towards trading him and hope to have something done by the weekend? There’s a right way to do this sort of thing and that’s what separates first class organizations from the rest of the pack. That’s what Draymond was talking about."
Dwayne wade won finals mvp on his rookie deal. OG was a contributor for the raptors. Klay thompson and draymond green were both on rookie deals in 2014-15. Parker/manu both won on the spurs on their rookie deals.
Draymond Green?
"&gt;Curry’s showing this season that he can carry a team with no other All NBA guys to a respectable level.  Did Draymond die? Also Wiggins is playing at an All-Defensive level, and Oubre's a good defender too. Just because they don't score a lot doesn't mean they're garbage, such a bad take.  Curry has more help than Harden tonight and Harden showed why he's better. Curry on this Nets team with no defense behind him is nowhere near the same team with Harden on them, they're getting 150 scored on them legit everynight with the corpse of DJ and Jeff Green being the only decent defenders."
To me Draymond Green is metaphorically describing every job I’ve had.
"What exactly is difficult to understand about what Draymond's saying?  &gt;Does he want a **rule** put in place that.....  You seem to be thinking about this strictly in terms of policy and I think that's where you're being mistaken. There's no ""fuck the players"" rule that Draymond is speaking out against and it comes off as disingenuous to pretend as if that's what he's doing. What he's talking about is the surrounding ""culture"" that pervades when we talk about these kinds of situations, and that's something that encompasses not just the league itself, or the media that covers it, but also the fandom that consumes it  The common denominator in every scenario Green mentions is that the vast majority of takes just so happen to align with the **team's** interest. Every report or rumor that gets tweeted or written about about seems to take a team-sympathetic lean to it. When players speak out, or when a report comes out about that player's preferred destination, the conversation is never about the player just having a preference, it's shit like ""Why speak out now?"" ""locker room cancer"" ""He's tanking his trade value!"" etc. This kind of attitude absolutely pervades places r/nba during the thick of these trade talks and therefore I don't buy that a lot of users here are actually as ""pro-player"" as they think they are  Let me take one of your points for example. On the Drummond situation:  &gt;I don’t understand what he wants to change here. If a team knows that they’re trying to trade a player, it does not make sense for them to risk injury to that player.  Because yeah, I don't disagree that this statement makes the most sense from the team's perspective, but my question is why is it just a given that we take the team's perspective on this in the first place? Not the first time this topic has been brought up and people defend the status quo position contrive all these reasons why that changing things wouldn't work, but consider the alternative: is it really such a fucking travesty to just let these guys play and if something happens, oh well that's sports? Is it worth all the bellyaching on behalf of the team when we could instead just enjoy watching our favorite players be their best selves?"
"Al’s value is his versatility. He’s not neccessarily elite at any one aspect, but he good/very good at every part of the game. He isn’t a traditional lead guy, but pretty much any teams (except the sixers lmao) could slot him in and improve. Kinda Similar (in effect, not play style) to draymond green"
1.	the players are only losing the 10% put into eschew to ensure the owners still get the 51-49 ownership stake. the league is missing out on a hell of a lot more than 10% (China &amp; COVID) so Draymond needs to be thankful that a CONTRACT is saving his ass and the owners live up to their end  2.	you are absolutely obligated to give you’re all if you have multiple commas in your salary. come on man. this is like a top .1% job in the world. full effort is the standard  3.	nobody is mad that players want to be traded. i go to other job interviews all the time. it would only become a problem if i went to my boss and said “i’m not doing any more work until i get a new job.” the players can demand a trade after every game for all i care. i would personally love for Draymond Green to start a labor uprising in the NBA and to abolish the draft and max contract and let guys go where they please. but that’s not what we are talking about. we are talking about if multimillionaires should try hard
Can someone just give dray a copy of Capital or State and Revolution and get this over with already? The nba needs a Eugene Debs. That man is Draymond Green.

Draymond Green has a college degree in communication. He knows exactly what he's saying.
"I mean, I get it, sort of. But not really. The teams pay the players, not the other way around. In the end, you are paid millions of $$ for playing a game. Someone had to sit and watch in a suit, the horror. How bad has it worked out for Harden by the way? Nobody cares anymore, he's on his new team and he got his way anyway. Are we supposed to feel bad for him? AD got a fine that is the equivalent of fining a regular person about $10. He also got his way and nobody cares about him asking away from the Pelicans anymore.  In a few weeks, the players who are sitting out will play again for someone else. These guys are so, so lucky I think most of them lose perspective. Draymond Green just likes the sound of his own voice."
"Draymond Green is also the first PF under 6’8 in the shot clock era to have at least 6 pts, 8 rebs and 16 assts with less than 2 TOs."
"I’m sorry but this is just ridiculous. Shaq is an asshole sometimes, but the dude is a once in a far better entertainer than Draymond Green. Pretty much everyone thinks that Shaq is a cool and funny guy, especially casual fans, and he’s responsible for a bunch of the funniest moments that Inside the NBA is known for. Draymond isn’t funny at all, and he’s nowhere near as entertaining as the rest of the panel.   If Draymond is replacing anyone, it would have to be Kenny. Dray would bring a more analytical approach to doing the show, which is what they have Kenny for right now. And even then he still wouldn’t be as good at setting up jokes as Kenny is."
"Okay but neither of those things have anything to do with basketball. I personally think curry is the better all around basketball player and has a better leader mentality. In no way do I think James harden is bad. He’s one of the most offensively gifted players in the league. Curry is on a different level when it comes to 3 point shooting. I also believe curry is a better team player, not saying harden isn’t. They’re both amazing top tier talented players, and honestly arguing who is the better player is stupid. Steph curry had the blessing of playing all those seasons with one of the best 3 point shooters ever in klay Thompson, James harden never had a player by his side like that. Add on draymond green, and a handful of consistent role players who fit the system well, and you have one of the best teams in the league. Arguing Huston and Golden State were equal is going to come with bias, because it’s simply not true, the warriors were always the better team."
Compared to  13.7 Draymond Green 18.6 Klay 10.4 Iggy?
Draymond Green is considered good only by the standards of the modern league. I don’t think he could guard prime Magic or Larry Bird
If defense is what makes someone a super star Draymond Green would be the goat by now
"Draymond ""get my man Booker out of Phoenix"" Green"
"just became a fan of Draymond Green, the man"
https://soundcloud.com/warriors/draymond-green-postgame-21521
"Draymond Green and Steph Curry played 30 mins each. Combined for 42 points, 22 Assists, 10 rebounds, 2 blocks, 1 steal, and most important stat of all, only 2 fucking turnovers. What a game."
The value Draymond has in getting Curry his shots is so high. They've been playing together long enough that Green knows perfectly how to set him up
"He was absolutely dominant on that high P&amp;R tonight, if you played him in the Draymond Green role and surrounded him with shooters he would be brilliant. Big guys can't keep up with him, smalls get bullied in the post.  Somewhat ironically if you surrounded Joel Embiid with shooters he'd be brilliant too."
"Because Allen should not be that high up, it's fucking Draymond Green why is he guarding him like he can do anything in terms of scoring  Sexton was right just sag off and Curry's screen is useless"
"Man, Ive been trying to tell people, Simmons is way too talented to just be "" Draymond Green"" like people were saying earlier when he was averaging 12. Obviously that was just him recovering. The next step for him is to be around 18-20 in the post season"
"KG was a better passer than Draymond lol. Green is one of the most overrated offensive players ever. He makes the most basic reads on offense, the system is perfect for his style and also has played with all-time great shooters all through his career. Imagine prime KG with Steph and Klay as his backcourt!!! They would break the NBA. That team would fit better than the team with Kevin Durant. Perfect synergy, especially when they played with Bogut at the 5, KG at the 4, and you can get a decent 3 just slightly better than Harrison Barnes. They will win 5 rings in a row."
"Even if he was just a good free-throw shooter and maybe could pick n pop. He didn't need to be a mainstay in the offense. He would have been so much more valuable, even in this era. Look at the value of players like Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert."
"I have no idea who Tua Tugavailoa or Dwayne Haskins are, but I feel the same way about Draymond Green. With talented guys around him he’s awesome - warriors don’t have the run they have without that version of Draymond. But on a bad team he’s just an angry undersized power forward with a triple single box score"
"Steph-Draymond PnR quite often leads to a 4v3 play. We see them getting dunks or open threes quite frequently. The closing 5 above isn't really good. Compare it to a closing 5 of Curry/Oubre/Wiggins/Green/Looney, which is one of the best units in the league."
"""He only won because he had all-stars like draymond ""triple single"" green, wiggins, and oubre."""
"He's not going to make a video on Wallace in the greatest peaks series, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did a separate video on him. Ben Wallace is arguably the GOAT defender. He's like if you combined Draymond Green with slightly less lateral quickness and David Robinson into one defender. Insane rotational help, shot blocking, and instincts. He is like top all-time in playoff defensive rating too for anyone with a decent sample size, which although is a team stat, is still insanely impressive."
"Lance Stephenson. Thought he could've been a lot like how Draymond Green is (was maybe?). He was just kinda dumb and made bad decisions, but he always worked his ass off. I'd even love if the Pacers signed him now.  Edit: Bonus player, Roy Hibbert. Dude was a STOPPER but had self-esteem issues that ultimately forced him out of the league."
"None of the above. I watched his entire career, and offensively he was pretty similar to a Draymond/Chris Bosh mix, tho he wasn't as good a shooter as Bosh or as good a playmaker as Green (better opposite tho -- better playmaker than Bosh and shooter than Green).  He wasn't good enough offensively to carry a team far. He just wasn't. Teams didn't fear him demolishing them so they didn't double him as much as they did Dirk or Duncan, and he was a good iso scorer but not an elite one. So he did playmake and he could hit open jumpers out to 20 feet at a pretty good clip, but he wasn't *incredible* at literally anything offensively. All of the guys on that list blow him out of the water with at least 1 offensive trait if not several."
"KG was not a very good iso scorer. He wasnt even in the same league as any of the players you mentioned offensively. He was a pretty good play maker and good shooter midrange when open, but he wasn't just going to go get you buckets. So sure, he would be a better version of Draymond Green (though a better shooter and far worse playmaker), but he isn't leading any team to a title that doesn't have a better offensive player than he was."
"Draymond Green is an excellent player too, but Manu's talent and skill are miles above his. Manu could've been a star if he had his own team. He was a star in Europe and with Argentina, and we know how that ended. The 4 championships are no coincidence, he wasn't carried to any of them (well, maybe the first one). He played at FMVP level in 2005, and he was the best passer and playmaker of his team, even when he had Tony Parker next to him."
Could say the exact same thing about Draymond Green who is an eite passer and defender. I maybe made a mistake by including Millsap since that’s who everyone is getting hung up on. Point is Im not sure Manu is definitively the best second round pick
"Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and maybe even Paul Millsap are probably all ahead of Manu? Jokic will definitely be best when all is said and done, but picking Manu is a little bit odd lol"
"Hmm Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Lebron James and Andrew Bogut.   He should've joined the warriors in 2015"
&gt; dude just isn't clutch.   He literally scored the game winning basket in game 6 of the NBA finals over Draymond Green.  I'll take that over a Sunday evening vs Minnesota.
"Apologies if I came across as aggressive, but as I said on a different comment, Siakam has performed on the biggest stage, including scoring a championship-clinching floating after euro stepping on Draymond Green lol. I'm not saying Siakam can carry a team in the playoffs, I'm not even saying Siakam is clutch. But to say he's not clutch because of three missed game winners in the regular season is a bit much. What is ""clutch"" even? I think it's a stupid concept. I even said in my above comment that Siakam doesn't have the skills to be a great first option."
Draymond green is a bum See I can say things that don't make sense too
"Maybe I should've made the title ""Kyrie Irving with the solid post defense on Draymond Green before ~~getting tea-bagged by~~ *being rewarded with the teabag from* Kelly Oubre."""
Draymond “triple single” green
Ok and? Curry is less athletic than Draymond Green but that doesn’t mean Green is better than him...

"I’ve watched them both play. Steph would not do better than dame, unless he got to take draymond green with him. The blazers have no secondary playmaking, even when McCollum isn’t hurt. I was definitely exaggerating but there’s a reason Jones jr, Enes Kanter, and and anfernee simons aren’t playoff starters on other teams haha. Lillard might do worse, but I think Steve Kerr is a good coach, and he would have draymond, so maybe not."
"He has multiple-time all-star Draymond Green and the so-called greatest coach of all-time Steve Kerr plus he's the so-called greatest shooter of all-time, so he has way more advantages than the other players really. His team should be winning the west given the numerous talents and skills that his fans say put him in the same tier as LeBron or Michael Jordan."
Jamal Murray is not a level above Draymond Green
"well im watching this GSW vs BKN game which has draymond green in it so thats what why im thinking about it, on a normal basis no, i dont give a fuck about draymond"
"NBA needs to have two three point shootouts at all star weekend. One with the great shooters of the league, and a second one with guys like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, and then the winners of the two contests should face off in the finals."

"draymond green or andre igoudala, those were the guys I tried to mirror my style after"
The original Draymond Green would say to one of the Draymond clones “you a bitch! we won without you”. Then the clone Draymond would go to the Nets.
"Ben would be secondary ball handler, like a Draymond green role basically."
Would draymond green have won FMVP if Kyrie missed that 3?
"I think you're looking at it from the wrong angle. that's all those guys should be doing. their role was defined by their skillsets being limited. if you've ever seen Danuel House try and move around the court or dribble a basketball, you'll know why he shouldn't be doing much more than standing on the 3pt line. same goes for PJ Tucker, and even Eric Gordon.  &amp;#x200B;  they didn't have any intelligent playmakers on the team. they were consistently signing minimum guys and pulling up from the G League (House, Mclemore) or finding guys that nobody else wanted (Rivers, Green, even Gordon) to avoid paying the tax.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Missing Piece the Rockets Need to Help James Harden - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/5/11/18616097/houston-rockets-missing-piece-james-harden)  &gt;The Rockets’ problem, especially in comparison to the  Warriors, is that they have never had players who combine both. They  have no one comparable to Andre Iguodala or Klay Thompson, much less  Draymond or Durant. None of their other shot creators are natural  pick-and-roll partners for a star guard. Golden State can switch a  screen between Harden and Gordon, Paul, or Rivers, and keep  similar-sized defenders on both players. They don’t have to worry about  any of those three attacking Harden’s defender on a switch. He is always  the one who has to create the mismatch, which wears him down during a  series. My guess is the primary cause of Harden’s history of fading in  the playoffs is his overwhelming offensive responsibility, not any flaw  in his character or his game.   &gt;   &gt;Harden doesn’t play with anyone who makes his life easier in the way Draymond and Durant do for Steph Curry. [The play that sealed Game 6 for Golden State](https://twitter.com/connectwidutpal/status/1127056521232175105)  (a Thompson 3 with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter) summed up the  difference between the two teams. Houston blitzed a pick-and-roll  between Steph and Draymond, creating a four-on-three opportunity for  Draymond at the 3-point line. He drove into the lane and found Iguodala  in the corner, who then swung the ball to Thompson. There is no one on  the Rockets’ roster who can consistently make the play that Green did.  Draymond is a legitimate point forward. Neither Capela nor Tucker is  comfortable making plays off the dribble. The Warriors can overload to  stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making  them pay for it.  this is a really good article that highlights the difference between the Rockets and, say, the Warriors. it's not like Harden wouldn't of rather had other lineups, it's that for what the Rockets were willing to spend they were never going to get guys who were more capable of doing anything other than 3&amp;D."
"Are we doing it as hypothetical 2v2 pickup or as a duo with 3 supporting players? Because I think if it was 2v2 pickup I'd pick Rajon Rondo and Draymond Green , they would have superior BBIQ and out-think their opponents but physically be outmatched.  But if it was a duo carrying a team then there might be an argument against it."
"Will I get hate mail if I say Draymond Green is the best role player? A ton of people say he’s a superstar, but he just fits the description of a role player. If you want to say he’s too good to be a role player, then this question becomes void, since whoever the best role player is in the league has ought to be considered to good to be a role player."
"yeah, i mean people will say that it was a great shot that he hits at a high clip but also that dame shouldn’t have taken it if the blazers were trailing at that point. the best you can say is that the blazers can live with it if they’re confident about winning in OT but you could literally say that about a deep 3 from draymond green"
You didn’t answer the question.What role do you see draymond being in the offense? I ask this because a year or two ago there was Ben Simmons trade rumors and they same question came up. I think they would probably need to trade Green.
u/MagneticTragedy (Draymond Green) likely went 1/6 &amp;from the field for 2 points 9 rebounds 15 assists 2 steals 3 blocks

" KD: 35/8/5 on 70%TS  LeBron: 34/12/10 on 63%TS  LeBron did not have Klay Thompson and Steph Curry waiting for him in the corners.

Draymond “triple single” green . 8-4-8
I witnessed Draymond Green lose a 3 point contest to Kevin Heart on live TV
"You are throwing statlines with points, rebounds, assists and TS% to make your point that Draymond is good at defense, like ????  Draymond Green has never successfully guarded Damian Lillard in his life, in fact they so rarely switch into one another, that you could probably find every clip of him ""trying"" to guard Dame."
"&gt; He probably thinks about defense as a teamwide thing more so than other positional defenders.  That's fine, but by saying that this makes him have a claim, you are acting like other all-time great defenders didn't think the same way, which doesn't make sense. Scottie Pippen and Ben Wallace are two of the greatest defenders ever (who actually have a claim) and both played defense with a very team heavy mentality, they were just individually better and more athletic than Draymond Green.  Draymond does have a high BBIQ, but people are acting like he is the smartest defender that has ever played, completely disregarding the BBIQ of other all-time great defenders that simply are better than him on defense as individuals.  Defense requires alot of BBIQ, you can't simply do it on athleticism and effort. David Robinson was a monster of an athlete in his prime, being bigger, stronger and faster than Draymond while also having a very high defensive BBIQ."
"Your argument is valid to say that Draymond is a great defender, which he obviously is, but we are talking about the GREATEST DEFENDER OF ALL TIME.  The Warriors defense was great, yes, for today's standards and for a grand total of three years. In 2018, the Warriors ranked 11th on defense and then 13th in 2019, people are here talking like the Warriors were the 2000s Pistons who had to hold teams to 80 points to win games, this is was the greatest collection of talent EVER, their defense was hardly the main or 2nd reason they were great.  Is Draymond Green a versatile defender? Absolutely, but he ain't a all-time great perimeter 1 on 1 defender, plain and simple. We are comparing him to guys like Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard and Dikembe Mutombo, dudes that not only are more decorated than he is, but that have the stats to prove how much better and impactful they were.  David Robinson led this league in DWS and DBPM three times, led the Spurs to top tier defenses for almost a decade and his teams actually relied on defense to win games. Scottie Pippen did exist and was the same height of Draymond, guarded point guards, wings and power forwards and people on this sub are acting like Draymond is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Draymond also didn't play with scrubs on defense, he anchored that Warriors defense, but he also had the help of truly good defenders like Klay, Bogut and Iguodala."
"I can't take anyone seriously who thinks the 29th and the 9th ranked defenses are equivalent   I've decided on my eye test that the Warriors 22nd ranked offense is just as good as the Blazers, outside of a few bad moments. Therefore, it's on Steph that they're worse  See how silly that sounds?  We have **objective** measures of team defense that are frankly just better than anything your eyes can tell you. We're no longer dealing with a 5 game sample or something. We can tell if teams are good or terrible. Shockingly a team with Draymond green instead of Kanter is much better defensively."
"He is and that's the point, just a decade ago there was a guy that was CLEARLY more impactful and more athletic than Green on defense, who had all the intangibles that people like to throw around Green (you can say everything about Dwight, but he has great defensive BBIQ), but he was simply bigger, stronger, more athletic and maybe even faster.  Those people saying that Draymond has a claim for defensive GOAT show that they absolutely didn't watch Howard in his prime, because if they had they would see how absurdly higher his impact was. Dwight led Orlando to be one of the best defenses in the league without having any other truly ""great"" defender alongside him and without having the benefit of playing with the greatest offense of all time on the other end."
"There are plenty of handsome dark skinned players, but Draymond Green is just not one of them."
"&gt; Lol guards can't even guard Dame or Kyrie, FOH.  I seem to recall CP3 eating Dame's lunch in their matchup in 2016, in fact when CP3 got hurt was when Dame actually played well in the series. Jrue Holiday also guarded Dame exceptionally well in their 2018 matchup, so yeah, hardly ""unguardable"".  &gt; Do I think Draymond is the best defender of all time? It's literally an impossible, and pointless, question to answer.  No it isn't, as his claim isn't backed up by awards (there are countless all-time great defenders who are more decorated than he is), by stats (Draymond shockingly has never led this league in DWS and only led it in DBPM twice) or by the eye test. Dwight Howard won three straight DPOYs, led the league in blocks twice, led it in DWS four times in a row and in DBPM once. Also, the eye test CLEARLY showed that Howard was WAY more impactful than Green was on defense.  &gt; team defense, switch ability, recognition/awareness, communication, etc etc all matter.  Yes, let's act like Draymond Green is the only all-time great defender that has those skills, as if Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwight, Pippen and many others didn't have all those skills AND were more athletically gifted with better individual defensive prowess.  &gt; Yeah Draymond is gonna get burnt by some guards  Tell me one instance where Draymond Green has successfully guarded an elite NBA guard for an extended period of time. You won't find it, because Klay takes all the defensive assignments on guards and when Draymond gets switched on to them, he is neither fast or athletic enough to stay in front of them. Draymond couldn't guard Kyrie, Dame, Mitchell, Murray, you name it, he simply doesn't have the athletic abilities to guard a quick small guard.  &gt; Once again, not saying he's the best defender of all time.  You don't have to, he isn't even close. Ben Wallace was CLEARLY better (backed up by stats AND individual awards) than Draymond Green and anchored an actual all-time great defense on a team that didn't have the greatest offense in NBA history, so they actually had to hold opponents to less than 80 points to win."
"&gt;but Dame will never have a defense around him like Steph because he’s a notably worse defender.  The Blazers had a top 10 defense like 2 years ago my man. The point is that Dame doesn't have an elite defense to bail him out. Steph does. His rim protector is Kanter. Steph's is Draymond fucking green lol.  At the end of the day, both the Blazers and the Warriors have an equal net Rating (-1.0) but the Blazers are vastly outperforming that because we're the best team in the entire league at winning close games...because of Dame. That's what it's boiled down to. The Blazers win 74% (20-7) of games that are within 5 points, whereas the Warriors win 56% (9-7) of those games.  Dame has been statistically the clutchest player in the league, and no one else has even been close - he leads the league in both scoring **and** efficiency (a wild 78% TS%).    We have an incredible +31 net rating in the clutch with Dame vs the Warriors who are -0.2 in the clutch with Steph  That's the difference."
"Because they are an offense starting a rookie Center, Oubre with 52% TS, Draymond Green, and Wiggins. Wiggins is their 2nd best offensive player lol, and he’s more defense than offense these days.  Not to mention the team used to be full of pass-first guys and is now rookies and 2nd year players lol.  There’s a limit to how much Curry can impact the offense when it’s full of inefficient players, a Draymond that just won’t shoot the ball anymore, or a rookie that’s playing like a 5 for the first time in his life lol."
"I watch a fair bit of Warriors games, not every single one of course. Steph is great of course but he isn't having that same ""winning"" effect, not sure why that's so hard to point out. How much worse is his roster compared to say, Dame Lillard's Trailblazer team? Is Draymond Green not a former All-NBA and DPOY?"
"No one can clamp Curry. That's the point. It takes a team to defend these kinds of players.   Draymond's proven over his career that he has what it takes to lead a defense to overcome players like Lebron, Harden, Durant, etc.  MJ and especially Pippen are better comparisons and I'm not claiming Green is a better defender than either. I don't claim to even know.  I'm just pointing out the absurdity of using a statement like ""Could Draymond Green clamp Shaq?"" as a way to discredit Green. No one asks if Payton or Leonard could clamp Shaq. Green has the unfortunate reality of being compared to the best ever rim defenders and the best ever perimeter defenders because he is so good at both.  His best comparison is to defenders like Pippen and Leonard."
"You do know that you can avoid getting switched on right? Teams tried to use picks to get favourable matchups all the time, but if the opposing player just fights through it enough or sees the switch coming, you won't get it.   Teams would consistently try to switch Pippen off their point guards on offense against the Bulls, but they were simply unable to as Pippen would either see the play happening or he would chase the player down with his insane athleticism.  Draymond Green has a high IQ, but he ain't the lockdown iso defender that Pippen, Rodman, GP and even Michael Jordan were and he simply doesn't have the athleticism that some of those guys had. The best comparison for him is Ben Wallace and Wallace was so clearly better that it's laughable how this sub clearly didn't watch the 2000s Pistons play.  People love to act like Draymond made this Warriors defense when in reality he played with great defenders like Klay, Iguodala (who won a FMVP for his defense with GS) and Bogut (who led the Warriors in DBPM in 2015 and 2016)."
"That ain't the point, the point is that one of the biggest pieces of bullshit ever told in this sub is that Draymond Green can guard guards, no he can't, he couldn't guard a 45 year old Baron Davis, let alone the top tier guards in the league. Draymond is a high IQ versatile defender, he can switch between wings and bigs, but to say that he can guard 1-5 is the biggest piece of crap ever told, he can't guard Dame or Kyrie to save his goddamn life.  The reason Draymond's claim was foolish is because he isn't as good guarding big guys as Tim, Hakeem, Dikembe and Dwight were, he isn't as good as LeBron, Michael, Kobe, GP and Scottie at guarding wing guys and he certainly can't guard small guards.  How can you be the greatest if you aren't the best at anything? Dwight Howard in his prime had more of an argument than Draymond Green (who doesn't even have the accomplishments to go against the very best defenders ever). People on this sub need to understand that versatility =/= best"
"No...because then by that logic Draymond Green was better than AD in 2018, hell no."
"Lol as if LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard wouldn't have also put up monster numbers. Each of those guys have had playoff runs putting up somewhat comparable numbers to Durant with the Warriors without the benefit of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the team. Those rings and Finals MVPs were the biggest jokes of all time."
Draymond Green is a dadaist and his medium is box scores.
Comparing Bill Russell to Wilt Chamberlain is like comparing Draymond Green to Joel Embiid. We all know Joel Embiid is better.
&gt;I like Al Harrington with Draymond Green one-on-one.  Okay.
"Willis Reed is technically the only 2nd round pick to win an MVP.... but that was 1964 and the rounds were different then, so he was still 8th overall, not really the same thing as Jokic who was picked 41st overall. Other than that Jokic is pretty clearly the best 2nd rounder ever, or will be if he wins MVP this year (+110 odds).   Other 2nd rounders who were/are good but not MVP level: Draymond, Manu, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Millsap, Lou Williams, PJ Tucker, Rodman, Gilbert Arenas.   None of those guys were as good at their peaks as Jokic is now though."
Draymond green when he is arguing with refs
Meanwhile Draymond Green chooses not to score 10 points to get his smsh
"Those other guys did a lot more on defense than MPJ or other aspects of the game. They also were all stars before they joined forces in most cases. MPJ is a great shooter but that’s pretty much all he provides at this point and he can’t really create his own shot either, you’re overrating him and underrating guys like Bosh, Kevin Love, and Draymond Green."
Draymond Green
He can play the 4. Too small for the 5. But even now for most guys playing the 4 need to be able to shoot the 3 unless you bring other valuable qualities like draymond green
Draymond Green and Robert Covington. No pass is safe.
"Yeah, I can only imagine how pissed OKC fans are.  At the time I even had a lot of deluded OKC fans even telling me ""nah man, they lost fair and square"".  I don't think people realized how important Draymond Green was to that GSW roster. He was the glue, the hammer, and the nails.  For the refs to watch him do the things that he did without even a tech is INSANE. He even did the armbar takedown that Kelly Ollynyk did to fuck up Kevin Love's arm: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-draymond-green-and-steven-adams-have-a-wrestling-match/  He was doing things that people weren't just getting Flags for, but were getting SUSPENDED for. Kelly was out for one game. Dray should have been given techs, flag 1, flag 2, and suspension throughout that series. Absolutely crooked reffing transparent as anything I've seen in my lifetime.  Thanks for Billy Donovan by the way. Its so awesome to have a real coach."
"You are confusing talking with acting. As a man the best thing I can do is put whatever kinds of means I have behind things that women ask for. Speaking from the zero experience I have of being a woman can only harm their cause. But, I can act on their behalf. Im interested in your next straw man though? You are running half of the full gamut so far. Schafly and politics have nothing to do with Draymond Green wasting everyone’s time with his mansplaining."
"Just what Draymond Green said.  If a player refuses to play, he is called unprofessional and has an attitude problem.  If an organization refuses to play a good player? That's professional?"
"You know I'd like to see Lebron try to carry the 2017 warriors no way in hell is that team making the playoffs let alone winning it all. KD took these scrubs to the promise land: 2x mvp Steph Curry, 3 time all star Klay Thompson (who by the way hasn't even played in the nba since KD left), and fucking Draymond Green who cant really even shoot the ball, not to mention he had fucking Iguadola leading the bench."
"Depends on the team. On most teams this player is called “Mr. Talkie Pants” or “The Pornstar”, but for the Orlando Magic they just call him “The Magician”. For the Thunder they call him “Tornado Siren”. For the Celtics they call him “Sully”. The Pistons guy is called “Sir Squeaky Brakes”,  but those are the only 4 teams I know that have a name for their communicator.   GSW calls their’s “Donkey”, but I think that’s just because Draymond Green looks like Donkey from Shrek, I don’t think it’s an official title written into their contract like it is with the 4 teams that have names for their communicator, so once Draymond retires they’ll go back to “Mr. Talkie Pants” or “Pornstar”."
Both AK and Okur would fit way better in today’s game than their era.  Okur is basically a prototype of Jokic without all the kinks worked out. Great shooter and passer. Mediocre defender.  The best comparison I could give for AK today would be Draymond Green. He could guard 1-5 on defense and fill any position on offense and fill up the stat sheet. We actually had him fill in as PG when all our other guards were injured.
Draymond Green  The Nets defense is still weak  The Lakers with Draymond would be an all-time great defense
Draymond Green
"Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thonpson are 3 all stars off the top of my head that couldn’t work together with KD. No way they would win any rings smh"
Joe Harris is better offensively than Draymond green. He’s scored over 20 points multiple times this year
Lol a healthy Lakers are still the favorites. This isn't even close to the 2017 Warriors. Y'all acting like Lamarcus Aldridge is prime Draymond Green
“This edible ain’t shit.”  *One moment later.*  “Draymond Green in his prime was a top 10 player in the league.”
"That in 20 years, he will be on TNT studio with Draymond and Danny Green and he will keep talking about how he was competitive while Draymond yells ""RINGS"""
"This team is more stacked than the 16-17 Warriors  KD - KD  Curry- Harden  Klay- Kyrie  Draymond- either Aldridge or Blake ( Draymond easily)  But Nets have better role players in Jeff Green, Shamet, Brown, Jordan and Claxton  Plus Dinwiddie but he’s been out"
"He’s better then Steph. GSW lost the 2016 finals off of curry getting isoed lmao.  Klay, Iggy, bogut, all NBA defenders for the warriors. Draymond green, all nba every year and won DPOY and was 2nd multiple times. Durant stepped it up on D Too. But yes act like the warriors had no help"
Draymond Green to the trailblazers would be a very interesting fit. I also think that Jrue Holiday to the Mavericks would be a really good fit.
"That has to be such a terrible statement because obviously he doesn’t need to carry a team if there are multiple all stars and not to mention this man led a team to 73 wins with klay Thompson and draymond green as his second and third best players, if that isn’t carrying idk what is tbh."
Draymond Green is “allegedly” one of the best defenders of this generation and “allegedly” one of the best all around players in the league. Kelly Ubre is absolutely no scrub. Andrew Wiggins is a good two way player. Sorry I can’t agree with you. Lebron on that team is top three in East OR West.
"""But, but Draymond Green is a all star.""- same guy who argues that Draymond is a scrub carried by All Star teammates in other threads."
"lol, remember when Draymond Green had to come out and sound off on people questioning Stephen Curry’s ‘legacy’!  https://i.imgur.com/YIZKiwv.jpg"
"Draymond Green must have that ""No Techs"" badge on Hall of Fame."
Steph has bad games in all of his finals. Dude was about to lose a finals mvp to Draymond Green
Draymond Green
"Ppl act like Curry is all by himself which I don’t understand. The warriors have their entire roster minus Klay.. they SHOULD be a playoff team.   Andrew Wiggins is averaging over 18ppg shooting 39% from 3 and playing good defense. He reinvented himself into a borderline all-star player again. Draymond won DPOY and is the primary facilitator for the team. Curry is the goat shooter. Throw in some good role players and you’d think you have yourself a decent team. Who would ever think the following would be under 500?  Stephen Curry, Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, Wiseman, Poole"
I for sure have Curry over Dame but I feel like Dame is getting really disrespected. Dame hasn’t played with nearly the level of talent Steph has. The only all star Dame played with was Aldridge and that was in his first few years. Meanwhile Steph had playoff success alongside multiple all stars and all of fame talent. If Dame had someone like draymond green to allow him to play off ball and all world defenders alongside of him he would look a lot better too. Not saying he’s better than Steph at all but if you flip Dame and Steph in GS I’m not sure they have any less rings.
Agreed. There was that fantastic interview with draymond green making that same point. I’ll see if I can find it.  Edit: [here](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bum7ga/draymond_green_gives_epic_speech_about_the/) you go
"So you think he did a magic 180 on his work ethic when he came to the warriors?  That shit is pretty hard to do in such short timespan, takes months and months of personal work on yourself, I should know.  He came to a team with Draymond Green on it and has only been praised in terms of his effort since he got here.  Draymond doesn't hold back on anyone, I mean look how he spoke to KD.  I don't think he would be buttering up the reality just to make wigs feel better about himself ya know?  I don't think the guy would be in the league unless he had a good work ethic tbh, lots of hungry guys out there busting their ass.  Some guys just peak early, happens a lot."
"I don’t disagree there.  However, I don’t know if anything will top trying to get through prime Draymond Green, pre-Achilles injury KD, and a “slightly younger than he his now” Andre Iguadala  All three were just the perfect height and weight to cover most vulnerabilities."
"&gt;	1A/1B with Steph depends on what you value (personally thought Steph edged him with carrying the offensive system),  Durant was **third** in dribbles per possession, touches, passes completed, initiating in the half-court behind Draymond and Curry. Then you get into the post season and ask why Kerr never trusted him with the ball? Because anytime his volume and playmaking duties increase, the offense plummets and he becomes a turnover machine.   The dude is as close to a system player as any other which is the same critique people laughably put onto Curry. As if Curry’s motion offense havent produced the best offenses of *all time* (it has). Durant needs an all time great creator in Curry/harden/Russ to anchor the offense and needs elite rim protectors the anchor the defense in Ibaka and Draymond Green. Pathetic if he’s actually considered a top 20 player of all time"

just like famously european draymond green and lebron james
Draymond Green
"I was devastated when Clint left Houston  He was one of my favorite guys on that team, and the Harden/Capela lob was UNSTOPPABLE (unless your name was Draymond Green)  So happy to see him finally getting real recognition w the hawks, truly"
Since there's already a few post about Steph   Draymond Green vs the Memphis Grizzlies  4 Points  12 Rebounds  10 Assists  10 Steals   5 Blocks  With only 2 TOs
The fact that you could be talking about Draymond Green or Russell Westbrook shows just how insanely OP KDs teams have been throughout his career.
Draymond Green Game 7 2016 Finals  32 points 15 rebounds 9 assists
&gt; point Zion      Did you notice he was completely neutralized after Knicks figured him out? He was turned into a Draymond Green who cannot pass in the last minutes
"I think he showed his true colors in the playoffs with Cleveland. He’s a good regular season player, but wasn’t good when you got into the later rounds of the playoffs. He averaged 1.06 PPG more than Draymond Green does in finals games, for example."

Id argue you can’t really compare anyone in the league to Draymond Green.  He is the only one on the team that could survive in the 80’s-90’s NBA everyone else too chill and too soft.
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
Here comes draymond green!
ah so if youre talented youre allowed to [purposely injure players](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/12/04/draymond-green-warriors-kick-marquese-chriss-hand-suns-video/comment-page-1/) . awesome brain you have
"Lebron carried that team for 15 games without AD. Draymond Green is an all star defender and facilitator. Andrew Wiggins is a “g-leaguer”?!? Oh and they have the top rookie center. That team isn’t g-leaguers man. Currys been hot yea, but don’t shrug off James."
"Lee's layup was harder and over two defenders, Draymond Green just choked hard"
Draymond Green also made one for the Celtics
Kent Bazemore missing those FTs and Draymond Green missing that layup......  Warriors late game situations just dont know how to execute. I dont know how many games I have seen where the last 2 minutes is where they lose the game after a pretty good overall performance.
Imagine going to Draymond Green when you need a bucket. LMAO!!!!!
"&gt;None of those things make him a good coach. Lakers fans were also complaining about him for a long time. He had a bad roster then too.  Lots of Laker fans are dumber than rocks, too.  &gt;The warriors have very little beyond those 3. And one of them can't go on the court. It's not a good counter point.  Just like the Kings.  So if Walton is a bad coach, Kerr must be as well.  Surely Steph Curry and Draymond Green are worth 6 games.  Why is Wiseman getting worse each game?  Kerr must be an awful coach, right?  &gt;I think streakiness relates to coaching. Have you asked why they rely on streaky shooters? Is his coaching strategy, hope the shots go in?  They rely on streaky shooters because that's all they have.  Are you proposing that Walton should be utilizing Hassan Whiteside in the post more?  Do you think that's winning many games?  It's not.  &gt;Has he tried anything different after going on two 8 loss streaks? (I don't know)  You don't know lots of things, and should probably remain quiet.  They also won 7 of 8 twice, and have already won more games than just about anyone thought they would this season."
"why would you think that? hes like 280 pounds and hes no exactly that big for a PF, 6 foot 6-7 for a Pf is iffy, combined with his weight he simply can't possibly have the lateral speed to be a good defender. he'd need to be pretty smart to makeup for it like Draymond, but Green is like 230"
Hopefully Kevon Looney or Draymond Green
Most notably not on that list: Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"&gt;there’s a reason the curry/draymond pnr is so effective and that is because green is an elite decision maker.   The reason is Steph is the greatest shooter ever and probably the greatest pnr ball handler ever. Draymond does make good decisions here but he also takes away from the overall effectiveness of the play by being a non scoring threat. Otherwise, defenses would have to send someone his way and leave another player to protect the basket. At the moment they just have the one player protecting the basket (which sucks even more if wise/looney are the floor with him because now you have one defender effectively cover two of our players) and all other defenders focused on other players."
this simply not true. there’s a reason the curry/draymond pnr is so effective and that is because green is an elite decision maker. He is an awful shooter and teams literally sit in the paint when he has the ball at the top of the key and yet he’s still able to find dudes open. I honestly have no clue what games you’re watching if you think he “struggles to make anything of it”. There are a couples times a game where draymond has a 4 on 3 and I want to slam my head against a wall bc he tries to pass when has an open lane or bricks a wide open elbow jumper but for the most part he is still effective with the 4 on 3 or else the warriors wouldn’t continue to put him in in that situation
Draymond Green. He's elite defensively but people fail to realize how bad his offensive game is due to his passing. He literally plays 4 on 3 any time he has the ball yet struggles to make anything out of it. Defenders have zero respect for him and just focus their energy on everyone else on the floor. Our offense completely shuts down against teams that are willing to hard-double Steph.
"Do people hate draymond green? I understand why someone would but it just seems like I rarely see draymond hate, almost like it’s too easy"
"Uh, Draymond Green is doing that.  And also directing the entire team defensively.  Ask presumed MVP Jokic about it."
Iggy is definitely one of the best guys to guard lebron and Durant. That being said it helped a lot having draymond green and bogus behind him. You can’t guard these guys one on one you need a rim protector and team defense
All of this just to lose to Draymond Green
Yeah that was him. Held a supremely talented offensive player to sub 40 unlike rudy who can't keep rich mans draymond green under 40. Sad existence.
"I said peak draymond is better. Plus it depends on what the team needs since they play differently. Rodman was better 1v1 defender but green was a better team defender etc etc, so many differsnces"
"To be fair, Kyrie’s a legit scorer and Simmons is basically Draymond Green with clout"
"Yea in my scenario everything will stay the same, his arms will just be a bit longer. Like Draymond Green is 6'5, but has a 7'1 wingspan, that helps him tremendously on defense."

Brutally shoves rival Draymond Green and coldly embraces bane of his existence Steph Curry
Cavalier's forward Kevin love savagely slaps the hand of warriors guard Stephen Curry and warriors forward Draymond Green
"It's more like Warriors will have to try to survive with only Kevon Looney, Draymond Green, and Juan Tuscano-Anderson as ""bigs"" with Looney being 6'9"" with a 2"" vertical, and Green and Juan at 6'6"" lol."
"Lol this is the most ill-informed nonsense ever, Draymond was a defensive player of the year in his prime from 2017-2019, while Ray Allen on the heat averaged...10 PPG with good shooting and bad defense  Imagine replacing 2012-2014 Ray Allen on the Heat with a prime Draymond Green looool"
"Why are you only looking at blazers vs warriors lmfao, talk about changing the subject. I thought this was about Curry vs Dame as individual players?   If you want to bring their teams into it, I wonder who’s team would be better— Dame alongside Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.. and Curry alongside CJ, Melo, and Nurkic who is injured more often than not 🤔. I think we all know the answer"
"I guess Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Kawhi Leonard are just scrubs huh?"
"The problem on their team is not Draymond Green, it's James Wiseman. Green is still really good. Wiseman has been singlehandedly tanking the Warriors almost every single minute he's on the court."
"Also GSW prioritized developing Wiseman instead of winning more games.  They are a better team when Looney is a starter and Paschall his replacement.  If they make it to the playoffs they will be a tough team to beat since their defense is top 5, Draymond Green started to score more( for his standars) and Curry is unstopable."

Prime draymond green actually shot well from 3. That’s the tipping point for me. Give me team green.
"It is much cheaper for Lacob than Draymond though. People that wealthy are essentially paying around 50% total tax rate,  but only the owner can use this as an expense.   So if Green bought the wine, it would be a personal expense, and would essentially cost $10,000, because Dray has to earn $10,000 to come up with an after tax amount of $5,000 to pay for the wine.   However, if Lacob bought it, this now becomes a business expense for the warriors in the form of a team dinner, and the cost of the wine becomes tax deductible. The cost to Lacob is now $2,500 because that $5,000 would have been otherwise taxed.   End result is Lacob losses 2500, the government loses 2500 in taxes, and the restaurant gains 5000 in revenue. Compared to Green losses 10,000, government gets 5,000 in taxes, and the restaurant gets 5,000 in revenue.   Net difference is 7,500 USD, so of course it is better for Lacob to pick up the tab."

"Better: Draymond Green  Worse: Westbrook  Now I feel the need to defend my take on Westbrook, I'm not saying Westbrook is a bad player or anything, he's a superstar and a great player that is a HOF lock. Butttt his stats can sometimes be a tad misleading, stat watchers look at Westbrook and may be misled to think he's wayyy better than he actually is"
"“I honestly wouldn’t bat an eye at a stat that said Steph Curry hasn’t missed a three from inside 25 feet since November, or that Draymond Green out-rebounded the entire other team combined in a majority of games this season. Hell, it wouldn’t surprise me if I heard the Warriors have the highest-ever number of points per game against teams with a winning record. All of that’s probably true, for all I know.”   https://sports.theonion.com/man-ready-to-believe-any-statistic-about-how-good-warri-1819578783"
"Thats the fucking point, because #77 has not really been worn by any other notable player its much easier for Luka Doncic to make that number his as long as he keeps up what he is currently doing. Right now maybe not, but in the future #77 will become synonymous with Doncic  You just proved the other guys point, when people think of #23 they will think of MJ/LeBron, not Draymond Green"
"&gt; When people see 77, they will remember Luka.  They absolutely will not. I've followed the NBA daily throughout Luka's career and had no recollection of his number. 77 is an ugly number.  &gt;Ain't nobody remembers 23 as Draymond Green.  No because Michael Jordan and Lebron James fucking wore it. Is that a serious example?"
"Eh, 77 will be his own number. When people see 77, they will remember Luka. Ain't nobody remembers 23 as Draymond Green."
"He'd basically be a slightly better version of current Ben Simmons. Like Simmons is such a non threat away from the basket, he makes Draymond Green feel like Klay Thompson. Simmons is already elite at pretty much everything else like peak Lebron was but if Lebron didn't have even the threat of a jumper, it would be a lot easier to guard him. Even when Lebron's jumper was at it's weakest he could at least shoot well enough to keep the defense honest."
Laughs in draymond green
"Steph’s game will get a lot of attention justifiably, but how about Draymond Green? 12/10/16/3/2 with 5/10 shooting is a monster game in a typical Green fashion: contribute all over the place."

"I'm glad to see draymond green get his respect. He is still one of the best defenders and the best hustler in the NBA, even when dealing with the afteraffects of covid."
He has always been. This is nothing new. He’s like a better scoring Draymond Green of guards.
Simmons has replaced Draymond Green as most versatile defender in the league... he can guard 1 to 5 at an elite level IMO.
"Now, Shaq. Perhaps the most risky part of this team, he makes or breaks it. If he doesn't get along with the team, I'd just replace him with Hakeem or Kareem. But, if he DOES get along, what he offers can't be matched. With Curry like gravity, he's going to be essentially unstoppable. Players like Shaq and MJ are the reason this team has so many passers and floor stretchers. The less Klay has the ball while still stretching the floor, the greater Shaq will be. Imagine a lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Durant/Shaq. 4 out, 1 in, feasting. It'd be so damn nuts. He can rebound, defend and protect the rim, and is perhaps the most reliable and consistent bucket getter on the team. Pass to him and you have a 70% chance of 2 points. If he gets tripled, you have Bird or Klay ready to shoot. And if they are guarded, you probably have a high IQ player like Lebron ready to warp the defense to exploit the triple team, resulting in the most efficient shot. See Shaqs upside? All of that was possible thanks to him simply being, him.   Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is EXTREMELY useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, yet he had perhaps the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound ANYONE. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense.  Then, we have Duncan. You know, I made this comment because I realized I completely forgot to talk about him. That says alot about his style. Quiet, not flashy, but he gets the job done. He, like Garnett will focus on defense, any kind of defense. I trust him to get the job done. He's the little thing king. So much of what he does doesn't appear on the stat sheet. If this team ever happened, and they played a game, you'd probably look at the box score and think ""Huh, Duncan, meh performance... Disappointing..."" You wouldn't see the leadership and selflessness he displayed when the team was down 17, inspiring the team. You wouldn't see the rim protection, the pass leading to a pass, or the team play. In fact, I don't think he cares about those stats. For another video, I'd reccomend Thinking Basketballs Tim Duncan video or Clayton Crowleys video on Duncan. As I said before, I value BBIQ and passing, and with Duncan playing for Pop for 15 years, he certainly has those attributes. With so many superstars, it's nice to have a consistent guy like Duncan who can't really be gameplanned against that much.  Then, the last 2 are KD and Green. I was SO close to adding Pippen but removed him at the last second for KD. KD's main purpose will be stretching the floor and getting buckets in a consistent and reliable way, similar to Shaq. Draymonds main purpose would be providing the intangibles of spirit and fire, and acting as a ball handler. If Lebrons on the bench and Magic or Bird have been gameplanned against somehow, you have Draymond to fill that spot as the facilitator. He can't exactly shoot but in this lineup, you can play him smallball center or play Garnett at C to make up for it. Jordan/Steph/Klay/Dray/Garnett could be an unpredictable lineup but Jordan at 1 works. This team is just completely unstoppable. Running Lebron + 3nD? I'll go Magic/Jordan/Bird/Duncan/Shaq and feast on your vulnerable interior. Running an old school lineup? I'll go Steph/Klay/Bird/KD/Dray and burn you."
"(Copy and Pasted)  ***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  2017 Kevin Durant, and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)   Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. You have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball. He has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. People hate on Garnett for not having high volume but that helps here as his efficiency is going to be sorely needed. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. Stephs ridiculous shooting is just so reliable. He's also super clutch and is able to act as an ok team defender. It's super obvious he HAS to be here. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better. His only loss is a SLIGHTLY slower first step.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He can shoot and dial in defensively when needed. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. He's acting as a jack of all trades in a way. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own shot, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have 2 clutch players and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan really completes the team. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (ideally not the 3, but jesus, look at the team. No way in hell he's the one getting the ball at the 3 line when you have such a good coaching staff, so many high IQ players, so many great passers and so many elite shooters. A non issue.) He is GOING to be the leader of the team. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. He rebounds excellently and he can use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (We have SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass and offer a new vitality to the team.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense."

how can anyone watch how bad our team struggles when Luka isn’t doing everything on offense and think   “yea replacing our second best scorer with Draymond Green would make us better”  somebody who needs the ball in their hands to create on offense without any ability to score whatsoever would go disastrously with Rick   i would love to have Draymond on the team but i’m not replacing KP with him that’s fucking insane...

how the fuck is everyone so dense in this thread. it is  **draymond green. talking shit. during a basketball game.** it's not a fucking truth claim. it's not an argument. it's has no bearing on truth whatsoever.
"&gt;Draymond green without curry, kd and klay to prop him up is garbage.  &gt;Defense does matter, surprisingly.   How can you hold these 2 opinions at the same time????"
"&gt;Draymond green without curry, kd and klay to prop him up is garbage.  &gt;Efficiency isn't all that matters. Defense does matter, surprisingly.   Aren't these 2 opinions pretty contradictory?"
Lit deflecting my guy. I didn't realize this thread was about a hypothetical Blazers vs. Warriors play in match.  I thought we were discussing an absolutely braindead statement by Draymond Green. And then you lashed out at my flair like a pouting child.  Good luck my man. Maybe you'll grow some thicker skin someday.
Here’s the full sequence:  Draymond Green fouls Zach Collins  Foul upgraded to flagrant 1 (highly questionable btw)  Steve Kerr gets two techs and gets ejected  Draymond Green gets a tech  Damian Lillard makes 3 technical free throws  Zach Collins makes 2 flagrant free throws  Jake Layman makes a 3  https://youtu.be/qv7GbA0R76U
What about a hit to the head by Draymond?  https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=242&amp;GameID=0022000932&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Green%20S.FOUL%20(P3.T3)%20(B.Forte)&amp;sct=plot
We all know Draymond gets away with hits to the head all the time. https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=242&amp;GameID=0022000932&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Green%20S.FOUL%20(P3.T3)%20(B.Forte)&amp;sct=plot
I mean...Draymond? https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=242&amp;GameID=0022000932&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Green%20S.FOUL%20(P3.T3)%20(B.Forte)&amp;sct=plot
I think it's partly because Draymond hit nothing but head and got a common foul. https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=242&amp;GameID=0022000932&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Green%20S.FOUL%20(P3.T3)%20(B.Forte)&amp;sct=plot

You are looking at this from an entirely different (and erroneous) perspective.    I understand how the supermax works yet you still keep trying to explain it to me. That doesn’t change the fact that Rudy Gobert isn’t worth that kind of money. Gobert is not worth 33 nor is he worth 40 mil a year. I would say in today’s nba he is worth roughly around what Draymond Green is worth. You aren’t ever going to be an actual title contender paying Gobert north of 30mil a year unless he is somehow your 3rd option and your other 2 stars are AD and LeBron. It’s just way too much money.    Also the supermax still impacts how much salary cap you have to allot to potential free agent signings. My argument is that Rudy Gobert + another max star player + vet minimums are not enough to win you a title. That’s the claim I am making.    The jazz did a pseudo win now move to appease their fans but they aren’t actual contenders. Rudy Gobert is not a modern center and that roster as presently constructed is not good enough to make it out of the west let alone to win a ring.
"Draymond green without curry, kd and klay to prop him up is garbage.  Efficiency isn't all that matters.  Defense does matter, surprisingly.   The Nuggets and jazz never had a chance at the title to begin with.   Jokic will win the MVP award by default not because he actually deserves it.   James Harden is the least enjoyable player to watch."
"Steph Curry creates space for his teammates with his off-ball movement. Draymond Green is typically trusted to make the passes to those teammates.  Guys like Harden, CP3, Lebron, etc take the ball and get their teammates open *and* make the passes themselves.   That tends to be the difference imo. Those guys can be offensive systems on their own with the ball in their hands."
Draymond green is probably the most overrated player in NBA history. Dude was propped up by Klay /Curry and KD and it's blatantly obvious with Klay and KD gone.
Draymond green literally had 19 assists the other day
That's why it's so disappointing. He was given the easiest job in the NBA. Being the third option on a LBJ team. Getting spoon-fed every wide open three you want or an easy pick-and-roll. And you post 16/9/2 as an all-nba-player. No need to waste that much money on so little value.   All NBA second team forwards the years after him. Durant. Pau Gasol. Draymond Green. Giannis. Kawhi.   How disappointing would they be playing like Love did.
Wtf?! Where is draymond green?
"Dejounte Murray has exceeded expectations especially on the offensive end. I echo Boucher, MPJ.  Aside from TO's Draymond Green has been killing it and Tj McConnell too."
"It was very obviously not easier when Oscar Robertson was doing it.  From 1961-1966, Robertson (30/11/10) and Jerry West (28/5/7) were the only players to average 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game.  From 2016-2021, 14 different players have averaged 5 rebound and 5 assists per game--including 6 players who have averaged 7/7 (Russ, LeBron, Simmons, Doncic, Draymond).

"Picture a version of Draymond Green who is taller and more talented, plus an olympic level athlete."
Don't forget Bobby Jones who was like the late 70s/early 80s version of Draymond Green and arguably a top 10 PF of all time.
I guess Klay Thompson and Draymond Green dont exist?
Love has never played well against the. Warriors. The three best players would be Draymond / Wiggins/ and random Jeff Green game / then Love  Warriors in 6
 Draymond Green hahaha
Draymond Green can get triple doubles every game if he wanted
Draymond Green
Probably Julio. Though it's not like Love is some slouch lol.  That's not the conversation at hand though. We aren't talking about who is better.  We are talking about who is more accomplished.    Calvin Johnson is clearly a better player and athlete than Draymond Green.  A truly imposing and dominating force the league over.  Green's got 3 rings and a DPOY.  Green is more accomplished.
"At one point, if you were going to guard Curry, that meant you would fight through an Andrew bogut screen followed by a Draymond Green or Andre iguodala screen. Almost every play.   Fuck that's gotta hurt"
Maybe. I remember thinking it's gonna be a brick everytime he went for a shot. Like Draymond Green in that way. Rodman's strength was rebounding and annoying the fuck out of anyone he could.
Love just happened to be the third best player on Lebrons team. He added to the team but he wasn’t pivotal and it could have been any of number of players to fill his spot. Unless you’re the leader of the team I think personal accolades go way farther than team accomplishments. Does anyone really think Draymond Green is a better athlete than someone like Calvin Johnson?
Draymond Green MVP
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
I'd recognize Draymond Green from his 5/11/17/4/2 statline and backpack jumper
"50/8/5/3 the prior game losing at home by 8 after carrying the team with the then NBA history highest usage rate and winning 14 of 19 games before the collapse. Its not making ""mY oWn rEaLiTy"" of what happened. Its taking about a what if scenario, similar to that of the 2015 Cavs if Kyrie and Love didnt get hurt or if the NBA actually punished Draymond Green for flagrant fouls and suspended him against the Thunder in 2016"
How does it feel to have an inferior sub to draymond green?
"He was a highly regarded center prospect drafted #2 overall in the draft. Who should I compare him to, jakob poeltl? As far as his job being harder... How? Dude is playing next to Draymond Green who is a phenomenal defender capable of covering up mistakes and helping him on the court. He's playing on a great offense that can feed him easy looks. I think he's in a pretty good situation, one that has made plenty of other guys look great who weren't great. On his own team he's playing far far far worse than Kevon Looney. I would expect the #2 pick in the draft and #1 center taken to be at least as good as a replacement level big."
"""The Los Angeles Clippers have traded Kawhi Leonard for Draymond Green; [Ballmer to take over as head coach](https://media.tenor.com/images/21217ae769924c38a3b692d481e6448b/tenor.gif)."""
For Warriors its   Draymond Green - Donkey
"Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Paschall   Over IT, JR, Love, TT, Jeff Green"

"Exactly. People on this sub won’t see it like that though. They still think the 73-9 warriors had no way to win because draymond green, their 4th best player at best, missed one game."

"Steph Curry, one of the greatest players of all time, is a 10th seed with a better version of wiggins and draymond green. I don’t see how you can expect KAT to do good when he had a shitty version of wiggins and ig jeff teague as his third best player. It’s way harder then you think to carry a shit team to being good."

Draymond Green burned him with his man on a backdoor cut about 4 or 5 times last game along with him getting burned on his guy getting behind him on a fast break. This kid has the BBIQ of an ameba.
"Stylistically, Draymond is a rich man's Josh Smith from his Aflanta days. Smith was a versatile defender with some passing acumen who couldn't shoot from the 4 position. That's Draymond. Green is a far, far superior player, but Smith in his prime was pretty unique."
"Bro I was convinced that Denzel Valentine would be the next Draymond Green. He was a four year Michigan State star with same kinda body type  and a great distributor, better than Draymond was in college, and a good jump shot. Sure Valentine was considered a poor defender but Dray wasn't touted as a future DPOY candidate coming out of college either. I really wanted the Hawks to grab him.  I'm dumb as shit."
"Draymond Green is a very sad excuse for a basketball player. Imagine being a writer with constant writer’s block or a bank with no loot or a tree that bears no fruit. That’s essentially what Draymond is: a basketball player who can’t shoot. Durant might still be on the Warriors had it not been for Draymond so in that regard, Draymond is an incredible liability. He’s an offensive liability because he can’t make an open shot. And he’s an emotional liability because he gets into it with his own teammates and opposing players. And then he jokes about it here in self-mocking fashion not understanding that the Warriors are paying him $25 mill/year and his shooting has not improved. He can’t make 3s, can’t make an open mid-range jumper, can’t make FTs and has the mos cringeworthy jump shot. He is like the most useless $25 mill in the world."
"Obviously if you just take love out, but if you replace him with any switchable defender who can create offense for the money he was making they’re way better. No denying that. Love looked like a child against Draymond green"
" The Celtics problems weren't solely on Kyrie,! It was a combo of Kyrie, bloated egos from the young guys and the rushing back of Gordon Hayward, who took minutes away from some of the young players, Kyrie is not a vocal leader, in the locker room, neither is KD or Steph they let their plays do the talking on the court, not everyone can be a leader like LeBron or-Draymond Green., James Harden.      Kyrie was the scapegoat and it’s obvious. Even now, The Celtics'' current leader on the team is Marcus Smart, instead of Tatum. Smart is extremely vocal in the locker room. Tatum is incredibly quiet. He, like all those players I mentioned, lets his play do most the talking."

"While there is validity to what your saying (and not being able to shoot is a pretty important metric) turns out that Curry actually benefits tremendously when he plays alongside Green. Steph shoots 46.9 percent from 3-point range with Draymond on the floor, and just 32.6 percent when he is off the floor (h/t FiveThirtyEight/NBA Advanced Stats).   Curry's plus-minus also drops dramatically from 4.3 (per 36 minutes) when the two are on the floor together to -4.7 when Steph isn't sharing the court with Draymond. Just 2.8 turnovers are committed by Curry with Green on the floor, while Steph averages 5.2 over 36 minutes without his longtime teammate. So it isn’t totally a one way street"
"this is pretty ridiculous. you give lebron the excuse of not having kevin love and kyrie the year before.  but you don't give steph curry the excuse of having a significant nagging injury that immediately dropped his play off a cliff and draymond green being suspended for barely anything.  steph was injured. the warriors best player was injured. those are the same metrics you used for giviing lebron an excuse but you don't give curry that excuse.  &amp;#x200B;  lebron should have won 2015, barring injuries; steph should have won 2016, barring injuries. they're even on these fronts."
He’s having a draymond green type of game.
"Curry is not a PG. He is more of a combo guard like Jerry West. He barely runs the offense, that is usually Draymond Green setting things up and dictating tempo. The same thing when Iggy and Livingston were there. That is what made the Warriors so unique, they had so many playmakers and versatile defenders."
Which was evident when KP was ejected for basically nothing.   Based on that ejection Draymond Green doesn't finish a single playoff game in his career.
Keep up the Draymond Green slander please lol
"Both are elite defenders.  Don't just assume Rodman was a ""big"" defender and rebounder. He could guard one to five at an elite level.. Think Draymond Green but could bang with Shaq."

"Gasol is also having a really good defensive season, what are you talking about?   Gasol and Green have the same DBPM, and they're pretty close in DRPM, DRAPTOR, and DLEBRON. They're pretty much even in terms of advanced stats and Gasol is on the #1 defense in the league.  It doesn't mean what it used to because Draymond isn't an All-Star level player anymore, he barely scores anymore."
"What in the world are you talking about? Was it not just two years ago that the Golden State Warriors had Durant, Steph, and Klay? Not to mention guys like Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, two of the very best role players in the league (and saying that much is arguably disrespectful to two former all-stars). AND that doesn't even consider that another washed all-star in Demarcus Cousins was a part of their rotation as well. Don't get me wrong, the nets are very good, but it's not something the league hasn't see before."
Are draymond green/Rudy Gobert better defenders than Scottie pippen/Tim Duncan because they have DPOYS?
"&gt;3x All Star and 1x DPOY Draymond Green  This is like saying the Lakers have 3x All Star and 1x DPOY Marc Gasol. It's true, but it doesn't mean what it used to."
"to be fair, imagine being the lakers, you have a fucked up season with injuries, and you end it with a play-in game which you could expect to be easy but then you turn around and who is it - it's scoring leader mvp level steph curry, with defensive king draymond green, with andrew wiggins reborn as an all star level 3rd option.   i bet they can't be happy either lmao"
"Gobert is a great player, but if you put him on a terrible team, I don't think he'd make a huge impact as it relates to winning games. Sort of like Draymond Green in that regard."
"Oh my god, the degree to which you just made me realise: the Kings passed on all of Steph, Klay and Draymond.  They are the only team that did that. The only teams that passed on both Steph and Klay are the Kings and Timberwolves, but the Timberwolves, oddly enough, didn't have a shot at Draymond. I'd thought it was just the Spurs, but nope, Twolves too.  That's quite the distinction.  Admittedly this is probably a worse look for the Twolves, since they passed on Steph *twice* and taking Draymond Green at 5 would definitely, at the time, have been a reach, especially since Steph was having his really bad ankle issues that year and even if you *had* Steph and Klay you might very sensibly take Lillard if he was still on the board.  But still, the Kings are the only team who could have had the Warriors' big three and didn't."

"Yes. Exactly. Draymond is a once in a generation level defensive player.  Wiggins defensive rating on [111 on BBRef](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html), higher than GSW as a whole and 7th among rotation players on the team. The best case for his defense is, he's up to 21st in [DRPM on ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), a stat which has Draymond Green ranked 55, behind CJ McCullum and Zion Williamson.  His DRTG [on NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*GE*20)is around 75th for players who play more than 20 MPG. None of that to me screams ""All-Defense""."
Klay Thompson is not better than Draymond Green.
"Does this prove stephen curry is a good floor raiser ? Is this really Stephen Curry's achievement by his own? I disagree. Yeah curry's gravity makes other players play more comfortably, but I don't see him creating for his teammates all the time(and he should not). Curry is also a great playmaker, but that role belongs to draymond green i think.Also steve kerr is a damn good coach, who is a massive upgrade over Saunders.   Curry needs to shoot, needs to score because no one else can do these things like him. Therefore he is a ceiling raiser, he needs to be used as a ceiling raiser. A hooper as skilled as curry can do whatever he wants, including making bums look like legit nba players, however it is not optimal.  Wiggins had a career year, but main reason behind that is the change of attitude from minny to gsw. All the other factors come after that."
"I would take Klay.  But I don't want Draymond.  Everyone hates me when I say this, but I don't think his attitude or on-court behavior would do well with the Blazers or the fan base.  He's too caustic, too aggressive.  We like some trash talk, but we don't want someone who is consistently at the top of the leader board for technical fouls.   I want players I can show to my little goddaughter, who is all of four years old, and say, ""you should try and be like him.""  I don't want my sweet, friendly little girl to grow up to be an asshat, and Draymond Green is an asshat.  I want my little girl to grow up to be like Dame or Steph or Klay.  Kind, respectful, hard working.  But Dray gets wins, so fuck me, right?  I've only been a Blazers fan since I was a little boy in the early Drexler era, and worked for them as production staff for the last three seasons, what do I know?  I get the same response when I say Rasheed was a horrible person and we never should have brought him on board."
"&gt;	What part of scoring is creation and protecting the rim part of?  How do we define scoring? As shooting the ball into the basket? Or is it more nuanced? Creation, the idea that you can create opportunities for your teammates (much like Curry contorting defenses by moving off ball), is essential to scoring the basketball.   Rim protection is the golden standard for defensive impact. And it’s not close. Which is why ben simmons will and never should win DPOY when Draymond green, Gobert and Giannis all exist and have anchored historic defenses themselves."
Draymond Green does wonders for teaching other players to play good defense.
I don’t wanna hear any Draymond Green slander again. Steph has always been doing magical things with him on the court.
"No, Draymond Green is not currently in the Hall of Fame."
Draymond Green would probably get another technical
Draymond Green screamed it out of him.
Draymond Green still being slept on by most fans and media.
Well not steph any more.  Kerr said that after steph dribbled through the entire clippers team to take the 3 he gave up thinking it wasn't a good shot.  But with Draymond absolutely. I have no doubt in my mind that draymond would have worked more on his 3pt shooting if Kerr encouraged him to keep shooting rather than telling him to not. After the OT win against OKC (the bang bang game) Draymond shot 33% from 3 and on substantially lower volume. I just don't think there can be any other conclusion to draw when Kerr was yelling at green for taking 3s in that game.
"You can put them all into one tier if you want, this is not supposed to be some concrete thing, just my gut feelings off the top of my head. As for why, I mean AD had LeBron and has only won it once in a very unique circumstance. Being a champ doesn't automatically put you in tier 1, it's not like I think Draymond Green is on LeBron/Curry level even though he's won multiple times. If you wanna make your own list then go for it, all I'm trying to say is that there's a pretty small group of guys in the west who people give that playoff edge and Utah doesn't have any of them.  And yeah, hence why I said maybe, I'm not sure if prime Melo is good enough."
"is MPJ more valuable than draymond green?  considering the warriors ended up #5 in defense, i would say no.  people act like steph lifted the warriors up to a top 10 offense and carried a sorry defense.  he lifted up what would certainly be the worst offense in the league, but only up to #22 or #23.  that team plays elite D."
"They've given maple Jordan prime Stephen curry and draymond ""what if you have me head but as a joke"" Green. League fucked."
"Agreed, KG was an elite PnR defender and when switched out on wings did a tremendous job at 6’11”. Amazing instincts. But he was mostly an interior defender. Garnett wasn’t matched up against opposing guards from the jump, it was usually on switches and temporary schemes.  Just last week, Draymond was Chris Paul’s primary defender. Green can defend 1-5 for an entire game by design, without a team putting him into that position because of a switch. That’s what I was getting at.  Your assessment of Garnett’s defensive strengths are legit, he was insane, but I have Green slightly ahead in the help defense/versatility role because of his better malleability and also probably my own fan bias.

"Dubs have a top 5 defense, and Draymond Green, good luck with that"
"I see where you’re coming from and I agree, it’s tough to scramble and still communicate while recovering from an offensive rebound. Memphis is a young team and Curry is a unique player, it’s not like they’ve ever schemed for this specific situation against the Warriors specific personnel. I don’t think it’s that unreasonable that Green was wide open given the circumstances, except that JJJ should’ve known not to double until he had confirmation that someone else behind him could come up to deny the pass (should’ve been Morant who looked a little lost but was closest to Draymond. And then I have no idea why the other player on Curry just left after JJJ took over. But youre right after that Curry just beat JJJ to the line in a foot race"
"ESPN NBA Rank this season said Curry's only top 100 teammate was Draymond Green, ranked #44th.  ESPN NBA Rank last season said CP3 had SGA at #64, Adams at #75, and Gallinari at #91.  So according to them, CP3 had a better team around him."
"Draymond ""Quadruple Single"" Green"
I was very wrong about Draymond Green being a bad NBA player
lebron james has never won a series against steph curry without draymond green being suspended during the series
"Yeah that’s my argument. The whole point is to judge someone by how much they impact winning, which is why a Draymond green is better than Drummond but never had better counting stats, and we can all agree there.  Ingles on your own team impacts winning at a more important level. Clarkson doesn’t shoot above league average, a bad defender, and you will commonly see him score 25 but have a negative impact on the game overall"
Draymond green probably has more fouls than points this year.

Draymond Green
really speaks volumes to just how good his defense was that it overwhelmingly outweighed his offense.  But Dennis Rodman making the HOF on defense alone already showed that there was room for defensive specialists in the hall. It also means Draymond Green has a pretty good chance to make the HOF too.
"The Warriors have a pretty scary defense.  I think he learned about the menace that is ""Draymond Green"" and it shook his confidence."
This has been a Draymond Green clinic
Draymond Green bb
"Draymond Green doesn’t get the same amount of criticism because his best years are behind him and he’s part of a sub-par team. I would argue that it’s an indictment against Draymond Green every time someone talks about how little help Steph Curry has. Draymond Green gets less criticism than Ben Simmons because one of them is a young player in their prime who has shown little-to-no improvement in their game over the last four seasons, while the other is half the player that he used to be. On top of that, Draymond in his prime was a better midrange and three point shooter than Ben Simmons has shown to be this far in his career. Draymond shot the 3 at a 33.4 clip during Golden State’s dynasty (2015-2018). That’s a decent enough clip that you actually have to defend it. When Draymond was in his prime, his game didn’t have the cracks in it that Simmons has in his. He was a much better shooter and rebounder, and his assist numbers were as good or better than Simmons’ current numbers each year. If Draymond was 25 or so and playing like he is today, yes, he would get criticism. If he was playing the way he does now and still making All-Star games, yes, he would get criticism. But at this point you’re basically asking for a 31-year-old role player to get the same amount of criticism as a 24-year-old All-Star. That’s a bit of a ridiculous ask."
"You *have* to know how disingenuous you’re being when comparing Draymond and Ben’s three point shooting. One has shot 10 3’s this year; the other has shot 124. He’s virtually the same size as Bam, who guards 1-5 just as well as Simmons does. Bam has a better FG% than Ben, despite Ben taking 91% (!!!!) of his shots from within 10 ft. And Ben is only averaging 1.5 more APG than Bam, while fouling and turning the ball over at a higher clip and rebounding and scoring less. If Bam has been able to expand his offense, there’s no real excuse. And if peak Draymond Green is Ben Simmons’ ceiling, Ben Simmons isn’t the player everyone said he was going to be."
"I saw him hit 2 jumpers near the elbow a game or two before they played the Heat. I'd like to see him do it more, but he's still an amazing player. He's 8th in steals and 12th in assists. He has a better 3pt % than Draymond Green AND gets more buckets than Dray.  He's one of, if not, the best defensive player in the NBA. If anyone jumps in here saying Rudy Gobert I swear to god I will smash the downvote button so hard my keyboard will break.  &amp;#x200B;  Yes 3 or 4 defenders were absolutely converging on him. I believe the Heat were running a zone D at the time.    &amp;#x200B;  I don't understand the Ben slander, but I do think '7ft Rondo' is a hilarious slander."
That's Draymond Green music!
"It helps to ALSO have Draymond F. Green, Dray"
"There's now three players who got in solely because of their defense:  Dikembe Mutombo  Dennis Rodman  Ben Wallace  Really speaks well for Draymond Green's chances. I think Green will definitely get in.  I don't think Rudy Gobert will, though, unless he wins at least one ring."
"I can tell you never watched a game from that era of Pistons basketball because that is outright false, especially the Tayshaun point.   I'm gonna guess that the only reason you even *know* Tayshaun's name is because of the block in the ECF, but let's advance a series.   If Tayshaun did always guard the other team's best player, surely he'd be on either Kobe or Shaq. Nope. Ben was Shaq's primary defender and the Mr. Big Shot was Kobe's primary defender. I believe Prince usually guarded Gary Payton, actually, who was three years away from retirement.   Sheed was a fantastic defender in his own right, but not better than Ben. Sheed had two primarily roles on that team: the personality that the team desperately needed (because adding a personality like Rasheed Wallace is similar to adding someone like a Draymond Green or a Richard Sherman in that regard), and he was one of the best stretch fours at the time not named Dirk Nowitzki."
"Draymond himself credited Bogut for his defensive development lol.  &gt;“I’ll never forget it,” Green said. “My first day out at Golden State he was teaching me different things you could do that you couldn’t do in college and throughout the course of that year just teaching me positioning.  “I wouldn’t be half the defender I am without Andrew Bogut. He taught me so much about defence that I owe all my success to him, defensively.”  [source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/06/draymond-green-says-andrew-bogut-taught-him-how-to-play-nba-defense/)"

"""The Grizzlies (37-33, same record as the Warriors) beat the Kings tonight, which means Sunday’s MEM-GSW game will determine which team finishes in 8th place, with the right to fly to the 7th place team’s homecourt and battle for the official No. 7 seed in the playoffs, probably on Tue 5/18 or Wed 5/19 (we think it will be Wednesday as that night is more desirable for the networks to have Stephen Curry on TV than Tuesday, but we’ll see if there are other factors involved).      The loser of Sunday’s big Grizzlies-Warriors matchup would have to face the 10th seed, win that, then play the loser of the 7th- vs 8th-place game for the official No. 8 seed in the playoffs.      Tomorrow’s game for each team (MEM-SAC and NOP-GSW) is thereby actually meaningless because all combinations will result in the Sunday MEM-GSW matchup still deciding who finishes in 8th place, with the notation that the head-to-head series between them is currently knotted up at 1-1:      If GSW beats NOP and MEM beats SAC: both teams are 38-33 heading into MEM-GSW. Obviously the winner on Sunday would finish 39-33, good for 8th place and better than the loser’s 38-34 final record.      If GSW loses to NOP and MEM beats SAC, GSW is 37-34 and MEM is 38-33 heading into the final game. GSW winning that final game means both finish tied at 38-34, but GSW would obviously win the head-to-head tiebreaker at 2-1.      If GSW beats NOP and MEM loses to SAC, GSW is 38-33 and MEM is 37-34, and GSW would have to beat MEM to avoid a tie at 38-34, in which MEM would win the head-to-head tiebreaker, 2-1.      And it follows that if GSW loses to NOP and MEM loses to SAC, both teams would be 37-34 and the winner of Sunday would obviously finish with the better W-L record at 38-38 and in 8th place.      Because tomorrow’s game is therefore “meaningless”, there is speculation that Steve Kerr will rest Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins, as they are all “banged up” (and Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell will be available)""      Courtesy of the Lets Go Warriors Youtube Channel"

"You are never going to rule out foul baiting in basketball, but it's comical how much easier to get a call on a jumpshot 30 feet away from the hoop than getting a call driving into the paint where undersized centers like Draymond Green and PJ Tucker can kick and hit and grab under the guise of ""verticality"" without actually trying to block anyone's shot.   The entire incentive of how the game is being called is just wrong. It's encouraging an ever horizontal game where what's truly great about basketball (the superhuman flyers, above the rim plays) are discouraged in favor of a game that's gonna look like handball.   they can keep protecting jumpshooters for all I like, all I'm asking for is players trying to score in the paint gets a fair shake too."

Dont get me wrong Green is a very good player but it's just kinda sad watching someone deliberately not be amazing.
You ever heard of the Clippers or Draymond Green?
He was playing through injury at the start of the year from ankle stuff in the playoffs and was talked about at least in speculation I think by draymond green at some point in the year about being uncharacteristically very out of shape   Then he flat out missed a huge chunk of the season after he tweaked it and basically has been playing his way back into shape since   Biggest reason people have been saying Lakers are vulnerable early is because Lebron and AD are both trying to get back into rhythm from extended injury time off

"The Warriors went with Steph Curry, who had never averaged 25 ppg in a season, Klay Thompson who has no ball handling skills, and Draymond Green who has the scoring potency of a donkey and won a championship and dominated the league. While getting rid of David Lee who was a very very good offensive player at the PF position. All by getting a new coach. The talent of the Warriors in 2015 and 2016 wasn't all that impressive. Guess what, the Duncan Spurs weren't all that talented either. Just coached well.  Yes, coaching schemes matter, considerably. A first round exit and pretender turned contender over one off-season and one coaching change.   Damian Lillard is the 2nd best deep range threat in the league today. And since when have you ever seen him run around screens or pin downs? The Blazers offense is literally to just work through Damian. Didn't work then. Still won't work now when they go up against strong defensive teams.   Didn't work for the Warriors in 2014.  Never worked for James Harden.  Didn't work for Russ.

"If we want to be reasonable people on r/NBA then I can tell you I don't think your reasoning was dumb but perhaps only reflected that you may not watch all the Warriors game or may not have followed Curry's whole career.  The reason I was high on the Warriors despite the Klay injury (before that I was thinking top 4 seed) I thought they had enough talent to be shooting for the 6/7 seed, depending on how the roster came together.  Watching Curry his entire pro career (I don't watch much NCAA) it's become obvious to me (and he's alluded to it in interviews) is that first and foremost he wants to maximize his talents and have the best NBA career he can. He's extremely driven in that regard. He works with his trainer, Brandon Payne, every off season to see what are the holes in his game, where can he improve, what are new ways he can score, how can he read and react faster and better, etc.  He's the epitome of a ""high character player"" in this league. He wants to be the best he can be ultimately because he knows how good he is and he has an interest in pushing his career as far as it will go.  I think a lot of people also undervalued Draymond Green, who clearly isn't what he was 3 years ago but can still anchor a top 5 defense and help direct an offense.   Wiggins also came to the organization with a lot of stink and poor reputation. So many probably discounted them being able to help the team. Frankly I was unsure of how much help he would be outside of simply being an athletic wing. But he's been really good, not great, but really good for the Warriors and should be a perfect 3rd option next year.   I guess I'm starting to just ramble now but I can admit that I understand *why* some people rated the Warriors like they did even if it felt obvious to me that they were being underrated.   Who you rooting for in the playoffs now?"
"Those guys aren’t stupid - exactly.   Jordan is passing to sharpshooter Steve Kerr to make that buzzer beater. He isn’t tossing it to Bill Wennington for the final shot.   Man, it wasn’t too many years ago in a playoff game where LeBron was doubled and passes the ball off at the end of a game and he was absolutely crucified by sports show hosts and fans. Crucified.   I get it. This sub thinks Curry can do no wrong.   But five seconds and your season on the line? Do you want Curry being “The Man” and taking on the double team? And if he can’t, find a shooter to pass to. OR Do you want Draymond Green with the ball at the top of the key?"

&gt; Oh so that’s why everyone hates ~~Grayson Allen~~ Draymond Green
Just solidifying why Jokic is the MVP. Currys supporting cast is as good as Jokics. Draymond Green and Wiggins compared to MPJ and Gordon. Yet Denver is a 3 seed and Warriors cannot even make the playofffs. The only reason MPJ is as good as he is. Because Jokic sets him up. Hes a catch and shoot guy. He really cannot create his own open shot.  Gordon usually scores on dunk lobs again via Jokic.
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn’t even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it’s up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis’ defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it’s what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks’ name because these 2 games he’s been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn’t on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it’s hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That’s a lot btw.)  ———————————————————————   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook’s minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he’s been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn’t call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder’s shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors’ execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip…](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6’9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV’s threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday’s game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that’s always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the “Curry experience”](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph’s 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don’t have Draymond’s help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV’s gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can’t switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ———————————————————————   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven’t mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray’s drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant’s shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an “so wide open its practice” 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond’s drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn’t make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn’t capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
Draymond Green is not an offensively skilled basketball player. Poor Curry having to defer to him after those doubles
"Draymond Green is better than all the greats like Barkley, Karl Malone coz he has rings  What a moron"
MSU named their weight room for Draymond Green?!?!?!
Zero help despite a top 5 NBA defense (and Draymond Green)?
"Draymond Green, NBA all star, starter on one of the greatest teams of all time, and his touch around the ring is worse than most high school hoopers"
"Lol @ me telling you. Did you not just watch the game?!? I don’t have to say a word it’s right there in 4K. When they needed a bucket they were smothered bc they were playing 4 on 5. If that’s not draymond green, the tape of those possessions would cause a mutiny on a team and/or get a coach fired for not adjusting. There is nothing more obvious to a hooper, and infuriating, than a self-check player on offense killing the team. Draymond is just lucky he’s loud and aggressive and everyone is probably scared to say anything .   Go watch the final minutes again. Draymond getting passed the ball wide open. Then whips a pass to a covered man, doing it so confidently like that’s all pet of the plan lmao So much so that fans like you think he’s facilitating or being a ‘great playmaker’ 😭😭  And I won’t even mention the potential game winner"
Draymond green doesn't have good peripheral vision 2 People open and you didn't pass 🤦
Something I was thinking of last night was that Tillman while at MSU would have worked out in a weight room named for Draymond Green and last night X eliminated him from the playoffs
Dame has constantly expressed an interest in acquiring Draymond Green the past 4 - 5 years. He retweeted a tweet in favour of this just today I think.
"I’m a huge Draymond Green fan, but I would love to see Booker turn the tables and recommend Draymond go to a winning team."

"Dude have you not been watching the Warriors this year? Teams have literally just not been guarding him at the 3pt line. He is a liability offensively in the moment we’re talking about. The only reason Draymond is still relevant is because he is so good at other things. He should not have the ball in his hand with less than 10 seconds on the clock.  Also, don’t even suggest for a second that Curry was hesitating because of how much he values certain possessions. Once again, as it has been for the last several years, one of the things that hurt the Warriors tonight was turnovers, a couple of which came from Steph at extremely important moments. Steph has more of a green light to shoot his shot than literally anyone else on Earth, and historically he hasn’t had too much care about whether or not a possession particularly matters."
what if i tell you that the nuggets are gonna start Facu campazzo and shaq harrison in their backcourt? Thats 2 draymond green type of guards who can defend but are liabilitys on offense.... its not crazy to think that portlands elite offense will outscore Jokic and MPJ
"I'm sure he is a high IQ guy, but not in the realm of gamesmanship of Rondo or CP3, or the ability to direct defensice adjustments like Draymond Green. Like most things, there are levels to this. Those guys plus LeBron and Kyle Lowry imo are just above the rest."
"Now I'm not pretending I know more about basketball than Draymond Green but dude, you're 31 years old but you okay like a person on vet min."
"Think you mean that the 4 other rockets could hit a shot. Look at the final play of regulation, curry made the right pass to a player that got a wide open run to the basket. Sadly that player was Draymond Green and he missed a fairly easy shot."
Draymond Green is not nearly an all star level player. He can’t even put up 10 a game. Find me an all star that averaged anything close to 7 points.
"The only reason teams are able to do this to Curry is because no one else on the offense can create for themselves. This doesn’t happen if Klay is playing (not to mention Durant, Iguadola, Livingston, etc.). The Warriors definitely forced the Green/Curry pick and roll all game and that led to some bad possessions and sloppy passing, but I don’t realistically know what else they should have done. Play make for Wiggins and Poole more? Unfortunately Curry and Green are the only two players who can run the offense and Draymond seems to have lost the ability to hit a contested layup or jump shot, so it’s really just Curry and the defense knows it.   Overall I think Curry had an off night and made significantly more unforced errors than normal, while playing against some really tough defense. No one else on the Warriors stepped up and they lost the game. This whole season it’s taken Curry being in God-mode to beat good teams."
"they also didnt trap him off the inbound straight away every time. He had plenty of screens set with Draymond after the inbound down the stretch. IMO it looked like it was Kerr's call to run Curry almost as a decoy because of how quick Steph was to just lob it over the 2nd defender, and TBH it SHOULD have worked. Green can easily make those little drive and dish plays.   overall though Steph should be doing more. Hes far too quick to just trap with 2 players.   Remember how upset everyone was when Bron passed up the big shot in game 5(i think) last year after that amazing battle with Butler? Thats what tonight felt like to me. Steph's hard carried this team all season and he was shut out of the game by a double team."
"Honestly I don't think it's this at all.   During the KD-era, they had issues trying to set guys up cause they had a whole bunch of guys trying to get the ball in their hands and not a whole lot of dudes trying to set screens for them and pass them the ball. They were spoiled from the Barnes/Green/Bogut era and thought they could do the same thing without the role players. In a lot of ways they were right cause they were so talented, but there's also a reason that team never would have won 73 games in their first 2 years.  Now they have all sorts of problems. They have players who cannot put the ball in the bucket, they have guys with no hands, they have guys who are inconsistent, and they have guys who can't play any defense at all and thus only play limited minutes. They try to feed guys where they can score but it's not as natural as it used to be, and it's far less efficient.  Add onto that both teams were literally just leaving Draymond Green alone and he was doing nothing to help, it was really too easy to force turnovers. Nothing Steph could have done except tell Kerr to change it up cause it wasn't working."
"If you listen to the Cav's tell it, the reason he went off is because they doubled down on Steph and Klay which left Green and Barnes. Harrison Barnes went 1-11, and so that left Draymond to have 30+ because the Cav's allowed him too.   Of course that was before the shoulder injury which left him with the ""backpack shot"". But I still don't get why he can't dunk and why he has no post-up-back-down-hook-shot."
"I was thinking, towards the end of the game, when Grizz had the ball to inbound with like 1.5 second left, up 2, with Steph on the bench and no timeout for Warriors (as they expect to foul immediately and get the ball back), would it be possible for Grizz to just inbound the ball directly to, say Draymond Green? lol He (or any Warrior) probably wouldn’t expect that and time would expire so soon. Even if they react with 1.5 seconds left and throw up a shot from ther back court it’s pretty sure it won’t go in (as Steph is not on floor). Also not possible to call timeout as they have none...Or am I crazy? lol"
"I think the problem is Draymond. He is considered and he considered himself, too much of playmaker and great passer. When he actually is just OK in that category, but he made a lot of bad passes. He had 12 TOs in two games. That's Russell Westbrook levels of careless with the ball.  Also Steph, for how much of a great shooter and player he is, he never was the best passer out there, he has vision but also he was historically careless with the ball.  So I don't expect any huge jump in the next season. Because the Warriors system will produce a lot of TOs, when you pass a lot the ball TOs possibility will increase. The only positive thing is that having back Klay could relief Steph from some pressure and maybe Pool and Wiggins will continue to grow in that aspect, so that at least the TOs of Curry would be reduced. As for Green you can't do much than live with that, also him will benefit from having more target to hit.   Oh they also need to add smart players into rotation. They need some smart veteran like Iggy and Livingston was for them in the past."
What’s the closest player to draymond green that blazers can get to push them over the hump?
"You mean Draymond needs it  It’s honestly mind boggling how bad he is on offense outside of passing. And even his passing is really sloppy at times  What does he work on in the summer? Like Simmons cant shoot but he has nice touch around the rim. Green can’t consistently hit contested layups, open floaters, open mid range, or open 3. I guarantee they won’t make it to the WCF as long as Green can’t put the ball in the hoop, even if Klay is 100%"
Im sure you know more about what the Warriors need instead of Draymond Green.
If someone has to explain to you why another team would fear Draymond Green then you just don't know very much about basketball.
Against the greatest defender in NBA history Draymond Green.
Draymond Green is a loser &amp; only in the NBA because of his height (like a lot of players). How can an NBA player be &amp; look so scared to shoot? He's complete shit.
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29628273/draymond-green-gets-50000-tampering-fine-saying-devin-booker-leave-suns
&gt;practically draymind green  Draymond green in the halfcourt is still an absolute problem with his screening and vision.   Simmons doesn’t have that.
Oladipo was a less efficient worse defensive version of Wiggins this year.   Grant was a young player who barely played.   Sabonis was a rookie that was forced to stretch the floor.   And Roberson … never … won … a dpoy. He’s not better than Draymond green at all. At anything.   Reading names off a sheet 5 years later doesn’t make the improved players “underrated.”
"""I was literally seeing three rims out there, I just shot at none"" - Draymond Green"
"Draymond complaining about the lack of veteran players for Steph is about as dumb as his shot at the end of the 4th. Klay is hurt at $35 million, Steph at $43 million, Wiggins $30 million, and Green at $22 million, and Oubre at $14 million are already $12 million over the taxpayer cap and that’s without Wiseman and a bunch of low-paid guys.  Lacob may not care about the tax, but it’s the lack of roster flexibility being that far over the cap hinders the Dubs this offseason.   Okay Thompson returning alone isn’t going to make GS a contender next year. Cray summer for the Warriors because this is a flawed roster even when Klay gets back after missing almost two years."
"R/nba troglodytes hate grayson allen. Meanwhile draymond green, whose cock is routinely sucked by these same assclowns, is actually a dirty player who has injured multiple people on purpose and pokes people in the fucking eye"
Wiggins this year is better on every level than Oladipo on the Thunder. Not to mention Draymond Green who is probably as impactful a defender as Gobert.
Did he ever hurt somebody as bad as Draymond Green hurt people?
Draymond Green agrees
"This is the play that angered me the most. the Wiggins bricked three in overtime and Poole turnover, those are expected. But the final play of the damn season, they don't call a timeout and settle for a Draymond green floater?   What is the fucking gameplan here?"
"Obviously people are trying to capitalize on the loss and get a rise out of GS and Curry fans but ya'll gotta stop with the whole ""LeBron has never had a team this bad"" thing. His 07 team is historically bad and he took them to the finals. Would you rather have a 32 yr old Big Z and Larry Hughes or Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins?"
Lol I couldn’t help myself. I had to respond to the guy below him. Man said draymond green is « probably » the second best player on the floor. What kind of drugs do you have to be on.
Damn how did I not see this 5 hours ago. You really said draymond green is the second best player on the floor? Awful take.
Draymond Green offense is offensive
"Look at their accolades and tell me they are better than Draymond Green.  Also, it’s clear you didn’t watch the NBA because Capela was not that good back then."
"I wonder what Draymond Green is thinking?  ""Maybe I shouldn't have pissed off KD""  Will he come back even after me calling him a bit@h?  Oh well, time to go fishing."
7 turnovers and they were all TERRIBLE.   Him and Draymond Green have no fucking exuses for turning it over that much

Please get Draymond Green off my TV screen
As if they did it because Draymond Green said so. FFS. PHX was slated to have a great season last year before Ayton got hurt. They won 8 straight to finish the season off. Draymond Green was an idiot for saying it then and he's an idiot for saying this now.
"Harden also got scoring titles while being doubled for a whole season (2018-19) even when Capela/CP3/Gordon got back from injury. Also, Curry is not near the playmaker Harden is. Currys gravity allows Draymond Green to make assists. Harden cuts out the middle man and makes the assist himself at a high clip."
Thats the problem. Its always about if youre getting the ball back. Do you think curry always gets the ball back? Or when Jokic sets the screen does he always get the ball back?  Its about making it easier for your teammates. One cut from dame and CJ might actually get a clean shot off.   And defense isnt always about if your opponent shoots worse when you contest. If thats it then draymond green does not deserve a dpoy. Austin rivers and facu averaged 5 and 6 assist per game respectively. Is that because facu and rivers a better passer than jokic or is because the guys defending them are not good at team defense.
"Draymond ""executive of the year"" Green"

Draymond green invented all covid vaccines
But I'm sure the Suns are hoping to get past the Nuggets and eventually into the Finals. He just got 4 techs in 6 games. To win it all the Suns could be playing 15-20 more games. It's pretty easy to pick up a random T here and there. I know you guys are celebrating him talking shit now but that could come back to bite you in the ass later on. Just ask Draymond Green.
"Obviously he's not the defender that Draymond is, but he's still a huge upgrade for Portland defensively.  Gordon is not as good a passer as Green, but he is a good passer, and much better overall offensive player.  He would really unlock a lot for Portland on both sides of the ball."
"Eh him teabagging Draymond Green in the 2016 Finals was definitely going after a guy who he knew would give it back lol, that’s why he did it."
"I’ll say this. If Draymond Green or any other fiery player that would get in LeBron’s face after seeing him quit multiple times to complain to the refs instead of getting back on D, the lakers win this game. Despite the Suns and Book especially playing a great game.   Forget all of Draymond’s defensive prowess and offensive playmaking abilities, his fiery nature would’ve never allowed that BS to slide. KCP and Schroeder tried turning it on in the 2nd half, but never went at the supposed best player in the league to get him going."
"&gt; You never destroyed shit.  Destroyed three HOFers.  &gt; Toronto beat a banged up team and the Lakers ring is just as valid.  One guy was out. Lakers faced two All Stars for four games, with no fans, no games on the road after three month break.  &gt; You want to pretend the Warriors team was the same team that won the chip but it wasn’t.  Hmmm it pretty much was. The starting lineup for the 2015 finals which the Warriors won consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut. For the 2019 finals which the Warriors LOST consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins who is an upgrade over Bogut. 4/5 are the same and one is an upgrade lmao.  &gt;  I’ve repeated my argument over and over because you’ve never destroyed it.  I destroyed it before it ever began. Sorry to say."
Lebron said he didn’t realize anything happened until he watched it again in the locker room but yea [it was definitely not the Cavs who lobbied for a 2 game suspension...](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19581798/zach-lowe-golden-state-warriors-forgiving-draymond-green-2017-nba-finals)
"Klay played in like 19 of the 24 quarters of that series, the whole GSW was so banged up narrative is so overblown   Obviously they didn’t have Durant which obviously hurt them, but they still had Steph, Dray and Klay for a vast majority of that series   Maybe if you need Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Boogie all fully healthy to win a title then just maybe the other team is good and deserves credit too?  And it’s not like the Raptors were all 100% either. Kawhi could barely walk during the ECF, Lowry had to have surgery after the playoffs, Siakam was nursing an injury throughout the playoffs and they were missing their second best defender all playoffs long"
"""You're still a bitch."" - Draymond Green"
Draymond green does this to lebron. No flagrant.   But now a flagrant?! Lmao. 5v8
"Where did he say that in this interview? Full text below.     `The Warriors have gone up against some of the league's best players and teams since the emergence of their home-grown trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.`    `Green is one of -- if not the best -- defenders in the league, and has been tasked with guarding some elite offensive talent throughout his nine-year NBA career.`    `The Warriors forward sat down for a Bleacher Report ""AMA"" on Wednesday where he answered questions from fans around the league.`      `One person asked: ""The hardest player you have guarded in your NBA career is ___""`   `""Kevin Durant,"" Green responded. ""Nobody is impossible to guard, but he is as close to impossible as it gets.""`     `Once former teammates, Durant and Green have plenty of history playing with, and against each other.Was Draymond sending Warriors message while analyzing Wiz`   `Now on separate teams following Durant's departure from Golden State, Green -- as a guest analyst on TNT's ""Inside the NBA"" -- recently predicted Durant's Brooklyn Nets as the team to win the NBA Finals.`   `In addition to Durant, Green named another player that he has had a tough time with throughout his career.`   `""And Manu Ginobili,"" Green added. ""He used to move downhill, but moving sideways. The moment you see him moving to the left -- euro step.""`   `His response was interesting because both Durant and Ginobili are two very different players.`    `There aren't many players who have success against Green, who is once again a nominee for the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award. The ones that do though, are future Hall of Famers.` "
LeBron in the post should try to be more Karl Malone and less Draymond Green
Draymond green called this exactly. Blazers ran out of steam
I wish Lillard had a Draymond Green to play with.
You guarded him? Or are you saying DPOY and defensive specialist Draymond green is wrong for saying so? At the end of the day its his opinion
"You talk about potential as if most of these guys aren't already better than Tatum. Tatum's slight uptick in passing efficiency hasn't even gotten him close to any of the guys I've mentioned in terms of passing/playmaking. In terms of scoring Tatum is great and up there with the guys I mentioned, but he isn't going to become a better passer in the next 5 years than any of these guys are now unless CP3 possesses him. Doncic has plateaud statwise, but his game has shown improvement with the introduction of the midrange and post game making him an even more robust scorer come playoffs. Where has Tatum shown that type of growth in his playmaking? Tatum is about the same level as Paul George as a number 1 option right now in their careers, but PG has shown a higher peak being an MVP candidate in OKC.   Clearly you rate Tatum very high, but you're comparing him with players of similar age who are already Top 15 or even Top 5 in case of Jokic and Giannis. He would have to show something that he has never done to even become better than Luka is now by learning how to pass/playmake at an elite level. Idk how you can say other young guards in the league outside of Luka have shown the same ceiling as Young when he is already putting up monstrous scoring and assist stats whilst being the sole focus of the defence. I'm not gonna bother arguing with you if you think Tatum has the potential to become a top 10 passer in the league or that he has the potential defensive impact of a Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green. Because those are the only ways he even comes close Jokic, Giannis, Luka or leapfrogs Young and Zion in terms of potential value. He's a great player and a perennial all-star/all-nba, but he isn't a future MVP candidate unless he does something he hasn't even shown glimpses of."
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"I don't think [Myers](https://theathletic.com/2610671/2021/05/24/bob-myers-on-the-warriors-offseason-veteran-help-needed-no-plan-to-trade-james-wiseman/) would disagree.  &gt; But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up. &gt;  &gt; “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist.

"Draymond ""Bill Russell"" Green"
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That’s a fucking amazing team."
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That’s a fucking amazing team."
"He's that do everything guy that Championship teams are built off the backs of. Dennis Rodman is a good example, guys like Shawn Marion, Draymond Green. The guys that can do a little of everything"
ESPN El Ocho with Draymond Green
You’re right. He finished 7th that year so a little higher than I remembered. Point still stands that calling draymond green an elite role player when he finished 7th in MVP voting is super dumb.
"Kevin Looney did not decide any factor of an NBA championship.   Barring KD's injury which goes back to the 2nd round of the playoffs. The Warriors still had 3 all-stars(4 if you want to count Cousins). The Raptors already beat the Warriors twice with Klay Thompson and it was a tight game when he got hurt in game 6. So, who's to say they would have automatically lost?   The Warriors won a title when Kyrie missed the series. The Cavs won a title when Draymond Green was suspended. Magic Johnson missed the 89 finals. Yet, somehow the Raptors who still played a very competitive team that won a title with that core 4 years prior should be vilified."
"I think he's one of those players that's great on only one team and would be pretty bad to at least mediocre on other teams. He's in that Alex Caruso, Lance Stephenson, Draymond Green specialist."
"They need a Boris Diaw / Draymond Green type of player who can make the offense flow better with their passing game, as well as make smart defensive plays."
I still hate him. I don’t know why.   And I love Draymond Green so much.   Life is weeeeiiiirrrrrd.
Isn’t it obvious? Draymond Green hurt me when he said Devin Booker needed to get out of Phoenix.
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
Draymond Green if Steph is on the court.
"I counter by saying he's going against Lue moreso than Kawhi &amp; PG. I watched every second with my own two eyes. During the 3rd quarter, Lue ran the exact same defense and Kawhi or PG hardly ever played him straight up or on the switch. I saw more Rondo,Mann &amp; Zubac than anything. I would trust a team coached by Draymond Green or Mike Malone over anything Lue is scheming."
"Kenny ""The Jet"" Smith has a 'running gag' where he races the other NBA commentators to the board when there are highlights to display.  While Kenny had wheels back in the day, he's now 56 on bum knees.  But since he usually is competing against Charles Barkley, Shaq (both big men with lots of persisting physical issues from their playing days that slow them down) and Ernie Johnson (who is 64 and was never a pro athlete) so the races are pretty funny but since these are all competitive guys, they do try to earn bragging rights.  However, on this day Draymond Green, a current NBA player was subbing in for Charles Barkley.  Kenny knew this, so he tried to catch Green off-guard so he could beat him to the board.  Draymond was not only able to react quickly, but he's so much faster that he just blew past Kenny in that short run."
"What do you consider a legitimate #2? Draymond Green? Michael Porter jr.?  So if he had either of those guys, he’d be better than Steph and Jokic?"
Draymond Green has the best MicroPenis in the NBA.
"Little off topic but I swear if you would show Jr smith highlights to a casual fan they would think he is top 10 all time. To answer your question I would say defensive/Playmaking players. Ben Simmons, Draymond Green for example"
Draymond Green is a great litmus test guy.
You can get Draymond green for Gallo and a 2nd round unprotected lol
*Draymond Green enters the chat*
6'11 Draymond Green
Ben potential gives me more athletic draymond green vibes. Not star point guard vibes.
"Elite third option player (on a championship team). Draymond green type of guy. Your team needs to have good shooters though, i think he would be great on the mavs."
"In their primes, a lineup of Monte-Danny-Marcus-MPJ-Draymond with Markieff, Jeff Green, Gerald, and KPJ would be pretty fun.    Solid mix of defense, toughness, scoring, shooting, and switchable wings. Best bench in the league too."
"Draymond green, oubre and Wiggins"
"I wouldn't use this to hate on Steph, he's an all-time great player and the GOAT shooter regardless imo.  *But* I would use this to defend guys like Dame who are criticized for not moving off-ball like Steph. It is easier to rely on off-ball movement when you play with an elite playmaker like Draymond Green, something a guy like Damian Lillard has never benefited from."
"it's so weird how many people just key in on off-ball movement when comparing steph to other players and ignore all other context  do you not realize that other teams (a) don't ask of their star guard to move off-ball like steph? it's not a matter of choice, that's not the system. in large part due to the fact that (b) they don't have a playmaker like draymond green to actually get him the ball when he's moving off-ball."
"They should pick up draymond green, iguodala, and klay thompson"
'Get my boy Kuz out of L.A.'  -Draymond Green
He is a more athletic Draymond Green which both Ben Simmons' supporters and detractors don't realize.
Draymond Green is their best defender tho
"nope, in 2016 he lobbied to get Draymond Green banned, which surpsrisingly resulted in an ""epic comeback"" by cry baby bron and his squad of douchebags and outright dirty &amp; dangerous players.  It is honestly a shame that a man of that much talent (basketball wise, in any other aspect he is as mature and intelligent as a 15 year old kid) somehow feels the need to flop and complain more and worse than any other player of his era. He is a great basketball player, but also the least likeable player for his entire career and probably the worst role model young players could possibly have."
"&gt;He was a Chris Paul hammy away and an unbelievable 27 straight threes missed from advancing to the Finals and most likely winning that year.  I don't get why this is used to boost his legacy. Are we excusing him and his team bricking 27 3's when it mattered most? Are we justifying the loss as a result of CP3's injury? Because if that's the case, then nearly the entirety of NBA history is changed. The guy you mentioned earlier, Steph, was an injury away from winning the 2016 finals. He was a Draymond Green ejection away. &gt;!A properly officiated G6 away. !&lt;   It's too much to expect the NBA community to think in that way."
"CP3/Green/Harris/Giannis/Vucevic probably could win a title   You might say ""oh man thats so stacked though""  But is it really compared to Curry/Klay/Iggy/Barnes/Draymond?   Or is Seth/Green/RoCo/Giannis/Joel crazy compared to Rondo/Green/LBJ/AD/Dwight?"
"&gt;  CJ is younger and compliments Bam much better + cheaper + alleviates the hurt of losing Robinson in free agency and would allow for the Heat to reset in order to retool for a run around Bam in a few years  And Jimmy compliments our whole team better. Jimmy plays a Draymond Green type role when Herro and DRob can actually shoot. As much as we need another PG, he runs a lot of our offense and hunts for off ball shooters a lot."
"Imagine D Wade, Lebron, Paul Pierce, and Draymond Green all in one room on tnt"
"If you think Danny green was close to the player that draymond was, or that playoff teams would value Danny green higher than you don’t understand either of their values."
"Bruh dray was miles better of a player than Danny green. He was arguably the 2nd most important player of some of those warriors teams and is an all time defender. Danny green is a journeyman for a reason, he can be a 4th/fifth starter on a good team and not get in the way, but you gotta be a way better player to be a hall of famer. Draymond was on 2 all nba teams, and was an all star 3 times. Danny green has never even been in the general all star conversation."
you know that's disingenuous cause danny green is awesome and kuzma is not  danny green is a helluva lot closer to draymond than kuzma is to jokic
"I would be genuinely entertained to see Ernie have a 3-point shootout against Draymond Green. Just to see Draymond's reaction when he finds out, then see him have to shoot with Chuck, Kenny and r/NBA and NBA Twitter watching every move, would be worth it."
"I don't think you realise how good of a defender Simmons is... Plus he's a generational talent when you combine his athleticism, lateral quickness and passing. The same way 9 ppg draymond Green wouldve never been considered for a cj averaging 23 ppg, Simmons will also be nowhere near considered. He was only ever considered for harden lol"
It just seems so much harder than winning 4 championships with the same team  If draymond has a chance to get in then danny green should at least be considered based on his contributions toward championships and overall very good defense
Thats completely irrelevant to the conversation. Ben Simmons and Draymond Green can not shoot for shit. They are both terrible 3 point shooters. That's just facts.
Stephen Curry and Draymond Green
I agree 100%. They need a defensive mastermind like a Draymond Green type player.
"Dude is dunking it with his shoulders over the rim and doing tricks coming down, taking elaborate footwork 1v1s, they’re playing it over and over on sports networks, and the only person who will say LeBron is fine is Draymond Green lmao the narrative is real"
"Remember when Draymond Green said Devin Booker being in Phoenix is not good for him, and Jay Williams said that Booker should demand a trade to New York.  Can't just let this dude ball out and leave him alone smh."
Draymond green role
Ben Simmons’ time as a generational centerpiece has long passed. He’s at peak Draymond Green levels of role-playing superstar rn. If you want Ben to put us on his back you’re kind of missing the point of a player like him. It’s Tobias who has to step up.
"He is an important piece. Like Draymond Green, but on the offensive side."
Traded a 24 year old who was averaging 14/14 because people convinced themselves he couldn’t beat Draymond Green or soemtbing
Draymond “the jet” Green
"He played more than that, and most importantly he was their only decent big.  Yeach because having fucking Draymond green as your second best scorer not even MJ on steroids could do anything with it.  Kd literally lost to Curry with equal roster and run to join him, and after leaving Curry he had to join both Harden and Kyrie to have a chane, he is the farthest thing from a leader you could have.  Draymond playing well one game doesnt mean shit tho.  Lebron lost to a Sick German and got locked out by Barea and even with a stacked roster on his side was embarassed wtf you smoking bro."
Lawl Draymond Green is one of the Inside the NBA TNT analysts tonight
Same for Curry and Draymond green. Kawhi and Kyle Lowry.
Draymond Green. He's always complaining about something.
"The Warriors second option (Klay) is arguably the 2nd best shooter of all time who averages 22PPG on great efficiency with the ability to score 37 points in a single quarter. The Sixers options behind Embiid are Tobias Harris, Danny Green, and Seth Curry. Asking Draymond to be better than Klay is a lot different than asking Simmons to try to be as good as Harris, Danny Green, or Seth Curry."
"Yeah like normal athletic Draymond Green made a 2nd all nba team, make him a more athletic version of himself and he’d be a perennial all nba guy who’s probably more likely to compete for first team than he is to not make it at all."
Tyler Herro -- Kuzma of the East  Bam -- Draymond Green of the East  Butler -- Russ with better PR  Duncan Robinson -- Taller JJ Redick  What else ?
"Please for the love of everything holy, please do not let Draymond fucking Green become a regular on this show"
Watch the sixers offense crumble once simmons tries to drive and create contact (he’s  afraid to because he’s dogshit at FT’s)  The sixers will lose and morey will certainly trade him. He can’t shoot FT’s. He doesn’t protect the rim. He can’t shoot outside the paint at all. He’s just a worse Draymond green without the playmaking or ability to **anchor** the defense because embiid does.
"Ben Simmons is like a less intelligent more athletic Draymond Green (and being less intelligent than Draymond is not an insult, it's like saying somebody is a worse shooter than Damian Lillard)"
I think you meant this as an insult but a more athletic Draymond Green is a potential superstar
"Yeah but KG is the kinda asshole I would wanna hang out with and have on my side. Someone like Draymond Green. Kyrie… is not someone who I would want to hang out with, and seems to stir shit up everywhere he goes."
You can't play hack-a-Draymond. Green gets paid less. While Draymond isn't a good shooter anymore he's not literally a complete none shooter. You can't be serious lmao. Simmons just shot the worst FT% in a playoff series in HISTORY.
"Their players are so hard to guard on a catch. All of them triple threat but the ball never stays with them for more than a second. Then of course you have 2 all time greats on their team. Unless you have an Anthony Davis or Draymond Green type of defender in your team, your chances are slim."
He's a worse Draymond Green
He could be a suped up version of Draymond Green if he gave a shit.
Ben Simmons needs to accept he's Draymond green and not Russell Westbrook
"But that's the point. There's a fair bit of luck involved in the draft.  Look at the 2017 draft. How many of the guys in the top 10 have been worth their draft pick? Tatum and ... maybe that's it? Maybe Fox. Lonzo's probably earned a top 10 selection and but not a #2.   2018, 2/5 of the top five were clearly bad picks only 3 years later.   2016, Jaylen Brown - who was considered a reach by almost everyone at 3- is clearly the best pick of the top 10. At what draft position was the second-best player in the 2015 draft taken? 13?   You have to assume that you are going to miss on more of your top picks than you're going to hit on, because that's what EVERYBODY does.   It's true further down the draft. The Nuggets didn't know what they were getting with Jokic. The Warriors didn't know what they were getting at Draymond. In neither case if you asked the team, ""What's the best-case scenario for this guy?"" nobody in Denver would have said ""MVP"" and nobody at Golden State would have said, ""One of the best, most revolutionary defenders in the history of the league.""  Even Jerry West, who is regarded as one of the greatest draft basketball minds of all time, evidently was a huge advocate of Dion Waiters and wanted him to drop to the Warriors. (And speaking of 2012, the number of smart draft people who thought that MKG was going to be an all-world player was substantial. He went #2 over Damien Lillard, Bradley Beal, Kris Middleton, and Draymond Green among others).   If your strategy involve you hitting on multiple top draft picks, you have to understand that you have to get lucky and you have to expect to miss a bunch."
Shit I’d settle for better Draymond Green at this point
Draymond Green is better than Simmons
"&gt;Ben Simmons is just worse Draymond Green  Basically, yeah. But Dray is really good and in the right system a worse Draymond could be very valuable.   &gt;And Dray will be paid 30mil$ less than Ben in next three seasons.  &amp;#x200B;  Dray will be 34 after 3 seasons. Ben Simmons will be 27."
"Not sure why, but after reading this I felt like that was disrespectful to Draymond Green and his accolades lol"
Ben probably saw Draymond Green instead of Trae
Is Ben Simmons actually Draymond Green who can’t shoot?
How much do Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green get paid?
Ben Simmons is a discount Draymond Green
Warriors have a similar problem. Draymond green who wont shoot and nobody guards
Can Simmons work at the four? He needs to have a role like Draymond Green.
Overpaid Draymond Green
Poor Man's Draymond Green
absolutely insulting to draymond green
He's like a homeless Draymond Green.
Ben Simmons is a worse Draymond Green trying to be Lebron
Ben Simmons is just a kinder gentler Draymond Green
He's a worse version of Draymond Green but more expensive
Draymond Green would like a word
Simmons is finally embracing his Draymond green role.  Weird ass stat line 4pts/11 assists/7 rebounds.
"Yeah but Draymond Green never got exposed defensively. I think this a hot take but Klay, KD, and Curry are not winning anything without Draymond on the team."
"All flop team would be pretty nice. Young, Harden, Kawhi, (Draymond) Green, Embiid"
No way. Lebron literally called Steph the [MVP](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/lebron-james-believes-steph-curry-mvp-2020-21-nba-season) and has and has respect for[ Draymond](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2021/06/15/lebron-james-congratulates-ben-simmons-draymond-green-on-making-all-nba-defensive-first-team/) and other players
I mean the Sixers may still need to blow up this team with how Ben Simmons is playing on offense.   If they can cover the offense responsibility with Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry and force Ben to improve his FT I'm talking 100 FT a day during the off-season. Maybe they can make Ben Simmons into a Draymond green role.
"What about a graduated D2 collegiate basketball player 6'4"" that was a good shooter and still plays pickup to stay in shape? It's just shooting. And Kevin Hart is a regular person that beat Draymond Green in 3 point shoutout. Kind of like this question smart one."
"I hate having conversations with people who think they're brilliant. You really think you broke it down lol  I'm not embarrassed. I think everyone in here is kind of weak-minded and afraid and sees ""NBA"" and defaults to being in awe. I'm not a shooter and I'm not beating Ben Simmons at anything. Maybe tossing quarters in cup.     As far as Morrow goes. It was HS camp and my friend was an actual player. It's just a game of knockout. You act like because he's in the NBA he'll always win every knockout game 100% against pedestrians if he tries. 100% win rate is probably statistically impossible  It's knockout, the best shooter actually doesn't always win.   What about Draymond Green vs Kevin Hart.   No shit there's a reason we're not in the NBA. We aren't good or athletic. But shooting isn't the reason Ben Simmons is in the NBA either."
"My friend beat Anthony Morrow in knockout at his basketball camp. Kevin Hart got Draymond Green. Ben Simmons would wash a person in 1 v1 or destroy a pickup game, but he can't fucking shoot. Don't know how people don't get that. There are people on this sub that played up to college and maybe overseas. They might carry a better 3% in shootout. The logic and mentality in here is so weak."
"&gt;To add on, here are the same stats for the players who just missed the cut:  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG|TS%|TPG|\# of Game 7s played|Record in Game 7s| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Jamal Murray|24.3|4.3|4.5|0.5|0.0|52.02%|2.3|4|3-1| |Draymond Green|19.3|11.0|5.3|1.5|1.3|66.79%|3.0|4|2-2| |Blake Griffin|20.0|8.8|5.0|1.0|1.2|56.74%|3.0|5|3-2| |Terry Rozier|10.0|4.7|3.7|1.0|0.7|47.89%|0.7|3|2-1|  Why were these players removed from the list?   Is the sample size too small?"
"&gt; Who do you think would win, 2018 Cavs or 2021 Nets with their Game 7 team? No Kyrie, Harden playing injured on a Grade 2 hamstring sprain.   Could go either way, I'd lean towards Nets because Blake and Jeff Green are more likely to show up than any of the role players on the Cavs   &gt; Considering what LeBron did against the Warriors in Game 1 who had KD along with Steph, Draymond, and Klay, I lean towards the Cavs.   So you're making your choice off of one game where Bron had his best game ever and still lost despite KD having an off night (26 points on 8-22)? What if KD plays like he did on game 5 and LeBron has an off night, do the Cavs still beat the Nets?"
"Shaq would ragdoll DPOY centers. People saying that Draymond fucking Green would give him issues are ridiculous. If Shaq could make Big Ben look like a child, Draymond ain't doing shit."
"I mean there was nothing else HOU could do. Warriors were playing physical defense in the paint and HOU was getting 0 calls so they switched to perimeter shooting and their shots just didn’t fall. There’s no gameplan that can prepare James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Clint Capela to beat Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green... especially in a shootout"
"You're talking about the LeBron that was a year older than KD is right now? Had played through 3 rounds of the playoffs including 2 grueling 7-game series? Had carried an awful and dysfunctional Cavs team playing all 82 games, averaging almost 37 min a game? Who dropped 51 points in a game where only 2 of his teammates hit double digit points? Who was being guarded by in their primes Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant?  That Lebron James?"
Fun fact: Danny Green and Draymond Green faced off for a NCAA Championship in 2009. Danny Green (and UNC) won.
"I'm sorry, but Tucker is just barbecue chicken for KD. Yes, he makes him work, but he's gotten buckets against him every time. I would take an Iguadola, Draymond Green, Simmons, or Kawhi on KD any day."
European DPOYs specifically tho. U don’t see Draymond Green or Kawhi getting exposed like it
"Warriors say hi….SC30 + Klay + Draymond Green….yeah, I don’t think the Nets will be that much favored next year, especially when the Warriors will bring back Klay…"
because nobody cares if they leave Draymond Green wide open
Yea he probably would but why do I give a single fuck about the biases toward draymond green by nba officials when talking about embiid walking toward someone. If Collins wasn’t such a soft pussy maybe he would’ve stood his ground and not been bullied into his home crowd by the “giant baby” embiid
Watch Draymond Green and Ben Simmons (not offensively) play and you can see why people have issue with Gobert winning DPOY. Gobert stands under the rim with long arms up and people call it a defensive scheme. That shit is good enough for the regular season but not in the playoffs against high calibre teams. This is the 4th YEAR IN A ROW Rudy has been a negative defender in the playoffs yet people still act like he is the best in the NBA on that end. A big reason Giannis wasn't in real contention for MVP this year is because of his play in the playoffs the two years prior. Why don't we hold the 3 X DPOY to the same standard?
"Say you have Draymond Green. He rotates, the other guys rotate. He can defend Jackson in the mid range and at the 3. Is harder to beat off the dribble.  Say you have Giannis. He is fast enough to defend the other players reasonably and not get exploited.   Say you have RoCo or PJ Tucker. They rotate, defend the perimeter and the paint well.   Say you have Deandre Ayton, good foot work, quick enough to rotate and defend the midrange, and defend the perimeter some.   The Jazz's entire defensive scheme rotates around Gobert's strengths.  They want the offense to meet him at the rim. If he is not defending at the rim, he is not useful on offense or defense."
"If Draymond Green pushed an opponent into the stands with his body during an altercation, he’d be sent to maximum security prison. Embiid: double tech."
The dpoy should have went to Draymond Green as he literally guards 1-5
"I mean Mark Jackson managed to take Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala all the way to the conference semifinals. Then he got fired and the Warriors won the Finals the next year with basically zero roster changes. I can't imagine why nobody wants to hire him!"
"I am fully biased to say this, but playoff Draymond Green is better than Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons. Again fully biased, Green has the defensive abilities to control the entire floor. He is a great offensive floor general too. Can miss an easy floater but at least doesn’t get taken out for missing free throws. Kicks few nuts and pokes some eyes, but is capable of getting double-doubles or even triple doubles once in a while."
"Draymond Green is not the best defender in the NBA, just stop."
"Fucking Kids trying to discredit the GOAT. Jordan played in a time where guys would finish a game and go out and drink a case of beer. Those same guys would also play thru almost any injury and would punch you in the face in games and get away with it. The Pre LeBron era was a much tougher game. Sure guys now are in better physical shape but the game is soft now. Put LeBron in that era with the same mentality he has now and he wouldn’t survive. Players would find ways to force a soft player off their teams if they weren’t leaving their blood out on the court. Jordan didn’t play against plumbers and Mechanics but he played in an era where you had to be tough to play the game. None of today’s players would survive if they had the same mindset they currently do. Well maybe Draymond Green, Giannis and a couple others."
"Draymond Green has had a long and successful career being an elite passer and defensive presence without being a good scorer. Ben Simmons isn't realizing his potential, but he's far from a bum."
I was just baffled that people put him in the same tier as Anthony Davis and Draymond Green. You never ever need to worry about them hurting their teams defensively but people somehow put Gobert over them both. Gobert's a very good defender but I hope after this he never wins over either of those two (if healthy) again. ~~which unfortunately Davis wasn't this year~~
Draymond Green agrees.
You mean like Draymond Green being suspended and completely changing the series?
Draymond Green for DPOY
"He not a scorer. That’s not what he does. Basketball is so much more than scoring points. But if you can’t score and you’re getting obliterated on defense Rudy has to go to the bench. Draymond Green and others don’t score, but they can move on defense and recover to perimeter players after stopping the drive. Clippers were getting practice shots."
"I think that the Clippers are a perfect storm of personnel and shooting, to the point that most teams out there can't replicate their scheme or strategy.  During the regular season, Beverley was their worst 3 point shooter at 39.7% (on sufficient volume). That is, they had 8 players (and Mann) who shot super efficiently. Batum and Morris can both play small ball 5.   To my knowledge, they and the Nets the only team out there with that combination of efficiency at all positions without completely sacrificing defensive ability, and the Nets have fewer viable players (7 good shooters with KD and Jeff Green as bigs). The Bucks have inefficient or average shooting bigs, and even the Rockets a few years ago had Tucker be league average. For the Warriors, Draymond was above average from 3 for one season but worse otherwise. Last year's Lakers weren't this efficient across the board either."
"Its footwork, Kobe explained it how on a Draymond Green video."
Draymond Green. From his pic he was a solid 8 inches
he is just poor man's draymond green.
Draymond Green should have been the DPOY dont @ me.
Draymond Green was right . There's no situation that you don't want him over any other NBA player
"Draymond Green is one of the best defenders of all time, you simply cannot scheme him out of a game because he’s so damn good."
That was a quote from draymond green about dbook. He just changed the names.
Draymond Green is still the best defender in the league
Draymond Green!
#DRAYMOND GREEN
"The thing is right unless your name is Draymond Green (and even him could use more scoring, and it only works because he is pared with the best offensive threat in the NBA) not being able to score/shoot is considered a negative now. We are seeing it with Simmons too. You are just not playable in today’s game if you can’t shoot or score."
I think that's a very good way to put it. The Jazz got exposed for trying to use him like he's Draymond Green guarding any position
"Yes.  Here's a more eloquent way to explain it: [Remember those lofty early comparisons to Magic Johnson and LeBron James? Those have devolved into some projecting Simmons as a souped-up Draymond Green, the beating heart of a multiple-time champion in Golden State. Simmons resembles Green only in the sense that they both have to work around questionable perimeter games. And that's not a diss of Green, who is everywhere when it counts, organizing and screaming and playing as if he wants to take someone's head off, a stark contrast to Simmons stationary in the dunker's spot as if modeling for an undergraduate art class.](https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-76ers-ben-simmons-struggles-roster-changes-game-5-hawks-recap-free-throws-point-guard-analysis/)"
Draymond Green should have been DPOY
Draymond Green.
I do it because there is no scenario in hell where Sacre Bleu Zan Tabak should be winning defensive player of the year awards while Draymond Green is an active NBA player.
Conclusions:  - Utah's regular season defense is a total gimmick that gets exposed like clockwork in the playoffs - Rudy Gobert is their only good defensive player - Even he's a liability against small ball units - Draymond Green was 100% right about him - Quin Snyder is a terrible coach that gets a long leash because he's white and looks psychotic - Mitchell should ask for a trade sooner than later  I had the Clips in 5 and only gave a Jazz a shot if Kawhi got hurt. He did and they still fucking suck.
"They are a good team, but this series exposed that they do not have a good small ball line-up, specifically for defense. They more depth off the bench and should make 1 or 2 roster adjustments (but preferably both).  1. A big man off the bench that can rebound on defense and space the floor on offense, while still offering some decent rim protection. A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player. (Though preferably someone younger if they can.) This player would swap in for Gobert when teams play small, because Gobert has no post game on offense which makes him a liability in these small ball matchups. 2. A wing player who can guard the perimeter and also play the 5 against a small ball lineup. A Draymond Green or Robert Covington type of player. Someone who can close out to the 3 point line, but also hustle and get rebounds."
Draymond Green is definitely the best defender in the league when it comes to showing up in the playoffs. Dude is something else when the warriors are there
He’s been overrated for a while now. Not to mention he has the Draymond Green whine at every foul called against you and yell at refs to make the wrong call in your favor because of your popularity and cash value to the nba technique down.
Draymond green - he's more versatile and can shoot free throws
"The thing is most teams couldn't even do what the clippers did. Center was their weakest position and Gobert's offensive game wasn't killing them. Thus, they were able to cut Zubac's minutes and just have 5 shooters. Not every team could or would do that (The suns wouldn't take out Ayton and the Lakers wouldn't just keep AD at the 3 pt line all game).      They just met their worst nightmare other than a healthy Nets team, unfortunately. I still think with a healthy Conley and Mitchell they probably win the series so I'm not sure blowing everything up is a good option. What they need is a small ball lineup they can trust and a slightly better defensive wing. Royce is great but he's undersized. Basically they need Draymond Green lol"
Draymond Green has had all time great playoff moments. Dominant dominant defensive moments. Rudy has been meh and Simmons has been genuinely terrible
"Draymond blow up your play green. Defensive IQ of him and his versatility is insane. When he said he is the goat defender, i thought he might be of our generation. Give him a good team and he will make that team great."
theres no defensive situation where I wouldn't want Draymond Green on the floor for.
"Draymond Green can defend all 5 positions, Gobert cannot. He's amazing at defending the paint and that would work well vs a dominant center who doesn't shoot threes. Problem is there isn't one anymore. He was cooked by the Warriors, Rockets and Clippers in the playoffs. Trade his ass for a Center who compliments Mitchell. If not just trade Mitchell so he can have a great career and not be stuck in a shit City."
#DRAYMOND GREEN. FULL BIAS
DRAYMOND GREEN. NOT BIASED
Draymond Green is the best defender in the league
Draymond Green 2016 finals game 7
3x DPOY disappears in the playoffs. This why Draymond Green is the real best defensive player. Dude elevates when the warriors are in the playoffs. Not go MIA
"But like, not even prime Draymond Green  Maybe 2021 Draymond Green"
He can at least find a way to be effective without a jumper. Draymond Green is a great example of a guy who can support and run the offense with his passing and provide a ton of value with his defense. Simmons has proven he can be a top notch player on the defensive end and we know about his passing. Getting played off the floor because of his free throw shooting is unacceptable however. Getting that fixed is easier than getting a competent jumper anyway. It’s a fix that’s more achievable by next season than getting a serviceable jumper.
You’re really comparing a 25 year old on a max contract to a 31 year old Draymond Green?  That’s a problem. Lol
"At his best, he was still being compared to a poor man's Draymond Green"
"Never. Early on the comparisons were at times with Magic (before Magic could shoot), but that's since become a joke. Instead he's a poor man's younger Draymond Green."
Ben Simmons is a discount Draymond Green
"&gt; I think there was a time where the hope was in Portland that Dame/CJ could see the success the Splash Bros.  So instead of trading CJ, it’s almost like they need to add a Draymond Green type or KD…"
Use him like Draymond Green imo.
Never go full Draymond Green
Who would you rather have on your team Ben Simmons or Draymond Green with his right arm tied behind his back.
My god Simmons is useless... he looks like a much worse version of Draymond Green
Boomer Draymond Green was not skilled enough to talk about anyone in the modern NBA.
Jimmy was the last pick in the 1st round.  Draymond Green was in the 2nd round. Klay was late lotto pick. Curry was mid-lotto.
"When the Warriors are on defense, watch Draymond Green and just keep the ball in your peripheral vision. He's incredible, and watching him helps you see the offensive play and how the defense counters it."
"Assists have also been overvalued by fans, someone like Trae Young creating something does not equal to say Draymond Green passing to Curry who hits a 30 footer   There are different types of assists"
Curry demands attention because of his 3pt shooting. Draymond green and iggy were the cogs in that offense that made it work with their passing and iq. Tatum and brown Aren’t huge off ball threats so there just isn’t that same ability to generate cuts and open shots that golden states offense could.
"Talent aside, I don't even see the comparisons. Trae runs the offense. Draymond Green runs the Warriors offense and Steph plays mostly off-ball. Steph is the best long-range shooter of all time and Trae isn't even that good. He was 4-13 last night and 2-11 in the game 7 vs Philly. They're not the same type of player at all. While Steph is a scorer, he's a shooter first. Trae is a scorer first and more of a quarterback for the offense. That's not Steph's game. They should be comparing Trae to Luka."
"Bill Russell was Draymond Green in Giannis' body, with Michael Jordan's psycho killer mindset.   Dude was undefeated in winner take all games in his entire career for a reason (10-0 in Game 7's in the NBA)."
"I don't wanna trash talk, just talk about this:  Trading Simmons for CJ would be great for Portland, man! And maybe not so much for the 6ers...  Simmons can play a Draymond Green type role on the Blazers, taking advantage of his great defense and playmaking surrounding him with shooters, thus, giving him space to penetrate too.  Lineup: Lillard, Powell, Covington, Simmons and Collins.  The 76ers would get hid of a liability and add a great scoring option on CJ, helping out Embiid. They'll lose a lot of defense though, but its better than trying to win it all with a player that hurts then (Simmons).  Lineup: Curry, CJ, Thybulle, Tobias, Embiid.  Hm... maybe they could also make some moves to get a starting PF to put Thybulle on the bench."
Aged Draymond Green.
"Bruh we would never have won a title with mark jackson. You clearly didn’t pay attention if you think Kerr didn’t transform that team. His motion offense unlocked everyone on that roster, mark jackson had them running a pick and roll focused offense and Draymond green was our 8th man. He had to go"
"Simmons just needs to accept a Draymond Green role. Play the 5, be that rim runner, and play all NBA defense"
"&gt;Yeah, I think Simmons will only be unlocked once he's on a team where he can play that Draymond Green small ball center role while surrounded by shooters.  Except that's not his game at all, his biggest strength is locking down 1-4. Making him defend the 5 is a waste. He can be a small ball 5 against another team not playing a real center, or he can be a 4 with a true 5 with range, like Jokic, KAT or even Lopez. Either way you need a shooter in your other front court spot and someone who actually offers rim protection."
"Bird was still giving you 20/10/7 on 47/41/93, I’ll take him over a bunch of guys on that list. Magic retired in his prime, he was 2nd in MVP voting in 91. I mean if we are counting injuries, then 2020 summer Klay isn’t a factor at all and Bam was injured as well. You’re now asking Draymond green and AD to guard a rotation of Robinson, Ewing, Malone, and Barkley. Or injuries wouldn’t count, and you have Stockton who was still in his athletic peak while averaging 17/14. No one really counts Laettner, he wouldn’t see the court lol."
"Against smaller teams: Lillard / Booker / Beal / Durant / Draymond.  4 elite scorers and Green doing the dirty work with his passing, screens and defense.  Good night."
"Or Jrue holiday, Zach lavine, jerami grant, Kevin love, draymond green"
"Steph, Klay, Simmons, Draymond and Wiseman with Danny Green first off the bench. Simmons can swing to point guard or point forward. Draymond is already an offensive liability as far as scoring goes so Simmons can play his role while also actually playing point when Steph is on the bench. A closing line up of Steph, Klay, Simmons, Danny and Draymond has plenty of shooting and can defend anyone. Ben assisted on the most 3 pointers this season- telling me Steve Kerr is gonna pass that up…"
"You havent seen his relationship advice or the times he hit on ladies in public lol he be pulling plenty, shit the got em guy pulls and he looks worse than and gets paid less than draymond green"
"The last players that the Warriors picked was Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green just exclude the rest  I think they got this"
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men’s Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‘92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"Yep, having a guard get caught on the screen created a lot of 2 on ones that Jokic either had to play up on the guard and give CP3 a window to lob it to Ayton or play both which is susceptible to pull up 2 point jumpshots.  I don't think people realize that a big reason the 6ers, Bucks &amp; Lakers are as good as the are defending the PnR outside of having fantastic defensive bigs, is the size, length, effort and ability to recover by their perimeter guys.   * LeBron * Simmons * Jrue * Danny Green * Caruso * Thybulle * Middleton  These are very good, big active defenders that are able to recover back into action so the big isn't defending a 2-on-1. Could Embiid, Ayton, Turner, Draymond, or Bam prevent a couple jumpers or alley oops Jokic can't? Probably. Are they all susceptible to exactly what Chris Paul did, and has been doing for over a decade, against the Nuggets w/o good perimeter defenders? Also, probably. Just ask Gobert.  What makes Embiid, Ayton, Draymond, Turner or Bam so good defensively is positional excellence + the ability to recover and make defensive plays outside of their area. Jokic has positional excellence but is limited to ""inside his area""."
"Yeah, I think Simmons will only be unlocked once he's on a team where he can play that Draymond Green small ball center role while surrounded by shooters. He's stuck where he's at because that will never happen next to Embiid, but it would be the exact same thing playing next to AD. Simmons on the Lakers would just be more of the same for him, with him relegated to the dunker's spot on offense. Unless he suddenly develops a good jump shot, the only way he's gonna provide close to his best value is as the team's sole big man on the floor.  If you're trying to get him to LA he'd be much more effective on the Clippers, because of this, but I don't think they have anything Philly wants (since I'm assuming Kawhi and PG aren't available). Maybe a trade for Terrance Mann along with Marcus Morris and Luke Kennard to match salaries? I dunno."
"Even Salt Lake City?  I remember that a few years ago the Warriors had a bunch of time there, and a bunch of the players were trying to figure out something to do (because there's not much compared to other places).  They ended up going to an escape room, lol:  https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/warriors-curry-mocks-nightlife-backlash-slc-insta-12536656.php  &gt;Steph Curry mocks last year's 'nightlife' backlash with funny Salt Lake City Instagram  &gt;Who says Salt Lake City doesn't have #nightlife?  &gt;A year after the Warriors' ""nightlife"" comments lit up Twitter, Stephen Curry made light of the pseudo-controversy with a tongue-in-cheek Instagram post on Monday night. In the photo, the team poses at an escape room in Salt Lake City. The caption: #nightlife.  &gt;In case you missed last year's weakest Warriors controversy, here's what went down: During the Western Conference playoffs, ESPN asked the Warriors if they preferred the nightlife in Los Angeles or Utah during their between-games downtime.  &gt;""No comparison. There's no such thing, man,"" then-Warriors forward Matt Barnes said. ""There's no nightlife in Utah.""  &gt;**""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is, like, dead**, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" added Andre Iguodala. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  &gt;Soon after the story broke, ""nightlife"" started trending on Twitter. The ""Visit Salt Lake"" tourism bureau even shared a two-minute video highlighting the city's attractions called, ""There's Nothing to Do in Salt Lake.""  &gt;Luckily, it looks like the Warriors found some of the elusive Salt Lake City nightlife this year. Omri Casspi, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee (and his fanny pack), Nick Young, Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell and Andre Iguodala all appear in the escape room snap with Curry. Missing are Klay Thompson (probably playing ""Call of Duty"") and Kevin Durant (perhaps the photographer).  &gt;According to its website, the Escape Key has four different rooms with mad scientist lab, Sherlock Holmes, Russian spy and CSI themes. In case you were worried they didn't make it out, McGee posted proof that they did.  &gt;""The champs made it out the escape room,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""TeamWork make the DreamWork!"""
"Draymond Green said a few days ago that he’s one of the toughest players to guard - “that kid is so fast. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.” Bradley Beal also says that he’s destined for greatness. I think he can be super elite on offence, but his defence needs improvement. This kid is only 21 years old!!!Give me a player that you can realistically see as his ceiling - I see glimpses of Beal or Kyrie in his game"
That gets 30m a year.  He makes 8m a year more than Draymond Green who is basically your best case scenario if he improves.  RoCo makes 13m a year and is less limited on offense.  Patrick Beverly and Marcus Smart are in the same neighborhood.  Without improvement on offense his contract is like a 15m a year overpay to going rate.a for 4 years.  Which is getting into attach a first round pick to get rid of range.
"As a Thunder fan, fuck Beverly. If I was an nba coach, anytime I started a playoff series playing against that bitches team, I would take the last guy off my bench on game 1, have him go into the game and kick Beverly in the damn nuts until he couldn’t stand anymore. Only way the bitch is gonna learn his lesson  Editing to add, I would do the same to Draymond “continuously kicking Adam’s in the nuts” Green"
"Stares directly at Marcus Smart, Draymond Green, and Robert Covington"
Booker already has a couple flagrant points and technicals in these playoffs. If the Suns plan on winning it all the last thing they need is him to risk getting any more of either. Just ask Draymond Green how that shit can come back and bite you in the ass in the last few games of the Finals.
"&gt; multiple of those calls were weak as fuck too  They really weren't. He got two other double technicals (one where he and KCP both got T'd up for jawing at each other, and one where he and Aaron Gordon both got T'd up), but the other two were totally on him. [One was for being pissed that the Lakers were gonna win Game 3](https://youtu.be/yjVfRkoqOqU?t=241) of the 1st round after Booker got ejected for shoving Schroder in the air, and the other was for taunting at the end of Game 6. At the time I told a bunch of Suns fans that was stupid because those can add up, but they all said ""totally worth it."" That shit can come back to bite you in the ass though. Just ask Draymond Green."
Draymond Green is going to make the HOF. Are you saying he's a centerpiece? Dude has been at best the third player on his team for every title run the Warriors have had.
people downvoting me when i said ayton is a beast. they said they'd rather take draymond green on the suns instead of ayton like are you fucking kidding me
"I'm a GSW/Draymond Green fan so I know I shouldn't talk, but it sure is nice to see PatBev's antics go ultimately unrewarded."
"Ah, nice that you’re acknowledging Draymond Green"
Draymond green breaths with his mouth all the time
"Yeah, much better than if they got Green or Kuminga though. My bet is they trade it to get help and make another run with Curry/Klay/Draymond and maybe Wiggins unless he's flipped with the pick and other assets for a star"

I dont think so.  He shot .584 from the line and in the later part of his career he had no range.  He would be more limited than Draymond Green who gets criticized for his offense.  At the least he would be subbed in and out in close games.
"&gt;	Curry anchored the defense? Ok  No that was Draymond green. In OKC it was Ibaka. Curry anchored the **offense** something Durant has never done either in OKC, GS or Brooklyn. Having trouble?"
"I wont deny there are ways to work on your mental fortuity  but again you don’t know whether or not hes done it. People respond to therapy/ treatment differently and some take much more time than others to get to where they need to be.   Plus even if he hasn’t it could simply be because he was always extremely confident and never really felt like he had mental issues that needed to be addressed. Maybe this series was the wake up call but to say that ben isn’t a hard worker or some shit because you don’t think he employs the correct training strategies doesn’t make sense. Because that isnt a question of will, its a question of him not undergoing a program thats right for him  Thats not the same as saying a player doesn’t put in the work, you could recommend better training strategies but unless you actually know for a fact that Ben isn’t a hard worker( which you dont, nobody does) you can’t really lean in either direction   You keep saying that he played poorly as if im disagreeing with you, im not. I do think Ben has skills that could help you win but he needs to be slotted in a role where he simply is responsible for the intangibles much like Draymond Green. Thats what he did when Jimmy was there and thats a role he excelled at  If someone wants to pay him like he’s kobe thats not Bens fault, if someone came and offered me kobe bryant money to play in the nba id say yes too. You expect players to say no to a pay day? Blame Philly if you wanna blame someone"
They’re aren’t going to build around a worse draymond green. Thanks for listening to my ted talk
Obvious answer is probably some random role player who won a bunch of chips but my take is Draymond Green  He really benefitted from having some of the best shooters to ever play the game around him. It maximized his potential and talent and allowed him to always be his best
"At some point you have to know that the shooting just isn’t going to come bro. Send him to a team that surrounds him with shooters and see what happens. It’s apparent this guy isn’t a franchise pillar, probably an overqualified support player like a draymond green."
"How about MOVING SCREENS?   Guys like Nikola Jokic and Draymond Green NEVER set legal screen ever, because they know they won't get called for it, and it's a huge advantage on the defender."
Draymond Green to the Cavs confirmed.
"He changed his name back to Ron Artest?  Anyhow, it would be amusing if Philly traded both Fultz and Simmon and they both end up being superstars (I don't consider Ben a superstar, he's a taller Draymond Green atm)"
"Ben is a great player. Now it’s looking like his role and what he’s asked to do will change. Maybe he’ll step into that Draymond Green role on a different team who won’t ask him to score, only facilitate and defend"
Draymond Green II: Point Guard edition
"Middleton, KD, Bam Adebayo, Harden, DBook, Draymond Green, Beal, Dame, Jayson Tatum  And now Kevin Love"
"Draymond Green barely takes shots in 4th quarters, is he a mental midget?  I don’t buy the narrative you’re pushing, if you haven’t taken shots or have turned down shots then yes you are struggling with confidence. I don’t think that means you didn’t put in the work, it just means you’re overthinking the game and not in the flow of it. Its gonna happen especially to a guy with an extremely limited offensive game like Ben  Define working on mental game, like is that a practice drill, is that meditation?   Ok, Ben Simmons aint Kobe and thats Ok"
Both teams say no.  Any team with finals aspirations is not going to trade up a lot for Ben Simmons. You can't play him at the end of close games in the playoffs. You can't trust him in the final moments with the ball in his hands.   The Warriors also can't play him with Draymond. The idea is for Steph to get open looks and not doubled or tripled team. No one is defending Green or Simmons on the perimeter.   Warriors would be interested in Embiid though. Lol.
Yea. He is like more athletic draymond green.
"I could see Ben thriving in a Draymond Green role, play the 4 or small ball 5 instead of ball dominate guard. Allows him to play closer to the rim and use his 6-10 size while still being able to make plays in the passing game."
"""He could be like a supercharged Draymond Green"" - people just assume if you cant shoot then you can just be Draymond Green. Its so asinine - Ben Simmons is so far away from being Draymond Green. Not the first time KOC has compared shit players to Draymond."
"Honest question:  In 2017, why did they decide to make Ben a PG if he has a shooting problem?  He's 6'11"", why not make him a forward who passes like Draymond Green?"
Draymond Green looks like the deez nuts guy.
"Steph Curry,  Klay Thompson,  Kevin Durant,  Lebron James,  Draymond Green"
"I disagree on the rebuilding teams. Simmons is 24. If they can land him without giving up 1st rounders, its a no brainer.  Also i think simmons is done as a PG unless he lands on a team where 1 big and 2 wings can shoot leaving him and the other wing as 4th and 5th options to shoot.   He should be basically a draymond green."
"Ben could, he could play a draymond green type of role on offense to take some pressure off of luka and bring some defense"
yeah this is scandalous. no one's a supercharged draymond green
At least needs to be a point center in crunch time and the playoffs. Something similar to Draymond Green.
"But simmons WAS the 4th best Sixer all series ... Jo, Tobias, Seth were all better, and more involved, all series. Regardless of status.   If simmons was just average, or not completely incompetent at the line....or say he was Draymond green in this scenario.  Sixers likely still playing."
"Everyone put this on ice for 2 months. He’s a 24 year old player who was heavily involved in trade talk earlier in the season. Philly isn’t the best franchise - look at the real outcome of the process. They went through the process and then brought in butler and Harris. Then they let butler leave and Simmons was left in the dunkers spot with doc rivers as a coach. Now, I don’t think he’s ever going to be a MVP or 25 point scorer, but I think there’s a version of Simmons that makes sense. And no, it’s not the “draymond green” version, but someone who can be much more. Don’t give up on this kid yet, get him out of Philly, and we’ll see his real worth. Maybe I’ll eat my words, but I would bet bens closer to the hall of fame then China in 10 years."
"&gt; Simmons could be like a supercharged Draymond Green to Damian Lillard’s Steph Curry.  Simmons is a straight-up liability in the final minutes of any playoff game. He's not Draymond Green, who's at least a threat to shoot and make his free thorws. Simmons walks the ball up, drops it off to someone and then disappears for 18 seconds."
Like playing as a small ball 5. Playing the Draymond green role. He wants to play on ball.  It was literally reported today that them making Jimmy Butler the primary facilitator on offense pissed Ben off.
"Ben Simmons is a better playmaker the Green, better in transition by a long shot as well.   If draymond played in that series he’d have contributed nothing as well."
"He needs a team that has a bunch of good shooters and understands he's neither a point guard nor a Draymond Green style center.  In short, he needs to be a Slash&amp;D small forward. They're valuable - for the right team."
I'd still rather have Draymond Green on my team than Rudy Gobert. Downvote me if you want.
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
Simmons needs to just become a super draymond green
I know Draymond sucks at shooting but Simmons is not a supercharged version of Draymond Green. Green is a better defender and is a way better shooter. Simmons is in theory a better finisher at the rim (when he isn't afraid to even try) and a marginally better playmaker. Sort of hard to call a guy a supercharged version of someone who is better at basketball.
I dont think Dallas wants anything to do with Simmons. He has 0 interest in accepting a Draymond Green type role. He still sees himself as a lead ball handler and there is no shot he'd like playing next to Luka. Dude is too stubborn/selfish and doesn't have a good attitude at this stage of his career.
"All this talk about Ben not shooting while having high value makes his contract bad. Isn't this the same as Draymond. Green rarely shots but his value is still high. Can Ben just evolve to be Green? Is it an issue of coaching since the 6ers don't run motion offense.  Although Draymond wouldn't totally shy away from shooting, he'll do it once but learns that it was a bad move and shoots next time he gets the ball."
"Are we not going to look at how CJ underperformed in this year’s playoff as well? He’s historically disappeared when POR has needed him most. To me, they are both albatross contracts regardless. Offensive production from the guard position is legitimately the most overrated and saturated category of value in the entire NBA. Does Ben Simmons have holes in his game? Absolutely. The same can be said for CJ who’s a net negative defensively and adds very little outside of isolation scoring.  Ben melted down in the playoffs this season but let’s not pretend that with a change of scenery and a positional role more suited to his “unique” talents that he still can’t be a fantastic player. You as well as most the public underrate his defensive ability. He’s not a true 1-on-1 shut down defender like a prime-Kawhi or Lou Dort but what he does offer is positional versatility and the ability to seamlessly switch P&amp;R. There’s only two other players in the entire league that can do so effectively for long stretches of time and that’s Draymond Green and Anthony Davis."
Out of the league is a huge overreaction but Ben Simmons is somewhat useless in playoff basketball. His negatives outweigh his positives as a defender and playmaker. He is a max player who is worse than Draymond Green at literally everything.
Supercharged Draymond Green?  That's disrespectful as hell... Green isn't afraid to take a shot and he's an even better defender.  He also shoots 72% at the line.
It's not even a real decline. He just got exposed as being a terrible fit. This is how he's always been. Dude needs to be the Draymond Green for a team with a Curry and Klay. That's why Portland makes so much sense. Don't make Ben the initiator. He needs be the connector.
"He's still got a Draymond Green-like Ceiling, which is worth a near max deal, so he is still a valuable player. He just shouldn't be the lead Guard on a team with championship aspirations."
Ben Simmons can’t be anything close to supercharged Draymond green. Draymond is an elite defensive CENTER who can switch 1-5 and protect the rim with the best of them. Simmons isn’t even close to Draymond as a rim protector/center on defense
Ben Simmons needs to realize he Draymond Green not Russell Westbrook  But Dray can shoot FT tho.
Teams are adapting to his Draymond Green potential instead of Lebron James potential. Still a good basketball player.
"I get the comparison you're making but it's wrong to say he's like a younger Draymond Green. A big thing with Draymond Green is he is physically quite limited but he's making the most of everything he has while Ben Simmon is physically gifted.  But yes I think going forward Simmons is better off in a forward role, and playing alongside at least one lead guard who has a complete skillset. Look at how even a guy like Reggie Jackson was over to take over a game for the Clippers, and Dennis Schroeder last year - it's much easier to find above-average shotmaking and creating ability in guards than it is in forwards."
"Ben Simmons lack of a jumper is a big weakness, but his biggest is his mindset. Draymond Green, love him or hate him is a dog and a winner. Ben Simmons is more gifted physically, but one of the mentally weakest players I’ve seen. I’d rather have Draymond on my team right now than Ben Simmons."
Supercharged Draymond Green is huge insult to Draymond Green.  At least Green isn't a coward to put up shots.  They're not always good but he isn't scared.  A bad shot can at least go in instead of not putting up one at all.
This is the worst comparison I’ve read in ages. Unless there’s a Draymond Green lamppost company I’m unaware of
I mean atleast be a Draymond Green and shoot 30% with those backpack 3's.
"Honestly, though, if any team in NBA history would have the shooters necessary to space the floor with Draymond and Simmons on it, it would be a team with a back-court of Curry and Klay.  But realistically, they drafted Wiseman.  It would be a huge waste not to play and develop Wiseman and I don't care about how good Curry and Klay are as shooters.  You aren't surviving with 3 non-shooters on the floor.  They could trade Draymond but I also think that's stupid.  If anyone in the NBA can fix Simmons's mental, it'd be Green.  And, regardless of how bad Green is on offense, he's still the heart of the team in many ways.  If they drafted LaMelo instead of Wiseman, then I'd say this trade is probably worth it."
"Well he could shoot, so more like today’s Draymond Green"
"I mean now that you mention it, if *anyone* could scare the shooting scaredy-cat outta Ben, it would be Draymond fucking Green."
I would take him on my team. He is obviously not some star offensive player. As fans we gotta just think of him as an elite role player instead of a star. I’d gladly let him try to be our Draymond Green for $15-20M
"Outside of Draymond Green, is it a bad idea to draft players that wear there emotions on their sleeve?"
"Yes, hope we get him.   He can play the draymond green role."
Draymond Green is already a supercharged Draymond Green
Saying Ben Simmons could be a supercharged Draymond Green is an insult to Draymond. Ben couldn't even be regular Draymond if he tried.
"""Simmons could be like a supercharged Draymond Green""  The disrespect - their mentalities could not be more different"
You know it’s bad when Draymond Green can give you more scoring than your All-Star PG on a max deal
"Iggy was never comfortable as the first option, but he was also never terrified of shooting. Simmons may have the skill set to be a prime Draymond Green, but he doesn't seem to have the attitude or the drive. I'm not really sure how you fix that."
Not at his price tag.   Defensive specialists not named Draymond Green are not worth massive long term max deals.   Hell even Draymond is a little overpaid relative to what he brings at this point in his career
He is literally the perfect Draymond Green for Lillard. But he will never succeed shooting 30% from the free throw line.
"I agree.  Btw in regards to the comment about going through every rep at game speed, Draymond Green said the exact same thing about him in an interview after KD left for the Nets. I think Draymond even said something like KD's the only guy he's seen that is going 100% every rep."
"Draymond Green is definitely out. Nobody that has snapchated a picture of their junk should  be in the running for ""on-air talent."""
"If he went to the Warriors, Curry probably ends up being CJ McCollum, Klay glorified Danny Green. Draymond a Ben Simmons who shoots"
Marcus Smart is the Draymond Green of the Celtics lockerroom. His leadership is indispensable. What he brings is beyond stats. The Boston Celtics will lose a lot of grit if he’s not part of the team.
"Dwight Howard lmao just kidding but on a serious note draymond green, personally hate him as a player but he knows his stuff"
"He can be their point guard/lead passer in the way Draymond Green is the GSW's lead passer. Curry is the dominant offense/ball-handler, while Green/Smart are tertiary ball handlers that set up off of Tatum/Curry's offense.  It can work, the team is so much better with Smart on the court."
"&gt; Why on earth would Steph be running around? Seems like you're the hater.  Steph is at his best when he's moving around off-ball.  Harden is at his best in the PnR.  Dray is at his best when he's in an advantageous situation to playmake out of.  All three of those things can work with each other.  Harden/Green PnR to create an advantage for Harden or Dray (let Harden make that decision) and then run action off-ball during that to get Steph open.  The result is basically either Harden gets a layup, draws a foul, gives it to Draymond who makes a decision from there, or finds an open shooter (ideally Steph)."
"I just want to say that the all time warriors probably have the best offense of all the all time teams.  4 all time shooters, Curry, Klay, Barry, KD with Wilt at center.  Completely unstoppable.  If KD is not allowed, Draymond is a downgrade, but that's still an unstoppable offense, Curry and Draymond run a pick and roll, either Curry gets a wide open shot, or passes to Green who has a clear path to the rim with young/prime Wilt as the lob threat.  They bench is almost as threatening, with run TMC + Nate Thurmond at center."
"I think JR Smith is the most famous just because of proximity to LeBron and he's also a memorable dude  If you count Draymond Green as a role player, it's definitely him though"
Draymond Green complains about it the other way all the time. How he’d be an even more impactful player if he could touch guys the way they could back then. So yeah I’d say so.
It's clearly going to be Draymond Green. They are already slowly bringing him in whenever he's able. He fits the role well too.
"One hundred percent.  On the Warriors, Wiggins has been a statistically better defender, averaging 2.7 defensive win shares to Siakam's 2. Two-Way Wiggs has been a lockdown defender against wings, guards, AND bigs. This season he was second to only Mike Conley in opponent FG%.  He's a better shooter, and he only missed *one* game this season - and that was a decision by coaching staff to rest the starters in a game that didn't matter, he *could* have played.  Siakam, meanwhile, has injury problems - who knows how his shooting will be at all after having a significant shoulder injury - and doesn't have the advantage (which Wiggins does) of having over a season to learn to play within the flow of Golden State's quite complex offensive system.  Wiggins is *excellent* at that.  The Warriors have Draymond Green and the Splash Brothers. What they need is reliable depth. Sacrificing a very reliable player who's been solid and consistent *plus more depth* for Pascal Siakam makes the Warriors worse."
"1. Cade - less athletic Grant Hill  2. Mobley - more defensive minded Chris Bosh   3. Green - 75% of Bradley Beal, better defender   4. Suggs - Tall, athletic Lowry with less ass   5. Kuminga - Very athletic Harrison Barnes   6. Barnes - Diet Draymond Green   7. Moody - TJ Warren with better defense   8. Keon - Shanon Brown with a better jumper  9. Sengun - Sabonis lite  10. Mitchell - offensively competent Kris Dunn   11. Bouknight - Nickiel Alexander-Walker   12. Kispert - Doug McDermott  13. Giddey - Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball"

Very draymond green like
Draymond Green
"Maybe a worthy mention, Draymond Green in 2019 when they swept the Trailblazers. Dude was a defensive beast that series. That 3v1 stop lmao"
I don’t want more from him but if Draymond Green could make a wide open layup ur argument would be shot  Steph had 37 and 39 in the 2 play in games
"Slight tangent but I feel sorry got that kid. Draymond green is his old head. Make him a batter defender? Sure. But if you want to avoid being pidgeon holed into the modern ‘just defend and rim run’ big, the LAST guy you wanna learn behind is Draymond. Draymond will teach him all the wrong stuff but bc he’s loud and demonstrative nobody will check him"
"If they want to be in the playoff hunt I think they need to get a solid vet that brings a winning mentality like CP3 did with the Suns. In a perfect world like a Pascal Siakam or Draymond Green, but    that probably won’t happen."
"Barnes and Siakam are def not similar coming into the league. Nobody really knows what Siakam can develop into or what his floor might be. If there’s a guy in this draft you wanna compare to Siakam as a raw prospect with high motor it’s JT Thor.  Scottie Barnes is not a raw prospect, he has a higher floor, is your modern 4 that can guard multiple position and actually has good handle to dribble drive and make plays for others with pretty good vision and high passing iq. There some Draymond Green and Giannis Antetokoumnpo to his game in that regard"
You must have missed 2016 Draymond Green
[Draymond Green](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/400900208) 4/11/10/10/5
"Rodman was as much a superstar as Draymond Green is a superstar, which is not at all. Fantastic role player and intangibles out the ass, though"
"That LiAngelo turned out to be the best of the ball brothers.  That Draymond Green would be the head coach of a LeBron James led team.  That Anthony Davis never missed another game due to injury.   That Marvin Bagley ended up being a better player than Luka, Trae and DeAndre Ayton."
"Lol rim running off screens is different, and even then, Draymond green was blowing that shit up making capella useless in 2019. He had a stomach infection which isn’t totally his fault but he wasn’t good. If you watched the 2019 series you’d know how bad Paul was"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"Im just saying compare Kobe’s worst series to Books worst (this series). And see. Also why act like TS% is the only thing worth noting, when Kobe was never that efficient either. Draymond Green TS% is 55 in playoffs. For the Lakers first round Drummond was 62%"
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
"Westbrook needs to completely change how he plays to win a ring. Needs to take a more limited role, no hero ball, only taking mid-rangers and 3s if the clock is about to expire. He can't be the guy with the most FGA on a championship winning team, probably not even second most FGA. Maybe third.   Idk I think his ego would get in the way of him playing more of a helper role than a starring role. But he needs to have more of a draymond green level role on a contending team."
Patrick Beverley looks like if Draymond Green started doing crystal meth.
"Anthony Mason is my favorite role player of and might just be my favorite player period. He was the heart and soul for those mid 90s Knicks teams, an actual tough guy who overcame so much in his career. He would be an incredible small ball center today, in a lot of ways he was the precursor to Draymond Green."
PatBev legitimately thinks he’s Draymond Green but in reality he’s just PatBev.
Draymond Green does this shit too. I guess I just don't understand how the rules work.
"used to be draymond green, but now this guy is my most hated player in the NBA. a true menace to society"
"It doesn't matter if he actually said anything lol Beverley was talking shit the whole series so why freak out when someone whispers ""loser"" or whatever in passing. Draymond Green is in the same boat except Green will be winning a series and gets himself suspended for a few games."
I see your rookie lottery picks and raise you rookie 2nd round picks:  Nikola Jokic  Manu Ginobili  Draymond Green  Marc Gasol  Gilbert Arenas
Draymond Green was suspended from a potential championship clinching game because he reacted when lebone baited him by stepping over him while while he was getting up and this fool out here pushing fools as hard as he can and the refs are like ‘cmon stop’
"Pat bev solidified hes a bigger bitch than draymond green. Didnt think it was possible, im impressed"
"CP3 is the easiest player to dislike, he comes across as a ""fake nice guy"" and in the game flops and plays dirty af. He's also a very easy player to like, because his game is just right in every way, incredibly skilled and efficient.  If Paul was only dirty people wouldn't dislike him so much, imo fans hate floppers (Harden, Trae, CP3) way more than they hate dirty players (Pat Bev or Draymond Green), it just so happens that CP3 is both things."
Draymond Green in shambles
"Oh, you mean Draymond. “Only looked good with 3 star players around him” Green"
Says the guy who has Draymond Green in his flair
"User ""removed by r/NBA mods"" tellysxpnightfall : Draymond ""carried to rings by KD and Curry"" Green: Get my man out of Phoenix. It's not good for him, it's not good for his career. I need my man to go somewhere he can play great basketball all the time, and win."
"Actual article title btw:               &gt; Draymond Green fined $50,000 for saying Devin Booker should leave Suns           From last august"
"I feel like Draymond Green is Klay Thompson, compared to Pat Beverly. Thats how low he is on the totem pole"
&gt;	KD is one of the best shooters in the league during a time when they DO shoot 3s. He’s shooting 30 foot pullups and step backs.  What were his numbers in OKC when he was asked to handle the ball? Oh right he shot **57 TS%**  in his tenure while managing to average a turnover per assist. Shameful anyone considers him close to bird.   Then once he joined a 73 win team he became “””better than bird”””” and was finally able to win where he was… HMMMMM…. **third** in terms of actually handling the ball and having playmaking duties. Some might say he was a good defensive player. Nope. That would be Draymond green anchoring the defense and protecting the rim.
Kevin Pelton's WARP metric had Draymond Green as the third best prospect in the 2012 draft. He was picked 35th.
Pass it to Steve Kerr the coach instead of giving it to Draymond Green for a Floater
I got Terry around the sixth too. We had mini awards too so I won another $20 for best trade (I traded Saddiq Bey and De'Andre Hunter (IL) for Draymond Green right before he had like 20 triple doubles) and $10 for best pick for Scary Terry
How has no one mentioned Draymond Green? Even his “comps” are nothing like him. His combination of defense and halfcourt offensive skills and limitations are one of a kind.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"A lot of it is fit too, Payne is able to ply his game and the team is willing play around his faults.   Draymond Green went from a bench player to all-nba with a coaching change that also brought Curry 2 MVPs."
"&gt; exceptional amount of injuries for the warriors including their top 3 players. Seems silly to pretend otherwise.  I actually think you might be pretending that. Which does seem silly, cause the injuries to KD and Klay were exceptional enough.   Breaking it down:   Klay played 188 mins that series, 3rd highest on the Warriors behind Steph and Draymond and around the same as Danny Green and FVV, he was injured with 2 mins remaining of the 3rd quarter of Game 6 - the game where the Raps won the title. He was cooking in the game he went out, and **could** have won the game for GSW in the 4th, but people now act like he missed the whole finals and wasn't playing in 4 of the previous games before the elimination game. That's one.   KD is the other obvious one, he only played 12 mins before the Achilles injury. That's two.   I'm curious which injured Warrior you think is better than Steph and Draymond? They led the series in minutes played, so if they were injured, I missed it.   The Raptors got lucky, for sure, I don't see how it's 'exceptional' though, that's just sports. KD and Klay played 200 total minutes in the 2019 finals, Kyrie and Kevin Love played 44 mins total in the 2015 finals vs GSW- was the Warriors 2015 exceptionally lucky too?"
Draymond Green is an average role player that got elevated by playing with some of the greatest shooters of all time. On any other team he’s nothing more than a rotation player
"The only thing that could change is if he were paired with a mega point guard like Steph, Lillard, Kyrie, or Young. If you sag off Simmons too much and he sets a good screen, you're now leaving one of those guys wide open for three. That's part of how Draymond Green is able to make it work despite his shooting limitations."
That much for a shittier Draymond Green? Who the fuck goes for that? How delusional can a FO be?
Peak Draymond Green or Current Ben Simmons is the real question
"i mean hey good for them, if they can get a team to buy into the delusion that hes really gonna change as a player this far into his career. i just can't imagine why someone would want to spend 35m for a guy who shoots horribly from the free throw line, doesnt even try taking 3's, the fact that embiid had to learned how to shoot to help fix the 6ers shooting woes is a damning statement in and of itself. he has his positives dont get me wrong, but his playmaking and defense are not going to win you games alone. you dont pay 30m for a guy who is really more of a tertiary offensive option. like draymond green makes 25m and he can do pretty much anything simmons can do but also isnt a liability. the 6ers made a mistake extending him off his potential, you had like 3 full seasons of seeing him like this before having to pay him and the gm still decided to max him.  so what do you do with a guy who is overpaid by 10-15m, is a liability in the playoffs, refuses to learn to shoot. the only way they get a deal like that is if they find a sucker out there. i mean, like who would you even trade to take on his contract, like the 6ers in a realistic world would probably be giving him and a pick for a bad contract and a role player (i.e, thunder, granted i think the only contract thatd match is kemba)."
Literally just described Draymond Green
We’re a Ray Allen 3 away from Danny Green being a FMVP.    We’re also a Kyrie 3 away from Draymond being a FMVP.
Scottie Barnes hes too limited on offense and drafting a Draymond green type of player without two of the greatest shooters ever wouldn't be a good move.
ask yourself this? would you rather have draymond green or ben simmons next season? and would you consider draymond green an elite role player or star?
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"THT, Kuzma, KCP + 2021 FRP \[#22 overall\] for Ben Simmons   I think this is a very reasonable trade after what we saw from Simmons in the 2021 playoffs.   Offensively he is terrible but as a defender he'd be MONEY and in the regular season he can help Lakers get a lot of wins and high seed which is important.   LeBron never has to guard the opposition best player, and Ben Simmons can be in the Draymond Green role for Lakers"
"Rasheed Wallace, Rodman, and Draymond Green might want to argue that one, lol."
"I hated CP3 until he came to Phoenix. Now I understand those players who you love on your team, but hate if they aren’t. Pat Bev is probably the most extreme example of that type of player. Draymond Green and CP3 are runners up."
"There seems to be a lot of Ben Simmons haters (and rightfully so after that playoff performance).    If I were a GM, I'd still be eager to trade for him. He's still extremely athletic, he's still 6'10, he just turned 25, and he has both a great handle and he's a gifted finisher near the hoop.   I think in the right role he could still be a top-15 to top-20 player as a cross between Draymond Green and Giannis.    You have to realize (and make him realize) he's shouldn't be a team's primary PG though - whatever team trades for him needs to attempt to turn him into their Giannis.  He might never score 30 ppg or whatever, but he could do all of the other things that Giannis does while scoring 18-20 ppg.  If you think about it, they have similar strengths and weaknesses (including having people scream in horror whenever they attempt a 3), and they're nearly the same size.  Simmons gets less rebounds and blocks, but I think a lot of that is where he's playing.  The 76ers mostly played him at PG.  If he's in more of a PF role, I feel he could replicate a lot more of what Giannis does for MIL."
"Congrats to the (now deleted) account that outlined the point-forward vision for him.  &gt; I'm just worried about using Draymond Green as a power forward in most situations, he's a huge defensive liability there.  These type of comments are so fun to look at (not to criticise the person who did the take).  It's such a pivotal draft in the history of the franchise. u/ME8 comment is the type of stuff anyone hopes to find when looking back at one's old comments."
"Wow I love this question!!!  Related-- of the thousands of undersized bigs that have been compared to Draymond Green in the last five years or so, who resembles him the most? Was he a good comp for literally anybody???"
There were several instances where he was compared to Draymond  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2636326-2016-nba-draft-prospects-breaking-down-pro-future-of-lsus-ben-simmons.amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2640620-best-comparisons-for-every-top-30-prospect-in-2016-nba-draft.amp.html  https://nbadraftroom.com/p/2016-nba-mock-draft/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/ben-simmons-best-nba-role-might-be-a-super-draymond-green/amp/
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
"OG Anunoby was compared to Jerami Grant, which was a fair comparable up until this past season with Grant popping off offensively  DSJ's comparison to Bledsoe was accurate, for all the wrong reasons lol.  Dearon Fox was compared to John Wall  Ben Simmons was compared to Draymond Green  Montrez Harrell was compared to Taj Gibson  Kelly Oubre was called a poor man's Paul George lol  Lavine was called a poor man's Westbrook, though they have similar playstyles, Lavine is a much better 3P shooter"
"CJ mccolum? Portland would trade CJ for Jrue in a second and they would instantly become a much better team. Do not try to tell me that Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Sabonis, or Vucevic are better players either."
Jrue Holiday has kneeled before Draymond Green….
man Draymond Green has GOTTA be one of the best defenders in the league. against all positions
I think Brook Lopez would have brought a lot more to Team USA than Draymond Green
"Draymond ""Ben ""Chris ""Rajon my favorite PG"" Rondo"" Paul"" Simmons"" Green."

Draymond “Ben Simmons” Green
He has Draymond Green. Can't even beat fucking Memphis lmao. Just look at the stats and don't tell me Aaron Mckie and Mutumbo is a game changer?
"Draymond Green was literally a bench player his first 2 years at Michigan State. He even came off the bench for a few games in his 3rd year. Barnes just finished his freshman year at Florida State. If you know anything about how Leonard Hamilton plays at Florida State, he plays like 10 deep, full-court press, so it doesn’t really matter if you start or not. Terrance Mann didn’t even start until his senior year there, and now he’s going to be a full-time starter next year in the NBA with Kawhi out."

Draymond 'better career 3p% than Allen Iverson' Green
"All depends on the matchup. If the opposing team doesn’t have a traditional big or there’s a matchup that can be exploited, he’ll slide to 5. But under Budenholzer he’s used the vast majority of the time as a 4 which allows Middleton to slide up to the 3 and it’s been very successful. He’s started at the 5 in less than 1% of his NBA games.  Similarly, Draymond Green is a successful PF who shot .270 beyond the arc on 2 attempts per game this past season. Not dissimilar from Mobley’s college average.  Time will tell. :)"
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"My 6’6” Line up can run with anybody PG - Zach LaVine, SG - Klay Thompson, SF - Jaylen Brown, PF - DeMar DeRozen, C - Draymond Green"
Kinda reminds of that video of draymond green reciting every pick before him. These dudes hold grudges.
"&gt; Making it further in the playoffs is not an accomplishment unless you win the conference and that's a fact  That's not true. Especially when you factor in expectations. The fact is Portland has made it further than Philly. Philly can be better on paper, but they haven't made it out of the second round. Why is that? Maybe installing 5 seasons of intentional losing impacted the players?  &gt;if you think Atlanta had a better season than Brooklyn because they made it to a father round in the playoffs.  I think everyone would agree Atlanta had a better season. Is Brooklyn the better team? Perhaps (most likely) but Atlanta without a doubt had a more successful season. How else would you determine it?  &gt;You want teams ro rely on luck like drafting Draymond in the 2nd round or Giannis 15th instead of having a proven plan that works.  Golden State has a proven track record of drafting well with Curry, Thompson, Barnes, etc. Sure there was some luck in how Green turned out, but again, they saw the talent and had the coaching/development to help him become the player he is.   &gt;of having a proven plan that works.  How many teams have tanked for multiple seasons and turned into a direct competitor as a result of that tank? Hint, it's not many. More teams turn into successful teams but retooling or a short rebuild, not a long term process."
"He’s the most well rounded non-shooting player outside of peak Westbrook and Draymond Green, with better defense than the former. If he can get his ft% up to 70%, he’s gonna be even more deadly. Just turned 25 this month. If he can improve his shot from even midrange let alone deep, Mvp candidate. Think his fit on Philly sucks. Fan base and egos get in the way. Needs a real vet mentor teammate to unlock his full potential. Dude gets a max indeed, but I think it’d be wise to set him up for success instead of throwing him to the sharks in a big market like LA/NY etc"
Draymond green
Draymond Green gets ejected in a game next season
Depend.  I would take the picks that translated into Draymond Green and Nikola Jokic over Anthony Bennett for sure.
"I went to MSU. I’ll just name a few.  Brynn Forbes(transfer from Cleveland state): championship w bucks  Denzel Valentine: chillin on the bulls roster I think lol  Gary Harris: solid player.  Draymond Green: I saw his penis once. Oh yeah, he’s won a championship or two or three  Miles Bridges: probably my favorite  Jaren Jackson jr: injured all the time but really good."
"Would be a great fit tbh, Lonzo could be a really good secondary playmaker in a draymond green type of role next to Lamelo"
Then you get into the Draymond Green Finals MVP timeline.
It's a fit issue with Draymond Green. Wiseman's path to success is to run spread PnR with Steph. The problem is that Draymond can't score at all any more. He basically has to play with Steph and has to be the one involved in the action. Otherwise his man is in the middle of the paint clogging everything as Draymond is a complete non threat to score. So that doesn't leave much opportunity for Wiseman to get reps playing with Steph with Draymond on the bench if they're trying to win games.

"Except that’s not gonna do anything of worth. Draymond Green is not guarded out there because nobody respects his shot. If Simmons made the miraculous improvement from what he is now to a Draymond level shooter, he’d have accomplished nothing."
"He can still move the ball and grab boards but the MF thinks he’s got the green light to shoot like he’s 2016 Curry, but he’s 2021 Draymond in reality lmao"
"'yall didnt watch basketball in my era, we had cats like draymond green putting fingers in your eyes, matter-o-fact i've seen chris paul shove a dude in midair. Giannis just had to be tough enough to ignore it."
Yup and honestly they put together a bad line up this year. Bam not ready for this draymond green play style is useless. And the bench isn’t very much that good. Tatum lilard and kd would have to go off every game in order for them to win
Count how many finals appearances  How may rings he made  Then include him in the conversation  Even Draymond Green doesnt consider you great if you dont have a ring
"Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut was the biggest front court in the league.  Then you had Durant, Draymond Green, bunch of centers like Javale/Zaza/Looney"
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can’t just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team.

Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"
"Im fine. Im neither a Dubs fan nor American so I'm absolutely peachy right now mate.  Are you okay? The French pretty much shoved a baguette up Team USA's ass last night (my time) and Im confident Draymond ""let me be in the rookies picture"" Green was a big part of that."
Attention seeking whore... cant even let the rookies have a moment in the spotlight without making it about himself  Draymond Green is the Lifetime President of the I'm My Own Biggest Fan Club
"I'm not entirely sure how that's relevant but I think I disagree.  I'd pick a lineup of Lillard-LaVine-Durant-Green-Adebayo to beat Curry-Doncic-Leonard-Antetokounmpo-Jokic faster than I would pick   De Colo-Fournier-Batum-Yabusele-Gobert to beat Lillard-LaVine-Durant-Green-Adebayo  I listed out Draymond because he was in the starting lineup and I get that he's not really All Star level, but this team USA squad is filled with All Star level or fringe guys. A team full of those guys should be able to beat top NBA players at least occasionally, maybe once out of every four or five games.   The France roster has one All Star level player, two NBA starters and a bit more fringe NBA talent. They have three guys (Fournier, Batum, Gobert) that I think could play in an NBA playoff rotation, the entire team USA roster is at least at that level. That team should not be beating team USA more than like 1 in 10 times."
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

"Because many people in this thread are saying the Warriors, I wanted to evaluate the pros and cons of the return on a Beal Warriors trade.  Pros of the trade:  Wiggins had the best season of his career, where he was an above-average defender and no longer an inefficient chucker on the court. Could it be a signal for further growth?  Wiggins' contract expires in 2 years. Should he perform well, Wiggins could be flipped to a playoff team OKC style next offseason for a decent return.  Wiseman is a young asset who was just the #2 pick in the draft. Even though his rookie season was terrible, there is quite a lot of room for growth, as he only played 3 college games and was injured during his rookie season.  The picks involved (7+ 14)  are in a stacked draft class. There is quite a lot of young talent that the Wizards could get their hands on.   Cons:   Wiggins success came next to Steph Curry and Draymond Green, and players of their caliber just won't be on the Wizards for the foreseeable future. Will he be able to replicate his production on a team where he is the focal point of the offense?   Wiseman was atrocious last year, and even though he has room for growth, the team will be overpaying for his 2nd overall pedigree. Is the upside for Wiseman worth risking how terrible he was last year?  Real life isn't 2K, where a team can trade their best players for prospects and expect no consequences other than having a high draft pick after 20 minutes of simulating. Attendance and fan engagement will surely be down if Wiseman and Wiggins flop. Will the owner be fine with taking a hit on the books for a couple of years, or is the expectation getting known commodities rather than prospects to compete for a play in spot?"
"He’s the one who tells them what to do and he’s the one that picked this garbage roster.   Jermari Grant, Zach LaVine, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant, Trae Young, Julius Randle, Russell Westbrook, and Zion Williamson??? Oh yeah, big brain time for sure."
"Steph curry, klay Thompson, draymond green, Kevin Durant, demarcus (boogie) cousins"
You mean they don’t want a total non-shooter and offensive liability next to Draymond Green?
"Draymond Green being on this squad but not Julius Randle is mind boggling. Green is just not olympic quality. The dude is a great role-player on a super-team in the NBA, but not in the olympics when there's so many better players. In fact, Green had the same PER as old Melo this year. Why not just take a better Point Forward in Randle, or Melo who has years of olympic experience and leadership?"
"We have 8 iso players, 9 if you count jrue, two centers, and draymond green."

They need a playmaker. When your best ball handler is Draymond Green you have serious issues. Trae can at least make sure it’s not iso ball all the time.

Draymond Green fined for maybe tampering
Do you actually watch basketball or do you watch box scores. the BEST PASSER on this team is DRAYMOND GREEN   there is literally no one on this team whose natural game is to create for others and thats solely because pop decided he wanted to coddle his buddy lloyd pierce and not take Trae young
"I mean we're winning but this should not be a single digit game. when your only natural playmaker is draymond green, you're gonna have a bad time"
"No. I think there'll always be something that can be improved.  A KD/Giannis hybrid would still be a bad perimeter defender. He wouldn't have the defensive flexibility of Draymond Green or Dennis Rodman. He would be an excellent shooter, but he couldn't shoot like Curry. He'd have handle, but not like AI or Kyrie. He'd be a good passer but not like Jokic, and certainly not like Magic or LeBron.   While I think players may get better, I ultimately think you can't have all of these because there's only 24 in a day. If you're going to shoot like Curry, you need to shoot all the time. But if you're a truly great, versatile defender, you're watching tape all the time. You can't do everything all the time."
He’s got that Draymond Green backpack form.
Give me Draymond Green and SGA   I was tempted by the Kings Fox and Haliburton.
Draymond has the same problems as Simmons in the playoffs but for some reason no one brings it up.  Dude isn’t respected in the slightest on offense and the other team hardly guards him.  Did we forget this [this](https://youtu.be/_VwLdjkZuAg) happened a few months ago?  At least Simmons is younger.  Green isn’t getting any better
&gt;do you blame steph for not winning in 2021?  Why the fuck would I blame Steph WHEN HE HAD A MUCH WORSE TEAM???  Oscar Robertson had All-Stars Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry. Curry had Wiggins and a Draymond Green who is clearly on the downward part of his career.  Steph elevated a much worse team.
"Don’t like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he’s more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga’s ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he’s a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn’t playmake like Scottie. I’d say he’s more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."

"Well, Warriors get better and Thunder get worse compared to keeping him. Harden is an MVP.  Klay is way better than Kevin Martin. I don't think it's enough for the Thunder to win in their injured years, and the Warriors could beat them by 2015.  Unless one of those picks was Draymond Green."
"Remember everyone, Draymond Green is a nice person now.  Maybe he attended dick kicker management courses or something."
"I don't think Draymond Green is a one dimensional player. Simmons is though. He's a defensive specialist. He can kind of handle the ball, though his skill at it is overblown. He can't score unless he's under the basket. Be has one thing he does REALLY well and a bunch of stuff he's only ok at."
Draymond Green in shambles
Nah have javale in the dunker spot and post up  draymond green.
Draymond green
"You're shipping a one dimensional player.  It's not 2018. We have a body of work to see who Simmons is. All that potential he flashed isn't actualized, and nothing he's shown should make anyone think he's ever going to be anything besides what he is, shitty Draymond Green.  It would be one thing if he was showing improvement shooting, but the dude has failed to even add a midrange game, let alone a 3 pt shot."
"They do have a win now center, his name is Draymond Green. No matter who they get Draymond will still be their best C and Looney is fine as a backup C. They need another wing to take the spot Bazemore/Oubre had"

Draymond Green should have been in the top 50 and Ben Simmons should be out. There is quite literally not one single thing that Simmons does better than Draymond.
"Motherfuckers are really gonna get Lillard and Turner this offseason, aren’t they?  How much help does Draymond Green need?!"
Siakam ain’t even a All Star in the west he ain’t no All NBA calibre player   He’s a overqualified role player like Draymond green with worse playmaking and defensive but better scoring
More importantly most teams running a small ball lineup don't have a Draymond Green
"Ben simmons is terrible, Draymond green is terrible. Smart isn't terrible he is streaky and inconsistent so he is slighty below average"
Curry - Beal - Klay - Siakam - Draymond....  Is there any way in god's green earth that they could do this?
"Great write-up but you left off Draymond Green and for that I cannot forgive you  His shooting splits wouldn't look great, but he put up 7 rebounds and 9 assists per game, was first team all-defense, and anchored a top-5 defense with not a lot of help."
I never moved the goal posts.   Draymond Green shoots.  Draymond Green is a better defender.  Draymond Green is about $10 million cheaper.
His lack of shooting - and what that does to team spacing - was evident even then.  You might want to look at what similar defensive specialist Draymond Green got paid by Golden State.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/draymond-green-10860/
"&gt;Draymond and Looney works. Draymond and Igoudala works. Ben Simmons is a lot better than Looney and Igoudala.  I don't disagree that Simmons will work on the Warriors, but I just have 2 comments  1. Looney is paid $5M to screen and pass the ball to Curry. I'm confident Simmons could do the same thing and more but he makes $30M+ 2. Pretty much any lineup with Curry and no Wiseman was a positive last year. I'm not really worried about Simmons minutes with Curry, they'll find a way to make it work but the spacing issues are a legit concern.  A major issue IMO is that any minutes without Curry and with just Simmons &amp; Green on the floor will probably be an offensive disaster since they'll trade their entire bench to get Simmons."
"&gt; He can really only defend one player at a time (certain exceptions apply)   I think this is an interesting point to bring up specifically in the context of Draymond Green. I mean, literally just a couple of days ago somebody posted a highlight of him guarding all five opposing players on the same possession. Draymond is the epitome of the exception you're talking about.   If you want to say, okay, yeah, only a few elite transformational players have that kind of impact on defense, I agree with you. But Draymond Green is one of them. That's why we should be able to talk about him as a top 10 PF of all time.   Most guys - most plus defenders - don't impact all aspects of a game like that. But Dray does."

"And how many games did Jordan miss due to injury? Or “load management”? Still lost in the first round  If you’re referring to the two Houston championships, Jordan was playing baseball up until about a month before the 95 playoffs AND STILL MADE THE SECOND ROUND!  And I’ll give Lebron credit that Cavs run was his best, but let’s be honest the Warriors lost that series more so than Cleveland won it.  If Draymond Green doesn’t get suspended, they more than likely win that series.   And like I said “with the exception of Rodman”, but are you seriously comparing an end of his career Ron. Harper and Steve Kerr to guys like Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, AD, Kyrie Irving?  And Harper and Kerr were brought in BEFORE Jordan returned.  And I say Lebron disappeared because he made it to the finals what 11-12 times?  AND ONLY WON 4 so that means he lost more than he won WITH MOSTLY SUPERTEAMS.  And if you bring up that first Cavs team he took to the finals that was in one of the weakest eastern conference in years.   And the fact that you can list 4 years Lebron didn’t show up in the finals proves my point because answer this, name a time Jordan got to the finals and didn’t deliver."
"You can find lineup data on NBA.com going back 12 years. Simmons is a good player, but he's no more a lead ballhandler than Draymond Green in my opinion."
"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"
Maybe because Siakam has actually accomplished things in the playoffs?  Including 32 pts on Draymond Green in the finals
Maybe I am talking myself into this but i don't think Ben works in Philly because they are asking him to be one of the main initiators on offense which he really isn't. He is kind of a Draymond Green type force multiplier and their isn't enough force outside Embid to multiply on that team. I think KAT and ANT are a much better fit with him.

3 years of picks is worth getting to 8th seed for 3 years and first round exists? How would ben simmons even push us there exactly? He's not a player to give the ball to and get a bucket when you need it. He's more like a SF draymond green and needs players who can actually score around him.
"Preferable to be a second round exit than trade for Wiggins or Murray and be a first round exit.  Like I always ask Warriors fans, if Wiggins is so good how did the Warriors miss the playoffs with a MVP level Curry and Draymond Green?  I’ve never gotten a good answer"
"The statline you just described was 2016 Draymond Green, so no."
Warriors we’re 26th in defense with Draymond Green
"You’re stating with confidence that a team with Draymond Green might be the “worst defensive team in the league”. Do you understand what type of drop off it would take to go from Top 10 to the worst?   I get using hyperbole for appeal. But Sacramento and Minnesota still exist. There may be a drop off, but it won’t be the worst in the league."
"I'll answer as a fan of the Thunder.  1. I'm guessing they tried to trade up and were unsuccessful. Who knows what offer they gave Cleveland that they refused. #6 and 3, 5, 7 FRP's?, we will never know. This draft had a very potent (hype-wise) top 4, and they proved unable to breach it. 2. Presti didn't have Sengun high on his board apparently. Rumor is he would've taken Tre Mann at 16, so the move was easy to make on his end. Also, Presti swings for the fences in the teens, and it hasn't worked out in the past. He could have taken Brandon Clarke over Bazely, Quickley over Poku, Oubre over Cam Payne, OG over Terrance Ferguson, etc. Each of those players are good roleplayers. 3. Sengun has looked great in two Summer League games. Summer. League. In 4 months he will be regularly targeted in PnR and switches. Then this sub can start making judgements. I liked him at 16, but I don't run the largest scouting team in the NBA. 4. His philosophy for a rebuild is literally here: [https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward) . The goal is a championship, not the playoffs, and the NBA is the hardest league in the world to do this in. Championships are won by a top 7 player either paired with another top 20 player or surrounded with top 50 players and high level role players. GSW surrounded Steph with one of the greatest shooters of all time (Klay), one of the highest IQ players of all time (Draymond), Iggy, Livingston, and eventually KD (broke the NBA, not applicable in reality). 5. This was the first draft of the Thunder rebuild with a goal of a championship, not the playoffs. His goal is multiple star players, so he is looking at 2+ years of drafting. If Giddey is that player, great. If he's not, try again. If Shai is unhappy eventually, he will get traded, probably to a destination in his top 3 landing spots. Then they will swing again for another star player through draft or trade. That's how it will go. 6. The draft picks are for trades. Sure, trade ups happen, but the easiest way to get an All-Star caliber player in the modern NBA is trading for an unhappy one. The price is 5-7 first round picks/swaps and good young players. That may be Shai, Giddey, or another pick that looks promising. One star is available every year or two and the Thunder will be interested in most of them I'm guessing. Whether the player wants to play here will be a question as well, I understand, but a lot of young players grew up loving the Westbrook/Durant or Westbrook/PG Thunder, so they won't get discounted as easily as Sacramento or other franchises like that. 7. Houston's young players look great. Let's say Green, Christopher, and Sengun pan out and the equivalent of Dame, CJ, and Nurkic (this is a ceiling outcome for Green and Christopher, and a moderate+ outcome for Sengun). Where does that get you? If your cap is clear and you have assets, you could build a nice team around them and if they stay healthy you have a shot at a conference finals. But this is a big bridge to cross and I would recommend pumping the brakes on an assumption like this after 2 Summer League games. 8. Saying a rebuild is done in one season...I think that's only true if you hit on a top 7 player. Even if it's done, it is hard to build around talented players like that. See Dallas, New Orleans and Cleveland before Lebron left the first time.  9. In conclusion, time will tell. The NBA is a luck game and I'll trust the guy that didn't get us a championship but brought a lot of success last decade for us. I will question his picks and decisions, but I'm just a guy reading subreddits and watching scout videos on YouTube."
Fair opinion. I think if you can't win playing with steph curry and Draymond Green you probably stink. But I also think Wiggins and Wiseman stink so could just be confirming.    Wiseman has bagley written all over him
"Wilt and Russell were both absolute athletic freaks that would dominate in any era.  Russell was a bigger, stronger, faster, and more explosive Draymond Green. You could drop him on any team in any year and he would be the best defender in the league by wide margin.  Wilt was a taller/faster/more agile Joel Embiid without the injury problems. There is no year in the history of the league where Wilt would not have been a top five player.   Look the wilt chamberlain archive on YouTube, he has a ton of great footage of guys from that era."
They’re more of a spiderman-pointing meme than being a “fit” lmao. Except Draymond Green steps it up in the playoffs while Simmons turns into a walking bruh moment  Warriors dumb af if they really entertaining this
Defence is never given its credit? Look at draymond green.   Yeah and he had grant then….   So tell me did he win before he got rodman or once he got rodman because the facts say he got rodman then won….
"Draymond went 35th. Green went 2nd.   More power to Green if that gets him going, but to me Cade was the consensus top pick and it just seems a bit forced to make something out of it."

"They were an up and coming team. Stephen Curry was on pace to be one of the greatest shooter in NBA history, but nobody saw him took that quantum leap he took when Steve Kerr took over as head coach. The Spurs were known at the time for playing ""the beautiful game"" when they dominated the Heat in the NBA Finals, and they were considered title favorites around this time, with Kawhi emerging into the team's best player.  Andre Igoudala was a huge pick-up for the Warriors, and Barnes, Draymond, and Klay all took huge steps forward especially when Steve Kerr decided to bring Draymond Green into the starting lineup."

"&gt;Really not. Dame is 31 and not winning shit in Portland. He’s too respectful to go public with a trade request.  True, Dame isn't winning in Portland... but that alone isn't enough to mean you can hand the Blazers weak assets for Dame with this much time left on his contract &amp; with Dame not sabotaging his trade value enough.  &gt;Ben is a better and younger version of Draymond Green  This is insane delusion. Holy shit. Not only is Draymond &gt; Ben for what the Warriors want, Draymond is a different type of player than Ben. Why do people keep insisting they're the same?  Just because Ben is technically a 4 who can play D &amp; pass that doesn't mean he's a younger Draymond. Draymond is much more of an off ball defender who can switch 2-5, guard P&amp;R, call out sets, use unmatched defensive IQ &amp; instincts and be a leader on a court.   Ben is more of an on-ball defender who can switch 1-4 but has defensive lapses at times due to lack of effort &amp; focus, can't space the floor at all and is more of a fastbreak passer who's shit in the halfcourt. Draymond runs offense in the halfcourt &amp; actually gives effort to get in the right place, move, set screens and sometimes hit 3s; Ben just stands in the dunker spot.  **Draymond is one of the best ceiling raisers in the league, Ben is the worst.**  &gt;and I’m sure Kerr salivates at the thought of fixing that sort of talent. He’s a good coach and has an ego. The Warriors are threading that line of trying to win now with Steph while also building for the future. Ben allows that.  Ben is un-coachable.  &gt;And Portland gets everyone’s picks and building pieces as a team that clearly needs to rebuild.  They can get that from the Warriors better package. Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody, Wiggins and picks &gt;&gt;&gt; Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle and picks  &gt;Not to mention exactly this was discussed by a reputable source in Spike Eskin as something that’s been noisy behind the scenes all off-season.

"It did feel weird putting Dwight in that top tier, but it's also weird having him in that second one. Either way, I think he makes it - but is the least certain of that top tier I mentioned by far.   Also fair to say I'm putting too much emphasis on defense. I can see Mutombo, Ben Wallace and Draymond Green all actually being pushed down a tier or two by voters"
"well it's going to be a new list of 75, rather than adding 25 to the 50 list. But even so, I took a stab at it. Top 25 of last 25 years.    16 Locks (not in order): LeBron, Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, Durant, Nowitzki, CP3, Wade, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Kidd, Nash, Dwight Howard, Iverson and Giannis     7 in the next tier (not in order): Gary Payton, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Pierce and Tony Parker  That means 2 spots left out of: Tracy McGrady, Draymond Green, Paul George, Ray Allen and Grant Hill. I would personally lean towards McGrady and Allen."
Really not. Dame is 31 and not winning shit in Portland. He’s too respectful to go public with a trade request.

I want absolutely no smoke with Simmons and Draymond green playing together.
You mfs are really on here on Al Gore’s internet saying draymond green is a better basketball player than Ben Simmons in 2021. I am disturbed at this point
"I've always thought Simmons is the closest comparison to Draymond in the league. Really good defender, rebounder and passer but can't shoot. Of course, Green has more size while Simmons offers a much greater transition threat but overall, if we were to recreate the 2017 Warriors using a completely different set of players, I'd have to pick Simmons for the Green role."
"The Blaze knows what they are doing, they do politics not sports reporting. Why would they even take up on a Draymond Green quote if it didn’t relate to a conservative narrative lol"

"&gt;Man that’s a lot of moving the goal posts around.  In what way?   &gt;A high end role player is not a max contract player.  I never said he was. But a max contract player that’s overpaid can still be a a winning player. The two aren’t mutually exclusive. Gobert is overpaid and still a winning player.  &gt;You cannot be a winning basketball player when you are a complete liability on one end of the court.   1. Yes, you can. I literally just gave you two clear examples in Dennis Rodman and Ben Wallace. Unless you think those two weren’t winning players?  2. Simmons is not a “complete liability” offensively. His transition game is still elite. He’s probably below average to neutral offensively most games.  &gt;Did you know the Hawks completed a 20 point comeback in half a game, by just hacking Ben over and over, because he couldn’t make a single free throw? A fucking elimination game in which the 76ers were blowing them out?  I sure did. I also saw him hold Trae Young to 5/23 shooting in game 7.   &gt;Show me where Ben Wallace or Dennis Rodman or Draymond Green have ever let their team down that much.   Huh? You just said you can’t be a winning player if you’re an offensive liability. Wallace and Rodman were both offensive liabilities, and yet they’re both still considered winning players. Clear examples of offensive liabilities being winning players. Therefore, your original statement that “you can’t be a winning player when you are a complete liability on one end of the court” is objectively wrong. Use logic please, not emotions."

"What is there to fully explain that you don’t understand? You need to be a once a generation player to be a generational player. That seems pretty simple, even for a simple dude.   Draymond green is clearly not a generational player. The fact you would post that and then have your chest out on other responses is hilarious and embarrassing."
"Watch the game. As many ppl pointed out, Positives - feel and instincts on both sides of the game - great defensively, locking up a PG is pretty amazing - the playmaking and passing, will translate - flat-out can ball  Negatives - the jumper and handle will need a lot of work but it will comes  Conclusion - worst case is a high lvl role player in the vain of Draymond green but looking up wings and PGs, with rebounding and playmaking and mediocre shooting - ceiling : future star if he can improve his jumper and handle"
How would the All Green Lineup do?  Jalen Green  Gerald Green  Danny Green  Jeff Green  Draymond Green
Is he a draymond green type player?
Looks like prime Draymond Green fresh out of college. He's gonna be great
"Draymond Green plays the same position as LeBron James, so, LeBron James."
Ben Simmons is an overrated Draymond Green.
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)).

"Cap police is here... We have a warrant for your arrest, too much capping...  Curry has just finished a season in which he scored 44 pts per 100 (would rank #2 in volume among ALL Jordan seasons, only behind 1987) on +9 rTS%...   Its a shame that his team was so overwhelmingly talented on offense, tho... I mean Klay was... wait... Klay didn't play a single minute all year? Really? What about Durant? Oh, he left a while ago. Iggy too? Well they still had absolute offensive juggernauts such as Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre Jr., Paschall...  Curry completely estroyed plebs like you this year, who were harping for years about how he was only able to score because of Klay and a great overall roster...  His roster this past year was pure trash, arguably as bad as MJ pre Pippen and Gran, and  he posted 44 pts (per 100) on +9 rTS%... MJ probably peaked as a regular season scorer with 43.5 pts (per 100) on 6.5-7 rTS%... Still insane numbers, but saying Curry doesn't deserve to be in this tier as a scorer is false."
Yeah he really needs to stop with the complaining so much tbh. Dudes out here getting technicals like draymond green
"[Draymond was fines for tampering, so there must be some rules about it](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29628273/draymond-green-gets-50000-tampering-fine-saying-devin-booker-leave-suns)"
Draymond Green acting like he accomplished something
"The Adams play from that year does not fill me with sympathy towards Green, if you believe that please look at the play again and re-assess. Either way Draymond was back in game 6 and LeBron still had 41.  In practice it’s because the excuse didn’t work out to be true in reality. The 73-9 warriors with the Unanimous MVP blew a 3-1 lead. Don’t forget that fact."
Draymond green is not the best player at any aspect of basketball. That's just ridiculous. Rodman was a much better player than Draymond and your argument doesn't really apply to him since he was an extremely high IQ player
The biggest difference between Draymond Green and everyone labeled the next Draymond Green has been on-court intelligence and in-game processing. Draymond is just a savant on the basketball court given his physical profile. He just understands the game at a different level than most players. He also makes decisions on the court that focus on winning instead of his own ego.  He's a special player in those regards.
"Pascal is a starting caliber player on a finals team. He can even be your second option on offense.  He cannot be the first option on a contender, or even a playoff team. He simply isn’t strong enough in the half-court. This isn’t a knock on his value as a player. You can say the same thing about Draymond Green. No one questions how great a player Draymond is, but if he’s the first option on your team your team isn’t going anywhere."
"I low-key hope that Draymond keeps building relationships in the league to bring back to the Bay...  Anyone else think Draymond Green would be a fine coach someday in NCAA or NBA? Barring that, a future Charles Barkley-esque commentator triggering nephews left and right?"
"It's been enforced once, I believe. [Draymond, on live TV](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/09/draymond-green-laughs-off-50000-tampering-fine-remark-about-devin-booker/#:~:text=Draymond%20Green's%20foray%20into%20broadcasting,during%20a%20TNT%20broadcast%20Friday.) with a history of asking players to Join (eg KD to warriors)  The NBA has to show that players are acting as representative/agent for their teams. And Players don't have to preserve a record of their calls, text, email, or get randomly audited.  Team execs do."
"Not so sure about that chief. He was a 2x AP All American honorable mention, so 2/4 years he was close to top 15 but not quite there. They had 43 honorable mention in 2012, for perspective. Never won B1G POY.   And obviously when you're a 4 year college player you can even be the best player in college basketball and still not be a ""can't miss prospect"" - look no further than a guy I watched when I was at MSU, Draymond Green. He won NABC NPOY in college, and then fell to the second round in the draft.   You don't have to die on this hill man."
"Draymond Green missed a very easy layup against Australia 2 days ago, it happens."
"[Tell that to Draymond Green.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/08/09/draymond-green-fined-devin-booker#:~:text=Warriors%20forward%20Draymond%20Green%20was,good%20for%20Devin%20Booker's%20career.)"
Yeah Draymond Green is the GOAT
"Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Draymond Green, Danilo Gallinari."
"Rodman was possibly the GOAT defender though. He was tasked with guarding Magic, Jordan, Bird, Barkley, Malone, Shaq, and did it as good as anybody. There's almost nobody else you could do that with. His rebounding was insane at 18 rebounds per game in the early 90s. His intangibles made him that much better. He's easily better than Draymond Green."
"He wasn't just a great defender though. He was a defender the likes of which the league rarely if ever sees. He's possibly the defensive GOAT although I would put Hakeem over him in that. Draymond Green is an example of a good roleplayer. Rodman's impact on games from defense to rebounding to intangibles is huge.   You really should be asking Rodman about Robinson, not the other way around. It was Rodman's problem with the coaching and teammates that made him want to move. He then found a good home in Chicago and was the 2nd best player on the team."
I mean… yea. When youre a top 5-10 player in the world who cares if someones jawing at you. Draymond green said that when he talked shit to duncan all he’d get back is a look and it stopped doing it
You telling me Boston bought into the hype of drafting the next draymond green but got a VP instead?
"6 offensive boards per game is producing offensively. He's a defensive superstar. He guards who the coach tells him to guard. But yes, he probably could have guarded him better than Robinson, considering he was tasked with guarding Magic, Jordan, Bird, Barkley, Karl Malone, and Shaq, and did it as good as anyone. Draymond Green cannot match that resume, nor can anyone else really. Rodman was indeed a superstar. 6'7"" forward getting 18 rebounds per game in the '90s and playing some of the best defense the league has ever seen, not to mention 5 rings and probably the best motor since Wilt, even though he came into the league at 25 and was all-time level on defense into his mid 30s.   But no, it means nothing because he was on Robinson's team when Robinson got lit up for 35 a night and publicly humiliated as the undeserving MVP"
"These comments 😭 This sub has a hard time valuing role players.  You can be immensely important to your own team and simultaneously have limited value in the free market. Ie Draymond green. Thybuille has no value to a non-contending team. And if you’re a contending   team, you’re not giving away one of your best players for him. So he doesn’t really have value. Dude above me said “untouchable…MAYBE for Dame” 😂 The delusion"
"“Kevin Durant, Draymond Green call” where have I heard this before ?"
"&gt; ""I’m not confident at all,"" he said during an appearance on ""The Jump"" last month. ""And it’s no disrespect but you look at the players they have (Durant), (Green), they play cute. In a good way, right. They get buckets. They’re not guys that are going to go down there and mix it up in the trenches.""   Draymond Green isn’t good in the trenches apparently"
"Lobos 1707 investor, Draymond Green"
Draymond Green!
"Draymond Green. The blackest name you can find. If you book an Airbnb with the name Draymond Green, you'll get a cancellation soon after you book it (Dave Chappelle)"
Because draymond green is also a punk bitch. It’s not some logical flaw to broaden the discussion by making some side commentary
Who thought Draymond Green had the brain to adapt to different rules
"&gt;You are seriously underrating Ben Simmon's value then. Yes, the Warriors have Draymond Green. But that doesn't change the fact of Ben Simmon's trade value. You might just be affected by the memes due to his most recent game so you think his value is lower than it actually is. Again, I said that the Warriors can top the Sixer's offer if they want to trade for Lillard. In this scenario, they are trading for Simmons since it would cost them fewer assets.   I'm not underrating Ben Simmons based on the recent article. I'm properly rating him based on his play on the court and his shortcomings. Draymond Green is an infinitely better fit with the Warriors and his IQ matches their style. If we're talking about being realistic, Simmons isn't worth Wiggins straight up after this year.   &gt;If you are including the Kings, why not Rockets? Thunder? Cavs? Magic? Pistons? They have better assets. Why didn't those teams trade for Harden when he was available? I seriously don't get the logic why you would think the Kings would even attempt to trade for Lillard lol. You need to be realistic. Only teams near contender status will trade for Lillard. Otherwise, he'll just request for a trade again after a few days  Because none of those teams are looking to take the next step yet to contend. The Kings are, DeAaron Fox's contract is coming up; by this season or next, they have to make the playoffs. Their timeline is the same as the 76ers. Embiid is only under contract for 2 years as well."
&gt; It’s funny tho cus he has never injured a single player in his entire basketball career.  Players not winding up injured as a result of intentionally tripping them doesn't mean he wasn't trying to injure them. I'm not sure what Draymond Green has to do with Grayson Allen being a punk bitch.
"""A lot of people said the world has caught to the USA. They gave us a good run, but this is still our game."" - Draymond Green"
"&gt;That's not fair value. Warriors are not including either Kuminga or Moody for Ben Simmons when they already have Draymond. That's extremely unrealistic. Why would the Warriors help Philly when they can just trade for Dame directly?  You are seriously underrating Ben Simmon's value then. Yes, the Warriors have Draymond Green. But that doesn't change the fact of Ben Simmon's trade value. You might just be affected by the memes due to his most recent game so you think his value is lower than it actually is. Again, I said that the Warriors can top the Sixer's offer if they want to trade for Lillard. In this scenario, they are trading for Simmons since it would cost them fewer assets.      \&gt; The Sixers offer of Simmons/Maxey/Thybulle and 3 picks can be topped by Sacramento with Hali/Bagley/3 picks, Wolves with DLo/Okogie and picks, Denver with MPJ/Dozier/Picks and the Knicks with RJ/Quickley/Robinson/picks. Note that all these teams figure to have picks better than the 76ers. Maxey and Thybulle are C tier prospects; they aren't moving the needle as much as you think.  \&gt; Why not? Like I said, the market hasn't opened yet since Dame hasn't requested. Once he does, a lot of teams looking to take the next step will jump in. Just because the 76ers are public about it doesn't mean they'll be the only team interested.     If you are including the Kings, why not Rockets? Thunder? Cavs? Magic? Pistons? They have better assets. Why didn't those teams trade for Harden when he was available? I seriously don't get the logic why you would think the Kings would even attempt to trade for Lillard lol.   You need to be realistic. Only teams near contender status will trade for Lillard. Otherwise, he'll just request for a trade again after a few days."

My favourite moment was when Draymond Green clicked on FIBA rules and smacked the ball away after one bounce off the rim during a crucial near-in free throw.
Draymond Green with the 3 billion IQ play knocking the ball off the rim. I'm not seeing that get enough recognition.
"People take the easy way, and it's easy to hate Draymond Green. But maybe now more people realize how great he is."
"Draymond green has 10x the dirty plays that Grayson has, and this sub usually fawns over him."
"Pat bev, maybe Draymond green.   Yeah, Allen tripped a couple dudes when he was an immature college student, dray was in the league for years and still kicking people in the balls multiple times.   Being a white kid from duke brings tons of extra, worthless hate"
Draymond Green is what Kevin Love thinks he is
Grayson is like 1/10th as dirty of a player like Draymond green.
DRAYMOND GOAT GREEN
That play just sums up Draymond Green.  Maybe 3 non Point Guards in the world can make that pass so casually.
"You could consider every star or even player to be competitive to make it to the highest level, so I don’t want to dismiss any of the players not mentioned.  Those are just the guys who come to mind with the most “dog” in them.  (Maybe add Draymond Green tbh)"
Draymond Green being assessed a flagrant-1 foul against Lebron in Game 4 of the 2016 Finals against Cleveland resulting in his automatic suspension for game 5. The Warriors ahead 3-1 end up losing the series and the Cavaliers becoming the first team in Finals history to overcome a 3-1 deficit.
That’s only regular season. So many of his career highs come in the playoffs.  He really lives up to being a 16 game player not an 82 game player   https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Draymond-Green/Bests/2369
"I think it's more because he's one of the oldest players in the group and people here aren't as familiar with him.   He also historically lives in the shadows of MJ.   He's the best wing defender among all choices and in my hypothetical team with Trae dominating usage, and prime Draymond as a secondary ball handler, I think he'd be perfect in a role of elite defensive stopper and spot up shooter.  We're only choosing a starting line up but I also think he's got the ability to the run the offense when Trae is sitting (I'm turning egos off in this hypothetical too I guess).  Also I'm looking at the current $5 when making that claim, and while I think Nash, Anthony Davis, and David Robinson are all five star worthy, I don't think it's wise to build your team around a big man in today's NBA (Giannis notwithstanding), Pippen should absolutely be above George, and Iverson I just wouldn't want on my team.    He's also not too unpopular of a choice even here.  He's the second most commonly picked $4 behind Trae (the vast majority of ""Green's"" are Danny Green), though tbf if he had been $5 I'm not sure if I would have chosen him."
"Wilt and Russell would have both been dominant in the modern game.   Wilt was a taller Embiid without injury problems, and Russell was a bigger/stronger/faster/more agile Draymond Green."
"How? They have a DPOY candidate &amp; proven top tier playoff defender in Draymond, and guys who play hard? Wiggins is really freakin good too and a much better 2nd option than the Cavs without LeBron (JR Smith or Jeff Green? lol).  The Cavs is a bunch of inconsistent vets who can't string any good set of games together without LeBron *on both sides*. Just a bunch of old inconsistent, unmotivated vet role players thrown together with no synergy, and who are terrible on both sides.  Curry may carry that 21 Warriors offense like Bron did, but Curry was carried by the defense as usual as they finished top ten.  Warriors in 6."

Draymond Green : how to delete Snapchat story
"I didn't watch Billl Russel, but doesn't the fact that he played with 8 HOFers and was still  considered the best player on all of those championship teams mean that he must have been pretty great. He was also a 5x Mvp in an Era where players voted, which shows he was respected by his peers at least. I feel like Bill Russel was probably just one of those guys you had to watch to truly understand his impact, sort of like a super charged prime Draymond Green"
"He's like a poor man's Draymond Green (on defense), not an A+ athlete  but super smart and negotiates space well and reads the offense quickly"
Put him in more of a draymond green role and he’d prob shine.
"Unless the 6'7"" guy is draymond green!"
Draymond green. If curry averages 30ppg and dray cant get up to 10ppg it will have to be him. Imo i think they should trade for simmons amd trade dray away after this season.
He'd be a fusion of prime Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert but on steroids and way more athletic.
Prime Draymond Green on steroids with league-leading athleticism.
"You could say that Curry has been surrounded by arguably the best 3&amp;D player to ever exist, DPOY Draymond Green and then Kevin Durant himself. But I won’t disagree that KD and Kawhi have had teams that were well built"
"a shorter Draymond green, who doesn't pass or defend as well, but shoots better"
What about the Green/Ball category? Lonzo just got 84 mill and Draymond got over 100 mill lol so out of everyone sign to Klutch only 1 dude seem to lost out too me it seem he is the problem not Klutch lol
"Hard disagree. I believe Portis and Coby White were good picks.  Portis without injuries could have been more.  The only draft you can consider 'bad' for the Bulls in that era was 2012 when we picked Marquis Teague at 29 when Crowder, Draymond Green and Middleton were all available (all picked in the 2nd round - so everybody else missed too). Yeah Wendell Carter didn't work out but what other 5 could we have drafted that year that's any better? That was what we needed at that time."
Draymond Green is close. They play different styles of defense though.
"Oh snap, did Bill Russel, Bill Walton, Vlade Divac, Arvydas Sabonis, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Joakim Noah, Wild Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Brad Miller and Draymond Green cease to exist?"
"Draymond is our point forward. Yes he sets screens but he’s very valuable making decisions with the ball. Simmons isn’t a threat if he’s left wide open on the perimeter. He’s only a threat in transition and around the rim. Defenders can sag 10 feet off Green and Simmons. JTA is more of a 4, while Iggy can shoot he isn’t great at it and he is 38. Moody and Kuminga are rookies who at least for Kuminga are gonna make quite a bit of mistakes but get better. Even then rn he’s not a respected shooter. We’re still talking OPJ for the majority of the workload. If you play Simmons at the 4 and not the 3, Dray is playing the 5 when Simmons is in. So a majority of Dray’s time will be at the 5. Yeah we missed half our roster but the problem with spacing is there were only 2-3 offensive threats as Poole and Wiggins couldn’t attract multiple defenders. Same happens in a Simmons and OpJ lineup just you’re paying more for it. And the problem is we are not getting Simmons for free. We have to give up a starter who can actually shoot, picks, and a very talented prospect. Why do you do that for what is a suboptimal fit?"
I recognize how good he is along with how limited he is. You can't be paying a defense-only player that amount of money. Draymond Green is the greatest defender of the last decade and he makes like 35% less AAV.
In the last 3 years he basically has the highest steal rate of any non guard not named Draymond green
"Ben Simmons, but not as a point guard, but as power forward that fills the role Draymond Green fills for Golden State."

"as it stands he is kinda draymond green, the Celtics should consider running offence through him like the warriors do dray, ofc they don't have the same personel but it's better than having him launch shots he doesn't hit."
That works great for the Warriors though because they have Draymond the run the offense—which is why Steph’s splits without Green are noticeably worse—but I’m not sure how well that would translate to the Trailblazers.

I agree completely. I wasn’t trying to say he didn’t have a solid legacy. So my bad if it came off that way.   I just think he could of been a more offensive focused draymond green type player with his head on straight and especially in today’s league.  His skillset was so unique and his style had that swag
“Draymond Green sucks”
3. Jarred Vanderbilt   2. Thaddeus Young   1. Draymond Green
Draymond Green went from being able to shoot to not being able to shoot.
“Draymond Green isn’t good and hasn’t been for a while”
"&gt;  and in my own experience I think Draymond's edge has definitely helped my team.  lol. your team literally lost the finals cuz he couldnt stop kicking people in the balls. also cried to KD to come to his team and then forced him to leave.   also a big LOL comparing MJ, Kobe and KG to DRAYMOND GREEN LOLLLL"
PG: Chris Paul ($3)  SG: Michael Jordan ($5)  SF: Tracy McGrady ($2)  PF: Draymond Green ($1)  C: Hakeem Olajuwon ($4)
Steph got hurt from falling backwards onto some steps that’s not a case of poor durability that’s just shit luck…..and if Dame or Harden’s 35 million dollar 2nd option missed the whole season and they trotted out lineups with Draymond Green and Kevon Looney/Wiseman the offenses would struggle with that spacing ….at least Dame has 3 respectable shooters on the floor with him at all times. Imagine where Steph would be with CJ on the wing and where Dame would be with the best shooter and only above average shooter in the starting lineup other than him being Andrew Wiggins
Draymond Green is trash.
&gt; KG is who he is: a proto draymond green  KG has legit discussion for top 20 all time.  Draymond green would be lucky if anyone discuss him for top 100.
"Similar to draymond green. The 4th all star on the greatest team ever, or just a slightly above average defender who's only offensive skill is passing better than average for his position."
I'm looking at his Minnesota years again now. From 2000 to 2005 KG only missed 3 games while averaging 40 minutes a night which is some real iron man shit.   Draymond Green must be a typo for Giannis.
&gt; KG is who he is: a proto draymond green  Stay off the craaaacck
&gt;KG is who he is: a proto draymond green  Tell me that you've only watched basketball since 2016 without actually saying it
KG is a proto draymond green?!  That's the most bizarre comparison I've ever seen for KG.   They are NOTHINGGGGGG alike
Draymond Green is bad
He may be able to be turned into a poor man's Draymond Green as like the cornerstone of a solid defense. The issue is that he needs to have shooting around him at essentially every position because he is essentially a center on offense.
"In your imagination who gets the Timberwolves past the Spurs or Lakers after Malik Sealy died?  KG and nobody gets past the Spurs, he had to go to the eastern conference to dodge TD  KG and nobody gets past shaq Kobe  Twolves did fine. KG is who he is: a proto draymond green"
draymond green is mr triple single or steph isn't an elite playmaker
Fuck Draymond Green.  Hate him on the Warriors. Asshole. I’d really like him on my team and would trade a lot of my beloved players on the roster to get him. He’d probably make Ja an MVP faster than anyone.   Fuck Pat Bev.  I was so hyped to hear we got rid of him before I ever had to see that shitbag in Grizzlies blues. Idiot would probably injure his own teammates if he thought it’d get him ahead in life.   Two different fucks.
A lot of people surprisingly don’t understand how smart Draymond is and the effectiveness he has on a team.   “put Draymond Green on any team besides the Warriors and expose his trash ass”  Lol no he will just make that other team better too.
"Alright, I was thinking of adding Draymond Green over KG along with Moncrief but it's more balanced now, so no need."
He tried to convince everyone that he had been blinded by draymond green for the last minute of the play in game against the warriors.
"I’m the 6’2 Draymond Green without the elite defense and playmaking, I also do not have a 7ft wingspan lmao"
"Draymond Green is damn good at what he does, but you gotta be on something to think that his lack of being any kind of scoring threat doesn’t limit the Warriors.  Don’t even have to be good you just can’t be nothing in as many games as he is.  He’ll need to be better if the Warriors are gonna compete for another title"
Draymond Green is good at basketball
Draymond green without the passing ability or consistent defense
* Finals record argument  * Shaq carried Kobe  * Kobe is better than Lebron/Kobe is top 3  * Draymond Green is ass
Draymond Green sucks.
"I would like a team of Danny Green, Jeff Green, Jalen Green, Draymond Green and Javonte Green please."
Draymond green mixed with Westbrick (cause I be missing my jumpers but I can drive/pass)
Draymond Green but bad at defense
"Draymond Green with better finishing, better shooting, horrible handles."
"Lol! Half the time it seemed like he was just ready to leave early to go to the club and would foul out intentionally. But to be fair, you could replace Rodman's name with Draymond Green and it would fit just as well. He cost his team a championship by getting suspended in the Finals."
What if I told you Draymond green was the leading scorer in game 7 of an nba finals and had 32 points and 6 made 3s
I blinked to make sure I read that correctly....DRAYMOND GREEN in a shootout with Dame??
"I think these numbers are absolutely true for Giannis and I can say that as someone who watched upwards of 75% of Milwaukee's games from 2014-2019, but BBRef's position numbers are very unreliable.  Take, for example, Draymond Green. As recently 2017-18 and 2018-19 BBref has Draymond playing 48% and 59% of his minutes at the small forward. Anyone who watched the Warriors in that period of time can tell you that's wildly inaccurate."
Draymond is also in the Draymond role. He plays with steph. And won ring with steph and kd also Klay. Dray role isn’t taking a bunch of fts. Yea Ben needs to hit them but it wouldn’t be his role playing beside those 3. His role in Philly was being the Pg which just isn’t possible if he won’t shoot in the clutch. His role beside Steph and kd or Klay would be the Draymond green role of elite defense and passing. Screens etc. but scoring is waaaay further down that list of priorities. And I believe Simmons could be as good as Draymond or better in that role.  U didn’t list anything specific he did just he contributed to a team winning championships.  So I believe Ben could have contributed too and nothing last season showed me he wouldn’t be as good as Draymond.  Also leadership and mentality are vague and unquantifiable anyway. Draymond mentality is why he got suspended in game 6 and he get techs. Leadership is cool but the team has a coach and Steph curry as well so hard to say how much is on Draymond. Ill admit Draymond leads the on court defense but Ben is just as good as on ball and team defender. No reason he can’t be an as effective defensive leader if the role asked for it.   Lol convo over. Dude no one attacked you. Stopped being sensitive over Draymond. It’s a basketball discussion.
"????   AD, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Draymond Green, THT, KCP, Gary Trent Jr, Tyrese Maxes, Darius Garland, and many more  They have other clients and most have been paid."
"&gt; That core included a fully healthy Klay Thompson that wasn't 31 years old and a Draymond Green that hadn't significantly declined and is also 31 years old.  &gt; They aren't the same players outside of Steph.  31 years old, just ancient."
&gt; Except this Warriors core has actually won 73 games before.  That core included a fully healthy Klay Thompson that wasn't 31 years old and  a Draymond Green that hadn't significantly declined and is also 31 years old.  They aren't the same players outside of Steph.

"I don’t care what anyone says, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green was a superteam. The only reason people act like they’re not is because the KD team is wayyy better in comparison but having the clear two best shooters of all time and one of the greatest defenders ever was so unfair. And they’re still together. Man I hope Klay looks at least a little close to 100%."
"I don’t give a fuck what anyone says. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green was a fucking superteam.

And they’re still together. Man I hope Klay looks at least a little close to 100%."
"It kind of matters, but the physical stats and skills matter more. If you build a guard oriented team with no tall F/C rebounders, you'll definitely get wrecked on the boards. But if you have 1-2 Draymond Green caliber Forwards with excellent rebound/defense stats, it doesn't matter as much."
"No, but the guy who represents clients such as Draymond Green, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, John Wall, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis probably is a legitimate agent. Noel happened to get the short end of his attention and got fucked over because of it."
"I mean yes it is a legit agency which is why plenty of guys like Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, and John Wall have gotten paid while being represented by Klutch/Rich Paul. The tampering thing is stupid because every agency tampers since it isn't just Klutch guys who sign deals 1 minute into free agency or get multiple guys that they represent who are friends on the same team. The rest of what you said just sounds like hating honestly. How can you hate on Lebron helping to fund a school in his hometown?"
"&gt; I love how you just ignored all the advanced stats and direct comparative stats, and just keep staying laser focused on just Jokic's defense. You say this:  You seem to have lost track of the discussion in that case, your initial comments towards me were directly about Jokic and Harden's defensive comparison.   Whatever edge Jokic (apparently) has in offense isn't enough to surmount his lackluster defense at the most important defensive position.   [He gave up 67.7 FG% at the rim last year's regular season.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Restricted%20Area%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=Restricted%20Area%20FGA*GE*10&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  [In the playoffs that number increased to 70.3%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/opponent-shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;sort=Restricted%20Area%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=Restricted%20Area%20FGA*GE*10&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  And that's only one facet, his PnR defense is the same reason why every other guard they meet in the playoffs has a career series: Dame, CJ, Booker, CP3, Donovan Mitchell, etc.  &gt;But then when I give you tons of advanced stats that suggest, actually, Jokic's impact overall, primarily offense though, was way higher than Harden's, you just ignore it.  **""No guard can do what a big does on defense, which is be the defensive anchor for the team and offer rim protection. The same isn't true on the offensive end, Jokic is one of the best passing bigs OAT, but he isn't the first/only for a reason.""**   Your advanced stats saying Jokic is a better offensive player than Harden don't refute this.  &gt;The Raptors, pretty much all the Warriors teams, the Cavs, the first Heat big 3 title, the Mavs...there is no clear correlation at all honestly.  Marc Gasol is not a below average defensive big.   Draymond Green is not a below average defensive big.  Chris Bosh is not a below average defensive big.   Tyson Chandler is not a below average defensive big.  The only outlier is the 2016 Cavs, which are an outlier amongst champion teams for an obvious reason."
"&gt;	The list of active NBA players with at least 2 Championships is actually surprisingly short: ​  1. (1 player) Lebron James ​  1.

Draymond Green.
I was so fucking pissed when we drafted him over Draymond Green.
"Draymond Green, though you can find various 'advanced' stats which make the case for his offensive value. His traditional box score stats are unremarkable, but he's an important facilitator for the Warriors' offense and directing guys where to go."
Damian Lillard and Draymond Green is a reasonable facsimile of Curry/Green
"Bogut is severely underrated in this conversation.   NBA Champ, All-NBA Third Team, All-Defensive Second Team, NBA Block Leader, NBL MVP, NBL DPOY, 2x All-NBL, great college career and some FIBA success with the National team as well.   Not to mention Draymond Green, a HOF-caliber defender, credits him largely for teaching him how to defend."
If Wiggins is so good how did the Warriors miss the playoffs with Draymond Green and an MVP season from Curry?
"Ok so lets assume by me saying those things that I mean weaker defense. I see why you would say that. Its not so much a disrespect on the skill set of players as it is the way the rules have been changed and how the whistle is blown.   Lets use your KD example…First, it makes for horrible basketball. Second, he does it because the whistle allows him to do it. Third, if a defender is guarding him with arms out, and KD swings his arms into his…it is gonna be free points and its gonna make the defender play different the next trip down. It benefits KD because now, he will be guarded different, less aggressive and probably get more space. Oh plus he got free points for doing that. Same goes for guarding a lot of players deploying the tactics you mentioned.   I think the “weaker defense” narrative by us old heads might be misinterpreted in a way that is more negative or disrespectful to the defenders of today. To me the weaker defense is a slap to Draymond Green, Kawhi, Gobert, Butler, etc. That doesnt change the fact that its easier to score though. You cannot base the evidence on stats because like we both showed, the stats can go either way. Its why you watch games and review old footage(or in my case grew up watching too lol) It is easier to score because big men can no longer camp out in the paint, the lack of hand checking allows for much more free movement and faster movement, the addition of zone defense allows more spacing by creating more open shots for people, the rules put in place for safety creates a little more spacing as well as calls for ridiculous fouls like the rip through or unnatural shooting creating spacing or altering how defense is played. So its not about players themselves being weaker defenders as much as the system in place benefitting the offense like it was intended when the rules were made/altered."
I may be way off base here but I view Simmons greatest strength as a defender as an on-ball guy.   Embiid is one of my favorite / and I think under-rated team defense players and does a great job of protecting the paint and plugging any holes. Tobias and Danny Green are also plus team defenders.   Which is why I still don’t see Simmons transforming Sacramento’s defense. He’s not like Draymond or even close to a talent like Gobert in that sense.   The Kings just drafted a dude who’s nickname is off-night lmao who (at least very early on) shows an ability to potentially impact even wings with persistent on-ball defense.  Again I could be wrong but Trae had his way in that series and even Simmons who I consider the best “on-ball” defender in the league didn’t really move the needle
"That interview with Draymond Green really summed him up for me. Hes focused on his craft and everything is really just noise. After hearing what he said about raising kids, I have to say hes maybe the most down to earth and real person at his level in the NBA. He is very intelligent and has great emotional intelligence as well. People really misread him"
"Favorites because they had the cap space to add in an all-star in 2017.  GS in 2015 got extremely lucky and even then Lebron and a bunch of g-leaguers took GS to 6.   GS in 2016, you guys went for the bulls record, got it, and nearly lost to the KD Thunder (won in 7) in  the ECF, and then lost to Lebron/Irving and crew in 7 after blowing a 3-1 lead (first team in NBA Finals history to do so) and then complained that it was because Draymond Green was out Game 5, neglecting that if Curry or Klay put in an AVERAGE game in game 7, they win handily.   Then the stars aligned and because you lost the finals, KD was like hell, maybe I should join the 73-9 team and completely crippled the league for 3 years until KD and Klay got crippled in 2019. And no, it wasn't like any other time in history of a super team. No other time in NBA history did a team start as the prohibitive favorite (you had to put more money up than to win) to win the NBA championship."
"Draymond Green is not just some person who exists.    Wiggins is at the very-least a solid rotation player.  They missed the playoffs because of the rules that were set up, and because of that, technically came in 9th last season in the conference."
Love the low effort of Draymond Green
"WCF+ babyyyyyy!!!  People trippin over Klay's defense next year... We were a top 5 defense last year. Our coaches know what they're doing defensively. And we got this dude named Draymond. We'll be fine on that end. What we need is shooters/guys who can take some attention away from Steph. I have no doubt that Klay, even a step or two slow, can manage that.  Our bench is also deeper and a lot more versatile than people are giving it credit for. If OPJ can stay healthy (I get that's a big IF but shit, I gotta hope!) he's going to be a massive piece for us. We've got a ton of guys who can play multiple positions and different roles. A sharpshooting center off the bench gives us a new look we've honestly never really had. If Poole continues to play/builds on how he played to end last season, he could have a legit shot at 6MOTY/MIP. Wiggins is a top-tier roleplayer, and we've got guys like JTA and Loon who excel at all the little things. If we can get some valuable minutes out of even one of the three Kuminga/Wiseman/Moody, that'll be massive.  I've also just got this feeling that we're a playoff-oriented team, even though we obviously didn't get to show that last year. Steph Curry is going to be Steph Curry. Draymond Green might be past his scoring prime, but he's always been a 16-game player and I believe he's still got that guy in him. Kerr likes to tinker with odd lineups throughout the regular season, but he does a good job pinning down the most effective ones from matchup to matchup when the time comes, and he is willing to make mid-series adjustments.  There's just something about this squad man... I just feel it! Call me crazy, IDC, but we're going far! No one wants to play Steph/Klay/Dray in a 7-game series, and we've got some guys outside those three who can make stuff happen..."
"You wild. CP3 is a complete point guard. It hurts to say this, but he’s a more complete player than Nash bc he can actually play defense. Also, power forward is one of the most important positions. Early 2000’s, you had to have a good power forward or you were toast. Also, see draymond green and what he does for the warriors. Having a do it all power forward and quality center is crucial for winning"
Peep the Duncan and Draymond love. I've got TD as the best player of all time (I rank guys in a way that's kinda against the grain) and Draymond Green is one of my favorite players to examine.
The 2016 NBA finals comeback was unprecedented but not as amazing as people say. I think putting asterisks on championships is stupid but talking about the circumstances is still worthwhile. Steph Curry was clearly hampered by his injury. Andrew Bogut got injured. Draymond Green got suspended. The Cavs got very lucky. It’s similar to the Raptors championship but people understand they wouldn’t have won that one if things didn’t all go their way.
"&gt;if you’re not a threat to score, it drastically reduces your impact on your passing  Draymond Green enters the chat. He was 3rd in assists last season. Amazing court vision can make up for a lack of shooting prowess."
"I have a few  If Jordan played today he’d be a bald Demar Derozan who played great defense  Harden is the most skilled SG of all time and in my eyes is better than Wade all time  Draymond Green is a generational talent  The 2016/2017 Warriors would destroy any team you put in front of them in a 7 game series   Any version of the Warriors from 2016-2018 would run the 90s Bulls off the court  Ivesson was overrated   Tim Duncan is a Top 7 player all time and should be rated higher than Kobe.   Durant would beat any player ever 1 on 1  Prime Westbrook is better than Prime Rose  Any team Lebron played in the Finals was tougher than any team Jordan faced and Jordan wouldn’t have won any Finals series on any of Lebrons teams that lost except that Mavs series in 2011. Jordan would have lost in 2016, and I believe only Lebron could have pulled off the win given the circumstances.   Many if not most of Wilts feats are exaggerated or fake"
"Damien Lillard is exceptionally overrated. He is a volume scorer who wouldn’t help a team actually win.   Draymond green is an all time bum that this sub loves to praise for dumb shit you can’t gauge like “dirty work, and basketball iq” he is nearly a max salary player and wouldn’t start on most teams but he was lucky enough to be drafted around two hall of famers and a coach who could use him. When his talent around him was gone he didn’t even average 10 points a game or 8 rebounds.   Giannis will develop a jump shot and be considered the best player ever, but will never get the praise MJ gets."
"It’s 100% depends on the type of team you currently have. Ironically, if I had some semblance of the Lakers young core, say a DLo, Randle, Clarkson, I’m taking Ben Simmons. If I have nothing, I’m taking Ingram. Ben Simmons is Draymond Green on Fucking hulk steroids. If you put draymonds skill set into lebrons body and then game him an extra 3 inches, that’s Ben Simmons."
"He is actually right around average in defense, check his drtg and dbpm. If you watch him play, he ain’t no Kawhi Leonard but he’s no Trae Young either. He has a quick first step, way above average height for his position so he can flexibly defend 1-3 and have the height advantage, and he has excellent mobility for his size. He does have issues with defensive effort, doesn’t put in 100% every possession and he doesn’t treat every person he defends with the same attention. He clearly doesn’t do any of that Jrue Holiday, Draymond Green shit where they study tape and specifically practice how to guard each all-star level player on the opposing team. His cardio isn’t elite enough to have that much offensive load while also putting max effort into defense.   But by all metrics I’ve seen, he’s right about there, some show slightly below or slightly above, but he’s not a turnstile on defense. His average defense is actually why he’s just so much better than Trae, because while Trae is an offensive weapon, he’s a massive liability on defense. To the point where he’d be specifically targeted every other possession for the switch, and he’s just not athletic enough or tall enough for even many PGs, 2s and 3s will straight up ignore him and shoot over him. People used to criticize Steph for his lack of defense but he’s actually league average most seasons too, he just got targeted since he used to be the weakest defender out of the starting lineup. And people would see that and critique him for getting shitted on by LeBron or Kyrie."
"Agreed Kevin Mchale is underrated but zero chance he’s a top 3 PF ever. Timmy, KG, Dirk, Karl Malone, Chuck were all MVPs and 3 of those guys were the best players on championship teams. Kevin McHale was a Robin, he was never the primary option and was actually in the perfect situation possible. Definitely a great scorer and elite defender but all the other 5 PFs ahead of him were the 1st option for the majority of their careers which is much more valuable to me than being the second/third option on a all time great team. I would compare him to having a Klay Thompson/Draymond Green kind of role except he was probably closer to having the impact of a Dwyane Wade in 2012/2013."
Draymond Green is one of the most overrated players
" Danny Green, Draymond Green, Gerald Green, Jalen Green, JaMychal Green"
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
"MLB has the most exclusive HoF by far, guys like Melo or Draymond Green wouldn't be HoFers in baseball, in basketball they will be first ballot. HoF is supposed to be the greatest players of all time, not what the basketball HoF is, which is the Hall of Very Good."
"Dennis Rodman (Not in the league currently but shut up, it's a great example.)  Draymond Green  Andrew Wiggins  Klay Thompson  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, Clarkson is a roleplayer to me. His role is volume scoring off the bench."
"you are correct.  draymond green has scorers that deflect from his inability to shoot, and the many many times he's passed up layups to kick it out for 3pt shots.  the sixers drafted markelle fultz, then they traded for jimmy butler.  they lost both, so the focus is unreasonably on ben simmons' shooting.  as if being one of the top 3 defenders in the league who also creates the most 3pt shots for his teammates is something to be embarassed about, or something that can't be incorporated in a winning program.  says a lot about the critic's lack of basketball knowledge than about ben simmons.  but none of that matters.  the environment is toxic, sixers fans have contributed to it, and they will reap what has been sown by losing a very good player for a bunch of lesser ones in trade."
"My homer take is what if Andrew Bogut didn't suffer his big injury with Milwaukee?  I think this is more than just your standard injury ret-con because of the flow-on effect of Bogut being traded to the Warriors. I think Monta still gets traded, but does it still happen with the Bucks if they have a healthy Bogut who they're less willing to part with?   Maybe the Warriors go after a serviceable big from another team and the Bucks try to refine their lineup to get past the Big 3 in Boston. Barring any kind of big injury, Bogut probably solidifies his position in the All-Defensive Team and is on of the dominant big men in the East. Potentially his defense suffers if he starts to focus more on scoring, but doesn't slump in a meaningful way; he could've ended up being more like a prototypical Jokic-type, without the outside shot maybe. At some stage he probably gets traded and winds up still as a journeyman in the league but contributes more consistently on the offensive end.  Does he still pick up a ring at some point? It's probably a coin toss.  But how do the Warriors go with developing their team to have title aspirations if Bogut isn't there to be the defensive presence and mentor a young Draymond Green to become a defensive maniac? Dray was probably destined to be who is now, but having an inside–outside system with Bogut made half-court sets for most teams a big problem. And does Iggy still sign if the roster doesn't feature a former #1 draft pick?  And the Warriors would need a legitimate inside presence versus those Lob City Clippers and Grit 'n' Grind Grizzlies teams. Maybe the Death Lineup is ultimately all they'd need to get through the WC but would they have enough left in the tank to beat the Cavs? Zaza and Javale have rings, so maybe, and KD probably still comes to town, but we'll never know how much the big Aussie opened the door to the dynasty."
"Yes but still Dame is borderline HOF while Curry is a cemented top 3 PG ever, multiple MVP winner, 3 rings to his name. Being generational talent for a franchise is great, but that franchise needs to build around you so you can both elevate to another height.   Even though Dame is legendary in his own right, he is a tier bellow Curry just due to the accolades. Basketball is a team sport and champion teams will always write out history.   Put Draymond Green in Indiana or somewhere and look at his reputation reduce to only being praised by Pacers fans. In the same manner put guys like Sabonis or Vucevic in GSW during their championship runs and look at their reputation skyrocket to the point that the whole public consideres them HOF guys and generational players. Players come and go, rings are permanent."
And Draymond Green is also an all time defender while being an great playmaker and in his prime could actually shoot  Also was the 2nd best player on a championship team in 2015
do you know how many “all time best defenders” lists exist? go ahead and find one that has draymond higher than 19. you’re allowed to have any opinion you want. but claiming green as top ten of all time puts you on a tiny island.
"I know the suns weren’t that well run at the time, but a few websites making the comparison (the ringer even said they played differently, they’ll just have similar expectations as high drafted, overseas bigs) doesn’t mean that’s why the suns chose to draft him. If it was any player that made him draft him (which I doubt, he was just a high level prospect), it would’ve been Draymond Green."
Tbf David Lee was an All-Star power forward. Every coach aside from maybe Pop would put D Lee over draymond. But when they saw how great of a defender/floor general Draymond was that's when they decided to change the starting five. Iirc that's also when they put benched iggy for Harrison Barnes.   With Jackson tho Green was riding the end of the bench and was rarely in games.
"Lots of guys have been really good Draymond green comps, actually, it's just that none of them have been good NBA players"
"Not as bad as what Draymond green did with oddbody tweeners, in my opinion"
MVP: luka(bit bold but with some west injuries think mavs have a decent chance at top 4)  MIP: porter jr(going get to score a lot next year)  6MOY: rose(lot of good candidates but ride was huge for ny last year and think that’ll continue.  Lot of good candidates so this is tough)  ROY: Jalen green( like op I don’t know much so just defaulting to someone)  DPOY: draymond(think there will be some voter fatigue with gobert even if he deserves it.  Dray is still very good there and gs will be a better team if klay is relatively good and their defense will be their strength like it was last year)
"I wouldn't say elite defender. More like a very good one. Maybe it looks that way because nobody else wants to defend.  When I think elite defense, it's players like: Draymond Green, AD, Giannis, Gobert, Jrue, etc."
I think they shiuld invite draymond green every time they play the national anthem fergie style
"&gt; That being said, his most NBA-ready offensive attribute is his jump shot. Green continues to display the shooting touch that he displayed as a junior, making over one 3-pointer per game. While his slow, flat-footed release and inconsistent percentages leave something to be desired, when given a chance to set his feet and get a clean shot off, he shows enough potential to lead you to believe he could develop into a solid floor spacer in time.  &gt;  &gt; Unfortunately, Green's defensive deficiencies have become even more pronounced as a senior. At 6'7, he is too small to guard elite post players, and lacks the lateral quickness to defend perimeter players, even face-up power forwards at the NCAA level. While his effort and aggressiveness will never be questioned, it is difficult to project him as an adequate NBA defender at this time.   http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Draymond-Green-5859/"
"&gt;  Listen to your logic: If a player has to take breaks on defense to perform on offense, then he’s not a good defender (he may have good defense skills but he’s not helping the team on the defensive end).  Okay, so rather than refute my arguments, you've moved onto another unrelated and incorrect point.  Here's a fun fact:  FVV scored more points per possession more efficiently after Steph switched off of him.  Here's another fun fact:  Kyle Lowry scored fewer points per possession on lower efficiency when Steph switched onto him.  Steph is not an elite defender, I never made that argument.  But people who argue he's a bad defender don't watch his defense and don't understand how much your brain matters on that end.  &gt;  I’m not saying he’s terrible on defense, but he’s not a top 10 isolation defender just because some metrics rank him top 10.  Actually he's pretty good.  In the history of the finals, no player has ever been targeted as much on switches as Stephen Curry.  And there's a reason for that, it roughs him up and tires him for the other end, it's a strategy that works.  But in isolation in the playoffs (think LeBron and Harden) he actually held them to fewer points per possession on lower efficiency with more turnovers than their averages.  People think because they hunt him that he's a bad defender.  They hunt him so he doesn't drop 40 points in 22 shots on offense.  They hunt him because their other options were Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston etc.  He does particularly well against stronger, taller players because he's stronger than he has any right to be and a low center of gravity relative to them.  People like JR Smith embarrass themselves trying to take advantage of that ""mismatch"".  Does that mean he's going to stop LeBron a meaningful amount?  No, he needs serious helpside to guard a 6'8 monster like LBJ.  But he does a pretty good job of holding his ground until help rotates or steering him into more defenders."
"Every defense first, decent passing big man who can’t score is Draymond Green"

Draymond Green.
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
"Shout-out to Draymond Green who just barely missed the assists list.  He had two games with 19 assists each, and several other double digit assist nights last season.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greendr01/gamelog/2021"
"if Draymond Green is playing center and picks luka up at half court, does that make Luka a center or Draymond a point guard?"
"Yep, if Draymond Green is playing center and picks luka up at half court, does that make Luka a center?  He’s a fkn point guard."
"Draymond is such a high BB IQ guy, coupled with being very articulate. I was wondering if he would consider being a coach in the future, but it looks like he’s already rationalized why he wouldn’t, and it’s a very thoughtful response:  https://fansided.com/2021/04/09/warriors-draymond-green-coaching-future/  &gt; “I think about it, and I don’t think I will,” said Green said on former teammate Kevin Durant’s “The ETCs” podcast. “One — the lack of competitiveness in players bothers me more than anything, and I don’t know how I would handle that as a coach.”  &gt;“When I’m done playing basketball, I don’t know if I want to be on a basketball schedule. I’ve been on a basketball schedule my entire life.”  &gt;“A coach’s schedule — they’re in the gym as much as us, plus a bunch of film, plus this meeting [and] that meeting. Their schedule in some ways is more strenuous than ours.”   I would love to see him be an analyst when he retires. He has a nice mix of bringing thoughtful responses, candor, and fun bluster to a show."
Draymond green.
"Draymond Green for sure, he has definately matured and I love what he does on commentary"
"I’d say Draymond Green,… watching replays of his dirty plays really made it seem like they were all intentional… but overall I did like his play style (hard nose, gritty defender). But what makes me like him more is how he sticks up for other players (regardless of what team they’re on) off the court. His extremely blunt answers to reporters are always fun to watch, and I respect the hell out of it."
"Draymond Green, Ben Simmons"
"I’m a Heat fan but I fucking hate /r/Heat sometimes.  I remember in around 2017-2018 when we were in the dark ages that subreddit got it into it’s mind that Winslow was somehow better than Draymond Green. And cheering on the cursed Winslow at point guard experiment that Spo ran for a while.   I remember people would argue in effect that Winslow was better than Draymond because “He’s a better shooter and defender, while only a marginally worse playmaker.”  The funny thing is that while he obviously isn’t a better defender, he’s not a better shooter either. Winslow had like 2 seasons at 38% but his shot attempt rate was so minuscule that he didn’t really space the floor. Add onto that the fact that his finishing was putrid, his defense was never anything beyond slightly above average and he couldn’t get to, or convert at the line and I’m just not sure this guy should’ve ever gotten consistent starter minutes- injuries or not.  By all accounts he’s a really nice guy, but after all the hype you’d wish he was something more than a poor man’s Solomon Hill."
"About to? Draymond Green has always been, and will always be a sack of fucking shit. Fuck that Donkey ass bitch."
"Still lost, that’s one game,  and Dray shot the ball that game which Simmons won’t. Who would you prefer on offense alone? Draymond Green or Chris Paul? Draymond gets his money because he’s a god tier defensive player and makes good passes on offense. If all he has no defense? Bench player. And on defense, Simmons is the best perimeter defender, Dray can guard 1-5, best Big defender, amazing help defender, and a good rim protector. They just aren’t the same on that end, it’s like comparing Embiid and Curry on offense."
Draymond Green is an nba all star and he is trash on offense.  Ben Wallace would be fine.
yeah but they’re missing their draymond green
"Draymond is not the coach, he's not part of the Golden State front office, and he doesn't work for the NBA. He is a player for a team part of the NBA just like Wiggins. I don't know why people keep trying to put the onus on players to enforce an NBA mandate. This isn't even on some anti-vaccination shit. Draymond would be way the fuck out of line to try to enforce ANYTHING on anyone. He does not have that kind of power. That's why he said it's a personal choice, because it is. Wiggins will have to deal with GS owners/management and the NBA for his decision, not Draymond Green. I'd say the same thing about anyone else out there that doesn't get vaccinated. I don't have to agree with it, I don't have to like it, but it's not my decision in the end. Ya'll need to chill. Trying to become cyber bullies because you don't like someone's answer. Hell, there's plenty of shit I don't like, that's just life though."
Nobody puts themselves higher and above everyone else than Draymond Green
need draymond green to shake the shit out this mf and remind him we won without him
"So i guess Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green and more  aren't phenomenal players."
"Obviously they wouldn’t let Simmons run the offense they would use him like draymond green. A secondary play maker and defender    All this is not going to happen anyway, but if it were it’s not as bad you’re making it out to be. Durant almost beat the warriors with multiple shit offensive players like Andre Roberson and Steven adams clogging up the floor. Harden hard carried teams with zero ball handling and playmaking outside of himself. Simmons would actually fit on a team with players like Durant and harden who can score at will even with cramped spacing"
"Paul George regular season, Draymond Green playoffs"
Draymond Green said in a [TV interview](https://youtu.be/5F0VnzEkark) at the Olympics that he brought a diaper with him to Japan to smell to remind him of his youngest while he can't be home. He did clarify it was a clean diaper. But that's the kind of guy he is.  Guy's kids probably have the sniffles and he wants to be home. It's fine. Nothing to worry about.
"Wiggins, Draymond, and picks for Simmons, Danny Green, salary filler."
"Rookie?  Green was drafted 35th overall in 2012 and by 2015 he was an integral part of the Warriors first championship team.  Simmons was drafted first overall and voted rookie of the year in 2016, and here in 2021 he's all but washed out of the league.  ANY team would take Draymond, nobody wants Simmons. Comparisons between the two are a joke."
Draymond Green is Rodman but substitute the rebounding with passing
I have yet to read about a young guy not liking Draymond Green. He's always talked about as someone who really embraces what it means to be a teammate and how he can help young guys grow.
PatBev and Draymond Green
"Andre Iguodala  Marcus Smart  Seth Curry  Toni Kukoc  Draymond Green if he counts, Shaun Livingston otherwise"
"Draymond is one of my favourite players in the league for all the reasons people have already mentioned but there is a good reason that defensive players will never be considered top 10 without also being good on offence.  Offense is just so much more valuable than defence in basketball, both because of current rules and because of how the sport is. Offence dictates the pace, defence is just reacting for the most part, with defenders literally having their back to the basket the entire time relying on other people calling screens, movement and switching and helping. Offensive players get to see the full court and decide what happens.  1 great offensive player (e.g. Kobe, Curry, Harden, whoever) can go out and get you 60 points by themselves. A great defensive player can't go out and stop 60 points by themselves. When a player can have so much impact on a game as producing a significant portion of a teams points then it's clear why those guys are ranked higher.  &gt; players of his ilk will never be properly valued by the general public.  You are totally right about this though, people really don't understand what it takes to be a good defender let alone an outstanding one like Rodman or Green. I put Ben Simmons in this category too kinda (obviously not on the same level as those guys), because people just love to meme his lack of shooting, ignoring his other offensive qualities (though lacking still) and his excellent defensive capabilities. Rudy Gobert is another good example especially after the recent playoffs and people laughing at ""screen assists"" when in reality that is actually a massively important skill and benefit he adds to his team beyond the boxscore."
Draymond Green was definitely better.
"Want: Fisher, Artest, Chalmers, Battier, Draymond Green, JR Smith, Olynyk  Do not want: Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Terry Rozier, Ezeli, Varejao, Danny Green, Roberson"
"you think that the best use for Joel Embiid is a stretch big? Yeah he *can* shoot and he *will* shoot, but he is most effective down low, first, with the threat of shooting second. This attack is made significantly harder next to players like Ben Simmons or Draymond Green etc. Ben standing in the lane reduces Joel Embiids potential, its not rocket science."
"It's not subtle.  &gt; “Darius Garland actually,” [Draymond] Green said on “Warriors Roundtable” on 95.7 The Game when asked about the toughest players to guard. “And I know that’s probably an unpopular opinion. That kid is so fast, so herky-jerky and he can shoot the ball. When he really figures out how good he truly is. &gt;  &gt; “I hate getting switched onto him. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.”"
Imagine saying Trae's defense was going to be the end of the Simmons/Embiid duo in philly a year ago lol. He has that intimidating presence of Draymond Green.
"True, we don't know that, but he was willing to when Embiid was injured.  It's not even crazy, he's basically Draymond Green lol"
&gt;Why couldn’t he play a Draymond Green type role? He’s not Draymond defensively   You literally answered your own question in the first line of text
"It’s his drive. He plays much bigger than he actually is. You wouldn’t think that he’s 6’5.   Plus he gives it his all on defense. He’s got great footwork and plays with a huge amount of energy.   His offense is an area of improvement. Realistically, he’s going to be similar to Draymond Green, but I think he can be much better.   His potential is through the roof. He won a gold medal at the Olympics and is one of the youngest players to ever be selected to the team. Look at the rest of that roster, it was all established stars and JaVale McGee.   I think we should try and get Caleb Houston next season depending on how he does at Michigan"
Like people here are hoping Draymond Green beats him up like wtf is going on lmfao

Gsw have one of the greatest defenders of all time in draymond green.
"Did you see the 2011 or 2014 Heat? Or the Cavs that lost 3/4 times against the Warriors and needed the Warriors to be injured and for the NBA to intervene with a suspension on Draymond Green for wafting air in the direction of where LeBron's balls would have been if he had any that series just to win the one they did?  If Lebronball was the best basketball could be played, they wouldn't have dropped a game to the first-time-in-the-finals all-the-stars-are-super-young Thunder, and they certainly wouldn't have dropped 3 to the Spurs, and lost as many series Lebron has.  I'm not saying he's not a top 5 all-time player and hasn't been successful, but it's never been *the best that a team could be*."
"I was actually thinking Joker to the Warriors. I’m sure I’m not respecting Draymond’s impact as much as I probably should in commanding the defense but I really think that the system they have in place wouldn’t lose THAT much if you lose Green and add Jokic.   Like I said, he’s very passable and I think he’ll end is prime as a solidly good defender so putting Jokic into the warrior’s system as an okay-good defender, a hall of fame finisher, and playmaker would be much better than a hall of fame defender and great playmaker in Draymond. Again, I’m aware I may not be giving as much gas as I should be to Dray for his defense floor general skills."
"meh, I'd see Steph with a center who is great at defense. You don't need Jokic's passing if you have Draymond Green."
"I forgot about that!  &gt;The league tightened its rules before this season when it comes to matters such as tampering, salary-cap circumvention and free-agency timing -- with one emphasis being the rule prohibiting player-to-player tampering. The fine amount is the maximum the NBA can give before a player can file a grievance, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.  From [this ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29628273/draymond-green-gets-50000-tampering-fine-saying-devin-booker-leave-suns%3fplatform=amp) article, apparently they recently tightened up the rules. I'm curious if they'll hit Embiid here, because I think it's clearly a hypothetical not meant to reflect any real potential moves."
"he will be his Draymond Green version with more mobility and less inside defense.  not perfect, but at this point nobody knows how good Klay will be."
"Ben Simmons was relegated to a Draymond Green role against Toronto and had to almost completely give up the duties he had all season. It works to an extent, but the team had to literally play an entirely different way to be successful. A different way they were not accustomed to. That in itself is a problem."
"Do we really think Simmons will ever be a primary ballhandler on a championship team? I certainly don't. It would be one thing if he was interested in being a Draymond Green type player. Based on what we know he thinks he's a point guard, and he will never succeed in that role in the playoffs when teams can game plan against him in the half court. OG is so much better as a complementary player and Simmons being a slightly better defender doesn't negate that."
"I think so. People constantly bring up that he was #2 in DPOY voting but what does that matter? I'd rather have Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, or AD on defense instead of him. Ben Simmons is obviously a great defender but he is not a top 5 defender."
"Players can care about winning and not want to change their playstyle. Simmons isn't a player I'm a huge fan of but in the absence of Draymond Green or say Kyrie Irving, I'd say he's the perfect 3rd max guy on a GSW or Nets championship team. His shooting hurts the Sixers way too much because of fit. But at this point, acting like it's his responsibility to become the player the Sixers needs despite already being a top 30 player in the league is like asking Gobert to become an elite passer for Utah's sake."
"Lmao the Raptors prob have the worst team.  PG: Tony Parker, Patty Mills  SG: Buddy Hield,   SF: Gerale Wallace, Luc Mbah a Moute  PF: Draymond Green  C: Kevon Looney, Jerome Williams"
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
Facts. For every Draymond Green and Richard Jefferson we get like 10 KPs
"Unless it's something like Cleveland dumping Love's contract, I just don't get why any team would seriously want Simmons.   If you aren't dumping a bad contract yourself, what's the point?  If you are Portland and are going to tank by trading Dame, why would you want Simmons in return?   Read a comment that a team should do for Ben what Milwaukee did for Giannis: Surround a non-shooter with players who can shoot. Which, OK, sounds good. But, that's like saying the Pacers should make the Finals if they just played Myles Turner like Shaq. There's sort of the miles-wide gap of talent. Or like if I had told my son during his second-grade son that he should just dunk like Vince Carter.   Also read that Golden State would be a good option for Simmons. OK, that would be the best possible option I've read, but it also wouldn't work unless Golden State made Draymond part of the trade. Could you imagine Ben and Draymond being on the floor together? Steph and Klay would have no room to operate. As great of a shooter as Steph is, it's often overlooked just how great of a driver/finisher he is. He'd have zero floor space if the opposing team was playing 20 feet of both Green and Simmons. And could you imagine the amount of hate Simmons would get if Green was included in the deal? And, if you think Ben felt stress playing in the playoffs for Philly - which, even as the #1 seed, I find it hard to believe anyone outside of Philly actually thought the team was going to the Finals - imagine him both having to overcome the Green hate and playing for a team where it's Finals or bust."
Hahaha.  Championship level player = refusal to shoot and passing up open dunks.    Draymond green is a championship level player.  Ben simmons is a coward.
Vince Carter  Chris Bosh  Draymond Green
Shaq and Kobe because they can defend. You don't need a Draymond Green.
Improves Philly and could maybe improve Brooklyn (if Ben bought into a Draymond Green-esqe role) but there’s no guarantee that Ben would buy in (he complained to Sixers management when Jimmy Butler was on the team saying that Jimmy had too big of a role)
"""Nah, he would just have them suspended instead"" in reference to the Draymond green kicking incident"
"The obsession with point forwards and passing is what Led to guys like Ben Simmons being overrated for so long.   Generally, the best NBA players are the best scorers, all time and current. The exceptions are very unique guys who are DPOTY level guys with elite passing and rebounding (draymond), and all of that still doesn't put him over Klay who's only a better scorer. Guys like Kawhi are a top 10 scorer and top 5 defender and ranked at a similar position as Luka who is a top 10 scorer but not even a top 50 defender. At least 2 of the best 3 players ever ( Kareem and Jordan) and two  of the 3 best scorers ever. I also would have picked Jalen Green over Cade for the same reasons. The best player right now is KD even with GIannis being better at so many other things. The best scorers are the best players."
"How many times are we doing this stupid argument? You just play him like Draymond Green. Draymond is also bad off ball, but they seem to make it work."
"Its not just ""get this guy a PG"", they need the right team mate. Ben Simmons who can be a shooting option is the best player for their team. But unfortunately, he has not developed that part of his game.  There is no other player in the league who is as good a passer and defender as Ben Simmons. The problem for Ben is that he isnt a shooting threat, if he could be an option like Draymond Green then he would change the whole dynamic of their offence. You cant bring in someone like Damian Lillard and expect the team to be the same  because dame is not the player they need. Someone like Rondo would be perfect but hes on the lakers now."
"Scottie can't run the point, unless you consider the function that Draymond Green serves as ""running the point."""
Not on this sub but a lot of casuals think Draymond Green sucks because he doesn't score
It’s not bullshit it was actually the truth.  Bulls we’re late round team that year and he was one of the options that year.  There’s actual articles on this.  Google exists my dude but here https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/chicago-bulls/grantland-bulls-staff-wanted-draymond-green-2012
Yes because I had Reddit causals telling me draymond  green was a star in another thread smh. I’m done with nba dumbasses fr. Don’t even know the game. Draymond has never been a star. Can’t stress this shit enough. Dude wouldn’t see a day of on air time if he played for the Charlotte hornets.
Adam’s life flashes before his eyes when he saw that ball coming. But then he realized it was lonzo ball passing it and not draymond green
"Dame has not made All-Star squads in the west on multiple occasions. Ben is All-NBA on D but that doesn't necessarily make you an All-star. I am not sure he makes an all-star team in the West many of the seasons he has. To me he is more or less the equivalent of Draymond Green. For instance Marcus Smart has made multiple all-nba defense teams, as has Andre Robertson and Tony Allen. None of those guys are All-stars. You can be all-nba level on D without being an all-star."
I said Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green would be good give me upvotes
"I'm not too surprised, after the top 10-15 it really depends on a few standout players which can skew the stats, 2012 had Draymond Green and Khris Middleton in the early second round and no all-star level players in the late first round.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_NBA_draft"
"&gt;Bucks actually won a title.  Nobody said otherwise, however  If Steph Curry and Draymond Green went down in 2018 and Golden State lost to Cleveland, it would be totally reasonable to proclaim they would have won that series and as a raptor fan you should know  Your team fans were cheering when KD got hurt. The 2019 finals cause even the thought of him healthy spelled trouble for Toronto. So with all due respect, your opinion on this won be taken seriously, and I’ll leave it at."
The following players had a higher 3% than AD last season.   Draymond Green  Robin Lopez  Ben Simmons
"imagine thinking Draymond ""7 ppg"" Green was contributing factor to the the Warriors dynasty.  Almost like players can do important things other than scoring, such as playmaking and defense. Do you watch the games?   No dude, Iggy and Steph have completely different roles, you cant just always say ""well scoring will make up for that"" especially in the playoffs when the game slows down and defense/playmaking get more important."
"it's just my opinion. Whether it's his fault or someone else's I've no idea. But the kd draymond situation, Green needed to be put in his place and he wasn't properly disciplined. Also the dlo signing. He's a pushover on both offense and defense as well as being super brittle. Yes they've won championships, but did he draft steph klay or draymond?  did kd come here because of him? Did he sign Steve kerr? I don't think so. Again he's a nice guy but I don't think he's really done anything impressive. Maybe he doesn't suck but I wouldn't call him a great gm. At best he's Tim Cook to Jerry west’s Steve Jobs."

"Worst: Michael Beasley, Derrick Williams  Best: Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green"
Draymond green star level in 2021-2022? Lol
Ctrl X “Draymond Green”   Ctrl C “Ben Simmons”  Ctrl V “Ben Simmons”
"I really wonder if the ""Draymond isn't a star because he doesn't score"" crowd have ever actually watched a Warriors game where Draymond isn't available, we immediately go from one of the better defensive teams in the league to a confused mess incapable of stopping anyone.   Add in around 9 assists, 7 boards, 1-2 steals and a block per game and it's pretty obvious Draymond Green is extremely valuable."
"Would be a perfect PF. Maybe even small ball 5 for stretches if you want to go all in on offense. He can create for himself and others from anywhere. I could imagine some playmaking like Draymond Green and maybe a bit of Jokic as a cutter, roll man, and a post playmaker.   As a scorer, he could stretch the floor by spotting up or running through screens or as a screener for a pick and pop. His off ball movement was amazing. He can score in the post with his fade away or fakes. His finishing was probably his weakest since he wasn't explosive but he had great touch. He also made up for it with excellent footwork and fighting for position with seals. He could also face up and score however he wanted. One of the best tough shot makers imo."
"I think/hope his next teams plays him at center more. Bruising post centers are nearly a thing of the past, post ups just aren't very efficient. Small ball is here to stay. I think Simmons is a perfect fit for that bill. Great distribution, switchable defender. Properly utilized, he could be similarly effective to a Draymond Green type."
And that’s why edwards popped off towards the end of season when the tank started. If edwards had done it throughout the season he would’ve won ROTY  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edwaran01/splits/2021  Take a look at his month to month splits. He minutes slowly went up. He didn’t even start the first 17 games. He had a much easier route than wiseman who was just thrown into the fire immediately. I don’t know how you look at the two and say edwards had it harder. Wiseman was teaming with draymond green and Stephen curry who day in and day out werent trying to lose so that’s already a lot of pressure being in the starting line up. He had Covid to begin the season and then broke his wrist.
"Warriors are definitely making the play-in, maybe the playoffs, but they’re not going past the first round.  Stephen Curry has shown he is incapable of spearheading a contender without a stacked roster at his side. Zero clutch gene. Couldnt win a single play-in game and got outplayed by Ja Morant lmaoo  He had triple-single Draymond Green who everyone raves about being one of the most “impactful” players in the league and a 20 PPG bucket in Andrew “Gotta do my own Research” Wiggins and he still missed the playoffs….  And this is fresh of a 2020 campaign where he faked an injury (IMO) to sit out the season and the Warriors ended with the worst record in the NBA. He didn’t want to play and have the Warriors miss the playoffs and everyone point to that and say “haha KD carried you, now you a lottery bum”   His G5-G7 of 2016 cemented him as the most phenomenal choker in NBA history. Only more chokes to come! Imagine winning a scoring title and missing the playoffs. That’s some Allen Iverson stuff right there. Now I know why Curry looked up to AI lmao  Also it’s so funny when people act like Warriors made any improvements. Your two rookies are going to be low-impact. Wiseman isn’t taking any jump, hes terrible. Iggy is washed. Klay hasnt played basketball since like Obama was president…But Wilt Chamberlain Jr is somehow going to help propel you guys to contending? Lmao  Warriors 42-40, 9th seed, Miss the playoffs via play-in choke"
"Do you know how many warriors fans were down on jordon Poole? He was statistically the worst player in the league his rookie year. I can pull podcasts of warriors beat writers saying that he will never be a quality nba player. It was hard to root for him even as a homer but he showed us flashes even when he was bad and look at where he is now. Wiseman played 3 college games, zero summer league, zero training camp in his first two years and he was thrown in as the starting center on a team that had playoff hopes. Playing center is hard especially when he needed to be the backbone of that offense. Draymond green didn’t come into the league as an all time defender. Sure he always had the bbiq to get there but if you’ve seen some of his interviews he credits Andrew bogut a lot for helping him get better defensively. Wiseman needs that and he just hasn’t gotten it because of the circumstances. Did it look worrisome when he looked lost defensively last year? Yeah but we have to consider how much basketball experience he actually has and he showed us a pretty polished offensive game for a rookie. Stop with the negative trajectory shit if Jordan Poole has taught as anything"
That stat about Curry without Wiseman is mind boggling. A team with Steph Curry as the #1 option and Draymond Green as the defensive anchor and Wiggins as a second option is a 60 win team and Curry could easily average 35 a game.  Absurd
"Bruh they give an entire paragraph explaining why, what the hell are you talking about?  &gt;We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players.  Nope, not a single mention of why!!!  I just don't understand someone like you who is too lazy to read an article but is still willing to spend time writing out some objectively wrong stupid shit and pressing save."
"Draymond Green is a better shooter than Steph is also an opinion. Doesn't mean it can't be stupid and shouldn't be criticized.  Steph was a huge part of the shift towards 3 point shooting in basketball, we don't need to wait to see that. Lebron was never a part of something like that, but legacy is much more than that, and Curry isn't even close to Lebron."
"I think there’s a level of training and preparation in college that is being underrated in this thread.  Some guys could really benefit from the style of a college coach/program to prepare them for the NBA.   I think one of the better examples of this is Tom Izzo and Michigan State, as much as it pains me to say it as a Buckeye fan.  Lots of MSU players who went under the radar have succeeded because of what he teaches and what the program has to offer.  Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, and Draymond Green come to mind.  Obviously, the Ignite didn’t exist back then.  The program is too new to compare players who went to the Ignite vs college.  But I think that some colleges are better at helping players truly improve than the Ignite.  The Ignite is a lot better for players who are basically locked into the lottery before they even play a game.  That’s cause they already have a lot of talent, they just need to sharpen it.  I think that’s the fundamental difference and what the choice comes down to."
Didn’t Kevin Hart beat Draymond Green in a 3pt shootout?
according to Lakers fans missing Talen Horten-Tucker is totally the same thing as missing Steph Curry and Draymond Green
The list is pretty solid.   Main one I don’t agree with at the moment is draymond  green over ayton. Harden is pretty low too but the top 11 is just so damn stacked
I fucking hate draymond green and I hate agreeing with him even more.
"This has been the real surprised with him in pre season for me, I knew he could pass but thought his limitations as a scorer would mean it would be limited, but his hustle and vision allows him to rack up assists playing with cutters and shooters really quick. Very much Draymond green in that sense."
ESPN front page: “Draymond Green calls Steph Curry a cheater. Is he lashing out because he’s being traded for Ben Simmons?”
Besides I thought it more had to do with how Draymond Green yelled at him and the way the Warriors front office handled it.
"Stein makes 32 selections.  Locks:  * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Kobe Bryant * Stephen Curry * Tim Duncan * Kevin Durant * Kevin Garnett * James Harden * Allen Iverson * LeBron James * Nikola Jokić * Kawhi Leonard * Steve Nash * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Russell Westbrook  Non-locks:  * Ray Allen  * Carmelo Anthony  * Chris Bosh  * Vince Carter  * Alex English  * Pau Gasol  * Manu Ginobili  * Draymond Green  * Kyrie Irving  * Jason Kidd  * Reggie Miller  * Tony Parker  * Chris Paul  * Gary Payton  * Paul Pierce  * Dennis Rodman  * Klay Thompson  Not sure how one can justify picking Klay over McGrady, Dwight, Billups, Dantley, Dumars, AD, or Webber."
"Draymond Green. Maybe some will contest the idea that he's an ""all-time great"", but being arguably the best team defender in NBA history has to be worth something, and he was a 2nd-round pick."
"&gt;Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing.  Dude, I don't know if you know, but Wiseman's family was in poverty before he got a NBA contract. Lavar lives in a mansion in Chino Hills. LaMelo was driving Lamborghinis before he graduated high school. Not only that, Lavar was raking in millions from his business, special appearances, and Facebook exclusive show. When you are struggling to make ends meet, you can't just get up and move to an entirely new country at will.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations.     Two things can be at the same time. I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams. Their front-court was always their biggest issue. When facing players like Embiid, Atyon, Gobert, Valančiūnas, and Jokic, the Warriors simply had no answer for them. That required Curry and Co. to work much harder to score because Draymond and whatever center they had couldn't make a shot past 6 feet. All long as Curry, Thompson, and Green share the floor together, the Warriors will always have championship aspirations. Wiseman needed time to get acclimated to the physicality of the NBA. Like I said before, dude was a high schooler playing against grown men who are more aggressive and physical than him.   Look, we can go back and forth on this, but I am not changing my mind. I support my favorite team and their players through thick and thin. I am more invested in being entertained than stressing out about who is better than who. Hell, Patrick Williams and Tyrese Maxey shocked everyone with how good they were, but I don't see Warriors fans dwelling on passing them up. Wiseman is a good kid and I want him to be successful. I didn't grow up much different than him, so I am rooting for him. If we still have a Reddit account a few years from now, we can get back in touch to see if the Wiseman experience pans out. Hopefully, you won't jump ship in the meantime."
"&gt;When Klay comes back, does Poole move to the bench, or do they move klay to the 3, Wiggins to the 4, and draymond to the 5?  Yes.  [Rotations](https://i.imgur.com/TDkzG8t.png)  [Minutes](https://i.imgur.com/R0mcEh7.png)  Caveats:  * Moody or Iguodala can be inserted into GPII minutes depending on need  * Q2/Q4 Wiseman stints can be given to Bjelica if needed  * Closer games will probably see 2-4 more minutes for Curry, Green, Draymond, and Poole each."
"You see, the problem with being a Jazz fan, and particularly one that appreciates Rudy, is he tends to bring out dumb people who say dumb things.  Rudy was not our problem offensively versus the clippers. Offense in general wasn’t the problem-we scored very efficiently throughout the whole series. The problems that we did have were largely guard related, averaging under 17 assists per game as a team (dead last in the regular season was 21.3) and with Conley out and Mitchell on a bum ankle for the games we did lose we had nobody that was an actual drive threat to punish the clippers lack of rim protection.   Obviously it’d be great if Gobert had Joel Embiid’s post game, but how is that relevant when comparing him to Green? Would Draymond have been able to single handedly punish the clippers for playing small ball? Also the notion that Rudy’s efficiency is a regular season mirage is just dumb- he shot 69.4% against the clips.   Draymonds shooting isn’t really a plus. He can’t shoot well enough to actually force the defense to guard him, and he’s such a poor shooter every shot he does take is a win for the defense. His playmaking is nice, but it’s not worth as much as the combined value of Rudy’s efficiency, screens, offensive rebounding, roll gravity and foul pressure.   Draymond is a great player, don’t get me wrong. But if Green were drafted to the Jazz and Rudy to the warriors, there’d be absolutely nobody who would say Green was the better player."
"To answer this question. Are you saying people in the comment section. You think any version of draymond green prime or now  with Donovan Mitchell is winning 50+ games with first seed in the west like they did last season.    Or Gobert the past 3 seasons with prime warriors isn't winning just as much.   Curry, klay, iggy, kd, gobert. Not winning more?"
"Cunningham - Ceiling: Luka, Floor: better passing version of prime Rudy Gay  Green - Ceiling: Drexler/Kobe without elite defense, Floor: Taller Monte Ellis  Mobley - Ceiling: AD, Floor: Jarret Allen (with better passing) ironically   Barnes: Ceiling: Magic Johnson lite, Floor: Draymond with slightly better shooting and transition play  Suggs - Ceiling: slightly worse Brandon Roy but with better defense, Floor: slightly better shooting version of prime Fat Lever"
"Cade:  * Ceiling: Luka * Floor: Kyle Anderson  Green:  * Ceiling: Kobe * Floor: Jamal Crawford  Mobley:   * Ceiling: KG / Giannis with a jump shot * Floor: Larry Sanders with better offense  Barnes:  * Ceiling: Ben Simmons / Andre Iguodala / more athletic Draymond * Floor: Having some trouble with this one... He's going to be a solid defender no matter what, and he's got point forward skills. Jabari Parker who I saw mentioned in another comment isn't a terrible comparison.  Suggs:  * Ceiling: Deron Williams / not fat Baron Davis * Floor: Rodney Stuckey"
"He’s basically a suped-up Draymond Green (prime Dray minus the shooting), really. When you think about overall impact that’s what he does for your team."
Unbiased but  Cade: Luka  Green: MJ without the defense  Mobley: AD  Barnes: Draymond Green with a jumper/handle  Suggs: Jrue Holiday   Floor  Cade: Kyle Anderson  Green: Malik Monk  Mobley: Jabari Parker with D  Barnes:   Suggs: Cory Joseph
Nah not really. When lebron James and draymond green are saying that vaccine hesitancy is equal to missing games due to wifes pregnancy it's not a racist take. Even though 95% of players are vaccinated majority have expressed vaccine hesitant views.
"That's exactly what I am saying. I think Russ/LeBron and AD fundamentally don't work as a half-court offence. The Lakers with KCP, Dennis and Buddy Hield are a better team IMO and make more sense as a team.  I didn't say AD has to be a playmaker. He's not. He has a good face up and is a great rim runner. Have him do more of that, not less.   AD shot 26% from 3 last season and is 31% of his career. That's worse than Draymond Green. AD's shot dies once he gets outside 15 feet. Having him hang around the permitter to make space for LeBron and Russ to play in the restricted area isn't getting the best out of him.  AD was 4th in the league in post-ups in the Lakers title year. Just behind Jokic. Design an offence where AD posts and face-ups more and rim runs more. Not one where he is standing at the 3 point line. If AD has to take 4, 3s a game, and LeBron is taking 7 a game you have fundamentally failed at team building.  Adding on. Russ is not a good pick and roll point guard for his flashy highlights. .71 PPP as the pick and roll handler last year. That's like Ben Simmons level bad, and it's also in line with his last few seasons. Having AD helps, but if you are expecting Russ/AD to be a much better pick and roll combo than AD/Dennis you are going to be disappointed.  LeBron missed 26 games last year? He is going to ""rest"" for 1/3rd of the season this year?"
"Question from NBA.com’s GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix – 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers – 14%  3. T.J.

DRAYMOND GREEN?????? YO WTF
This is so bad. Draymond green over James harden?
After Kevin Durant the list just gets absurd. Like those top 15-20 players are hard to rank and really I don't care everyone has their own opinion but man after KD this shit is just like the guy was trying to recount players names he can think of. Draymond green over nowitzki? Insane and harden at 60 like another 30 spots after Draymond
This list has Draymond Green at 30. Right above Gary Payton and Dirk . Dwayne Wade at 62 🤣🤣
"Russell Westbrook at 21, Draymond Green at 30 makes me cringe"
It was already terrible but then I saw Draymond Green at 30 and I LOLed right out.
"This list is embarrassing fucking lmao.  I think the pool of players isn't all that bad, but the order is sinful. Draymond Green over Dirk is hilarious"
Draymond Green over AI lol
"This is a lie. The talk was about how great our defense looked in comparison to our regular season effort, and how terrible Bud is as a coach(Giannis minutes etc) and how terrible the bucks were playing, but this was said in the bubble as well, and the year prior when y’all allowed the raptors to steamroll you with 4 wins straight  That did not start with the Nets. Bud and the bucks playing style has been a subject of criticism so stop the cap.   And really, you didn’t prove anything that series outside of beating an injured team **just *barely*** you didn’t overcome anything. You caught a stroke of luck. I’m not knocking the bucks for it. A lot of teams gets lucky and at the end of the day, we know injuries was always a concern  But please stop acting like the Bucks overcame some major obstacle. It took Kyrie being out and Harden being out/rushing back for the Bucks to just barely squeak by in 7 games.   Nets absolutely are significantly better than the Bucks a and you’re an idiot if you disagree. The Bucks escaped that series by the skin of their behinds even with the comical injury luck Brooklyn suffered. They had 3 games of Kyrie Irving and two games of James Harden at like 25% capacity. Give me a break.  And don’t give me that “but muh injury prone players” nonsense. James Harden was an ironman until this recent hamstring and Kyrie Irving’s injury was a freak accident that could’ve happened to anybody.   If Steph Curry and Draymond Green went down in 2018 and Golden State lost to Cleveland, it would be totally reasonable to proclaim the the Warriors would/be champs if healthy . The fact that you’re too fragile to admit it because that would’ve meant another playoff disappointment for your team is irrelevant so again stop the cap and throwing around “bandwagon” I could link you to my Twitter and all my Nets gear collected over the years.   KD played 53 minutes that game 7 and harden was on a injured hamstring and y’all only won by 4 points lol."
Draymond green and Jason Kidd higher than dirk that’s funny asf
NEVER was Draymond Green an MVP candidate 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"It’s absurd, but not even remotely the most egregious part of this.  Hell, Draymond Green is apparently a top 30 NBA player of all time."
"Draymond Green being over Barkley, Iverson, and fucking Dirk ahould tell you all you need to know about this list.  Or the Fact that KG being at 54 when most competent people put him in the top 20"
Draymond Green is better than:  Dirk  Barry  Baylor  Barkley  Iverson  Worthy  Nash  Allen  Gervin  Thomas  Howard  Dumars  Kawhi  KG  Jokic  Lillard  Ewing  Petit  Wade  Harden  Wilkins  Drexler  CP3  McHale  Mutombo
"Agreed. But:  I think we're really really bad at ranking guys who bring most of their value on the defensive end.  I think Draymond is without a doubt one of the five best defenders I've seen, and I've been watching since the '80s. In fact, I think saying ""one of the five best"" might be insulting to him. He's a transformational defender who can guard anyone on-ball, defend the rim, captains a defense as well as it's ever been captained in the era with the most complicated defenses ever, and he has an incredible sense of the moment.   And even though he can't shoot, he's often graded out as a slight positive on offense because of his passing and IQ (and, of course, the impact his defense has on generating transition buckets). Even last year most advanced stats grade him out as merely very slightly below average on offense (although clearly he was exploitable once the team got to the play-in and teams actually started game-planning against him). He's basically been a ceiling-raiser on offense, while he's clearly both a floor and a ceiling-raiser on defense.   I don't know where to rank Draymond Green all-time.   But I will say this: if a player was one of the 2-3 best offensive players the last 30 years, and a league-average defender, we would never, ever, in a thousand years say that they didn't belong in the top 100. The question would be where in the top 20 he belonged, or maybe even the top ten.   Players who might qualify as one of the best offensive players ever and ballpark league average on defense? You'll recognize a lot of these names: Larry. Magic. Dirk. Steph. KD.   It seems absurd comparing Draymond to those guys. You don't need to rake me over the coals for it - I agree with you!   But if we just showed you player's league rank on each side of the ball, and hid which side of the ball was which (e.g., this guy's +6 on one side of the ball, -0.5 on the other) and that was all we had to go on, we'd rank Draymond up there with those guys."
They really rated Draymond Green above Kawhi Leonard...what?
"Imagine putting DRAYMOND GREEN above Dirk Nowitzki (or literally anybody else in this list, he’s nowhere near top 75 of all time)."
Draymond green was never a “star”
"Seems like a list made specifically for controversy. If LeBron made that dunk at tail end of Game 7 of 2016 Finals, maybe Draymond Green would not be included at that list."
Draymond green better than AI?
Draymond Green. Being a role player on a successful team opens u up to more awards. Never above 17.3ppg is pretty much a role player.
"That’s not a better comparison lmao. Draymond Green is not a zero on offense, he’s one of the better passers in the league. On top of that, I’m talking about PRIME IT, the one that was in MVP talks.   All the players you named are all POSITIVES on offense. As great as Draymond is, his peak is considered when? When he could shoot the basketball and was known as a top 20 player.   There are plenty top tier players who are only good at offense. KAT is one, Trae, Luka, Curry, Lavine, even Damian Lillard is literally one of the worst defensive players in the league. All these players are considered slightly below average to flat out garbage.   There’s nobody on these guys level who is only good at defense, and Gobert is the only one who even comes close. He averaged 14. Come on bruh."
"The better comparison is Draymond Green versus Isaiah Thomas. All defense versus all offense. Almost every team in the league would take Green.   Except MJ is lauded because he was a terror on both sides of the court. Dennis Rodman is considered an all time great and averaged over 10 ppg once, at 6'7"". Draymond Green is considered instrumental to GSW's championships, behind only two of the greatest offensive players of all time. Tim Duncan's greatest attribute was his defense and he's considered the best PF all time over Dirk, who was clearly the best offensive option.   There aren't very many top tier only defense players in the league, just like there aren't very many top tier only offense players. Look how Melo gets trashed. KAT is another name that gets a lot of hate for being great offensively and bad defensively."
"Because all star teams are popularity contests? And there are plenty of people that make all nba/all star teams because of defense, for example Gobert last year. Or like Ben Simmons, who averages like a 15/7/7. Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green are all guys that have gotten all nba honors based off of their defense.   Guys like Thybulle and Roberson don't get on their because there are players like them that are also better on offense, i.e. Kawhi/PG13/Butler/CP3. Same reason that guys like Rudy Gay or CJ McCollum or Malcolm Brogdon aren't making it despite having 20+ppg scoring. There are players that do what they do better plus other stuff better"
Draymond Green better than Dirk.  GTFO Nancy.
Draymond Green being a top 30 all time player didn’t immediately send you into fits?
"Is there a different Draymond Green I don’t know about? He’s not even top 30 among current players, much less all time"
BASED list   draymond green &gt; Dirk
"Draymond Green at 30 all time ahead of multiple time mvps, finals mvps is legitimately the worst basketball take i have ever heard"
Draymond Green 2.0
"What if this is now between Wallace, Howard, and Draymond Green?"
Nobody's pro comp should be Draymond Green because he's one of a kind
Scottie's pro comparison is Draymond Green. Prime Draymond Green if he was an average shooter and wasn't able to hide behind 2 of the 3 greatest shooters of all time is a superstar top 5 player.
1. Steph Curry 2. Michael Jordan 3. Jimmy Butler 4. Zach Lavine 5. Draymond Green
"The defense really isn’t worth the extra 4-5 possessions they’d need to outscore Steph and KD.  Where it evens out is LeBron’s more complete control over the floor, captaining offense and defense.  Steph has Draymond Green for that but in this hypothetical 2v2 with unnamed role players completing each team….the role players are the deciding factor.  It really is that close."
"Bro, if you're picking Draymond Green as a wing on an NBA team, you are fucking up. This list needs a formal apology and a retraction."

I got you all beat.... Shawn Marion&gt; Draymond Green
"KD &gt; Steph  Maybe not controversial IRL but definitely controversial on r/nba   I'd even give Steph a slight advantage OFFENSIVELY(slightly worse scorer but a more significantly better playmaker) but I feel like his defense is worse than people tend to think, he just shares all his minutes with Draymond Green so doesn't get exposed  In the play in Ja Morant was targeting him hard and he looked kind of lost on D"
Imagine Draymond Green trying to defend Shaq in the post.  BBQ chicken
Draymond Green for Simmons and 2 first. GS  taking a big risk here.
Draymond “normal person” green
"Summary: players like Draymond Green and CP3 have pushed for a new stat that helps capture the value of the roll man, something not really shown in the normal box score. Thoughts?"
"Agreed and this is why I can't dock KD for the ""he didn't win on his own and Steph did"" thing  Westbrook in the 2012 Finals took more shots than KD with 50% TS to KD's 65%   Imagine if Draymond Green(who has comparable shooting stats to Westbrook, and back then was probably a bit better) took more shots than Steph in the 2015 Finals, what are they winning?  My point is that both KD and Steph are absolute top tier offensive players and scorers, but only one of them played with a guy who simply isn't that but thought he was"

""" stop being a lil bitch "" - Draymond Jamal Green Sr probably"
The league is way better for it. It’s so much more interesting to watch Draymond Green play at center than to watch some 7’2 dinosaur from the 90s post up for 0.8 points per possession
Draymond Green.
Yes Draymond wasn't fully engaged last year like he is now.   Gobery carried an offensive team as the only good defender to a top 5 defense.   It's a season award and he was better then Green. This is not a playoff or multi year award.
And I’m going to stand and say it again: there isn’t a single thing on the court that Ben Simmons does better than Draymond Green.

GP2 just bullied them. He really is a guard version of draymond green
Draymond Green with the Trouble Double
As funny as it sounds I think Ben Simmons would be a great fit there like a Draymond Green. But it would never happen. Their role players are marginally better than the sixers role players so there really isn't a trade there and Ben wouldn't want to be 2nd man to Trae.
"Mark Jackson was playing Draymond Green as a backup small forward lol. Jackson did a lot instilling a culture of defense there, but he was a horrible offensive coach and made a lot of questionable rotation decisions. Kerr completely unlocked the offense and actually knew how to use Draymond in an unprecedented role on both sides of the court"
"I find it hard to see Draymond leaving. The team situation will probably be good with their young guys really coming into their own. And I doubt Draymond gets a better offer elsewhere unless its a poison pill. Then again, a team offering that for a 34 year old Green likely won't be a great team, and I would think a personality like Draymond wants to play on a losing squad just for the money."
"That’s becUse the qualification this year is 93 minutes played for a statistic that is essentially prorating by possession.   Iggy plays bench minutes on a good defensive team, while being a good defender.   Jokic plays the most minutes a game for the Nuggets and the Nuggets are the 2nd ranked defence.   If you took raptor for last year with a 750 minute qualifier.   D-Raptor - 1. Gobert 2. Capela 3. Poeltl 4. Thybulle 5. Turner 6. Embiid  O-Raptor - 1. Curry 2. Jokic 3. Lillard 4. Harden 5. Doncic 6. Kawhi  Total Raptor - 1. Jokic 2. Embiid 3. Gobert 4. Kawhi 5. Conley 6. Curry   Using BPM  DBPM - 1. Nerlens Noel 2. Draymond Green 3. Giannis 4. Jokic 5. Butler 6. Gobert  OBPM - 1. Jokic 2. Curry 3. Lillard 4. Giannis 5. Embiid 6. Harden  BPM - 1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Butler 5. Lebron 6. Embiid   So when looking at both list from last years data there are clear flaws to both list. For the most part they do a decent job, and for something like RAPTOR you can change the qualification of minutes required so if you want to see players that barely played you can, or if you want only the most played players in the league you can.  So if you think RAPTOR is flawed since he is the 7th best defender by the metric this year while being the leading minutes per game playing the 5 on the 2nd ranked defence. But for some reason fail to acknowledge that BPM had him as the 4th best defender last year"
"&gt;Steph had 20 in their win against the Thunder on Saturday and Wiggins and **Greed** had 14 a piece  Draymond ""Ultimate Shield"" Green"
"The takeaway should be Davis's reputation for shooting far exceeds his actual shooting. Draymond Green has a higher career 3 point % than Davis and he is seen as a non-shooter, while Davis is seen as a stretch big. Once you get Davis outside 16 feet his shooting falls off a cliff."
He is one those guys line Draymond Green. Useless with stats but can be impactful when it matters.
Draymond Green has been traded to the Denver Nuggets - Woj
Maybe mobley I guess because of offensive game but draymond green was an all star so I guess anyone can be if they play defence and have narrative on their side
"The thing is that it's muscle memory to not touch the ball so players naturally just watch the ball, it takes them a while to adapt minus Draymond Green"
"Eliminate the take foul! The other day, Draymond Green fouled Ja Morant in transition. Good strategy, but Draymond is an incredible transition defender and Ja Morant is dazzling and unpredictable on the run and I wanted to see it!"
"Compared to Melo he’s still Draymond Green, let’s be real here"
"Successful poly relationships are all about ball movement, spacing, gravity, communication, chemistry, and Draymond Green kicking people in the dick."
"Wow, I'm better at basketball than Draymond Green."
"Smart gotta go lol Hear me out  Yes, he’s right!  But when trying to build around young players you need a certain type of vet. The quiet enforcer or the bought-in vet. The worst scenario is the role player vet who doesn’t understand he’s a role player. Even worse when that vet has personality. Marcus smart isn’t good enough to publicly call out your cornerstones. It may be unfair but that’s how it goes   Young Mike Jordan wasn’t getting publicly called out by *Brad Sellers*  When Bron first got to Cleveland, certain players had to go. Ricky Davis was one. Too outspoken he probably woulda been on some Marcus smart.  Darius miles another. Google Darius miles’ reaction to lebron joining the team. Dude didn’t make it past training camp he was shipped   So yea there’s a certain insulation you do with young players. Bc you DONT split them up. Wing players have been able to do-existent for ages. Tatum and brown will be good they just need a true point guard. That’s literally it.   Draymond green is probably an example of outspoken vet who isn’t as good. He’s the exception. But he’s the only exception. Generally speaking, that formula doesn’t work"

Interesting they are using Draymond Green jersey for Warriors. Is he the bigger star then Steph Curry.
"draymond green shooting 59-60-37 😤  (even if you take out his free throws from the game where he fell on his wrist twice, he'd be only 50% orz)  it's still early, but his 9.3ppg is higher than it's been since 2017-18, so that's something."

Draymond Green ALWAYS uses that phrase. Must be your first time listening to him speak.
"Story of Klay's career. The guy doesn't get called out for a lot of his streaks of mediocre offensive productivity. Obviously he works very hard off ball and is a good defender, but his inability to dribble, finish around the basket and pass make him a liability when his shot is not falling. To me, 2014-2016 version of Curry is still very underrated. The guy was the only on that team that could consistently create his own shot. What made the 15/16 Warriors so lethal in the regular season was Draymond Green was actually hitting all the open threes he gets at a near 40 percent clip."
"the nba &amp; fiba hosted a basketball without borders camp with hall of famers like david robinson out there, amare stoudemire obviously converted &amp; is a pretty big israeli advocate, draymond green did a pr tour with the idf etc  those are obviously their choices to make, so it is what it is. i just don't see israeli advocacy in the nba to be that much of an unlikely thing tbh"

"Stat: ""The only occurrence of a triple-double without points was on February 10, 2017, when Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors) scored only 4 points, but collected 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals against the Memphis Grizzlies.

"No way. That's sooo far from happening.  Look at how people talk about Draymond Green sometimes, like he was just a lucky role player or something.  Alot of people have no defensive mentality at all, the MVP is an offensive award."
"When people make draft day comparisons, they aren’t talking about they are now, that’s silly. He got the Giannis/Simmons/Draymond/Magic comparisons not because he’s going to be that good his rookie year obviously, but because for a 20 year old to have the size and strength he does along with literally being a PG in college and a primary playmaker there, you can see how he can fall into that archetype.  It’s like if I went and made a post saying “Jalen green is averaging 14 points and shooting 34% from the field, why does he get Zach LaVine comparisons?”"

Draymond Green has a QUADRUPLE HALF-DOUBLE without points
"2015, when [this happened](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/video-draymond-green-hits-mike-conley-in-the-injured-face-on-loose-ball/)"
"lmfao you really came back to my comment for this weak shit. Get a life. Green didnt move and just had his arms out, hugged him so Ja wouldn't hit the floor after running into a stationary draymond."
Draymond Green at his best there. GOAT defender.
"I don't think it is with KCP but it can be both an expanded role and playing better for players.  There are players who get a shot to have an expanded roll and they come up big. Julius Randle,  Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler come to mind"
"Draymond Green is becoming the Master of entropy.  Unpredictable at both ends, although defensively it's been fun."
Draymond green might actually be my favorite player - like he’s soooooo fucking good
Draymond Green playmaking shows why Lebron should run Lakers offense and not Westbrook.
Draymond green is fun to watch
Randle with the Draymond Green statline going on
Draymond Green too most likely if Thibs is still there. He lobbied hard to take him but was overruled by management to take Marquise Teague since Rose had just gotten injured.
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"Adding Bjelica as a big man helped their 3pt shooting and spreading the floor. The dude can playmake as well. Iggy coming back has been a revival for the dude. He’s playing a lot better than when he was in Miami. He’s still hitting the occasional 3, he knows the system, and he’s still a decent defender. While GP2 has been phenomenal and definitely better than picking up Avery Bradley. Aside from the dunks, he’s been shooting 3s more consistently. His defense is some of the best in the league right now. Full court press on the ball handler, contesting every shot and helping with rotations, plus playing passing lanes and getting steals with his hops. OPJ is a bit injury prone but has worked well with the Warriors so far. Kuminga is looking like a good wing defender and driver. While he is average from the 3, he is still a rookie and developing. He comes off the bench with a lot of energy and can only get better.  And these are just the additions to the team. The home grown talent like Lee, Poole, and Looney have been showing his stuff as well. Looney has been stepping with his defensive skills and great footwork. Watch the Nets game where he defends Harden if you wanna see his defense. Lee has always been a great bench player than can hit 3s and drive to the rim. Not to mention his chemistry with the team. And Poole has become the second option for the team with his playmaking and shooting 3s. He’s also flourishing in the Kerr motion offense. Even if Klay comes back, Poole is going to be a great asset starting until Klay gets back into the line up or being the leader off the bench.   Then you have Wiggins and Green. Wiggins has been has been emerging in the Warriors system. It just creates so many opportunities for everyone to shoot and play make that it drives defenses crazy. Wiggins looks like a different guy on the Warriors, idk if the culture was bad in Minnesota or he didn’t like the team. But now? He’s a different dude.   And what’s there to say about Draymond Green? He is part of that system and knows when to set screens, pin downs, pick and rolls, when to roll to the basket, handoffs. It’s stuff that doesn’t stuff the stat sheet but is important to the Warriors offense. On defense he is the leader and no one disputes that. He can tell when the other team about to make a switch, where they will shoot, and when to drive. He’s always communicating with his team and he covers for them if they miss an assignment. His game against KD is a masterclass on why he’s one of the best defenders in the league.   But the whole reason they are doing a lot better is the players in the roster understand the Warriors system. They got rid of guys like Paschal and Oubre jr who didn’t really fit the Warriors scheme. You can see now the Warriors team are playing like how they used to in the Strength in Numbers days. Everyone is active on offense: setting screens, pin downs, handing off, freelance running and cutting to the rim. It’s a lot for any defense to cover and it’s why Curry can get open so often."
"Draymond ""Triple-Single"" Green is in shambles. He has competition now."
"Yes it is. You guys got a good one. His confidence and intangibles are astounding for a 19 y/o rookie, and he seems even much better than Green so far.  If you guys just planning to keep on losing, Silas gotta play him more. Hoping that your teenagers like Garuba and Christopher would be included in the rotation also because those two are your franchise' future foundation. Garuba is too good to be benched with that Draymond Green-like defensive potential, just needs to improve the offense. And Jaygup seems good also and has a chance to become a productive two-way player a la Jrue Holiday  Trade CWood in the deadline (preferrably a team who needs a big like Charlotte), move KPJ in sixth-man role, tank for Banchero, and hire a development coach (sort of Kenny Atkinson)"
Draymond Green joins the chat
"That presumes that the other team also makes him the star, builds everything around him, fellates his ego and never, ever criticises him.  Because the second Philly stopped doing that, this shit happened.  Like, imagine Simmons on the Warriors. Draymond Green yells at him one time to lock the fuck in and Simmons pouts his way out of the Bay immediately. Fuck no."
"He is like the draymond green of heat, can run plays and mesh right with jimmy"
"I remember when Draymond said something like that about defense, and the headlines were ""Draymond Green says he's the best defender of all time!"" completely taken out of context cuz he was talking about this, the mentality you have to have, if you have any doubt, you've already lost."
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
"Mostly the fact that Draymond Green was top 10 (if you're really a hater then top 150, but imo top 10) player in the league that year and he's pretty far below that mark now."
"Why? Worst case scenario you get a 25 year old Draymond green, one of the best all around defenders in the league and can be a good secondary playmaker next to Cade. At best you get a young allstar for Jerami grant."
Draymond Green
He’s also shooting 38% from the field and *checks stats again* 28*% from the three. Not really all star numbers unless you’re draymond green
A Draymond Green of our very own? I’ve always wanted a Draymond Green!
"Warriors have positive defenders on the roster. Wiggins, Loney, Green are all positive defenders. The others are willing to play within the system and let Draymond QB it. Lakers have no one who can QB it and they have negative defenders."
"The Basketball HOF will award guys who weren’t exactly great players but had an impact on their era. Like guys like PG, Jimmy Butler, Rondo, Draymond Green weren’t great players but u can’t tell the story of the 2010’s NBA era without them"

Better the knee than the full on kick a la Draymond green lol
Steph Curry will be Draymond Green
Have you heard of Draymond Green
"Injury list: Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre  Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr, Klay, Wiseman.  That's why.  It's good to get him reps right now."
Nobody says draymond green is a super star lmao
Draymond Green  Dude is talked about like he Magic Johnson 2.0.  He is a 8/8/7 guy. He plays great defense.   Triple single threat. Not a superstar by any means.
Out for Golden State  * Steph Curry  * Draymond Green  * Andre Iguodala  * Klay Thompson  * Otto Porter  * James Wiseman
Lmao. Draymond green backpack 3s one of the most deadly moves in the game because he does shit like miss 5 in a row warming up then drops that 3 pointer out of nowhere
Yeah we should use RAPM instead cus it adjusts for lineups. In which case the list is (1000+ minutes):   1. LeBron James 7.66  1. Draymond Green 7.66 	  3. Manu Ginobili 	7.13   4. David Robinson 	5.34   5. Kawhi Leonard  5.02  7. Tim Duncan 	4.71   8. Kevin Durant   4.56   9. Kevin Garnett 	4.56   10. Stephen Curry  4.38   11. James Harden 4.34  Data is only available up to 2019 tho
"People acting like he deserves It. Just wtf. It was an hard foul by Markieff, flagrant 2, fine maybe suspended for one game, but Jokic just CANT do what he has done. You just cant fight on the court when game is stopped, and not in that way and maybe create a serious injury. Draymond Green just kicked Adams on the balls but he didnt anything to answer him, Harden was kinda murdered by Artest, and.... Well idk how much Is worth to you fight Artest but he didnt react after the elbow.  Imo Jokic deserved an harder punishment, if it was Markieff to push Jokic he'd take 10 games out and fines to have injuried him"
I watched draymond green warm up and miss 5 midrange jumpers in a row
"Look at team G.Paul George,Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert."
Good post  Wade is a good one.... George might be another.  Scottie is right on the borderline for me.  He definitely had the defense but he was never a superstart level player on offense (I mean he was good).  Almost like a draymond green (although Pippen was obviously a better scorer)
Draymond “6-8 from 3 in Game 7” Green
"It’s Rudy, and frankly by a pretty decent margin. Gobert’s offense might look awkward and gangly but he’s the most efficient player of all time (by true shooting) by a decent margin and he scores at nearly double the rate Draymond does.   Green does a lot of playmaking for sure, but Rudy also opens up a lot of offense for others with his screens. Every time it gets brought up Jazz fans get mocked, but it’s a very real part of basketball and Gobert’s probably the best in the league at it.   What makes the difference is Gobert averages about 2.5 more ORBs per game, and also is top 5 in the league in fouls drawn, which helps us get into the bonus. And frankly the biggest gap is in spacing. Gobert provides either league best or close to it vertical spacing and is constantly occupying the attention of multiple defenders, which makes the offense easier for everyone else. Green is a PF that’s a 30% career 3pt shooter, and even though he’s learned how to not have that cripple his offense that’s still not ideal for any team’s spacing.   Rudy Gobert is the #1 reason the Jazz have the leagues best offense so far despite being a below average 3 point shooting team so far while being first in 3 point attempt rate."

Draymond Green dropped 32/15/9 in a finals game 7.
"Imagine being Draymond Green, just minding your own business and trying to kick a dude in the dick, and all of a sudden you feel your foot mush up a bunch of fresh poop.  Not cool man. Not cool at all."
"Pretty sure Jokic could win with Klay Thompson, Draymond green, and Kevin Durant. Even in 2015 I feel like he could put up better than 26/5/6 considering it probably would’ve been Tristian Thompson guarding him"
"I saw a thread comparing Andre Drummonds game to Dennis Rodman's and I thought that for the younger audience that didn't get a chance to see him play, this video did a wonderful job showcasing how unbelievable a player he was.  This motherfucker was only 6'6 - 6'7 and had 11 offensive rebounds in game 2 and 6 of the NBA finals(against a freakishly athletic Shawn Kemp in his prime), set several NBA single season rebounding numbers(as well as rebounding percentage in an era where the NBA was played at a slower pace), was a 2x defensive player of the year, could guard everyone on the court(and unlike Draymond Green, and Rodman dealt with larger monsters in the 90's and even held Shaq scoreless in the 2nd half + OT in one of there meetings), and despite his image in the media,  worked as hard or harder than anyone else on the court.  Rodman due to his anxiety and need to keep up his bad boy image, notoriously would spend hours alone by himself late into the evening/following morning after his team had left the gym working out and studying film to not only master defense schemes, but to learn where the offensive rebounds were likely to land based on who was shooting.    This man was a monster on a off the court, but for all you young guys that didn't get a chance to see his game, please don't compare him to Andre Drummond."
"Gotta be honest here, I'm not sure why people are downvoting you.  And I'm wondering if I really am watching a different clip?  Garland CLEARLY has position on Green for the rebound.  Green comes in and pushes Garland in the back and folds him like a sandwich to get the rebound.  Here is the rule stated in the books.  “A player may legally reach all the way over the top of another player and get a rebound. A foul only occurs when the player pushes or holds the player he is reaching over in order to gain advantage.”  Draymond is clearly doing that in the highlight provided.  So why then are people downvoting you like crazy when you're actually correct?  Yes, Draymonds arm got hooked, but not until Garland was eating his knees in the rebound."
"What happens?  It makes every news station, article, website, newspaper, it makes Shaqtin, the NBA.com top 10, Inside the NBA, The Starters even make a comeback special for it, Chuck and Shaq become friends, Metta World Peace changes his name back to Ron Artest, Dwyane Wade returns to basketball citing ""I have now seen it all"", LeBron James retires also citing the same thing. The NBA expands to 32 teams one in Las Vegas, the other. Kevin Durant signs with OKC. David Sterns zombie corpse returns to rule the NBA. Robert Sarver signs DA to a Max extension. The NBA erects netting around the basketball court like indoor beach volleyball and also abolishes the 1 year in college rules and allows players to start at any age they want.

"KD's chief critic: Green, Draymond."
"I mean of course it is almost impossible to determine how much environment plays a part in a players development, especially if you were a secound round pick.   But things like vision and BBIQ are things that i feel are one of the most innate things a player has and least likely to be taught, and these are the things that he exceled in comming in. Observe this scouting report for Draymond back in 2012  &gt; He has a substantial wingspan with a strong frame, and is unafraid to bang with bigger bodies... Terrific rebounder thanks to the combination of an aggressive motor and soft hands … Unselfish and timely passer … Overachiever. High basketball IQ … Makes those around him better, possesses sense of maturity and leadership qualities … [source](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/)  His weakness was he was undersized and tended to get beat by quicker guards. Of course his defensive position got better as he develop in the league, but I feel like most coaching staffs would be able to help him with that And given his high bbiq and great work ethic I feel like most scenios he would have been able to develop to what he is."

"If you are a fan of  Isiah Thomas Piston's bad boys, you can appreciate Draymond Green's plays. Yeah in today's NBA you can say they are ""too physical"" but before that was good defense. Though I do admit watching Green kick nuts was a bit over the top haha."
"I mean, he's first in RAPTOR! You know, the stat that rates Jalen Brunson higher than Kevin Durant offensively, and Buddy Hield higher than Draymond Green defensively.  Advanced stats are great, but are only as good as the formulas behind them. Jokic is a great player, Top 5 right now with room to keep getting better, but the advanced stats  thing MIGHT be overplayed a bit right now."
That Draymond Green slander
Here's another. Yo bro do you KNOW how you got your core pieces. Here's a list for the warriors Wardards.   1. You got beat by lebron in 2016. Everyone saw them as the biggest flop. Draymond green was getting finals mvp.   2. Kevin durant signed with you guys and everyone said you guys are unbeatable again. He won 2 finals mvp for the warriors.   3. He left the warriors in a sign and trade gift because he didn't want to leave you cold which gave you d Angelo Russell.   3A&amp;B -&gt; DLo turns into a trade for Wiggins and the Timberwolves pick. Which gave you Kuminga. Put that all together on how didn't Kevin durant saved the dynasty
"Lol, I am the biggest Draymond Green stan alive. However, everyone has been trash from 3 lately. Steph been carrying hard. It's not dumb to say somebody is carrying the team if it's mostly offense."
"Dammit imagine if Draymond green really did have an opportunity to play against Dennis Rodman, would be wild."
"Draymond Green doesn’t have a max, why do you feel like Simmons should get one?"
"There’s the end to end speed and there’s explosive first step of quick burst of speed I’m not gonna dive deep into who has what too much but   PG: it used to be Rose, Westbrook and Wall. Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it’s still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven’t seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he’s not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."
"At pg, the combination of dribbling and speed, i would go with Steph Curry, Trae Young, Fox,  First Step Spencer Dinwiddie   Impressive ""bigs"" for me are Draymond Green in Fastbreaks and KD    Few years back i will go with Prime Drose first step, Miami Lebron on the fastbreak and slashing mvp Westbrook"
Was really looking forward to watching Draymond Green get dunked on. smh
"Ron Artest - fantastic defender who moves in an awkward fashion when running down the court or making any type of drive. Can post up, iffy shooter (and shot selection).  Kind of like Draymond Green with lesser passing ability but more well-rounded scoring ability."
How the Warriors Got Back to the Top:   Stephen Curry &amp; Draymond Green
You should watch some Draymond Green ISO defense vs KD and you’ll see the difference between a good defender and what AD did last night.
Espn actually compared him to draymond green before the draft lol
You know Jokic was a second rounder? So was Draymond green. Sometimes even nba scouts overlook a dude.
"The thing about DPOY is that players get hyped, I remeber Draymond Green saying before he won it that he gonna talk himself into candidacy, Bron attempted that in 2013 too. Media just dont know too much about defence they run with narratives prompted by players."
Really wish we had a draymond green right now.
People always forget that Draymond Green is a top perimeter defender in addition to being a fantastic interior defender and help defender. The fact that he could do all of these things is the core reason why the Death Lineup and the Hamptons 5 worked (he’s as important to the defense as Steph is to the offense). Give me Draymond every time.
"This is fanboy talk, Draymond Green is a better passer than Steph and he is not even world class at it. Incredible passers are Steve Nash in the SSOL days, Jason Kidd, Magic, Jokic, Larry Legend, prime Rondo from 2010-2012."
"&gt; Do you really think Kobe becomes a scrub if he doesn’t model his game after Jordan? Like, was him modeling his game after Jordan the only reason for his success?   No, of course not. But if we don't assume that he'll still grow up idolizing Jordan and having similar playstyles, there are endless possibilities. He might've trained to become a professional soccer player instead, who knows.  ""Kobe now models his game after Wilt Chamberlain, but because of his height, he no longer gets drafted.""   Regarding Steph or literally any other kids of ex-NBA players, it adds in a layer of uncertainty that is impossible to predict. Maybe Steph or any other 2nd generation NBA player only got into the NBA because of their upbringing.   IMO, the question is asking whether certain skillsets would work better or worse in different eras. For example, Jhalil Okafor's skillset in the 70s would've made more sense. Another one would be: Draymond Green never plays Center in the 90s and doesn't become one of the greatest defensive players of all time. Instead of winning his DPOY award, he just gets awarded with a 1st time all-defense award at the SF/PF slot."
I'd go with:  1. Draymond Green  2. Bam Adebayo  3. Rudy Gobert
"TBH if THT is that good then that's a ""good"" problem for the Lakers. Because the issue was that Westbrook sucks at his role and they don't really have an alternate besides not playing him as much. If they can just plug THT to play and reduce Russ minutes they're fine with Bron and AD.  Plenty of teams have been contenders with wasting salary cap and unsung heroes rising up to the challenge. See Draymond Green/David Lee.   OF course I doubt THT is that good yet."
"I disagree. His stock went down during the playoffs, but it went from budding superstar to Draymond Green. After this whole shit show it went from Draymond Green type of ceiling to “we’ll give you a role player” type of value."
Draymond Green
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Let's stop this biasness towards Curry. Stop comparing two players base off advanced stats.  When every non curry man knows its bs. Rudy gobert better then curry. He finished first seed last year with a higher efg% ? With a higher defensive rating and defensive player of the year ?    &gt;Defensively, Kobe surely was better but playing with O'Neal helped, I think.  Your reaching and kobe has won defensive teams without shaq. And players have said he is the hardest to go up against.    &gt;start thinking that Curry is at the same level as his, at least. He is a whole offensive system on his own, has changed the game  Curry is on the same level. He's an all time great and generational player. No he's not a whole offensive system on his own. Basketball is a team sport. Draymond green facilities or sets high pick screens and curry roll to a side open to shoot off ball.   Same way the triangle offense was ran by kobe and a low post scorer to create spacing for his mid ranges, and cuts.   &gt;No one is being double or tripled teamed with the same consistency  Luca doncic led the nba in double teams last year Also looked it up for you. Curry isn't in top 10 this year in being double teamed. It's just a false impression base off highlights. Ja morant is being doubled the most.   Kobe was getting doubled team the most though and also during pick up games bruh...."
"He’s a big, his floor is somewhere between Ian Mahinmi and Draymond Green"
"Top 5 by minutes, Lakers 2006:      Kobe   Lamar Odom   Smush Parker   Kwame Brown   Chris Mihm       Top 5 by minutes, Warriors 2021:       Steph Curry   Andrew Wiggins   Draymond Green   Kelly Oubre Jr   James Wiseman            just dropping in for comparison"
"Yeah because voters are liberal with the way they vote to get the players the like most on the team.   Are we really calling Thunder KD a big now? Dude was a wing. Even in golden state he was a wing, unless we’re considering Draymond Green a center now?"
Deni is going to be a Kawhi Leonard/Draymond Green level defensive player down the track.  Only in his second season after coming off a broken ankle. His defense is already insanely good. **AND HE’S ONLY 21**
"Bill Russell wouldn't struggle, but he'd be a Draymond Green type of player in today's game. That's nowhere near a perennial MVP."
Draymond Green NOT Rudy Gobert is this generations best defender.

LaMelo would not have this high a value if he was playing alongside Steph Curry and Draymond Green. Maybe his efficiency improves but his counting stats would be worse and teams would look at him as a supporting piece rather than the franchise cornerstone that he looks like in Charlotte.
"I give some much credit to Steph for how well he's been playing, and Iggy being back. thanks heaps to Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins stepping up. Draymond Green gets so much better with more wins and team confidence. it's not a total transformation this team has been shown to be the best. also no one expected 12-2. it's more than just some min contracts and rookie signings"
"Curry is at 18,999 currently and will finish near 20k by the end of the year. He averages about 1,700 points per year. You times that by 7. It would take curry at 40 years old 19 years with no injuries in the future to  pass kobe in scoring.... it's not longevity just kobe is a better scorer.   Curry getting subbed out is because his teams are amazing and torch teams collectively. You even said it.. klay dropping 60 in 3 quarters. Curry didn't have that luxury last year... Kobe was scoring 35ppg with Kwame brown not Andrew Wiggins , kelly oubre Jr, draymond green. Kwame brown.  Plus we all know curry is the greatest shooter, but scorer no."
The decline of Draymond Green has been greatly exaggerated
"No-one's saying Gobert isn't a better rim protector and an elite defender, but Draymond Green drags the entire team to play D and play it well."
"Because you have Steph Curry? Because you don't need a ball-dominant point guard when you run a motion offense and *have Steph Curry*? Because you haven't had a decent true C since Andrew Bogut left?  We don't need Wiseman to be prime Hakeem out there. If he can be *Zaza Pachulia* only without *injuring so many of his teammates* that's enough.  Meanwhile a guy with his physical tools getting mentored by Draymond Green, Kevon ""would be a star if his body didn't betray him"" Looney and Andre Iguodala, now getting coached by the guy who taught Jokic how to play basketball, could be a future franchise centrepiece."
Draymond green is one of the 10-15 best players in the league.
"[Jabari Young (Portland beat writer) straight up forgot him](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/04/24/defensive-player-of-the-year-voter-admits-he-just-forgot-about-draymond-green/)  &gt; When thinking of the candidates, Green’s name just slipped my mind, as Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, Memphis center Marc Gasol, and San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard were the selections made. Once it was discovered Green was forgotten, a change was sought but after selections are submitted, all votes are final."
"&gt;I can buy most of that, but personally don't think having Russ and the pup version of Harden compares to having Prime Shaq, arguably a top 5 all-time player.  Nah, having Westbrook and Harden doesn't compare to having a prime Shaq. You know what it does compare to tho? I'd probably say that it's even better than having a prime Shaq. Having the only unanimous MVP in NBA history Steph Curry who had just had the best offensive season of all-time better than peak Shaq , DPOY Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Iggy. Why are we pretending like Kobe having a Prime Shaq is at all comparable to KD joining the best team in NBA history?   Kobe with just Pau Gasol accomplished as much as the KD warriors did. Having Westbrook and Harden, hell just having Westbrook by himself is probably better than having a Pau Gasol. Let's not pretend like KD has had it worse than Kobe when it comes to teams."
When Demon Overlord Steph Wardell Curry and his Great General Draymond Backpack Green are already dad dicking the Hero's army and here's another Great General Klay Toaster Thompson about to join the one sided beatdown.
"Ya, but this was big news during the season and when Durant left in the off-season.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/13/18091804/kevin-durant-draymond-green-argument-beef-warriors-clippers-stephen-curry-injury"
"Shoutout to Draymond for his D on Durant. Of all people able of defending KD, there's only a handful I'd trust the job to try to contain this behemoth. Green one of them."
Draymond Green
"Draymond ""Kevin Durant"" Green over Kevin ""LeBron James"" Durant"
Draymond 'Steph Curry' Green
Somewhere. Its not his fault.  Had he played with the bulls Theyd say he was 1 of the greats. Same with draymond green. Hes decent. Kerr with the bulls? Decent. Pippen is the real test. He only won with Jordan but he was elite. Its hard to say. The nba is like that. Without pip jordan may not have won those titles.
"We talked about Green - Ayton - Booker. Wouldn't work.  Then he said ""Warriors with Iggy + Draymond + a center"". The Warriors played small ball and used Green as a Center. The year Bogut worked as a center, Draymond shot 39% from deep. Every other year he's shooting 30 to 33%.  Iggy + Draymond + a Center would be like Booker + Draymond + a Center. Both are bad, there's not enough shooting.  Y'all have Draymond in your mind as someone who can shoot. 31% on wide open threes is Giannis level of shooting, dunno wtf you talking about"
Prime Draymond Green getting no respect we are talking a guy 32-14-9-2 with 6 3s game 7 nba final type. Blake griffin wouldn’t dream of posting this stat line while playing dpoy defense.  I get it Blake can dunk and I see an argument for him getting better all around in Detroit but the fact of the matter is we watched these two go at it for years and the Warriors sonned the clippers as soon as they started integrating Draymond.
"&gt; In impact entries that take on and off court splits in addition to box scores stats into account he was top 5 in the the postseason from 2015-19.  Can you share any non-cumulative ones of these so we can look over them to see if that's measuring how valuable Draymond is as a singular player, compared to his value compared to the player replacing him in the Warriors scheme?   &gt; ""aNd NevEr HaS bEeN"" it was literally the most valuable skill in the league for 30 years. You know one player won 11 rings off the back off of his defence.  Which 30 years were those? Because defense was, uh, not particularly existent in the 50s and 60s. Even when you're speaking of Bill Russell and those Celtics teams, they were constantly at the top of the league in PPG and played at the highest pace in the 60s. The only reason why they didn't have the #1 ORTG every season was because of that insane pace leading to, well, more questionable shots than usual. Even by those standards.  You could make the argument that it was their defense that allowed them to have such a high scoring offense I suppose but that's pretty cyclical. I mean look at the 63 East Finals against a lousy defensive team in the Royals.   Game 1: **Royals 135** Celtics 132  Game 2: **Celtics 125** Royals 102  Game 3:** Royals 121** Celtics 116 Game 4:** Celtics 128** Royals 110  Game 5: **Celtics 125** Royals 120  Game 6: **Royals 109** Celtics 99  Game 7: **Celtics 142** Royals: 131   Or what about the 66 Finals vs. the Lakers?   Game 1:** Lakers 133** Celtics 129  Game 2: **Celtics 129** Lakers 109  Game 3: **Celtics 120** Lakers 106  Game 4: **Celtics 122** Lakers 117  Game 5: **Lakers 121** Celtics 117  Game 6: **Lakers 123** Celtics 115  Game 7: **Celtics 95** Lakers 93  Russell, Havlicek, and Sam averaged 23 a piece, West and Baylor averaged 34 and 25 respectively. I implore you to go watch some tape from the 50s and 60s and try to come away with the opinion that defense was the premier skill and reason for winning back then. Hell I'd say stamina was more of a factor for winning then than defense, considering it was just a track meet up and down the court every game.  &gt; Draymond performed like a low level MVP candidate in his prime  He has only had votes casted for him one time in his entire career. That was the 15-16 record season setting where he came in 7th and his teammate, Steph Curry, was the unanimous MVP. Because Mike Fratello and John Denton had him aas their #2 MVP. Denton who had Avery Bradley as his #2 in DPOY voting, case the sole 6th man vote for...Allen Crabbe... Fratello who had LMA and Pau Gasol on his All-NBA 1st team. Cmon now. Even Draymond said in an interview he couldn't believe he got those two votes.  You are conflating the value that Draymond receives from being on some of the greatest teams of all time compared to his actual standalone value. No doubt he is a big part of those teams, but to suggest his standalone value as a player is anywhere near the quality of an MVP is past even the most fervent of fandom takes. I like Draymond as a player, a lot. He does truly unique things. If you put him on any other team besides the Warriors his value drops off a cliff. If you put any other ""MVP"" players on a different team, ever, their value does not change much.   You would have to suggest that Draymond is account for 20+ points negated on defense alone to have the same standalone impact as an MVP caliber player, which would be by far the most of all time by lightyears.  By every single defensive metric you're going to find, Rudy Gobert is a more impactful defender than Draymond Green. In fact Gobert has a number of the best defensive seasons of all time. Rudy had the highest DRAPTOR rating of all time last year at +8 going back to 77. The highest DRPM since 1996. #1 and #3 DEPM seasons since 04. DLEBRON says he has the #1 and #4 best defensive seasons of all time. He has the single season record for most team points allowed since 06-07.   This was all last season.  So by every ""impact"" and ""performance"" metric there is, the solid ones or as solid as you can be since defensive metrics are kinda meh, Gobert is a vastly superior defender than Draymond, and last season might have been the best defensive season of all time. Did you feel like he was an MVP candidate? Was he even a low-level candidate? Probably not something you had ever considered and you might not consider it right now either.   &gt; AD is no doubt a better scorer but most most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let's not undersell that first point.   Draymond's best scoring season was on the 73 win warriors where he scored 14 points a game on 49/39/68. Excluding this season he would never average over 45% from the floor again or over 30% from 3 again. Nor did he before that. No doubt Draymond is a better passer, that's part of his role in that offense because he cannot score at an NBA level. He averages 5 more assists a game than AD for his career.  AD is not used as a passer even if he is better than we think because he is an elite scorer. He is the guy people like Draymond pass the ball to. He is on a streak of 9 straight 20+ ppg seasons. 7 of which are over 24 points. 4 of which are over 26. 2 of which are over 28. Obviously on much better efficiency than Draymond from every shooting location that is tracked. He's not just a better scorer. Most years he double or triples Draymond's scoring.   Even considering Draymond's elite positional passing and being on historic offenses he only cracks the top 20 of OWS once. That 15-16 outlier season for him where he was 10th. AD is top 20 6 times, and top 5 4 times.   Draymond has never been top 20 in OBPM. Anthony Davis has not only been top 20 6 times but he is 14th overall in NBA history by that measure.  The levels of value on offense that AD is greater than Draymond, even when Draymond sits on these historic offensive teams that are the absolute perfect positions for him imaginable in all of NBA history, are staggering. They cannot even be mentioned in the same breath. Draymond is like if you fused a non-rebounding Dennis Rodman with a non-scoring Andre Miller. AD is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.   &gt; most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let me make it clear. I don't care about championships in this discussion, nor do I think it's particularly relevant when assessing the individual talent of players. Especially in this case however, because there is no case that Draymond is a #1, 2, or 3 offensive option on his team--so there isn't a discussion to be had like Jokic vs. AD wherein you can suggest Jokic is that extra level better because he's a true all game #1 option that leads to winning.   As Gilbert Arenas said in regards to the 75th Anni List redo he did, ""Championships are the cherry on top of the sundae, stats, all-nbas, all-stars, individual achievements are the sundae. Championships are just this extra thing on top of that to be a tie breaker or a nudge over the edge.""   So while AD did go crazy in the bubble, and conspiratorial as it may be I think that he and the Lakers got some serious help from the refs, it's not like it was some outlier among outliers like Draymond 15-16 season. Certainly his bubble run (28/10/3.5/1/1.5 on 57/38[3 attempts]/73) was better than his other playoff seasons (31/11/2/1/3 on 54/00/89 and 31/13/2/2/2 on 52/27[2 attempts]/83) shows he is still an elite playoff performer. In fact when you account for the fact he was on wildly worse teams than that LA team in 15 and 18 where teams could double and swarm him all game, compared to a Lakers team with LeBron and shooters, and the fact that most shooters got hot in that bubble, it's even less of a staggering outlier.  As far as being effective as a scorer in isolation in 19-20 AD was in the 71st percentile for isolation scorers. Not elite but certainly not ineffective. That was better than players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and around the same as Jason Tatum and CP3.   As you can imagine Draymond is in the no-percentile on that because they would never isolate Draymond. Additionally playmaking is more than assists, which Draymond is an elite passer especially for his position but he is not a good playmaker.   Playmaking is not passing, that's just one component of it. Playmaking comes from being a threat to get places on the court to score or pass.  The more of those places and the more ways you can do that, the better a playmaker you are. The play part of playmaking is there for a reason, and there are many more plays than a pass. Otherwise we'd call it a passmaker. Draymond isn't a threat to score, he isn't a threat for the defense to collapse in on, his passing comes from passing to people off screens or when the defense makes a mistake because his IQ is great. It also comes from his elite 2 man game with Curry, the best shooter of all time who is going to convert a lot of those assists. But a playmaker he is not.   &gt; Its the same with Giannis and Embiid as well. Their scoring is brilliant but their value in the postseason comes from their standout defence.  No. It comes from both. I don't even really understand how you can come to the conclusion that their value in the postseason comes from their standout defense more than their scoring, let alone the sole value.

"It would be even cooler if KD's true identity was a secret to the Warriors.  Masked MVP caliber player: ""Steve Kerr never told you what happened to Kevin Durant""  Draymond Green: ""He told me enough. He told me you killed him.""  Masked MVP caliber player: ""No. I AM Kevin Durant!"""
I'm a Warriors fan. Not specifically a Draymond Green fan. I want Warriors to succeed.
You're a Warriors fan and you'd trade Draymond Green?  After all he's done for us?  Bandwagon fans have no respect.
Draymond Green.
"Honestly, seems like a bunch of excuses. ""Ricky Rubio induced psychosis"" is a dead give away. How many other players had Ricky fucking Rubio induced psychosis to? If it was like Draymond Green, I would get it but Rubio?? Sounds like excuses."
Draymond Green looks like he attends Men's Rights groups
**“I’m back’”**  – *Draymond Green*
I think a foul was called on Draymond for a foul on Lillard. Green thought he didn’t foul him.
Draymond Green getting a technical? That is a cool drink of water for me
"KD joined the 73-9 team that slapped his ass because he couldn't beat Lebron or the Warriors without being a bitch as Draymond Green said. You're still tripping man, Bron won a ring while Kyrie didn't even get past the 2nd round. Truth still hurts you little man"
"I think most of the players on your team last year are better than the warriors players this year. green has only played 18 minutes in the first 5 games, so I’d basically ignore him.  Wiseman looks really good for a rookie, but is not a “good” player yet. Even with noticeable and obnoxious flaws, white side has a better impact than wiseman.  Same thing with paschall. It’s very rare for a 1st or 2nd year player to actually help their team, and if they do they’re the ones getting votes for regular awards, not just rookie awards.  If you told a team they could have any player for 1 year and had to play them 30mpg if they take him, but couldn’t take curry or draymond, who would be consistently chosen?"
PG: Gilbert Arenas  SG: Kobe Bryant  SF: LeBron James  PF: Draymond Green  C: Hamed Haddadi  6th man: Josh Hart  Head Coach: Scott Brooks  This could work under the cap if the timings with bird rights were on.
"He's 5 feet from the rim and he never once tries to shoot it.  Two years ago Draymond green couldn't stop this guy, now 1st option Siakam cant get off a shot against guards and we are talking about hey they are actually pretty good defenders.  It's just depressing seeing what happened to him. This has nothing to do with the level of defense he's getting"
"In the championship run he was getting guarded by Jonathon Isaac, Joel Embiid  / Ben Simmons, Giannis and Draymond Green.  People act like he never saw a double in 2018-19 and Kawhi somehow made his shots super easy. In 2018-19 he would run hard in transition, but he also had a great touch around the rim, had an amazing shot from the corner, could rebound aggressively and could call his own number in the post. He had ball fakes, spin moves, up and unders and had such a great feel for the glass that anytime the ball would touch the glass it was going in.  I'm not saying he's not getting any more defensive attention, but that's like, 15-20% max of what's the issue. He's still getting open corner looks from three, his role change shouldn't suddenly change the result of those"
Past peak draymond green but his jumpshot is actually hitting at a average rate
"This is just Draymond Green, and you won’t trade him for Harden?"
"I like Draymond Green a lot but Dennis Rodman is one of the greatest defenders and rebounders of all-time.   I've seen some here question the importance of rebounding in today's game but I find that it's still incredibly critical to a team's success, particularly on the offensive glass. Rodman, at least when his head was screwed on straighter (i.e. a good portion of his Detroit years) was amazers.   With Rodman, you'd get someone who'd x-out your opponent's best player, someone who was going to fill every lane he could in the open floor, someone who was liable to emerge from the weakside for an impressive block (or a charge, if necessary), and someone who ate offensive rebounds for breakfast, constantly providing precious additional possessions for his own team while limiting his opponents to a single shot.   It's tough to turn away from a guy like that.   That said, if the question was more about finding a team leader, a guy who could serve as player 1A, that's not going to be Rodman. But assuming you have a team of already semi-competent players, Rodman's going to be an incredibly valuable addition to just about any team."
Warriors' Draymond Green still struggling with no longer being good.
Draymond Green would be great on the Nets. I was wrong about LeVert so far. LeVert has been disappointing.   As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather have Draymond Green than Wardell Stephen Curry II on the Nets. The Warriors need to free Draymond Green from that garbage team.
Am I crazy to think that Simmons is more like an athletic Draymond Green?
"Kind of reminds me of Noah, Rasheed Wallace, or Draymond Green. Like you hate them cause they're on opposing teams and you know they're going to be a pain in the ass and trolling, but you'd love for them to be on your team. Same thing here, nothing more. Seeing him every game, the dude has an absolute motor."
"And trying to not be too blinded by homerism but he is showing shades of pj Tucker and draymond green.  Woods looks like an all star  John wall looks. Like great feel good story being away for two years.  Very fun team to watch, great job Silas and stone making the best inspite of an ass owner and your first year one fo the best players wants out bc of that guy and you gotta work around it. Nice change of events to be looking forward to this gritty team"
"Warriors will probably end up tanking this season for a top 5 pick, and try to nab one of Cade/Suggs/Jalen Green.  The Wolves pick likely ends up in the lottery.  Next year's roster could realistically look like:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman  Suggs, Kispert, Oubre, Paschall + some randos  That takes the team from 1 shotmaker to 4 instantly, with 2 players who can handle the ball / iso when needed.  This team can compete while not sacrificing the future either.  Warriors can have their cake and eat it too.  I actually love how the team is positioned going forward, it's far from doom and gloom."
"1.6 STL, 1 BLK, 6.4 REB, 8.4 PTS..    he just need to learn how to pass and you get yourself another draymond green."
"Yes, Game 2.  &gt; Stephen Curry missed an NBA Finals-record 13 3-point field goals (courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau) in Game 2, in large part thanks to Dellavedova's defense. Curry was 0-for-8 when guarded by Dellavedova on Sunday, including 0-for-5 from 3-point range, his worst shooting performance against a defender in any game this postseason.  &gt; Overall, Dellavedova held the Warriors to 3-for-15 shooting, including 0-for-6 from 3-point range, and forced six turnovers as a primary defender in Game 2. That's the most turnovers forced by a Cavaliers player in a game this postseason, and only Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton have forced more turnovers as the primary defender in any game this postseason.  &gt; In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Warriors shot 1-for-6 from the field and turned the ball over three times with Dellavedova as the primary defender; the Warriors shot 8-for-18 and turned it over once when guarded by anyone else in the half court over that same span.  &gt; Although this number is expected to be high since he was guarding Curry, it’s worth pointing out that Dellavedova contested 11 shots in Game 2, more than any other Cavaliers player.  [Shut. Down.](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0608%2FFSNBAFINALSDellavedovadefense.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg)  And they 100% don't win if Kyrie and Love aren't injured."
"Let's say that's their plan, to rebuild around Wiseman plus whomever they get in the lottery from their own pick and Minnesota's pick this year. When exactly would those guys be ready to contribute to a winning team? The reason I ask is because Steph is about to turn 33, Klay is coming off back to back career-altering injuries and will be close to turning 32 by the time he plays a game again, and Draymond Green has looked washed for a year now and he's about to turn 31.   If the Warriors really plan to build for the future around their picks, then they probably should be looking to ""blow it up"" and see what they can get for Steph and Draymond while they still have value. I'm assuming Klay is a hugely negative trade value asset right now because of his contract and injuries. It's also quite possible Draymond is as well (cause he's owed $100 million over the next 4 years), but maybe someone would give up something for him on the hopes that he's playing so poorly cause he's disinterested because the team stinks rather than because he's just washed."
“Get my man out of GSW”- Donkey face Draymond Green
"who would you rather have, 2016-17 draymond green, who averaged 10.2 points, or 2019-20 Kevin Heurter, who averaged 12.2 points?"
"That’s probably true. I don’t think that Curry’s on-ball PnR game is any better than Lillard’s. And the blazers haven’t generally had a lot of good passers.  However, Curry’s offball shooting is much better than Lillard’s and that’s why I don’t think Lillard could have won 3 rings. Curry with players who can find him and get him the ball is a top 5 player, whereas he’s maybe just top 15 without those players. Lillard is top 15 always but I don’t think he improves as much as Curry by playing on a team with players like Iguodala, Bogut, and Draymond Green."
"&gt; But the rebuild is gonna take longer than Steph has to wait.   There is no reason to trade Steph, or Klay, or Draymond.  None.  You rebuild with them on your team.  Why?  Look at the phoenix suns.  How did they go from a good, young nucleus of talent to translating that into wins?  There are other teams, like the Timberwolves, the Bulls, the Pelicans, and etc. that have good, young nucleuses that have not been able to translate that talent into wins and losses.  Why?    The biggest difference I see on the Suns is Chris Paul.  The Suns were a good story in the bubble, but they are a good team right now.  Bringing in Chris Paul, a guy who knows what to do and where to be to win close games, and who has played in and won many close games in his career, is having a big effect on the suns.    Young players need mentors, and not from coaches all the time.  Locker room leadership is a real thing.  The wolves have tons of talent, and they can't win.  Why?  The Bulls do, why?  There's no adult in the locker room.  The Bulls starting lineup is younger than the University of Wisconsin's starting lineup.  That doesn't work.    These young players keep going down this path, they will pick up bad habits that they will not be able to break out of even later in their careers.  At a point, a player's career hardens, and you are what you are.  For most normal people, that switch happens at age 24 (according to behavioral psychology).  It is absolutely crucial that you get good mentorship before the age of 24, or you're sunk.    Now, look at the Spurs.  They never had a plethora of top 10 draft picks.  After Duncan, Genobili and Parker, they had one top prospect for a period of about 20 years: Kawhi Leonard.  One top prospect was enough.  Why?  Because Kawhi had the fortune of starting his career in a place with absolutely the strongest locker room ever, he was surrounded by guys with championship rings.  He was a young rookie who learned to do it the right way.  The reason why the Spurs must rebuild now is because they've lost that locker room.    Having that veteran locker room, of players who have won rings in the past, can massively increase the probability that your draft picks pan out and become stars.    The best argument for NOT trading Curry, Thompson or Green is James Wiseman.  Do you want to give him the BEST chance to harness all of that freakish natural talent he has into becoming a generational talent?    Let him learn the RIGHT habits when he's 19 years old, from Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Kevon Looney.  Let him learn from 4 other players in the same locker room who have 11 championship rings between them.    You want to maximize the chances that those two top 20 overall selections in a loaded draft the warriors will have in the summer of 2021 pan out into terrific, foundational players?  Give them the right MENTORS early in their careers.    Most of us, in this life, never had a mentor when we were young, so our lives become a series of distractions and we spend much of our existence running in place, always trying hard, without ever getting anywhere.  That's due to our habits.  Young players learn by mimicking the habits of their older peers.  If you have a locker room full of young players who care about their social media standing and their brand, guess what those young players will pick up on?  If you have one dedicated to being unselfish and to winning, guess how those young players will grow up?    If the objective is to get the warriors back to contention as quickly as possible, trading Steph, Klay, and Draymond is about the worst thing you could do.    Meyers did the right thing in 2019, he kept the four foundational locker room players, and swapped out everyone else."
"OP is not paying attention.  What do you think Meyers did in the summer of 2019?  He blew it up.  They are in the process of rebuilding right now, that's why the team doesn't look that great, they're rebuilding.    Look at the summer of 2019 again, carefully.  Look at the all the players who were on the roster for the 2019 finals.  Do you know how many of them suited up for GS a few months later for the start of the 2019-20 season?    Four.  Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevon Looney.  That was the carry-over.  Meyers BLEW IT UP in the summer of 2019.  What OP is calling for, Meyers ALREADY DID."
"Dude was down 3-2 without love or Kyrie and still won the ECF. Seriously dude, his starting lineup in **game 7 of the ECF** was JR, George Hill, Jeff Green, and TT  If LeBron can make the finals with that, curry should be able to make the damn playoffs lol  Oubre was averaging 17 a game last season,  wiggins was at 22, he's still got Draymond, etc. People are making the players seem worse to fit the results    Is it a good roster? No. Is it bottom of the barrel only better than the Knicks like OP said? Hellll no."
"I think it’s definitely real. Put draymond green or Klay Thompson on a bad team they won’t win a lot more games than they did before, but they can be the pieces that pushes a team to championship caliber. Put Westbrook on a bad team you expect them to have a shot at the playoffs, but you also don’t think Russ is the piece a team needs to win the championship"
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
"Fuck it, throw S. Curry (either one) and hope for the offensive fouls.   Draymond Green to bait him into techs maybe?  You aren’t stoping prime Shaq with a one on one defender since team defense is the main way to slow him down"
sorry dude. you have a poor recollection of what the warriors were back then if you even followed them at all which you probably didn't based on your factually inaccurate statements. the reference to david lee's defense is from the MIT Sloan conference on analytics. iguodala wasn't even on the team in 12-13 and draymond green wasn't a starter until 14-15.
Draymond Green was 2nd most valuable player on defense before KD arrived. Once KD arrived he just change the dynamics of the team. Warriors might regret extending Draymond Green in basketball sense for their cap.
"They've got plenty to choose from. The elephant in the room is the Wiggins contract, but Draymond Green is also well compensated, and even though I imagine the Warriors front office will show loyalty to their guys, Klay Thompson also makes loads of money. Oubre is an expiring $14 million contract so he's the easiest to move."
"You had the nerve to criticize David Lee, his all star teammate in on of those season, as the worst defender on a team led by Steph Curry, whom the Warriors go out of their way to hide him on defense by giving him elite defenders like Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodola and Draymond Green. Let's not forget back then they were 10 deep off the bench. You're delusional in your recount of things."
"&gt;Just need Steph to shoot 40%+ from 3 instead of 32,  That's about one additional make, per game.  And the Warriors are currently losing by about 18 per game.  &gt;Draymond to shoot better than 40% from the field  Green is a career 43% shooter.  So that's not likely to happen, nor matter if it does, since Green doesn't shoot that much."
"Not Draymond.  Seriously, I get it ""he's a dog"" ""he's the engine"" blah blah... dudes straight up not good especially on his albatross contract.  He's great when he's surrounded by INCREDIBLE players (he was literally with 3 hall of famers).  But throw him on a team like the Hornets and I don't know if he adds more than 3 wins to their season. Dudes straight up dog water but no ones ready to have that discussion because ""he's the DRIVE on the team -- tHe HEaRt oF ThE TeAm""   The answer is Zion, then porzingis, probably Demar after that then Millsap, and some mix of Covington Crowder Green Morris."
"probably im not to knowledgeable on how salary for trades work, but a trade of james wiseman kelly Kelly Oubre draymond green  and a couple of picks could probably get it done"
"Are you surprised? Draymond green is a triple single machine, on a good night hes giving you 7/8/5, plus he hasn't played in a year this is pretty much exactly what I expected"
I'm starting to get really annoyed with people pretending that a team that has Draymond Green and Steph Curry on it is somehow the worst team in modern NBA history.
"Nope.   Waiters, McHee, and JR are literal dogshit. Rondo was in the regular season too. Bradley skipped the bubble.  Green, Kuzma, and Dwight are FAR worse than Draymond, Iggy, Barnes, Livingston, Barbosa, etc. It’s not even remotely close"
Everyone of the players mentioned needed help to reach the top(some didn't).  TBH I don't get it. Curry wasn't doing good early in his career (injuries and whatnot). Warriors started to be Good when everyone else reached their potential (klay &amp; Draymond).  Kawhi - he had 3 future hall of famers with the Spurs. He had lowry with the Raptors and Danny Green shooting lights out.  Harden - Have yet to return to finals since his OKC days.  But in the end is personal preference
"Iggy is Iguodala for your information, i didnt forget Draymond he is part of the big 3, im talking about the role players obviously, and no, im literally citing the rosters of the 2 teams.  There is no way, you can say that, Howards, Kcp, Rondo, Kuzma, JrSmith, Bradley, Mcgee, Danny Green, Dion Waiters arent combined better Draymond, Iggy, Livingston, Barbosa, Clark, Bogut, Ezeli, Barnes, the ""deepness"" of that Warriors team was literally only Iggy and Shaun lol"
People really thought Draymond Green was gonna get the warriors to the playoffs.
^draymond ^green
"&gt; a good example of how pro athletes are the exact opposite of the classic ""dumb jock"" stereotype; we have to give credit where credit is due. draymond is the perfect testament to that  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-defends-kyrie-irving-earth-may-be-flat"
"I'm sorry, were the Cavs responsible for Draymond accumulating 3 flagrant foul points before the NBA Finals? Draymond Green was literally kicking people in the nuts in order to create space for himself and then claiming it was a natural basketball motion. He was a dirty piece of sh!t. Furthermore, Draymond Green intentionally took a swipe at another player's groin. That's a flagrant foul every day and twice on Sunday."
"Draymond green, Rudy Gobert. Isaiah Thomas (small one)  Edit: [one of draymond comps was Jared Dudley lol](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/)"
Draymond Green
"Great content man !! As a big Draymond Green fan, I just love to see people doing videos on defensive schemes !! Keep it up !"
"KD is useless in the playoffs without 2 time MVP steph curry right next to him, along with all stars klay thompson and draymond green."
so why doesnt that apply to Anthony davis. he made the second round in the west without a 2nd star.   Curry has draymond green and some decent pieces around him. according to this sub he should make the WCF or hes not really that good.
Hell no. You don't waste a year of prime Stephen Curry and Draymond Green for a *chance* at Cade.
it’s interesting how frye mention that green should’ve been better at not getting techs since the warriors were missing their best screener (bogut) and then getting suspended (referring to draymond being the second best screener) and didn’t mention anything about it being illegal or having to do anything to deal with that. he said that the warriors had too many great playmakers so they needed to grab them to offset the cutting and passing ability of the warriors
You are not lying.  I forgot about Dre.    Draymond Green is one of the best defenders of all time
"a) Harden intentionally jackknifed himself into Bell.  That was Draymond Green quality stuff.  b) Even if we say it was a foul, Harden gets 5 to 10 bogus foul call a game, in his favor, and gets away with another 5 to 10 travels or offensive fouls.  The LAST thing Rockets fans should want is accurate NBA officiating."
"Draymond Green getting a triple double with only 4 pts. He had 12 boards, 10 assists, 10 steals. First player in NBA history to get a triple double with less than 10 pts."
LeBron was eating KD even with the help of Draymond Green. With not interior defense LeBron and AD just destroy the Nets
"76ers fans needa start looking at Ben like a Draymond Green instead of a LeBron.  Ben is a good player (especially now that they’re trying to surround him with shooting), but he isn’t a generational superstar.  Championship teams need good players.  I’d be happy if Ben was on my team."
"This is purely my opinion.  I don't have a degree in journalism nor have I ever done anything in journalism.  Kyrie, is LeBron like a father figure to you?  Chris Paul, will you be at game 7?  How do you feel about floods, draymond green?  At least prepare questions. They had like 4 hours prep time they could have used!"
"I would say Kerr already recognized what kind of player Draymond was when he was a commentator. He would praise the Green on doing all the little things that keeps him on the floor. I had no doubt in my mind Kerr would eventually start Green when he got announced as our coach.  You could actually hear some of this if you played 2k15, since they still had Kerr as a commentator."
I was about to say. The turning point was that David alee got injured and forced Green into the lineup. Draymond was already really good before Kerr and I think he also credits Mark Jackson with a lot of his defensive development (which is one thing Jackson is good at)  I don’t doubt an insistence to try and play him at the 3 but he proved he could ball and defend at the 4. He definitely would not have fallen out of the league and would’ve flourished in a similar role on another team
Why is Draymond Green here? Lol
-Draymond Green
"If Draymond Green won't be in HoF, I'll riot."
Great point forward but he sucks as a scorer.  He's basically Draymond Green but faster and quicker.
"I don't understand why people make the Draymond comp constantly. I know fans aren't the greatest at understanding defensive impact, but do people realize Green is literally the best defender of the past decade, and Simmons isn't the best defender on the Philadelphia 76ers?"
"Draymond doesn’t exclusively play 5 and neither did Rodman. So my point stands.   And listen I’m not saying Green is better for even close to peak Barkly. That said its wrong to say draymond was the first “small” big guy. Guys did it before him. While they are HoF players that doesn’t mean Green wasn’t comparable to them in small sample sizes. Part of being a HoF is longevity, but there are players that have reached HoF levels of play for only a season or two or at least comparable. For a few seasons Draymond played as well as Rodman and Barkley. If that makes sense. My point is that Mark Jackson had a player with immense talent that played the 4 spot in college and rather than Build a game plan to fit his talent, he made his talent fit his mold. Green playing 3, Klay doing ISOs, Making Curry take mid rangers, trying to make Harrison Barns a focal point of the offense. All things that were clearly inhibiting one of the most explosive teams ever and he couldn’t (well more like wouldnt) see it."
&gt; there were a bunch of us Warrior fans on here calling for Draymond to start over Lee because of how much better we looked on the floor with Green instead  I remember a lot of people saying Draymond should start over Barnes.
"Mad props to Kerr. I cannot overstate how great a coach he is for this group of players (KD not so much).   That said... Draymond emergence was serendipitous to a large extent.   David Lee was injured to start the season, and the Warriors didn't have a lot of options, so they went with Green, and in Kerr's offense, he really shined.   Had David Lee, an established All-Star, been healthy to start the season, I doubt very much that Green would have seen such an insurgence.  He likely would have still played a valuable role off the bench, but Lee would have still be getting a lot of minutes.   This was analogous to Joe Montana going down and the 49ers realizing they happened to have ANOTHER and young HOF QB on the bench in Steve Young (not that either Draymond or David Lee are at their level).   So offer kudos to Kerr, but this is also one of those stories where a chance injury gave a reserve player a chance to shine that they might not have otherwise had."
We like to argue a lot about what players are thinking. It would be super cumbersome to always be saying “I think that Draymond Green really thinks...” when everyone already understands that we don’t actually know these players or what they really think at all.
"It's much more than ""slightly"" hyperbolic, it's extremely hyperbolic. Draymond was certainly in a perfect situation with Kerr and the Warriors, noone is arguing that. But Draymond Green was only in his second year in Jackson's last year as coach, he was still learning the game as all young players do. Draymond played 82 (started 12) games Jackson's last season and averaged 21.9 mpg, 41% FG%, 34% 3P%, 5 rpg, 1.9 apg, 1.2 spg, 0.9 bpg, and 6.2 ppg. And he started 4 playoff games that year. He was already a useful rotation player and was already showing his defensive prowess. He most certainly was not nearly on his way to Europe at the time.   Now, would he have become the player he became without Kerr? Probably not, Kerr utilized Green in a way that very few coaches would have. But Green was playing for Jackson and playing real minutes and already showing his defensive abilities before Kerr even showed up. He was going to stick around in the NBA with or without Kerr."
"Draymond ""Zhang Fei"" Green"
"Interesting as Draymond Green tried to attack Steve Kerr in the locker room when they had a HEATED  DISCUSSION over the loss to The Cavs.  Yea this was a while back. Idk how this fucker is even in the league.  You came after a coach and teammates had to hold him back.  Steve just sat there and starred at him...   I got so much fucking respect for Mr. Kerr, yall young boys/girls/transgenders have no idea."
"Draymond was coming off the bench at PF behind Lee for most of Jackson's last season, too. And he started at PF towards the end of 2013-2014 when Lee got hurt under Jackson, as well.   The big changes Kerr made were making Draymond a permanent starter (which he only did once Lee got hurt in the final preseason game) and using Draymond as a small-ball 5 in the death lineup.  People in this thread seem to be conflating Draymond's usage in his rookie 2012-2013 (mostly as a small forward) with his usage in 2013-2014 (mostly as a power forward).  In 2013-2014, Jackson's last season, Draymond mostly played PF with Barnes or Iguodala as the SF. Here are Draymond's 10 most common lineups during that season by minutes played:  |Rk|Lineup|G|MP| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|S. Curry  D. Green  A. Iguodala  J. ONeal  K. Thompson|12|107.7| |2|S. Curry  D. Green  A. Iguodala  D. Lee  K. Thompson|27|104.3| |3|H. Barnes  S. Curry  D. Green  D. Lee  K. Thompson|31|104.2| |4|H. Barnes  S. Blake  J. Crawford  D. Green  J. ONeal|16|84.7| |5|A. Bogut  S. Curry  D. Green  A. Iguodala  K. Thompson|16|70.5| |6|H. Barnes  S. Blake  J. Crawford  D. Green  M. Speights|14|65.0| |7|H. Barnes  K. Bazemore  T. Douglas  D. Green  M. Speights|11|62.5| |8|H. Barnes  J. Crawford  D. Green  M. Speights  K. Thompson|10|55.0| |9|H. Barnes  A. Bogut  S. Curry  D. Green  K. Thompson|18|50.7| |10|H. Barnes  S. Curry  D. Green  M. Speights  K.

Draymond [rarely played with two other bigs in 2013-2014](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612744&amp;Season=2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=101106,101135,201578,979,203110). Of his 1800 regular season minutes, Draymond played 106 minutes with Speights/O'Neal, 84 with Lee/O'Neal, and 53 Lee/Speights.  Finally, the idea that Draymond was almost run out of the league before Kerr arrived is absurd. Draymond started the Warriors final 4 playoff games under Jackson, averaging 13/9/3/2/1. He was a key rotation piece, just like he was before Lee went down during Kerr's first pre-season."
"Okay so this is a straight up lie. Mark Jackson is an asshole but the only guy to play all 82 games in 2014? Draymond Green. In the playoffs Dray got 4 starts.  He was just a young player finding his way. Shit takes time.  Dray playing the 4 fulltime was best for his career but acting like Jackson didn't give him a chance and he was ""almost out of the league"" is bullshit."
Pretty sure the main reason Draymond Green got more minutes at the 4 was because David Lee got injured
Lol y’all are too young to remember the David lee Carl Landry Draymond Green lineups but that’s what Draymond was playing when he first entered the nba as a rookie and an ex of how he was often a 3. He was very often just used as a wing/perimeter defender
"So now I understand why on here people say this or that player play good D. Draymond did nothing the title should be, 3 Pacers fucked up a 3vs1 fastbreak...  I mean he did the ""right thing"" by standing in the middle and not committing, but he literally didn't move a finger that's not good defense, just awful offense (by Summer in particular, seeing from above it is clear Green went for Brogdon and his pass let Summer free under the basket)."
"agree, this is the path forward.     Mainly we need a true lead guard.   Last night there was a play with him screening for Maxey, and Maxey gives it to him on a short roll;  help is shading and he just fires it to the corner for a Green(maybe Scott?) three ball.   It was beautiful and was draymond-esque and should be something he does more.  He can obviously be a lob man in addition to playmaker off that action.     We just need to get that guard."

Draymond Green epitomized.
"JJ Reddick, Draymond Green, Jared Dudley, Boban"
"Ok, first of all it's Harden. Then we can talk about ranking the other three players.  I would go for Simmons, then Wall then Lavine. Simmons is a flawed player that hasn't been used right, so what he's basically playing at his 'floor' level. But I still think he can be used much better, either in a Draymond Green type role or by fixing his jumpshot."
"AD does it, and Draymond Green does the same for the Warriors lol, sorry ass defense turned it around majorly as soon as he got back on the floor.   AD the front runner for DPOY this year so far no doubt for me"
Draymond Green winning the tip off against Myles Turner at the end of the game sums up how clutch Wardell Stephen Curry II has been his entire career. Aaron Holiday just stole that ball away from him. Wardell Stephen Curry II was not born with the clutch gene.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league. They were born with the clutch gene.
Draymond Green threw this game hard.
“You thought you was Kobe!”  – Draymond Green
Getting a draymond green caliber player with your number one pick is not extremely disappointing. It’s about average for number one picks.   What’s disappointing is his potential that everyone sees but he is unable to reach.
"Was about to type that Aaron needs to drive and flail more to finally get some calls and then he drives it straight towards....Draymond Green  Lol come on man you're not a rookie anymore, you know that aint it"
Who got a ring on the bench not doing much?   RJ? Danny Green?  Or maybe doing alot but not a star? Draymond?
DRAYMOND GREEN
"even though you're right that he's never gonna be a dependable scorer, he's still draymond green on steroids and that's a very valuable player for every team to have"
"And I didn’t know Draymond Green, Iggy, Looney, Cousins, Livingston were G league players. Troll harder bro"
"Don't worry. I watched Draymond Green win a high school state title and I came away thinking he'd be lost on Michigan State's roster as an undersized, out-of-shape dude with no position."
"Draymond Green, Ron Artest...   They aren’t what I’d call big men. And both won it within the last 20 years (Artest 03, Green 16)"
"Dude, we're treading old ground here. You [already admitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi4s3z0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to not understanding what point OP was making, but then you [went back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi68d2n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to your straw man after I pointed out that it was a fair reply. Also, you didn't ask OP shit. Your [first comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq1o6b/kerr_on_the_steph_disrespect_hes_63_180lbs_so_he/gi1qxzj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in this thread is a reply to me. You asked ME and like I said, that while there's a discussion to be had there, it's not the point OP was making.   &gt; But Draymond alone, especially this Draymond, does not make up for the other deficiencies of the 2021 squad.    I don't care if it's current-form Draymond Green. He still obviously brings more to the table than 2017 Andre Roberson. This is an almost objectively true statement. The warriors wouldn't trade 2017 Roberson for '21 Draymond and I think most Thunder fans would trade '17 Roberson for Draymond without question. Also, who's arguing that Draymond makes up for all the deficiencies of the squad? I'm asking because it sure as hell wasn't me.   &gt; The squad WB ran with couldn’t give him what he needed most, but it gave him the 2nd and 3rd best thing he needed most, defense and the capacity to play at high usage. If I had to build a team around Steph smart playmakers would be what I’d go for first, then defense and shooting   What do you mean by ""capacity to play at a high usage""? You mean low-usage players, aka no all-stars? Aka, no help?   Warriors get players to buy into their system, they don't always come in being intelligent passers. Look at a guy like Javale McGee or Zaza Pachulia.  &gt; To call Steph as an inept defender is wild at this point. The man is a slightly above average defensive point guard. He’s even better than WB at it.   Are you always going to try to address trivial? points? I don't care how good a PG defender Steph is, he's not Marcus smart. He's going to need bigger wings to carry the bulk of defensive responsibility."

"Im not really seeing him actually make contact there, sure he steps as if hes about to make contact but then he slips at the last second. The Draymond screen had green put his knee into Matthews shin which i would argue is very different.   I get your overall point in that you could find similar contact at any given moment though"
"The (current) Bucks are basically hoping to outshoot their opponents on each and every game. And yes their offense is clearly better. However neither Portis, nor Forbes add anything defensively. Maybe P.J. Tucker does add to their defense, then again I trust in Bud to heavily misusing him and playing him alongside Lopez ... because why not? I have a switchable small ball C? Why not play him alongside the most unswitchable player in the modern game? Basically negate his superpower (defensively) by asking him to basically chase players?  So, yeah, obviously if the Heat go on a run (oh and they will) and the Bucks go to even bigger runs, the Bucks win. However if you are hoping to outshoot each and every opponent in your way to the trophy ... good luck.  In fact I'm doubter of the Nets even, who are even better at this style of basketball (""let them go in a run, we will run even faster"" type of nonsense) . Things that you think may work , don't in the playoffs. There the rules are different. The Lakers basically mangled those hapless Warriors to submission. The amount of ""missed"" calls were incredible. I sometimes joke that playoff basketball has more football in it than it has regular season basketball.  I wanna see Forbes and Portis shooting 45% when driven out of the court because the refs refuse to call the same things they do in the regular season. Shooting teams get roughed up in the post season ... Always. The Warriors ultimately won because on top of being a shooting (super)team they were also tough defensively and very switchable. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were taking everything away (and Iggy earlier on). You *need* that, goonery. You won't go to the finals prancing like a princess. And yes the Bucks have goons of their own (defensively), however they are greatly misused by Bud's system. He puts no bodies in the perimeter, they are always chasing the shooter, like always. Those are NBA players, they don't need much to get hot. Leaving 3+ ft to shooters (consistently) is a recipe for disaster. Suddenly players like Duncan Robinson would look like superheroes on your a$$, all the while your very shooters would be roughed up on the other end (before even they are in a position to the get the ball), because Spoelstra has Bud's numbers.  So yes, better personel. The Bucks are blessed to have so many good players at once. Despite lacking a legit No2. They have 2-3 no 3s, and some good 4s and 5s. Not many teams can have that. Still.not.enough against good teams.  Even if you win over the Heat (on talent alone) then you get the Nets next. Without outwitting *them* you are a second round exit (and you will be that in your best case scenario)."
"You see the respect players on the court have, and then you see the absolute BABIES some nba subs are, cough cough suns,nuggets,warrios, when it comes to LeBron. Wah wah wah Refs wah wah, acting like the could take a full on eye poke by a 6ft6 draymond green."
That illegal screen call was most likely a make-up call for the flagrant foul they refused to call on Draymond Green 13 seconds prior. The league didn't want to deal with the shit storm they'd have if Green got ejected for his 2nd tech and the Warriors lost.
Is the player Draymond Green? —&gt; yes —&gt; invest in a good cup
"Curry stans as well.   It’s amazing how many fans aren’t able to take their personal feelings (likes and dislikes) out of the equation and judge a player based on facts, logic and common sense.   Reading a bunch of posts in this sub you would think Golden State beat the Lakers last night. Curry was unstoppable and Draymond played the best defensive game of the decade.   Failing to mention   Green also went 0-5 and finished with 2 points and 6 turnovers.  Davis  ended up with 25 pts and 12 rebounds.  In the fourth quarter? Davis went 5-6 from the field and 2-2 from the line.   Curry finished with 3 assists and 6 turnovers.   You have to look at the entire picture. Not just cherry pick."
You guys are obsessed with Draymond Green.
"&gt;How Flopping Swung the NBA's Game of the Year, and Why the NBA Should Hate That  &gt;To be sure, Green was moving into AD's path as he went to contest Jordan Poole's shot (and Poole missed the would-be attempt). **Officials may well have called the offensive foul either way**, but the accentuation didn't hurt Davis' case.  &gt;[Draymond's contest on Lebron], of course, **was an obvious foul, though. Whether he was selling or not, the outcome was always going to be free throws for LeBron. And forcing a review probably didn't move the needle much one way or the other.**  &gt;Whether any of the above actually changed the outcome of the game is impossible to know. It'd be, at best, speculation, especially since the Warriors had a few possessions between the last flop (and we'll just go ahead and definitively classify the last one as a flop) and the final buzzer.  Great fucking work from the Bleacher Report as always.  Also, come at my but Draymond is a piece of shit who sets illegal screens on most plays (hell illegal screens basically created the Warriors dynasty) and always seems to be getting himself into these ""opsies"" on defensive contests. I don't condone flopping but it's a two-sided problem. Yeah, it happens because it's under punished, but it also happens because guys do illegal shit play after play that doesn't seem to get called unless to can get yourself nominated for an Academy Award."
"As much as I hate Draymond Green, I have to say that the mother fucker is right on this one."
"&gt; i like creative ones also. We do it to opposing teams sometimes while we watch games. Such as, Draymond Green seems like the type who eats all the cookies and puts the container back in the cupboard. This guy drinks the milk and doesn't replace the bag. This guy probably cheats at golf against himself...lol  Yeah that sounds like what Canadian heckling would be lol. Besides cheering for Achilles tears of course."
"The pass he made that resulted in a turnover basically is always a buckets, shoutout go draymond green on that.  Aside from that, the whole second half felt like it was fully controlled by Lebron"
Too bad the Draymond Green common foul was at the 2:04 mark. I really wanted to see the NBA clarify how that was not [a flagrant.](https://imgur.com/a/fYH9Kzl)
"Fuck you Draymond! is not good trash talk. It’s just mean and not good trash talk.  You suck Draymond! is a little better, it’s just cleaner. Still lazy trash talk but I think that’s acceptable.  Good trash talk would’ve been like the Dad talking to the boy so loud that Draymond could hear and saying “Omg that right there is Mr Triple Single himself Draymond Green, it’s such an honor for us to see him play today!”  Insult their play, not them."
"[""There's some bitterness and some saltiness going around, they obviously not the champs so who cares what they say."" - Draymond Green](https://streamable.com/bq4g)"
"The turnover thing is a decent idea, but honestly I think it’s far more probable that the Warriors were just sloppy with the ball in the second half.   And Draymond might as well classify for being in the category of 6’8 or taller for the sake of this argument. Yeah he’s only 6’5, but he plays like a big man and shut down AD as good as anyone can. Height didn’t play a factor because of Draymond Green."
"I'm convinced they just didn't want to call the Flagrant because that meant Draymond was out of the game and GS is effectively screwed when it comes to slowing down AD, and that would be an even worse narrative to attempt to navigate. So instead they keep it the common foul, make up call on the other end with the illegal screen. Which was illegal by the book, just typically not called, especially in that situation. So you get the same result essentially: LeBron still gets his two free throws only Lakers don't retain possession for the Flagrant, get possession back on the other end when Green stupidly sticks out his knee right in front of the ref, Matthews sells the contact and that's all the ref needs to balance the ledger.   All that being said, people get waaaaaaaaay to hung up on a few botched possessions. There are around 150 plays in a basketball game and the first 10 points count just as much as the last 10 points in the final box score."
Don’t think Simmons will ever be worth his contract tbh. Hiss role is essentially a super draymond green except he’s not as good of defender where draymond gets most of his value.   He just hasn’t developed his scoring game at all. He’s 6’10 and freakishly athletic but he’s not a great rim finisher on contested shots. If he had a lebron/Giannis like rim attacking package he could get by without his shooting but he just doesn’t.
This sub knows just as much about reffing as JVG. Seriously last night was an embarrassment for this sub and getting angry at basic calls (the Draymond green screen was an offensive foul and stupid ass JVG doesn't know shit). I really think users on this sub fall for the idiotic commentary of JVG and Mark Jackson.   Also the warriors were fucking lucky that Green didn't get a flagrant foul on Lebron and if it happened during the second quarter it would have been a flagrant 1 (he doesn't make a play for the ball clearly).
"yeah not good.   i like creative ones also. We do it to opposing teams sometimes while we watch games.  Such as, Draymond Green seems like the type who eats all the cookies and puts the container back in the cupboard. This guy drinks the milk and doesn't replace the bag. This guy probably cheats at golf against himself...lol      My kids usually use video game references, and that the player sucks in those also..lol     players name looks like he is trying to sell you some insurance"
Idk man if my kid's first words were fuck Draymond Green if be ok with that
"Draymond Green is definitely the Dennis Rhodman for the Warriors (albeit not as weird) which actually helps Steph and Klay as he can take much of the hate away from them. I think another reason Steph, and the Warriors in general are like better than Lebron's team, in this case the Lakers, is because it is organic. The Big 3 of the Warriors, were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green have grown through their careers on the same team, and together. It's natural. Its organic. Despite being a big 3, it's not like others. They got a lot of hate when they signed KD, but KD absorbed a lot of hate, as you said. So, if the Warriors say, win another championship once Klay is healthy, a lot of people will probably be rooting for them. People don't love the Lebron style of leave when things get tough, and form a super team in your next destination. I don't think any athletes image has changed as much as Lebron's after the infamous 'Decision' to go to Miami."
"The first lesson the kid got is the dirty player that is Green smacking a player in the face when it wasn't necessary. He's been doing it for a decade.  Hey kid, ""Don't be a fucking asshole like Draymond Green.""  Lesson learned."
"Switch Anthony Davis with Dryamond Green, or throw Klay Thompson back in, and we'll see who daddy is.  Edit: Or drop both anthony davis and draymond green and we will see who daddy is."
"Draymond wakes up for the playoffs. He slapped the shit out of Lebron, looked down and and handshook Wiggins lol.  But in seriousness, stats don’t tell the story of draymond green. That dude is an impact player, play maker, ultimate facilitator and defense juggernaut. He was going one on one with Davis and kept him to a horrible first half with like 12 points"
"How many times did even the commentary say that was a foul, though the Warriors never got the call. Both charges in the fourth quarter the Lakers players were moving their feet. No way did Draymond Green have two moving screens at the end of the game. At one point when Jordan Poole was shooting a 3-pointer, the Lakers Dudley stepped on the court and even clapped his hands together during the shot but there was no call. The fix was in."
"I'm a Laker fan, but I'll be damned if Draymond Green isn't a Hall of famer. The way he impacted  today's game just shows that."
Have you been poked in the eye while mid air by Draymond Green and then landed awkwardly on your sore ankle at 36?
lmao are people really going to act like it doesn’t hurt to get hit in the face by Draymond green ?? And are we just gonna ignore the fact that Draymond has a history for being a dirty player ??
I remember back in 2016 game 7 when it actually Green who for a stretch kept Golden State in the game with his Scoring... I rather expected Varejao to score 25+ than Draymond turning up for 32 pts with 6 for 8 from 3.  Since then his shot really fell off to a point where you rather want to see Ben Simmons taking multiple 3s than him
Draymond green is not the worst offensive player in the league. Think about what you’re saying

Wes “Draymond Green” Mathews
Yeah Draymond Green would never curse out anyone in public.  Good for him standing up for his values.
[Probably /r/NBA's favorite prospect of the 2017 draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6iyok5/wojnarowski_sources_golden_state_acquired_jordan/). This sub piled on the Bulls for letting the Warriors trade cash considerations for the next Draymond Green.
"Acting or not, he still came out clutch with that desperation 3 in the final minute.  I do believe he was acting, even if his eye was swollen after that foul by Draymond. His eye got hit, and yeah he may have deserved to have that flagrant called against Green. I still believe he was exaggerating.  I wanted GSW to win this. Call the referees biased, say that all the offensive fouls in the 4th are just flops, and I'd agree with them.  But still, Lebron hit that three pointer. All time great. Gaddehm."
"Draymond Green scratched LeBron's eye in one of the previous plays before this shot, so he was kinda minus an eye. Also it was a play on staying ""woke"" and keeping your third eye open (seeing past all the bs)"
"Nah i think its gonna be closer than you think.  The possibility of Draymond Green outplaying Gobert is higher than anyone think.  With steph being the be the best player in the series, it can easily turn around"
"Should we set up a similar scenario for you to eat contact directly into your eyes from Draymond Green and have it all on tape so we can see how you react, internet tough guy?"
*Understandable* - Draymond Green
"The other dude made it seem like AD is a pushover lol any other player not Draymond Green, AD would've scored wayyyy more. Like the broadcast said, the player who guarded AD the most these past 6 years is Dray, so he knows exactly how to play AD  I guess Drummond and Gasol isn't cutting it next to AD"
"I don’t like Draymond Green but that would have been a soft fucking flagrant. It’s absolutely a foul but not overly hard contact nor deliberately malicious, just unfortunate where he made contact. Fuck giving out bonus points for that"
he got poked in the fucking eye by fucking Draymond Green. What the fuck are you guys talking about? You ever played ball and been poked? its fucked.
"They dramatically changed how they called head contact around midseason because it was getting ridiculous. From what I can tell it turned into a question of who initiated contact and/or if it caused an injury.  This is totally a guess because the league sucks at explaining these things, but Draymond jumped vertical yet had his hands angled out, LeBron jumped into him to initiate contact for a foul. Obvious foul on Green for the hand angle but he kept his hands locked and didn't swipe down so they assume LeBron caused the contact.   Again it's a total guess but the best I can think of as to why the call went that way."
"Overreacting? Dude gets mauled in the eyes by draymond green and his eyes are visibly swollen, yet people still think he should get back to playing right away. Yall really think NBA players are metal robots huh"
"Those guys were also claiming Draymond went straight up when his arms were at a 45 degree angle lol. It was going to be a controversial call no matter what the moment it happened. That's just a playoff basketball game with draymond ""shooting motion"" green in it"
"Draymond ""Daniel Cormier"" Green"
"oh yeah, how dare we almost lose to those scrubs of the century Stephen Curry and Draymond Green."
"So glad we won.   My Takeaways:  - 36y/o still showing he's the best player in the league is goddamn impressive. Also NGL some acting skills involved especially on that charge that was overturned that was pretty lull, but he legit got poked in the eye.  - Curry's ability to hit shots is goddamn scary but I was actually surprised at how much Wes and the child of Erneh managed to cause him to fumble. His handle was questionable, and this isn't the first time in the playoffs its been questionable. IMO trying to go through the double team every time doesn't work against good D like ours and the 6 TO's (altho 1 was just a pass drop by TA) were how we got back in it. This all goes away with Klay Thompson back I guess but MEM with Brooks might be a real problem for GSW if they watch tape.  - Draymond Green is really really really good, he made some Westbrook like shitty passes on back-cuts but damn he disrupted our entire offensive scheme every other time.  - AD still looks way off, I don't think PHX will give us much trouble due to how we match up, but this version of AD not gonna do it vs LAC.   - Obv Biased but I thought Ref's were pretty good. This level of ""letting em play"" tho favors us a bit just cause of our aggressive our D is.  Glad we got the extra rest."
"Draymond ""Superman"" Green."
When evaluating Draymond Green.... please do not look at the box score. he’s a guy that you have to watch to get an idea on what he does.
same here with lebron getting mauled. Exhibit a the draymond green obvious flagrant
AD a real savant for locking up the offensive threat that is draymond green
"I'm  pretty damn sure that not ""virtually everyone here"" has been poked in the eye by someone as massive as Draymond Green. Let alone with that same amount of force.  Either way. Who tf cares about theatrics if thats what it takes to get these dogshit refs to make the right call. That was an easy flagrant. So many armchair idiots using ""theatrics"" to deter from the reality of what just occurred in that play."
"At the end of the day, it's Draymond Green. Refs were probably watching closely at him since he was playing rough out there."
Same thing happened to harden and [his eye was scary red](https://images.app.goo.gl/p9QYF4nEdsrdkYd47) for a bit. Poked by none other than... Draymond Green
"Here you go champ: https://imgur.com/a/fYH9Kzl  LeBron may be a flopper, but of all players, Draymond is one I would 100% expect the contact to be legit.  https://images.app.goo.gl/rNDUFBA7K3bX1aoY7  https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/05/05/rockets-draymond-green-pokes-james-harden-eye/"
"Draymond ""Jon Jones"" Green..."
"I actually thought he was fine on defense as well. A few blocks and rim protection moments, as usual fouled too much. But the problem is his presence alone makes Lebron, Shroeder, and AD worse. Especially AD who had to go against Draymond Green"
"It was an incredible three-pointer with the shot clock running down regardless of the circumstances, but the King apparently was having trouble seeing after Draymond Green accidentally poked him in the eye during a hard foul a few possessions prior.  ""After Draymond's finger to the eye, I was literally seeing three rims out there,"" he said during a postgame interview with ESPN. ""I just shot for the middle one."""
Coaching Draymond Green must take years off of your life. Great defense! Bad pass. Good rotation! Turnover.
Shot that with one eye thanks to a Draymond Green (flagrant) foul
"Hmm I agree the first half was rough all around from the refs. These are the calls that stood out to me. Jordan Poole got absolutely mauled getting to the rim, no call. Draymond Green sets a legal screen, gets called in a crucial possession of the game. Steph got held 3 separate times in the last 3 minutes, no calls. I saw a lot of plays in the first half that should probably have gone against the warriors but the Lakers got the calls when it mattered IMO. Still, super entertaining game. Lebron is big time, as if the world needed a reminder."
I’ve seen waterboy. Eye shots are not a joke. Draymond green shows no mercy
"Bro get off it. Refs make questionable calls *in every game*. Remember a minute earlier when draymond green had his arms out 90 degrees in front of him, double-palmed LeBron in the face, and didn't get a flagrant called on him? If the game was as rigged as you idiots act then explain that."
Getting hit in the eye/face by Draymond Green might cause that. Hopefully no one has to find out if so.
Draymond “Jon Jones” Green
That game really showed the impact of draymond green if u haven’t been watching the warriors and only look at the box score u might think he’s overrated. His defense on AD(atleast for the first 3 quarters) was fantastic.
I've actually been poked in the eye by Draymond Green before and it wasn't that bad so can confirm that Lebron milked it
"Draymond ""Bill Laimbeer"" Green"
"LA has not had played enough to develop chemistry, and the Warriors were close solely because of the greatness that is Stephen Curry and Draymond Green"
It nearly worked tonight lol. Draymond Green going back to scoring 10 PPG isn't the difference between them contending and not contending. Warriors lineups with Curry + Green without Wiseman had like a 120 offensive rating this season. Obviously it's not ideal for him to be such a bad scorer and shooter but he more than makes up for it with his defence and insane passing.
Draymond Green committed a flagrant by aiming for LeBrons eyes with his hands. Refs trying to rig the game for Warriors.
"Draymond ""Jon Jones"" Green"
"You could tell that James, Green, Curry basically have everything memorized.   TONS of intercepted passes once the double-team trapped Curry. They know that he whips the crazy pass and finds his target, so the Lakers were sprinting to his targets as soon as the ball left his hands.  Draymond had so many plays that he disrupted, also fucked up Davis whenever he was around the rim."
He got poked in the eye by Draymond Green who was jumping up at full intensity. Literally anyone would be rolling on the floor after that.
"Refs were ass. That rebounding foul on lebron followed by the draymond green screen? Completely confused calls.   But I agree they weren’t throwing it for the Lakers, could’ve easily said hands to the face"
"Make no mistake, Anthony Davis played like an absolute pussy for most of this game. But also Draymond Green was incredible defensively.   Steph Curry and LeBron James are basketball Gods.   I haven't liked Dennis Schroder for a single second this season, he was playing for the Warriors tonight.  Alex Caruso is a fucking dog. I love him."
"I don't know what they're complaining for, Draymond ""Natural 45° verticality motion"" Green should have had his ass thrown out and suspended for that WWE move"
Fuck you all Steph out there playing with top 5 scorer Draymond Green while gettin triple teamed every fucking possession I’m so pissed
"Fuck Draymond Green. Welcome to the club of hating Draymond Laker fans, us Cavs and Thunder fans have been waiting for you here."
"Draymond Green really is built different.  So is Dennis Schroder,but not in a good way."
Draymond “Seth Rollins” Green
I honestly thought draymond went up with no intention of blocking the ball and just went straight at his face.   Even after all the talk from the commentators Jackson at the end straight up said it’s a contest to James’ face rather than the ball.  I know everyone thinks James is a flopper or an actor or whatever but it seemed like a dirty play from Green.
I wouldn't pay Draymond Green $7.25 an hour to play on my team. There is 100 plus free agents that are better then him.
FLIP OFF PEOPLE THAT DEFEND DRAYMOND GREEN
I don't think there's a single player in the league more on point with help rotations than Draymond Green
Draymond “Illegal Screen” Green
"Draymond ""Daniel Cormier"" Green"
"If anyone should be getting the benefit of the doubt, it isn't Draymond ""Natural Shooting motion"" Green"
Lmfao  Draymond Green and Lebron James classic love story
I note that LeBron was clutching a part of his head that Draymond Green did not even slightly touch
"DQ him for an eye poke  Draymond ""Jon Jones"" Green"
*Tweet* “and that’s an offensive foul on draymond green who was 30 feet away from the play”
"Draymond green, I appreciate your game wow"
Draymond Green is so great man. Insane how some people say he’s trash.
This is an a defensive masterclass from Draymond Green. Flawless on that side.
Draymond Green showing why he’s so valuable when scoring 3 ppg
Draymond Green wide open for three!
[draymond green](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WxPqqGteL._AC_.jpg)
The Lakers really just showed on the last play of the 3rd they’d rather Draymond Green shoot an open three than let Steph take a contested logo shot.   The funny part is that’s not necessarily a bad game plan.
First time watching the profilic scorer Draymond Green?
The Warriors might miss out on the playoffs because Draymond Green forgot how to make layups
Draymond Green really just tried to take a game winner
Imagine letting Draymond Green shoot the game-winner lmao.
Draymond Green is such a bum
Why would u ever give draymond green a game winning shot lmao
"Draymond Green is def who I want shooting the buzzer beater. Yep, good play."
Draymond Green LUL
Ain't no way you let Draymond Green in 2021 shoot your last shot of the game
Imagine if this game ended on a Draymond Green buzzer beater floater 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Draymond green sucks
Just who I thought the Warriors need to feed in these situations Draymond Green
Draymond Green said Ill do it myself lmao
Tony Allen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Draymond Green  Just saying
Warriors fans will act like Danny Green is some super dirty player that's dirtier than Draymond lol
"Only draymond green could commit a foul that the refs have to look if it’s a flagrant, and still be praised for being “smart”"
Draymond Green using a small child as a human shield.
Draymond Green has a right to defend himself.
Fuck Draymond Green
Fuck draymond green!
"Grayson Allen vs Draymond Green, who do we dislike more?"
"I hated Draymond Green so much over the years that now I just laugh.   Because God damn it is hilarious.   When he intentionally raked Lebron's eyes last game and commentary immediately says ""OH HE WENT STRAIGHT UP. HE STAYED VERTICAL. JUST A SMART BASKETBALL PLAY!""   It's just so fucking funny, man. He could have torn this dude's ACLs just now. Kicking people in the balls when he shoots.   I have never seen a player at any level of basketball get away with the abuse he gives the refs without getting T'd. It's hysterical.   Give Tim Duncan a technical for smiling on the bench but let Dray call you a stupid motherfucker while his spittle hits you in the face. ""THAT'S JUST DRAYMOND"""
Draymond Green should not be allowed to shoot the basketball
Must win game to keep your team in playoff contention and the warriors insist on having draymond green handle the ball
Man... Draymond Green needs to settle down.  He's killing the Ws this game
"Did he? JV's first ""foul"" on Draymond looked the exact same, but on replay it was clear that JV never extended his arm and Draymond flopped like a... Draymond Green.  I can't say tis play was the same, but that's because they didn't show a replay"
Draymond Green has become a near net negative on the offensive side of the ball. It’s so bad
I think curry should bring the ball up and make decisions. Draymond green has been really bad this game
"I agree it's not an argument. That's why it wasn't ruled a flagrant foul. Draymond made a snap decision to prevent James from getting an easy layup/dunk and there happened to be contact on the head. There was no wind-up or shove. No, Green wasn't completely vertical, but when someone is coming into you the body's natural tendency is to curl forward. It's unfortunate that there was contact to James head but it wasn't a flagrant.  Unnecessary contact would be LeBron James two-hand shoving Joel Embiid in mid-air."
"These draymond green turnovers aren't even basketball turnovers, they're just dumb stuff."
"Congratulations, I'm an engineer too.   &gt;Nobody except for Lakers fans think what Draymond Green did meets that qualification. Again, get over yourself.  Again, you're appealing to the crowd because you can't look at a picture and come up with any actual conclusion. This is a fallacy and isn't an argument."
"I have a master's degree in engineering so I can in fact think.   Flagrant 1: Unnecessary contact committed by a player against an opponent.  That's the definition of a flagrant 1. Nobody except for Lakers fans think what Draymond Green did meets that qualification. Again, get over yourself."
Without a Green!  Haha I think Lebron would crush with a Draymond
"Evil Danny Green and Draymond Green, same team on the floor defensively? Oof. I’d love to see that!"
Will dirty ass Draymond Green score more than 2 points tonight?
Vintage Draymond Green waist-high kick.
Draymond Green is the Bill Laimbeer of his generation.
"Kinda impossible to be ‘random’ and have that type of impact in the playoffs but I get what you mean…  **Seth Curry**- can’t be understated enough how much of a non-scorer Simmons is. All it takes is a smart coach and the right defender and he’s practically Draymond green. So, Curry will be that 3rd scorer and I can see him having a 20-25 point timely game   **Joe Harris**- Jump shots will stop falling for 2 of the big 3, and Harris will get open looks and have a 20 point game. Media will jump all over it  for the unsung hero angle   **Mikal Bridges**- he’s not even really random but since it’s vs LA the masses and media will be shocked at anyone other than the big names playing big. Bridges will have at least 1 game where he’s hitting open 3s all game   **Enes Kanter** - Kanter always gets buckets, he’s gonna have that 1 game where he gets enough minutes and shots to score around 20. Denver may be a perfect matchup for him since they will almost always have a traditional 5 in so Kanter can stay on the court"
"Draymond Green. In the future, Jordan Poole"
"Salute for stickin around ol boomer  Here's mine (that I got to see play, no particular order):  Kobe Bryant   Pau Gasol   Tracy McGrady  Chris Paul   Draymond Green   Tim Duncan  Nikola Jokic  Lebron James  Lamar Odom  Lonzo Ball"
"CP3/Green/Ingles/Draymond/AD is a contender  You might say ""oh thats too stacked""  But is it really crazy compared to Steph/Klay/Barnes/Iggy/Dray(back when he could shoot)?  Or even  Lowry/Green/Kawhi/Siakam/Gasol?  True contenders are usually stacked"
"Is this a serious question? For one, we both know that Golden State wins that series at least 75% of the time even with the Draymond Green suspension and Curry injury and Bogut injury."
"If you want to get more into shooting then actually look at their splits on NBA.com  Steph was assisted by Draymond Green on over HALF of his 3 pt makes this year. I wonder if that has anything to do with his natural screening motion??  Not to mention Steph was assisted on nearly 65% of his 3s whereas Dame was about 35%  Dame has a higher percentage of the dribble, higher percentage of his shots are taken from further away, and higher percentage of his are step backs over multiple defenders.  Hard to believe but maybe if you remove Stephs little duck from your mouth your eyesight will be less cloudy."
Marcus Smart and Draymond Green
"The Lakers, Philadelphia and New York are the standouts to me. Philadelphia have a lot of great defensive personnel; and the Lakers and Knicks are coached really well defensively. Gobert and Embiid are great at rim protection. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Thybulle, Caruso and Jrue Holiday are great on the perimeter. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green and Giannis are great help defenders."
Draymond Green /s
"Eh idk, shot clock running down, KCP picked up his dribble and Draymond is draped all over him. He's either going to have to hoist a turnaround jumper with Green all over him, pass from a bad position to a covered teammate for a likely turnover, or the shot clock runs out - if everyone else just stayed home on their man. Green could handle KCP with ease on his own."
We don’t say that here if it benefits the Lakers. We only talk about the draymond green moving screen foul
"If that Draymond Green screen is an offensive foul, then 90% of screens are fouls. His knee doesn't make contact with the defender at all.  The rules are written in a way that every call is up for debate. Feet planted, but too far apart? How far is too far apart? Who gets to decide that? Tripping to me is when you are still moving your feet in the way of the defender, but Draymond's foot is clearly planted."

"Draymond Green’s importance to that team is always underplayed. If he’s not on that team, they get worse in literally every aspect of the game. The ball won’t move as much on offense. Transition offense gets sloppier. Every player on the team who isn’t Klay Thompson get’s worse on defense. They’ll simply score less and give up more points, straight up.  I don’t think it’s a fluke that everyone on the coaching staff and front office that get’s interviewed says that they’re not winning a championship if they don’t have Draymond Green on the team."
"&gt;why was Draymond playing so badly, missing a ton of games?  Because he'd logged a ton of minutes the past 5 years and had injuries? I mean, it was bad enough they MRI'd his knee because they were afraid he'd damaged it. Steve Kerr has missed coaching playoff games due to lingering back pain, he knows firsthand the toll your body can take.  I think you're confusing tanking with just pragmatic decision-making - evidenced by the ""why didn't Curry come back sooner?"" line. Any GM/coach worth their salt is always going to weigh short term vs long term value. Is it worth making LeBron play at full exertion all season, or do you let him LeCoast until the ASB? Is it worth letting Kawhi miss games for load management? Do you rush Curry back so he can win you another 5 games on your way to missing the playoffs? Do you make your 30 year old defensive swiss army knife bust ass to get a 3rd or 4th from last finish? No, because you know that a healthy, rested LeBron/Kawhi is worth more than a slightly better seed, and because giving Curry/Green time to recover is worth more than a few extra wins. The counter would be, say, Beal playing despite being banged up, because you're on the cusp of the playoffs and need him. So you risk exacerbating that because otherwise your season is over.  That's not tanking. Tanking is dealing away assets, taking bad contracts, accumulating picks to maximize your chances at getting a high pick. Intentionally losing games. If the Dubs were doing it last year, they sucked - cause they won 3 of their last 6, and 2 of those by a fair margin."

"Somehow I thought Jeff Green and Danny Green before Draymond, my less dumb brother."
"Because the most valuable player makes his team better too, like Steph did in 15 and 16.  Remove Steph from the warriors teams and we probably wouldn’t give a shit about klay thompson or Draymond green"
"Mark Jackson and JVG are the worst commentators in the history of the NBA. Obvious illegal screen but they can't see it in the replay. Obvious Draymond Green was not ""vertical"" but they can't see it in the replay. WTF are these guys paid for!?"
Where were the missed calls? Draymond clearly stuck his knee out on the screen and the pass at the end of the game was a bad pass (Curry and AD were jostling for the ball and it would have criminal to call a foul there). The biggest miss call of the game was the refs not booting Draymond Green out for a flagrant foul (doesn't make a play for the ball and hits Lebron right in the face).  Don't fall for JVG's stupidity and horrible calls (man gets so many calls wrong).
"I can cherry pick stats too!   Dame- 8 assists, 2.9 turnovers. 2.76 assist/turnover ratio. gets to the freethrow line 7.8 times per game. 1st in the league in clutch shots (with 1 minute left). 27.0 PER  Curry- 5.8 assists, 3.4 turnovers. 1.71 assists/turnover ratio. gets to the freethrow line 6.3 times per game. 26.4 PER  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Dame wasn’t close  Don't be ridiculous. Curry had the better season but Dame wasn't far off. You can just look at pts and %s but there is more to the game than that, for example your ability to draw fouls. Also I'd argue that Blazers team was just as bad as this Warriors team. Dame had just CJ with freaking Hassan Whiteside as their #3 piece because Nurkic was out for the season. The Warriors have Draymond Green (DPOY) and Wiggins. I'd say that's pretty close."
"Jesus Christ, Draymond Green committed a flagrant foul on Lebron with less than 5 minutes to go that wasn't called. Draymond Green should not even be in the game at the end."
"Uh how about all the miscalls in the first half against the lakers? The caruso and 1? Not to mention lebron gets pummelled in the face and not a flagrant? Draymond green jawing at the refs for years but still not getting ejected? Gtfoh, i feel like yall magnify the lakers miscalls yet forget what the warriors got away with but thats not surprising, rnba is basically a warrior sausage fest with every curry 3 posted in the front page and uninteresting draymond quotes getting upvoted to the top"
"[""There's some bitterness and some saltiness going around, they obviously not the champs so who cares what they say."" - Draymond Green](https://streamable.com/bq4g)"
A flagrant foul is excessive or violent contact. Draymond green put both hands up and they went forward a little bit. Lebron falling down isn’t on Draymond. It looked like a flagrant at first but shouldn’t have even be considered one
"Yeah, of course is much rougher here than in the USA. I no longer find it funny or arty as you do. Its not about softness, I wouldnt call Draymond Green soft. Its about respecting your fellow human being."
"sounds like a lot of he said/he said:  Denver Broncos wide receiver and Michigan State alum Bennie Fowler also said Green did not punch Edmondson.  ""On Saturday night, Draymond and I were eating in East Lansing. At no point, ever, did Draymond punch anyone,"" Fowler said in a statement via text to The Undefeated. ""The claims against him are beyond false and I look forward to the truth coming out.""   Sources close to Green told The Undefeated that while Green did slap Edmonds, he never threw a punch or did any other physical harm and he is shocked by what they deem a laughable accusation.  Lt. Scott Wrigglesworth of the East Lansing Police Department told ESPN on Monday that there were no injuries. He also said police were not called to the scene but were already in the area as part of their normal patrol."
"I wasn't there (and not that where it happened really matters), but all the articles say Conrad's and in the video of him getting arrested they're walking him away from Conrad's  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/17050354/michigan-state-spartans-cb-jermaine-edmondson-alleges-was-punched-draymond-green-golden-state-warriors](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17050354/michigan-state-spartans-cb-jermaine-edmondson-alleges-was-punched-draymond-green-golden-state-warriors)"
"He had four dirty plays in college. In the NBA, he's been ejected from one game, and it was a summer game with two questionable fouls. That's it. You're just exaggerating to the max. You want him to be worse than he his. People like Draymond green and Dwight Howard have at least 10 dirty plays for every one of Allen's.   The classic curse of the white guy at duke, just ask Laettner"
"I never claimed the trespasser was brutalized by the police.   BLM is a wide encompassing set of reform activism from police brutality to our incarceration system.   It's simple. Draymond Green in a certain context will lambast our overly incarcerated population and then turn around and wish someone to go to jail for something as petty as running onto a court and slapping the backboard.   Btw, most trespassing violations are met with fines, not imprisonment. So Draymond is desiring something more than necessary. He is being a hypocrite and desires cruel and unusual punishment which makes his desires for law enforcement and criminal justice activism seem tribal rather than principled."
"Seriously, clowns only keep pouting the stupid ""championship teams don't have that kind of mentality"".  A good portion of the rings won in the past 5 years worked out that way. Raptors got bailed out by KD/Klay getting injured. Warriors in '17 got bailed out when CP3 injured his hamstring. Cavs got bailed out in '16 when Bron lobbied for a Draymond Green suspension.     Every championship has a little bit of luck fall their way."
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
"Despite what you seem to be implying, [this is why](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.foxsports.com/stories/nba/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-best-defender-ever-tony-allen-reaction) I think Draymond is dumb."
Why does Shaq look and talk like Draymond Green from the Golden State Warriors?
A lot of people want draymond in this position. Personally I find him more sensitive and petty than Shaq just without the hilarious chemistry with Chuck. Draymond Green is an insufferable prick.
&gt;Green was arrested early Sunday night after allegedly assaulting Michigan State cornerback Jermaine Edmondson during a confrontation outside an East Lansing restaurant.  wtf draymond
simmons is finishing at the rim at a what 50% average nothing monster about that. Dudes is a worse Draymond Green because at leas draymond can make plays in the halfcourt
"My pick is definitely Draymond Green because he has many, many basketball skills. He plays hard, he plays intelligently, he plays with an edge, he can shoot from the perimeter, he knocks the glass on both ends, he can push the tempo, he undoubtedly has good vision, he fiercely protects the rim, he can play multiple positions, he can play perimeter defense."
"Lol that Golden State team with KD was so insanely overpowered. Outside of the Nets big 3 you have Joe Harris, everyone else really isn't great. Versus Golden State where outside the big 3 you just had Draymond Green being a defensive beast, Iguodala, and a bench with vets and role players. The Nets are the favorites but I think this is the one year where they are vulnerable. They are weak up front, are bad defensively, and have a very thin bench. Next year with some ring chasing vets and Dinwiddie or whatever they can flip him for they will reach unstoppable status. This is the year a team like the Bucks or 76ers could beat them."
"Draymond Green is getting the *fattest* check from TNT when his playing days are done, lol"
Draymond Green making Kenny look like an old man on crutches
Brother Have you heard of draymond green
"LOL no, you're just wrong.   https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/3/30/21199077/stat-of-the-week-how-champions-are-built-in-the-nba  Comparison with 2018 warriors just doesn't fly cos they always had it in them to turn up their defense and they had Draymond fucking Green."
He’s a all star the way Draymond Green is an all star.  elite role player
"Simmons is just 31 Draymond Green, don’t @ me  26 year old Draymond green could atleast shoot better"
