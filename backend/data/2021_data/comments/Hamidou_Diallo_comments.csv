Hamidou Diallo won the dunk contest in 2019
"Hello? Did you just happen to miss Larry Nance Jr, Mason Plumlee, and Hamidou Diallo? Not to mention LaMelo at 11."

"&gt; “I’m a grown man, so I’m gonna do what I wanna do,” Hill said after the Thunder’s 112-102 loss to the Spurs. “If I wanna go see my family, I’m gonna go see my family. They can’t tell me I have to stay in the room 24/7. If it’s that serious then maybe we shouldn’t be playing. It’s life. No one’s gonna be able to just cancel their whole life for this game.”  &gt; The NBA and National Basketball Players Association agreed to several new protocols. Among them, as Hill referenced, is that players and staff are required to quarantine at home or in their hotel rooms when they’re not practicing or playing games. Exceptions include outside exercise and essential activities, like grocery shopping.   &gt; When on the road, players and staff are prohibited from leaving their hotel or having guests in their hotel rooms.  “We wanna play the game,” said Hill, a 13-year NBA veteran. “That’s what we love to do. But at the same time if we’re casting all these rules, this and that, maybe they need to reevaluate what we’re doing.”  ...  &gt; “I just don’t understand some of the rules as far as we can sweat 48 minutes with the guy next to us and the team next to us, but we can’t talk to him after the game,” Hill said. “It makes no sense.”   ...  &gt; “It’s challenging, obviously, not being used to all the protocols and all the rules, but for me personally it’s what’s necessary,” Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of this COVID thing. If it means wearing my mask on the bench the whole time then it is what it is and I gotta do it.”   &gt; Thunder guard Hamidou Diallo downplayed the challenges of adhering to the protocols.   &gt; “The rules are set, and it’s either you follow them or you don’t,” Diallo said. “If you don’t follow them there’s gonna be consequences to that, and if you do follow them hopefully God willing we’ll stay healthy and we’ll keep playing the game that we love.”   ..."
I had the Black Prizm at one point! Still have about fifteen silvers. Did okay on my Troy Brown and Hamidou Diallo stashes though so 2/3 ain’t bad.
"And Hamidou Diallo. From end of the rotation and on the verge of slipping from there to 6moy candidate this year. Hamidou has actually been quite good this year, he has been especially good the last few games with a very efficient about 23ppg the last 2-3.  That dunk champ athleticism has really paid off so far this year, he's had a huge turnaround. I heard he trained with Dinwiddie in the offseason or something."

Crazy that Durant vs Thunder is happening with no player that played with Durant still on the team (and only 22 year old Hamidou Diallo who played with Westbrook)
Hamidou Diallo is the most tenured Thunder lol
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"
"It's so much more fun doing that with random players. Slashers are buffed so hard in the new 2k, my brother and I were playing Magic vs Thunder and we just went back and forth each dropping 60+ with Hamidou Diallo and Terrence Ross"
"They are total nobodies lol. And I thought Derrick Jones Jr, Hamidou Diallo, Glenn Robinson III, Pat Conaughton etc in recent years was bad..."
"BG had an awesome dunk over a convertible and they made him hop over part of the hood of some shitball kia sedan.  Not much upside, you don’t want to lose to hamidou diallo or some benchwarmer."
Instead of looking at a GOAT tier player for the logo the NBA should average out the dimensions of every baller in the league. Imagine Hamidou Diallo as the silhouette lol
"Yeah,    Bruce Brown   Mykhaliuk   Milton   Gary Trent Jr   Hamidou Diallo   Brunson   Graham   Mitchell Robinson     Nobody of Jokic's caliber tho"
I was gonna say us. I used to get annoyed with Hamidou Diallo but he’s actually a good NBA player now
He can't be up there with such superstars as Hamidou Diallo without a dunk comp win
"Lmao I was just joking, the draft really is deep as hell. Didnt mean to try and undermine your opinion. Like shake milton, mitchell robinson, hamidou diallo, jalen brunson and devonte graham all drafted in the second round is a great pool of talent to choose from. Could be they are in situations good for them, but the skill and potential between all of them is amazing."

"Takeaways:  That one hurt man. Fuck it though. Young OKC took it to em  Hamidou Diallo is way too tough  Bazley pros: he won a critical game saving jump ball against Lebron and got boards. Bazley cons: he tries to do way too much  Pay ATTENTION TO KENRICH WILLIAMS. Kenny hustle. This guy plays winning basketball. Do not snooze on this man.   Shai hoops. That fucking step back with four mins to go in the fourth was insane. Really awesome to get to the line and go 3/3 at the end of regulation  Lebron so fucking good it’s crazy. Just an unimaginable passer and just tossed our guys around. Such a scary shooter  The refs called a lot of BULLSHIT on Luguentz Dort. Hate to see it   Forgot how quick Dennis hits the jets. He adds such a layer of dynamism to the Lakers on offense   Okc needs size so bad. Cannot stop Trez, he got what he wanted. Anytime Baze was on him he was toast    Good ass job Okc. Let’s keep competing"
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."

I'm not a Pistons fan but always root for the Pistons. I've probably watched more Pistons games this year than most people who aren't Pistons fans. I think the future looks bright. At PG rookie Killian Hayes is a question mark but a good PG is not hard to find in this league. At SG Hamidou Diallo seems like an exciting athletic player who is a good defender and explosive scorer. At SF rookie Saddiq Bey seems like a solid defender and very good 3pt shooter. At PF Jerami Grant has been playing great and looks like one of the most improved players in the NBA this year. At C rookie Isaiah Stewart provides a strong defensive presence and has a good ability to score down low

"If you want to watch a young core develop over the years from being bad to good then how’s the perfect time to be a detroit pistons fan.  We’re ass this year but so far 3/4 of the rookies we’ve drafted have looked solid, and it likely could’ve been 4/4 if one of them didn’t get injured 7 games in.  Jerami Grant looking like the most improved player his first season as a #1 option if the NBA doesn’t randomly say “fuck you” and give it to Julius Randle who’s basically putting up his same numbers from last year.  Hamidou Diallo is likely to breakout here after putting up 19 last game on a minutes restriction and doing solid today too.  Then you can see vets ball out as they try to revitalize their careers here.  Shit we lose a lot, but most our losses are within 2-3possessions. I think are win margin, which we don’t get a lot, is by like 5.5pts.  We’re not a good team right now, but we have some promise.  If you wanna watch a team that’s winning now then watch Portland or Miami. Hard as shit not to love Dame or Jimmy Butler and both teams are fun to watch even without knowing who the rest of their rosters are."

Lefrak legend hamidou Diallo
"Why would you be upset? They have been abundantly clear that they aren't trying to win right now. They are also very obviously trying to find ways to wind up with a roster than can compete for championships, rather than hope to win a playoff series.   Hamidou Diallo, while a nice player, was going to be a FA.  With SGA and Dort there, they may not have been willing to pay Diallo this summer.  Why not get something instead of nothing?  He can't shoot, and he's not a lead creator. That limits his high-end value.  Also, they have a ton of room this summer (perhaps some RFA offer sheets?) and extra picks, which means roster spots could be at a premium for them...plus, they may be players in the salary dump market again."
"RemindME! 6 years ""Today, Hamidou Diallo was traded to Detroit for Svi Mykhailiuk and a 2027 second round pick.  do you remember writing this?  do I still have a picture of obama on the wall?  btw, remember the plague?  LOL"""
Hamidou Diallo
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."
Metta world peace and Kenny the jet smith. Hamidou Diallo and I lived in the same neighborhood too which is neat.

"ppl here have no idea what the standard for ""non-starter"" really is. No one ever makes threads about like Hamidou Diallo or Gary Harris bad games because no one cares like they do for more famous players. Eric Bledsoe is starting next to Lonzo and he's hasn't played well much since joining the pels.  Lonzo is an NBA starter easily. His good games are great and posting his worst game of the year on reddit doesn't make all of his bad games like this one. He's fucking 23 years old, scored 33 the other day and triple doubled before that and now he has no shot at EVER being an all-star. ok then  knicks wouldn't start him over elf?"
Hamidou Diallo
"The difference there is Chris Paul, Danillo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Terrance Feguson, Hamidou Diallo, and Nerlens Noel  Literally half our team"
"[Pistons youth movement is genuinely exciting](https://twitter.com/RedAlternates/status/1387929113252405248?s=20):  - They have a bonafide interior threat big who covers a crazy amount of space on defense and is showing some 3pt shooting chopps in Stewart (19yo)  - They have a sharpshooting wing with great awareness and on ball D who is showing some ability to take the ball to the hoop and use his strength to finish in Bey (22yo)  - They have a stellar passing PG with incredible vision and great on-ball and help D in Killian (19yo)  - They have a raw project with Siakim-esque upside in Sekou (20yo)  - They have an athletic, sharpshooting bench sparkplug with HoF tier hair in Frank Jackson (22yo)  - And they have two athletic, multi-tool bench wings who play hard nosed defense in Josh Jackson (24yo) and Hamidou Diallo (22yo)  That's 6 players 22 or younger who could have lasting roles in Weaver's restoration (4 of whom are more or less locks) without counting Saben Lee or our 2021 pick. For context, before the moratorium lifted last fall, the only player on the team under 22yo was Sekou. Just an insane transformation in only 6 months."
Hamidou Diallo actually has a pretty similar play style. He's a physically strong and gets to the line a lot but can't really shoot. He's just only like 60% as good as Maggette.  Jimmy Butler's scoring in Miami is sorta similar.  Maggette was a unique offensive player so I can't think of any particularly great comparisons.
"The 2018 draft is making bank this year. Multiple TRUE superstars at the top, and 20+ picks of incredible long term starter caliber and rotational depth. This is gonna be a hell of a redraft to mock in 10 years.  Some of the guys who just showed FLASHES this year... Alize Johnson? Hamidou Diallo? Anfernee Simons?

"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
"If Giannis is 6'5"", he's not in the league. Maybe he could be Hamidou Diallo."
"I think Weaver wouldn’t care too much for picks 23/24 and would rather pick up future picks. Our roster is already at 9 guaranteed spots, plus Cook who will definitely be guaranteed, and then bringing back Hamidou Diallo and Saben Lee, possibly Frank Jackson too. You’d be at 12 roster spots with picks 2, 23, 24, plus three second rounders, which obviously does not work."
"There definitely was more than that. Stewart, Killian Hayes, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee, Hamidou Diallo, and Josh Jackson all showed reasons to be excited."
"Hamidou Diallo had what looked like a pretty gruesome broken leg, then was later thought to be a fractured ankle, which turned out to be a clean dislocation and stretched ligaments and was back in 2.5 weeks whilst with the Thunder  &amp;#x200B;  Really hoping this is one of those ""looks worse than it is"" ones"
"Pistons: Draft Cade, resign Hamidou Diallo. Run a starting lineup of Killian/Cade/Bey/Grant/Stewart. That's all I want.   Maybe we could get a decent package for one our guys languishing like Plum, Jah, or Wayn3 3llington?"
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don’t have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn’t in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we’d be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it’d also depend on who else is taken. I don’t believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don’t think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
Im sure the Thunder would love him. (Hamidou Diallo/Terrence Ferguson)
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
"Detroit's 2 best players last season (Jerami Grant &amp; Saddiqq Bey) are their starting forwards. They had Wayne Ellington starting for a while but Josh Jackson &amp; Hamidou Diallo will likely fight that spot this season.   Like, just like your team has set things up for Markelle Fultz to be ""The Man"", Cunningham will definitely be the lead guard for the Pistons."
Lol that’s like Hamidou Diallo money. Much better than him plus by time Ben is up for another contract the cap will be higher so players will be paid a little more.
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
"Sam Presti has not found a guy who could play minutes in a playoff rotation with a pick outside of the draft lottery since 2013. He has made 13 picks in that time. (Not counting 2021 obviously).  If the best retort to that statement is ""What about Hamidou Diallo?"" then that is an airtight case against Presti's recent draft history."
Way to miss the point. People improve their jumpshots. Using their bad shot from over a year ago to weigh down the % doesn't change what he's shooting now. Idk what Hamidou Diallo did to you but it must've been bad cuz I don't see why someone would go out of their way to hate on him of all people lol. I'm not even trying to say his shot is good. I'm just saying it's not broken
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
"summer league is killing me lol. i just got into a heated argument with a guy who insisted we should wave hamidou diallo, who averaged double figures on good efficiency going into his 4th year, for a guy named jamorko pickett who scored 16 points in one SL game. he called me stupid. thanks for letting me vent lol"
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon
"1A &amp; 1B are for Cade &amp; Killian. Not for Lee, and not for Joseph.  I just don't see how the team would bench Frank Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Saddiq Bey and others to give ""a lot"" of run to Joseph in 3 guard lineups."
"&gt;and we won't have great shooting.  You can't judge regular season shooting off of Summer League (with guys like Sirvidys &amp; Cook who won't be on the roster) and guys like Saben Lee who are spending most of their team in the G-League.  The Pistons should have excellent shooting from Cade, Frank Jackson, Bey, Grant, Olynyk.   They should also have some average shooting options with Lyles &amp; Garza.  Hamidou Diallo remains a question, because if he can shoot that really rounds out the rotation with shooting at every position."
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
Hamidou Diallo also looked really good in summer league. Pretty sure he had like a 18 or 19pt opening SL game back in 2018.
"Dennis Schroeder - PHI      Danny Green - LAL      Andre Iguodala - GSW      Kelly Oubre - GSW      JJ Redick - BKN      Paul Millsap - ATL      Lou Williams - MIL      Avery Bradley - BOS      Reggie Jackson - LAC      Lauri Markennen - CHI      Josh Hart - NOP      Hamidou Diallo - DET      Svi Myk.. - OKC      Khem Birch - UFA (has been signed, Raptors)"
"I think Iguodala might retire, maybe JJ as well.  Lou Williams will go to the Pacers or the Bucks, but I'm not confident on that.  Reggie Jackson back to the Clippers  Hamidou Diallo re-signs with the Pistons  No idea for most of the rest of them."
"Dennis Schroeder - Honestly no idea.  At this point, Shanghai maybe?      Danny Green - Whomever can pay him the most, maybe Dallas?      Andre Iguodala - GS  &amp;#x200B;  Kelly Oubre - Lakers for Vet minimum     JJ Redick - He didn't do much last season so maybe retirement?      Paul Millsap - Brooklyn on vet minimum?      Lou Williams - still provides a scoring punch off the bench.  Maybe Boston or NO?     Avery Bradley - Lakers      Reggie Jackson -  NO      Lauri Markennen - resigns with Bulls     Josh Hart - NO      Hamidou Diallo - ?      Svi Myk.. - Lakers?"
"Cade - 19  Killian - 20  Beef Stew - 20  Sekou - 20  Balsa - 21  Saben Lee - 22  Bey - 22  Garza - 22  Livers - 23  Frank Jackson and Hamidou Diallo are both 23, and likely to be re-signed as well. If we are counting two-way guys Chris Smith is 21."
"I think he'd be a great add to the Pistons or Pelicans, who could use some help still, can take a risk, and still pay him alright at least.   Pistons obviously aren't using him over Cade but rn their other options are Josh Jackson (better fit as an SF imo), Hamidou Diallo (better fit as an SF imo), and Cory Joseph (better fit as a PG imo). I guess they could technically slide DSJ over but again, fit thing. Just as a 3rd/4th guard he adds a decent amount.  Pels wise he's better than Satoransky, I think NAW and Graham are both actually great and will impress this year, but again, could use a little bench depth at G rn and Nunn is better than your average 3rd/4th guy, especially at the budget it looks like he'll be available at."
"Kings sign Malik Monk.  Kings trade for Bam Adebayo.  Kings trade for Hamidou Diallo.  Bring in Wenyen Gabriel and Isaiah Briscoe.    Fire Walton, hire Calipari."
I mean I think Zo would probably be the favorite here but I’ll with another name in Hamidou Diallo still think he has a decent amount of upside
"Agreed. Hamidou Diallo is still really young, and has some potential too."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
can you rap about hamidou diallo?
Hamidou Diallo?
"&gt;Which player is the most athletic?   1. Zion Williamson, New Orleans – 27%   2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 20%   3. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota – 17%   4. Zach LaVine, Chicago – 13%   5. Ja Morant, Memphis – 10%   &gt; Also receiving votes: Hamidou Diallo, Detroit; LeBron James, L.A. Lakers; Derrick Jones Jr., Chicago; Ben Simmons, Philadelphia  https://www.nba.com/news/2021-22-gmsurvey  The Most Athletic poll is in the Misc section towards the bottom of the page."
One good pick out of his last 14 prior to this year's draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis
"Too early but I’m liking our bench of   Cory Joseph  Josh jackson Hamidou Diallo Trey Lyles Kelly Olynyk  3 of these guys shoot the three at a solid % while Cojo is good at running the unit along with both Josh and Hami being good cutters and defenders. Not to mention Cojo, Lyles and KO got good synergy being they played for the Canadian National team."
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
"True he made some picks that looked horrible at the time and were in fact horrible (Huestis), and some picks that didn't pan out (McGary seemed like an OK pick but was awful, although not too many good players after him in that draft besides Jokic; Terrance Ferguson was a bust too at #21 but I don't know much about how he was viewed predraft).  On the other hand there were some OK picks in that span. Along with Sabonis, Hamidou Diallo was also a pretty good draft-day trade (obviously not close to the caliber of player, but pretty good for a #45 pick), and Bazley (2019) for now seems OK at #23 although he's not a great player by any means. Cam Payne looked like a huge bust for a while but is actually a decent player now (no thanks to OKC really). Quickley last year was also a fine pick (even though they gave him up) - there's not really anyone much better taken after him.  So you're right that not a stellar drafting record from '14-20, but I don't think it's that fair to call it near the ""worst in the league"" given the picks he had to work with - the 3 picks of 2014 + 2017 were bad for sure, but 2015 was just Cam Payne and #48, 2018 they were #53 and #57, 2019 was Bazley and 2020 was Quickley (and the #53) who are both OK given where they were picked. (There might be other draft-day trades that I'm missing)"
Terrible overrated player.  Mavs should trade for Hamidou Diallo and Kelly Olynyk 🤝
"Kings: Barnes is hella athletic but doesn't dunk very often, pure hops probably Damian Jones  Suns: McGee &amp; Ayton  Mavericks: no real big-time dunkers, but DFS/Kleber can get up, KP too occasionally   Spurs: Lonnie Walker  Pacers: probably Turner/Sabonis  Cavs: Jarrett Allen  Pistons: Hamidou Diallo (2019 dunk champion)  Wizards: Hachimura got some hops, hasn't played this season though. Gafford &amp; Trez?  OKC: Bazley??"
"Survivorship bias. Outside of LaVine, everyone only developed a deadly 3-pt shot after a few years in the league when they could no longer score like they once could and I would argue Kobe never developed a great 3-pt shot. Guys who weren't bigs in the dunk contest usually were out of the league if they didn't develop a shot...Hamidou Diallo, Glenn Robinson III, Fred Jones, Desmond Mason, etc"
I'm pretty sure Lyles will slide up and play backup C with Hamidou Diallo or Saben Lee reentering the rotation.
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
