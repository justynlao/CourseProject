Also happened to RJ Barrett in 2019 Elite Eight.
"Considering the last few drafts, this draft is hella week at the top. Last years top 5 were Zion (franchise player), Ja (franchise player), RJ Barrett (?). The year before that had Ayton (questionable but potential future star), Bagley (Kingslul), Doncic (Future MVP) and then JJJ (future All star) and Trae Young(All star). I dont think theres any chance that anyone from this group this year is gonna be an all star in the next 3 years."
Feel like RJ Barrett is a value play there
Fair point about the overvaluation of a player in a winning team. Reckon that‚Äôs the case for RJ Barrett?
"Zion seems the same way to me too. I usually tune out coverage of Zion since I‚Äôm tired of it, but everytime I‚Äôve seen him speak he sounds really humble which is impressive given the massive hype he gets.   I just remember hearing a reporter ask him what it‚Äôs like to be the best player in the draft, and he said something about ‚Äúit feels like being RJ Barrett‚Äù"
"nice to see him chucking efficiency, i mean when RJ Barrett is bad, like it gets really bad but if he can keep this consistent output the Knicks have a really great future."
2017-Frank Ntilikina 8th may be out of the league soon  -Daymeon Dotson 44th Solid rotational player for the Cavs   2018 Kevin Knox 9th Barely getting minutes on our team  -Mitchell Robinson 36th our franchise center   2019 RJ Barrett (exception)
I think the future years after the draft we'll see RJ Barrett as an iron man that plays big minutes every night puts up 18 every night with good defense. And Ja and Zion will be in and out for injuries or load managing those injuries. RJ isn't as flashy or won't hit the highs of the other 2 but will probably end his career as most accomplished due to longevity alone.
"RJ = 20 yrs old.    IQ= 21 yrs old.      So yeah...its way early since IQ has played like 14 professional games and Barrett can't buy beer yet....  .....but considering their age and what we have seen BOTH of them capable of more and more frequently, the Knicks backcourt got legit hope."
"Barrett and Haliburton can play together. Hal's a floor spacer with great court vision who makes the right pass almost every time. And he'll be at least a good wing defender and maybe a great one when he gets a little stronger. In many ways a perfect compliment for RJ. With shooters like IQ and Hal on the court at the same time, RJ's slashing game would be lethal."
Why the hell is RJ Barrett not in the game down the stretch? Ridiculous.
MJ is just the American RJ Barrett bro
RJ Barrett aka Canadian MJ
Future RJ Barrett let‚Äôs go Knicks
"If Rj Barrett turns out like this man, I‚Äôd be ecstatic"
"Haliburton, DeRozan, Malik Beasley, RJ Barrett, Harrison Barnes, Daniel Theis"
You mean the Raptors 9th man in the rotation isn't better than RJ Barrett?
it's always the knicks though  RJ Barrett and *checks notes* immanuel quickly are the future?
"I‚Äôm a Knicks fan I like Barrett man. I been watching every game and i really like how even on bad shooting nights RJ doesn‚Äôt get discouraged and continues too put effort in and chip in in other areas of the game, getting bounds &amp; playmaking etc and being a presence on the floor playing some of the most mins in the NBA....I think he got a nice future in the league"
"I am skeptical. He wasn't a good shooter in college and he wasn't a good shooter his rookie year. Look away, but I am getting major Andrew Wiggins vibes from him. He will do just enough to earn a max extension after his rookie contract is up but like Wiggins I am skeptical he will be able to take the next step.   The Knicks are 8-11, they're not awful, so why does RJ Barrett have a 13.2 PER?"
"I love me some Rj Barrett, needs to get the ball more"
"Rj Barrett and the knicks, when Rj see them yellow uniforms he feasts"
"Man I can remember towards the end of the playoffs and into the off-season when Herro &gt; Barrett wasn't an unpopular opinion   Don't get me wrong I like Herro too, but he was put into an amazing situation and RJ was definitely not"
I've seen the light after the Utah game.  It doesn't help that without the haircut they both look a lot so half the time I was wondering why RJ Barrett was just holding the ball and taking crap jumpers until I realized that wait RJ Barrett isn't right handed.  That last 3 Elf took made me laugh out loud and groan.  I couldn't believe he took that.  Poor RJ on the side standing with his hands on his knees.  I actually popped in the Knicks sub and my worst fears were confirmed.  Y'all somehow got stuck with the albatross like others before y'all.
RJ Barrett snubbed again
I replaced him RJ Barrett
How's RJ Barrett fairing at this point?
We need to be patient with Anthony Edwards. 19 year olds usually don't succeed in the NBA. RJ Barrett was godawful last year at 19 and this year he's great.
Pretty standard really. RJ Barrett going from career high last night to throwing the rock away with 2 minutes left is prime time Knicks.
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett on the other hand...
The only tandem that can come close to Jordan and Pippen: Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
Remember when people saying RJ Barrett was a bust.
"At the start of the play, Zion is on Kyle Guy (UVA #5), Marques Bolden (Duke #20) is on Jay Huff (UVA #30), and RJ Barrett (Duke #5) on Hunter (UVA #12). Huff sets the pick to get Zion off Guy. Bolden then switches onto off Huff onto Guy, but Zion stays on Guy. In a typical pick and roll situation, the defender guarding the ball handler (Zion on Guy) and the defender guarding the screener (Bolden on Huff) switch after the screen is executed. Zion not switching onto Huff forces Barrett to switch onto Huff. That means he abandons Hunter, who's free to run to the three point line, leaving him open for the extra pass. The defensive recovery onto a guy who wasn't his man was great, but he only had to recover because of the initial error. OP asked why a player who was so good on defense in college and high school has struggled in the pros; it's because you can't pull off that kind of recovery in the NBA, so all that's left is the first error.   **Here's where, watching it again, I could have made a mistake**: I initially assumed Zion/Bolden were supposed to switch, but it could be that they were supposed to blitz Guy and the defensive strategy just failed. In that case, it's more of a blown play because of tactics, and not because of anything Zion did- not his fault at all."

RJ Barrett continues to impress this season. You love to see it!

Wait till ya hear about RJ Barrett üòÖ
"Kevin Porter Jr. - $4,791,562 over 3 years  RJ Barrett - $16,071,720 over 2 years plus another $17,000,000 club option over the following two years (which Knicks will most likely sign because he has been a model citizen)"
Nope. We base a guy's potential based off of his first two shots of the season. RJ Barrett airballed his first two shots of the season THEREFORE HE'S A BUST.
"RJ ""RJ 'Barrett' Barrett"" Barrett"
"It's hard to play offense with this team. We have 4 non-shooters in the lineup, consisted of exclusively lob threat in Mitch, ISO scorer in Randle, a guy that can't create his own shot, stretch the floor or dribble right in RJ Barrett and Payton that plays like he has bondage over his eyes. Every point we score has to be grinded out to the max."
"RJ ""RJ Barrett"" Barrett"
RJ Barrett
Zion: *scores 10 straight points in crunch time*  RJ Barrett: it‚Äôs RJ Barrett time
"Such a shame, this guy is just as talented as RJ Barrett. It‚Äôs telling one went #3 and the other #30, and it seems he‚Äôs going to toss a very salvageable NBA career."
"If you were a Zion fan in college, RJ Barrett was your arch nemesis"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
RJ Barrett. He's definitely beloved amongst Knick fans but it's hard to see past the lack of shooting/shot creation. He's gonna be a  solid NBA player but I don't see him becoming much of a star so the most efficient thing would be to trade him at this point while his value is high instead of making moves based on compensating for RJ's poor shooting.
"Rj Barrett- become steph Curry from 3 and kawhi on perimeter d, win about 5 chips and some individual awards"
"Rj Barrett, randle, Mitchell Robinson, Payton, quickley"
That's a great follow through. I can look at that picture and tell you that guy is a good shooter. Not like RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett &lt;3
RJ Barrett isnt in the bottom? pog
"Bail out from what?  Not only have I not given any opinion on RJ Barrett but I've also literally never replied to one of your comments or known of you at all until I saw the same user in 2 threads today arguing the same points.I then realized by your comment history that you're consistently commenting about RJ Barrett, which is weird as hell.  If you think people need a bail out card from *yourself* then that should say more about you than anything."
"This guy is literally just an RJ Barrett hater more than anything else so take what he says for granted.  But yes Knox has improved, especially in bring his 3pt shot down to a regular arch. He's shooting 60% from corner 3 when last year he would air ball them and he's been actually hustling on D. When he tries to create a midrange shot its tough to watch but otherwise he's taken a good step in the right direction"
"IMO he makes a lot of sense as a backup PG that could contribute to many teams. He's extremely physical going to the rim and has decent vision. But on our roster he's literally just a shittier version of RJ Barrett, trying to fill the same role as Julius Randle."

Honestly I still wouldn‚Äôt take him over any of the guys who went top 5 but I‚Äôm probably much higher on RJ Barrett than I should be considering how bad he is as shooting.
"I'm definitely not complaining about that as a Cavs fan, you're right. But I was referring to the recent changes to lottery odds that were meant to discourage tanking. These changes to the odds took place after the Cavs run of #1 picks.  Without those changes, Knicks and Cavs fans could be rooting on Zion and Ja instead of RJ Barrett and Darius Garland.  2019 Draft #1 Pelicans - 33 wins #2 Grizzlies - 33 wins #3 Knicks - 17 wins  #4 Lakers - 37 wins #5 Cavs - 19 wins   2020 Draft #1 T-Wolves - 19 wins (3rd worst record) #2 Warriors - 15 wins (worst) #3 Hornets - 23 wins (#9 seed in East)  #4 Bulls - 22 wins #5 Cavs - 19 wins (2nd worst) ... #8 Knicks- 21 wins (5th worst record)  In other words, Gilbert and Dolan are getting the team ownership equivalent of the ""ball don't lie"" phenomenon..."
"Dude I don‚Äôt want to hear about no RJ Barrett after Tacko Fall hits a three. This is Tacko time, everyone else can post later."
RJ Barrett got stripped by Drummond twice in the final minutes lol.
RJ Barrett because I think he is being limited by the Knicks and still value his potential. It‚Äôs hard to compare him to a guy being coached by the best coach ever.
"Listen, I will always root for the Raptors to win the game I'm watching. But there's tons of upside to losing this season as well.   First of all, this is a fake ass season. Half the league has covid, the Raptors are playing 72 road games essentially, and there's so much shit going on that I really don't think this season matters. Asterisk season. If there's a year to bottom out and just chalk it up to external circumstances, it's this one.  Second, I'm tired of always having to develop guys. I love that our team is filled with underdog guys who were drafted late and worked their way to starring roles for this franchise are great stories, but our only lottery picks on the roster are Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. For once can we just have a naturally gifted talent to build around? Can we get a Ja Morant or a Jayson Tatum. Even RJ Barrett would be a great type of player to take and develop under an organization that has proven to get the best out of its draft picks. Why not? This year's draft class is supposed to be stacked, this is the year to have a top pick. We have never signed a star free agent, we could trade for one, but we have no real trade pieces without gutting this roster for it to be even worth it. The easiest way to inject star potential talent is with a top 5 pick. We have the pieces to go, FVV/OG/Siakam, and you pair that up with a Cade/Mobley and we're off. It's just one season."
"Barrett. Heat will have to be dominant in regular season to get multiple all-stars. He's competing with Bam and Jimmy. If Knicks start to look decent again RJ will get a lot of credit, even though Don Julio is their best player at the moment."
RJ Barrett and two seconds.
"Rj Barrett had a very pleasing bounce back game, to those he say he is a bust shouldn‚Äôt step on the gas to early"
RJ Barrett is terrible man
RJ Barrett is so ass.  Just make a shot
RJ Barrett is so bad its not even funny.  You can make an argument that 6-7 guys drafted after him are better than him at this point.  But Knicks fans will defend him to the death even though he has not shown anything on a consistent basis.
Uhh... I would bet on it. Never heard of anyone buying frank ntilikina and RJ Barrett jerseys
"I hope this happens for 2 reasons.  1: KD Kyrie and Harden need to win. That's too good of a big 3 not to. After the next off season they may end up better than KD warriors.   2: The Nets were the laughing stock of the league after that Boston trade and they've done this. Knicks have Julius Randle, RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin. Everyone in the Knicks front office should just fire themselves."
Knicks get: kyrie  Nets get: harden  Houston gets: Rj Barrett + a player from the nets + protected 1st from knicks  Who says no?
Jimmy Butler is who RJ Barrett thinks he is.
"dsj wasn't 'average'...he was bad...  he scored 15 points from 15 shots, 47%ts firm rj barrett territory, on a team that was tanking"

An RJ Barrett brick hits your dome
I know Thibs has that reputation but it can‚Äôt be overstated how much the Burks injury is influencing the need for RJ and Barrett to play long minutes. He was giving us 20 points a night on super high efficiency and it‚Äôs really tough to cover that. Hoping that when he comes out we can smooth the minutes out a bit
RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett is already breaking out somewhat but it still underrated
He really isn't lol. He was 11th and 6th in player votes and fan votes for the East Backcourt all stars alone     The players certainly do not respect him. He had 2 more player votes than Colin Sexton and RJ Barrett lmao
"As an RJ Barrett guy, I‚Äôll admit that I shat a lot on Randle last year. He seemed like he was only in it for him and him and Payton were always freezing RJ out when he got going.   I‚Äôll admit now I was wrong about Julius. He needed time to  adjust to his role and learn his new teammate‚Äôs habits. He‚Äôs been just excellent this year and the passing has unlocked a whole new level for that Knicks team.   I‚Äôm glad to see he could take the time to adjust his game for the betterment of his team. That makes him a true leader."
"The international team is led by RJ Barrett and Lugentz Dort.  The domestic team is led by Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, and LaMelo Ball.  Send you prayers to the international team, because they need it!"
"Who would you say the best Canadian player in the league rn? Between Kelly Olynik, SGA, Jamal Murray, Cory Joseph and RJ Barrett? Tough choices if you ask me"
terence davis &gt;&gt; &gt;RJ Barrett
Like I said in another comment I don't think he's undeserving but the fact is the Jazz have 2 maybe 3 All Star caliber players on their roster. The Knicks 2nd best player this year is RJ Barrett
"Why would they overpay for a player who's aging and that they have a very similar type in RJ Barrett? Besides, has the new FO even made a bad signing yet?"
is trading rj barrett and 3 first round picks worth it for beal? cause rj is young and could be a all star sg one day and those 3 firsts could be lottery pick knowing the knicks recent history plus beal can opt out in 2022. personally i don't think i would do this trade
Literally no GM in the league is trading a 30 ppg scorer for a trade package centered around RJ Barrett
"Is there danger of Simmons being unhappy or refusing to play?  If so, they could prob get a better package than RJ Barrett and remain competitive in the conference given they are the 1-seed and Barrett doesn't keep them there."
The article says a star will demand a trade to New York. The Knicks don't have to put a crazy package together if it's a trade demand situation and Simmons is unhappy or refusing to play. But even then a package around RJ Barrett would probably work.
"As long as RJ Barrett is on it, I don't care"
Exactly the 1st pick was projected to be rj Barrett before college
"I‚Äôm sure it will happen, and even though I usually hate big market teams, the knicks have been through enough. You guys payed your dues and more.   I especially would be down to see you guys add to Randle and Barrett. I like RJ and will absolutely admit that I‚Äôve been sleeping on Randle"
dang people were telling me this guy was better than rj barrett
"His duke teammate Rj Barrett also gets mauled often with no foul, however he doesn‚Äôt sell the fouls well either"
"The Knicks are never right. The Knicks managed to turn Zion, Kyrie and KD into Randle, Morris and RJ fucking Barrett LOL"
#Did RJ Barrett erupt again this game?
"They didn't win it all because RJ Barrett and Reddish turned out to not be as talented as expected. Especially Reddish, he was basically a role player level on that team who was very inefficient on offense. Barrett had the mentality of a star player, but was nowhere near as dominant or impact-ful as Zion on offense and defense. Tre Jones played his role on the team pretty well, but no one expected him to be exceptional."
This is why they should‚Äôve given RJ Barrett the allstar nod over one of them üíØ
He was dominating games in ways we haven't seen before. I went back and watched his highlights the other day and it's nuts. And then Duke takes the ball out of his hands to have RJ Barrett take shots and you get sad.  How that team didn't win it all is beyond me
"He's not the most overrated, but RJ Barrett is painfully inconsistent especially this month."
The players are RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr
RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr
Rj Barrett and Julius Randle
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
Should I trade for CJ McCollum And give up RJ Barrett miles bridges on Charlotte. Worried about CJ injury and coming back and my playoffs being 3 4 weeks away
This is like the 6th time I've heard some weird sex comment in response to someone criticizing RJ Barrett
Julius Randle is who we thought RJ Barrett would be
"Why do some people like to shit on RJ Barrett? No one's disagreeing that he's been real inconsistent, but I just don't get why you guys care so much if you don't like him?"
The RJ Barrett Cycle:  1. Plays well  2. Teammates inexplicably stop passing him the ball  3. Loses confidence because teammates aren‚Äôt passing him the ball  4. Starts shooting poorly  5. Works hard in practice to find form again  6. Repeat from Step 1.
"good game, both teams were REALLY choking in that fourth quarter and it seemed like nobody wanted to win.  as a knicks fan i'm gonna complain about 2 things: rj barrett and the warriors commentary team. RJ has to play better.  warriors commentary is ridiculously biased (which is fine) but it's not even fun bias its just... complaining about calls and then talking about ""basketball god"" whenever we miss a free throw. YES IM SALTY. we miss free throws because WE SUCK AT FREE THROWS not because basketball jesus thinks that it wasnt a foul."
#RJ BARRETT SHOOTS 30%
"Even RJ Barrett, despite his struggles, is over 30% this season"
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday‚Äôs game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it‚Äôs been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks ‚Äî Reggie Bullock ‚Äî RJ Barrett ‚Äî Julius Randle ‚Äî Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
Zion should stop waiting for Ingram‚Äôs approval. This has all the makings of the Zion/ RJ Barrett pairing.
"1. Big time college prospects family members get ""jobs"" around the town their kid committed to.  2. These kids drive brand new muscle cars they obviously couldn't afford beforehand.  3. They don't have to pay for anything around the town.   4. Plus straight up getting cash money.  500,000k is good money. Colleges, especially the ones pulling big time prospects can match it, while you get to save yourself for millions.   Compare afreenee simmons who fell to the 24th pick to RJ barrett. Simmons would have been a lotto pick in his normal year. He will have made around 5 million in three years. Great money. RJ barret made 7 million last year. Pretty significant difference in their rookie contract earnings for a few months of being a pampered college athlete"
"I remember watching him in college in like 2014. He was raw, but would pull random moves that made him look like Hakeem and I would just be astonished.   On defense, the guy looked like he improved every single game. His ability to adapt and retain information showed a naturally high basketball IQ.   He was 7ft in shoes and about 245 at that point. I really wish he didn't bulk up as much as he did.   He would have been perfect at like 260. He looked much quicker and more fluid in college. I legit thought he had potential to be the best two way player in the NBA in his prime.   Wiggins was the hyped up prospect coming into college, but once you watched them both on the same team, it was clear Embiid was by far the most talented prospect of that class.   It was kind of the same thing with RJ Barrett and Zion in college. Zion just looked so much more dominant."
"Zach LaVine, RJ Barrett from the Knicks,  any big man"
RJ Barrett baby
"To me he is still putting up a lot of duds. He‚Äôs obviously a talent, but I just don‚Äôt see him every being a top tier perimeter player with his play style. He‚Äôs very similar to RJ Barrett"
"RJ Barrett made fun of myself and the entire chess club once. Thought we were playing checkers. What a jerk.  Who's the nerd now, RJ?! I just got my first virtual girlfriend. Put that in your pipe and smoke it."
"You cannot tell the story of basketball without Vince. He popularized basketball in Canada and is a huge reason behind the influx of players coming from Canada. Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett. There are many more that were exposed to basketball because of Vince."
With Haliburton you wouldn't have the guard issues of Payton or even making the D Rose trade.  Both guys are good defensive players.  Maybe not true 1s but RJ Barrett should be the nominal ball handler anyway.  You guys don't need a real point guard just put in his hands and surround him with shooters.  It's not like that type of archetype hasn't been successful before with a big shot creating wing who can play make.  Also why doesn't he close games.  So weird.
"maybe its the same reason RJ Barrett was the #1 on Duke and Zion was the #2.  I think its the ""lack of moves""...but the dude is so quick and powerful that he'll be able to do something no matter what, even if he lacks iso moves."
this sounds like back at duke with rj barrett lol
Rj barrett prepared zion for this
"Yes, Julius Randle is doing well, but this isn‚Äôt even a sample size problem - it‚Äôs completely cherry-picked and relies on the fact that Randle plays a shitload of minutes on a .500 team in the East.  AD has been injured and is the 2nd guy on an actual championship team in the West while Randle is sharing the ball on a .500 team in the East with RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton.   Per 36: AD 24.7 Randle 22.6  Joel Embiid is playing 32 mpg.   Per 36: Embiid 12 Randle 10.8  Lillard attempts 2.4x more 3‚Äôs a game on a team where he basically goes down in a hail of gunfire every night.  Is it more valuable when someone plays more minutes?   Absolutely.  Will AD and Embiid play Randle‚Äôs minutes in the playoffs?  Yes."
"Yes the Knicks and 73 win Warriors circumstances are soo similar. Its not like Steph or Klay are as good as Elfrid Payton and RJ Barrett, Randles getting open shots while Draymond getting guarded like he‚Äôs the best player on the team."
Wow what a scrub. They should trade him for RJ Barrett
"Are we going to act like a guy playing with Elfrid Payton, Rj Barrett  and Reggie Bullock is playing with stars? Not  sure Randle‚Äôs healthy is that much better than bam‚Äôs injured if it even is. Dude  is surrounded by inefficient non shooters. There are like 2 guys on the team besides him capable of hitting a 3 consistently."
Rj Barrett is who that lollipop wearing number 11 thinks he is
"Capela, Ad, powell, RJ Barrett, Simmons  Strong offense, stifling defense"
Lonzo  RJ Barrett Mikal Bridges  AD Jokic   Two superstars surrounded by decent perimeter shooting and good defense ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Rj Barrett when he plays a team with blue and yellow uniforms
He has barely played with Elfrid this season so no that‚Äôs not why at all but I know Elfrid lives rent free in y‚Äôall craniums and every single issue with the team big or small will be traced back to him somehow by y‚Äôall. I even saw people blaming the fact that RJ Barrett can‚Äôt make a fucking layup right now on Elfrid being on the floor with him lol.

Maple Mamba = RJ Barrett
He‚Äôs selfish and ices out RJ Barrett
I mean he'll probably get covered for his flaws by the other three but... Deandre Jordan?  Also right now if the Knicks make the playoffs I'll say RJ Barrett.  But only due to youth and inexperience.
This must be like deja vu because I feel like Duke didn‚Äôt win a championship during Zion‚Äôs freshman year because he had a black hole on his team in RJ Barrett.
"Larger point is people generally overrate their ability to predict both which classes are strong/weak and how accurate their pre draft rankings will be. People thought classes like [2009 would be terrible](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/205266-mocking-a-supposedly-weak-2009-nba-draft) while endlessly hyping up classes like 2014.   We think we know but we often dont. The idea that there was a ""clear top 2"" in the 2019 draft was only a recently formed take in the months leading up to the draft. Prior to the 2018-19 season RJ Barrett was the guy people were hyped up about. So just like things change alot in 1 season the same thing will happen very often after players are drafted."
Lmaooo I said that Barrett is better at everything but scoring. Seeing that scoring is the most important skill in basketball Lavine is a better player rn. He‚Äôs also 5 yrs older than RJ. My point was that if RJ continues to improve his scoring ability every year then when he‚Äôs 25 he can be a more valuable player than Zach because he does everything well. RJ could also end up not improving to that point but I believe he can. His biggest flaw rn is shooting. The fact that he bumped his ft up 15% higher shows how hard he works and that he‚Äôs developing shooting touch. You have been parading around hating on a 20 yr old kid and telling other people they are immature and just being straight up a dick. Obviously RJ has flaws at his craft. We all do and if I had thousands of people hating on me for not being great at my job I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it tbh. The Knicks are my favorite team and always will be but sometimes we forget the human aspects of the game. I‚Äôve done it too (looking at my Elfrid Payton comments lol ). You can be critical but you have to give them props when it‚Äôs due. Hope you have a good day Vyper.
"Depends on who you ask.  Mavs fans think they can get him for THJ and a second rounder.  Knicks fans think RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley is an overpay for him.   I am not making this up, these are pretty recent opinions by fans from those subreddits.  Realistically? We aren't trading him and if we are it's gotta be a haul - somewhere around whatever Bradley Beal nets. Beal is better right now but he's two years older and Zach is better at 25 than Beal was at 25 so I would say their value in the long term is similar."
"Just the other day there was a *fiesta* at our sub celebrating RJ Barrett as almost equal and soon to be better player than Zion. Reasoning, Barrets better playmaking, defense and rebounding(relative to position)."
lol as if RJ Barrett and Julius Randle don't attack the rim. GTFOH with this garbage
"Cade has been the best player in college, rivaled only by Suggs maybe (who benefits heavily by being in the best team in college). Not even CLOSE to RJ barrett underperforming in college lmao  People overreacting to one bad game and ignoring basically an entire season of elite play from him so far."
The contrarian takes eventually became the mainstream take for RJ Barrett because of his performance. I suspect it will be similar for Cade
So we're stuck with Captains RJ Barrett and Malik Beasley?
"You don‚Äôt earn the initials of your name you weirdo? Do you refer to RJ Barrett as Rowan Barrett when he came into the league lmfao?  What the hell? Nobody has to know your 25th pick rookies acronym dumbass. He hasnt earned that privillige yet. You recognize KD, LBJ, KP, CP3 bcause they actually proven themselves. What did IQ has done to be known by IQ?    &gt; And its IQ like pretty common acronym for something you lack of, apperantly.  If you‚Äôre going to try and call someone dumb you should probably check that you‚Äôve used correct grammar LMAO"
Also a reminder that there's a clip on Youtube of Freshman LaMelo Ball making RJ Barrett and Anfernee Simons look bad.
"No! People on my sub have clearly set it straight with me, RJ Barrett will end up being better player and is already not far behind. I don't take their word for granted."
That makes sense... RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickely could use a little more competition for usage.
"This idea is really, really, really dumb.  &gt;  I believe this should be a scenario where the Warriors should look to trade multiple draft picks for a more proven young player  &gt; RJ Barrett (4/4), Lamelo Ball (4/4), Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Halliburton  We should trade four first round draft picks, including a potential top 5 pick, for RJ Barrett or Lamelo Ball? Why? So the idea is to mortgage our future for players who don't really help us in the short term..?"
Just last year rj was seen as a major disappointment. I‚Äôm all for this hot streak being the new him but it‚Äôs just way too early to say anything yet much less the knicks are now going to be able to attract a top tier fa. Quickley was a late round gem but again saying he and Barrett are building blocks is jumping the gun. Their pick right now wouldn‚Äôt even be that good and the mavs pick is pretty mediocre too. Mavs will likely bounce back as well. It‚Äôs just way too early to say anything about this new regime in ny.
Yes I absolutely despise RJ Barrett because.....REASONS
"Comparisons likes these are lazy IMO. Tatum &amp; Brown were part of a well rounded Boston teams, which limited their shots and usage. Tatum in his second year had Horford, Hayward, Irving, Rozier, and Brown. Brown in his second year had Tatum, Horford, Morris, and Irving. RJ Barrett is competing with 1 legitimate starting scoring option and has a higher usage and MPG than both in their 2nd year.   Harden makes no sense because he was a 6th man playing 8 fewer minutes and was unbelievably efficient.   Beal was another guy on a well rounded team. He was maybe the 3rd option with Wall, Ariza, Gortat, and Nene rounding out the starters. All averaged over 13ppg, with Wall being the clear cut go to option.   Strange comparisons to make, especially with only 2 being shooting guards. Ignored some more logical comparisons like Booker, Mitchell, and SGA. But I get it, they made huge leaps in year 2 and it would provide way too much of a counter point."
I like RJ Barrett
"&gt; But you never hear that from other players or coaches on his team or the opposing teams.  probably because that's horrible PR and you don't see players or coaches shit on specific players really ever outside of rare situations? especially in the modern era  he got 1 more player vote than rj barrett for the allstar game, players aren't exactly high on westbrook either"
"&gt;squash  the other guys had pretty solid points but you just seem like a hater. ""He hasn't done anything to squash the doubt"" his biggest concern was his shooting hes currently shooting above leave average from three.  His rookie season wasn't ""terrible"" he struggled but it was in no way terrible. I feel like so many people on this site dont watch these players. You guys just look at the players ppg and ts% and than that how you judge a player. It wasn't a great season or even a good one but it was definitely not terrible.  The knicks werent sub .500 until like a week ago, they've been floating in between the 7th and 4th seed for most of the season. Why would that not be a factor? Team success is a major part of basketball  ""extreme inefficiency"" 45/38/73.5 shooting isn't great but it definitely isn't ""extreme inefficiency"" especially in the context of a 20 YEAR OLD. I dont think there's some RJ Barrett conspiracy I just think he's underrated"
RJ Barrett is the goat. Unbiased don‚Äôt look at my username
...How did you not know about RJ Barrett?
"Ready for the downvotes, but I find it corny as hell how RJ Barrett was deemed a bust in his first season, was snubbed from the all rookie team, and has basically been ignored for the majority of his sophomore season despite all his improvements because he was inefficient and on a bad team last year. Anthony Edwards rookie season so far is just as ""bad"" as RJ's rookie season statistically aside from PPG. He's even more inefficient and is on a worse team with a worse record than the Knicks last year but he has been getting nothing but praise and attention throughout this season and people are ready to call him rookie of the year (mostly because Lamelo is out).  The double standards are wack as hell. If people were ready to write RJ off as a 19 year old rookie why is that same energy not present for Anthony Edwards who is pretty much in the same exact situation? Miss me with all that man it's goofy. I'm sure Anthony Edwards is gonna have a solid season next year, but ROY of the discussion should be primarily about Lamelo Ball regardless of the games missed. Since apparently y'all care so much about the efficiency of a 19 year old rookie."
"Okay, let's play this game.   There's 30 teams in the NBA, which means 30 starting 3s.   We can call the top 6 ""elite"" and the next 6 ""above average"" and the next 6 ""average"" and the next 6 ""below average"" and the last 6 ""bad""  Does that work for you?   You're telling me there are fewer than 12 starting 3s who are better defenders than RJ Barrett?"

"The writers are kind of saying that about Barrett too.  The argument is that an elite role player makes a bigger impact than a not-really star that's forced into a lead role. It's not like Morant is in a high spot on the list either. I'd be fine with RJ in the 18-22 range though.  I disagree with the people saying this particular case is clickbait. The person who left him off his list is Pelton, who's not exactly a clickbait writer."
"If ESPN was really just trying to stir up contoversy, they would do something more drastic than leave out RJ Barrett. I think he genuinly just got left out. I was reffering to Jayson Tatum was put under Lamelo Ball"
"It's simple math, not some mystery equation.  * RJ Barrett after this game: 53.3% TS  * Siakam: still 54.8% TS  1 game out of 50+ isn't going to jump Barrett up multiple percentage points. If Barrett goes 14/14 next game and every single shot is a three *then* he will jump Siakam."
*Cananda's own RJ Barrett
"Rj Barrett is a good player. Just couldn't miss, even with bad passes ort bobbling the ball that shit was automatic."
"I love JB. He is an amazing offensive player and he is an all star for that very reason. But watching him on defense can be soooo frustrating. Like, it‚Äôs obvious he has the physical gifts to be a great defender and he has shown it from previous years all the way to that block at the end. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs scheme or low defensive IQ but they got like 6 wide open threes from it. He just falls asleep. I really hope he fixes it.   On a positive note tho, Romeo Langford looked great. Really good defense and the offensive rebounding was a pleasant surprise. I didn‚Äôt expect him to play this much right off the start but he is really showing he deserves it.  Also, RJ Barrett is something special. Knicks really got a good one with him. That whole top 4 of that draft can all become all stars and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all.  Jayson looked great outside of the ball handling issues which isn‚Äôt a normal thing, the Knicks threw **A LOT** of double teams at him and hopefully eventually he will get used to that, because they will keep coming.   Another positive, was the refs. This may end up getting many downvotes because this sub hates the Celtics and Celtics fans specifically for obvious and very fair reasons, but the refs have really not been on our side this year. Jayson and Jaylen get destroyed so much, just hacked over and over and get nothing and then I have to watch someone like Embiid or Harden (not as much this year) just throw it up essentially and get a foul call. But this game, though there were still bad calls (which is expected from Brothers and a rookie ref at this point), it seemed pretty even at least imo.  All around, solid game. Good defense, offense will be better with Kemba and Fournier, obviously."
Rj Barrett good upvotes to the right
"RJ ""Khris Middleton"" Barrett"
"WE WON A GAME OFFICIATED BY TONY BROTHERS! IT FEELS LIKE A MIRACLE!  Seriously though, what a fun, gritty game to watch. GG Knicks, that was a tough one. (p.s.- please don't let RJ Barrett be a new Khris Middleton against us...)"
RJ ‚ÄúCanadian Korver‚Äù Barrett
&gt;RJ Barrett will most likely be better than Sabonis.  What makes you think this?
"Just popping in to shoutout RJ Barrett, dude looks like he could live up to his pre draft potential"
RJ Barrett
"Lets be real, Sabonis hasn't won anything. He is not empty stats, but he is definitely overrated.   Julius Randle does the same thing as sabonis, also hasn't won anything.   RJ Barrett will most likely be better than Sabonis."
"RJ Barrett will end up being a better, and more consistent player than Ja Morant"
The whole article is about who you take long term. I‚Äôll gladly make a bet any day that RJ barrett is a dramatically better player than Collin sexton at his peak  Those ast numbers from a PG are terrible and he‚Äôs too short to be a true SG so I don‚Äôt know what to do with sexton long term
"yeahh even tho Sexton is the 1 option and Barrett isn‚Äôt, i don‚Äôt really see how you can take RJ over him."
"Sabonis is a center that can't defend his position.  RJ Barrett, if he pans out, will be much more like to help you win in the playoffs."
I'd take RJ Barrett over Sabonis long term tbh
"Yeah Knick fan here too, if anything at times he‚Äôs shown more than Barrett but they are both two similar players stat wise, but if anything Edwards had more help around him than RJ did year one."
Oh shit you guys got really salty after we fucked you up and RJ Barrett choked. Damn I didn't even realize.
He‚Äôs getting the RJ Barrett hate
Ah yes I‚Äôm sure RJ Barrett is more likely to be the next Wiggins then the guy who said he would give up basketball to be a football player. Also mentioned how he enjoys making music more ü§î
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
I think Wiseman and RJ Barrett are 2 guys who will likely shut up a lot of haters out there. Both of those dudes are 20 years old and going through growing pains in the NBA right now. They'll be fine once they're you know actual adults.
"this is hilarious. you‚Äôre exactly like the other trump supporters who think it‚Äôs okay to say china virus interchangeably with coronavirus because they think it‚Äôs the same thing. not just a phrase ‚Äúbig guy.‚Äù youre the one writing essays when talking about how you don‚Äôt care about this, &amp; how i‚Äôm salty but you‚Äôre not LMFAO biggest hypocrite on the thread! keep creating your own conclusions too, but for coming at me for doing the same. didn‚Äôt complain because you didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsuck the duck‚Äù off barrett, was merely trying to correct you and put in my thoughts but obviously you were salty af. i‚Äôll definitely enjoy rj barrett, while you keep posting your cards on reddit when no one gives a shit like a loser! LMFAO hilarious"
yeah he actually is less efficient than rookie rj was last year and barrett was crucified for it.
"It‚Äôs pretty obvious that your mind is made up my guy, enjoy building a team around RJ Barrett, I‚Äôm sure it will work out well. Save this comment and tell me how wrong I am 3 years in the future, I‚Äôll be waiting lol"
I think you‚Äôre missing another RJ Barrett
"3 lebrons, 1 jokic, 1 embiid, 4 james hardens, and 1 RJ barrett"
if i was rj barrett there i probably woulda cried when they read that quote to me shoutout to that man
"Actually I wrote it that way because I paused several times when writing the response to answer a work email, and couldn‚Äôt remember if it was 35 or 36 percent. Instead of going back and confirming, I used a broader term which applied to both.   But thanks for telling me about my narrative. Do you really think that I sit here waiting to flame RJ Fucking Barrett and need to create a narrative. Maybe a top 100 player in the league and you think people give that much thought to him. Seriously, get over yourself."
Mikal Bridges is far better than RJ Barrett. Come on.
No Rj Barrett in the top 25 makes me sad
Fact that RJ Barrett is not on here is wild as hell.
"Bro it was the teams plan not Anthony Edwards. The entire team decided and agreed that RJ Barrett was the one they wanted to take the shot. Or do you think he just made all that shit up just to piss RJ off? Like explain your reasoning behind what was said if it wasn't a calculated plan by the entire team. It doesn't even come off like shit talk, it reads like a risky plan (cause anyone could still make the shot, this is the NBA after all) that worked out because they played their odds.  Like far-be-it from me to judge the plan of an NBA team that actually worked from my desk."
"Bro let me quote the man himself  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Gladly, RJ Barrett caught it, and if he would have made the shot we would have lived with it because that‚Äôs who we wanted taking the shot. We didn‚Äôt want anyone else taking it.  &amp;#x200B;  He literally said they ONLY wanted RJ Barrett to shoot. Lmao. Nobody else period. Now personally speaking, if someone is making comments like this about you, it's on you not them. This wasn't even shit talk, you got called out cause the entire other team viewed you as the lowest potential threat and purposely exploited that. That's on yourself in that situation."

RJ Barrett time
"Why are people saying Zion wasn‚Äôt hyped?  He was extremely hyped?  Was it because he wasn‚Äôt #1 in his class?  The only people ahead of him were RJ Barrett and Marvin Bagley who were also very hyped.  Personally,  I think they knocked him to #2 because of his competition in HS while RJ was a freshman starter on Montverde.   I could remember Zion vs Lamelo amassing 120k viewers on Facebook live stream and that's completely unheard of.  Lamelo Ball was also extremely hyped being a freshman started on one of the best high school teams ever(Chino Hills)."
"He literally said ‚Äúthank god‚Äù Barrett got it and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs who we wanted to take the shot‚Äù. There were three other dudes on the court, he seemed to single out RJ."
"Perimeter: Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, Kawhi, Butler, OG, Draymond, Tatum  Paint: Gobert, Davis, Draymond, Embiid, Bam, Noel, Capela  Giannis does a little of everything, so I couldn‚Äôt really classify him for one of them. He‚Äôs more of a freelancer, but he‚Äôs very good at it. Clearly the defensive anchor for a top team.  Edit: I didn‚Äôt want to add him because it‚Äôs kinda of a homer take, but RJ Barrett has really impressed me as a perimeter defender. He‚Äôs shown that he can hang with the best in 1v1 situations and make it difficult for them."
"Wiseman, LaMelo (after literally his first NBA game), Ingram, RJ Barrett, Ayton (cause he wasn‚Äôt Luka)  This has been going on wayyyy before social media. Dirk was absolutely lambasted his first year and a half in the NBA."
Talking about efficiency in an RJ barrett post is WILD
"RJ has no room to talk, at all.  Last 15 games  Barrett: 19.1/5.4/3.4 and 2.1 turnovers on 55% TS%  Edwards 24.2/5/2.6 and 2.8  turnovers on 53 TS%"
"Anthony Edwards has improved since the start of the year. He is not the same player anymore.   Rj Barrett is improved from last year, but current Edwards &gt; current RJ"
"It kinda is an one off if it literally happened once throughout their histories... obviously I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not, but I‚Äôm not sure how confident I am about the Nets signing two superstars if we have a mediocre roster 10 years from now.   Also how many big FA signing have there been in the last decade, feel like most stars are traded not outright signed.  Kyrie to the Nets and Kawhi to the Clippers is a similar situation to the LeBron Cavs one. They wanted to go home. Furthermore Kyrie grew up a Nets fan. It seems like where you grew up is a pretty big factor. I can see RJ Barrett considering the Raptors in FA for that reason.  Location is obviously a thing, but people acting like it‚Äôs the only thing is a tad overboard.  On a side note it seems like smaller markets for one reason or another don‚Äôt even try to be in the running. Only ones who went for Kyrie and KD were the Nets and Knicks. The LeBron sweepstakes were between mainly the Lakers and Sixers."
"Yes, RJ Barrett does live in your head rent free."
Hint Knicks flair and RJ Barrett comment from Ant ring a bell
"&gt; I have you tagged as ""RJ Barrett weirdo""  I do too lmao"
Go to the RJ Barrett is disrespected thread and see the top comments. Literally all of them are either insulting Edwards or Minnesota.
"&gt;I replied to you because I have you tagged as ""RJ Barrett weirdo"" and still see you here making goofy RJ posts a week later.   And I'll tag you as the rent free guy  &gt;I'm sure you found some stupid replies in the Knicks sub like you'd find in any team sub when players go at each other. You think you're some sleuth journalist LOL.  Top comments literally  &gt;Nothing Ant said was even that damning. Was a funny little shot he threw at RJ and that's the end of it.   Yeah and your fanbase got so riled up they started calling him a POS.  &gt;I'm sorry the highlight of your season is completely irrelevant to anyone else lmao  Lmao you are not the highlight of our season. That would be the Phoenix game ‚úå"

"Better than RJ Barrett right now, no offense knicks fans"
"mavs knicks rivalry is hilarious  mavs: luv the knicks, gave us tingus pingus and hardaway for dennis smith jr, would you like trey burke for rj barrett  knicks: this is  lakers-celtics"
"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I‚Äôm going to win the lottery? Seems like you‚Äôre assuming there‚Äôs 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"
To add on to this point I took this [ten game stretch from earlier in the season ](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/rj-barrett-stat-from-january-13-to-january-31)
The Edwards vs RJ Barrett double standard on this sub is astounding to me. It's been going on all year.
"rj is better rn but next season edwards is gonna take a scoring and efficiency jump like most sophomores do and he'll become better than rj barrett, and dare to say i think edwards will be an all star and be a great scorer within the next 2-3 years. maybe even next year if everything pans out"
Rj Barrett
"&gt;	, it's already starting with the RJ Barrett comment  What comment are you referring to?"
RJ Barrett on the final possession last night:  3/31: 0/0/0/0/0 on 0/1 and 0/0 from three
I love Ja but he's closer to RJ Barrett than he is to Zion (which is more praise for Barrett than it is an indictment of Ja)
We got a spot for you AE at r/nba. Fuck RJ Barrett.
"Love this kid, his answers always feel real, not some rehearsed media training. Sucks people gonna turn on him for it, it's already starting with the RJ  Barrett comment"
"RJ: "".....and I took that personal!""  RJ Barrett is going to be this year's MVP!"
*RJ Barrett will remember that*
nba finals mvp RJ Barrett for you !!
"RJ is my boy but Edwards is actually spot on. Barrett has not converted on game tying or game winning shots this season. He‚Äôs missed about 4-5 from my memory this season. Still sucks that RJ is being disrespected üò™.   As for Edwards, it‚Äôs fun having a cocky rookie who‚Äôs talented. Still a long way to go but he‚Äôs the type of person to just speak his mind and talk."
"""Gladly, RJ Barrett caught it and, you know, if he woulda made the shot, we would live with it, I mean, cause that's who we wanted to take the shot. **We didn't want anybody else taking it.""**  lol"
RJ Barrett's advanced stats are terrible. His 3 point percentage is also bad. Barrett sort of high usage and 3 assists a game. His downsides are the exact things NBA analysts said his downfall would be. Current upside is he has 2-3 years before we know what type of player he will turn out to be.
RJ Barrett probably sees this quote and immediately goes to the gym to angrily work out. This man averaged 20 per night in March and continues to get better.
RJ Barrett against the TWolves this season:  2/21: 21/4/1/1/1 on 10/20 and 1/1 from three  3/31: 23/3/2/1/1 on 8/17 and 3/4 from three
What is RJ barrett doing on this play? he spends the whole just staring at the ball while not being close enough to actually help
"&gt;""We told Jaden try not to let Randle catch the ball... gladly RJ Barrett caught it, that's who we wanted taking that shot""  Oof"
This season for the Knicks is already a success regardless of how the rest of the season shakes. Kawhi going to the Clipppers there was no one there outside Shai ( who wasn't what he is now). We have an All Star caliber player already in Randle and  one potential in the making in RJ Barrett (hopefully). I am confident in any star player coming to the Knicks those two would not be on the wayout they are the core. We are under new management I do believe old management would of have done it / they tried to do it but we are not doing any quick fixes with NYK.
Same lol  Frank Ntilikina RJ Barrett Carmelo
Clearly he wants RJ Barrett to retire at age 30 and share his wisdom as to why he‚Äôs out of the league at 30 years old.
"RJ as in Richard Jefferson or RJ Barrett or RJ Hampton?  I personally want to see Kyrie, KD, Westbrook, Draymond. Basically all the ones r/nba have strong opinions about"
"Right now yeah, but in a few years it‚Äôs either gonna be shai or rj barrett"

RJ Barrett is getting noticeably better by the day so idc bout sos bring it on we making the playoffs.
"He had alot of potential but I agree he did suck, and that's what people are banking on potential, reminds me of a worse RJ barrett"
"No I actually had no idea that the owner of the team is the one who hired the president of basketball operation so thanks for that. Jesus fucking Christ.  What you actually said was that ‚ÄúBrO DOlAN NeEdS To StOp COntRoLlinG LiTeRaLLy EvErYThIng BruH.‚Äù.... which hasn‚Äôt been in the case in years. He hired Phil Jackson and stayed out of the way and Phil was an utter disaster so he fired him a few years later. He brought back Steve Mills and stayed out of the way and Mills was (predictably) an utter disaster so he fired a couple years later. Now he hired Leon Rose and has stayed out of the way and things are looking good so he won‚Äôt be fired as long as this keeps up.   The last time he intervened in a basketball decision was when he nixed the Kyle Lowry trade during the 2013-2014 season, a terrible decision as always.  But yeah you‚Äôre right, James D is making all the basketball decisions nowadays and also RJ Barrett is just a fringe starter, maybe.

I want to use these same analytics for Rj Barrett
Zion had the same issue at Duke. RJ Barrett was his Ingram
&gt; the Knicks being more popular on Reddit  He‚Äôs talking about us being more popular in NY. Which we are.  The Nets are looking like championship favorites with three superstar players and NY still gets more hype for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett lmao

ALL MY HOMIES LOVE RJ BARRETT
RJ. Barrett.
RJ Barrett. That is all.

"Imagine how good they'd be if they had taken Haliburton instead of Obi Toppin! Seriously, he could have taken Payton's minutes (during which they were outscored on the season) and also played off the ball with Rose in closing lineups. And he can defend too. Would have been a great fit, man.  I can't say anything, my dumbass disaster of a team took Killian Hayes. I've enjoyed watching this Knicks team, they play their asses off every night. Randle is just damn good and RJ Barrett improved tremendously from last year.  Too bad there aren't many good free agents this year, they'd actually be an attractive destination for once. Who's available the summer after this one?"
"The arguments for PG13 write themselves. Similar stats, similar efficiency, infinitely better spacing, better record. 2nd in net rating, 2nd in offensive rating, and 8th in defense versus the Heats'  21st, 7th, and 19th respectively. You're saying Kawhi might have an argument but if we're accounting for team success then there's no way Butler sniffs Kawhi and he doesn't even have a solid argument over PG13.  The case for Randle is that last year the team was 21-45 for something like a 30% win rate.  This year Randle is posting career highs as their first option and the Knicks are 38-31, which is the same record as the Heat while having what many thought was an inferior team in comparison to the Heat. If you had said that a team with RJ Barrett and Julius Randle as their stars would've had the same team record as the Eastern Conference Champs of 2020, you would've been laughed out the door. But here we are and by some accounts, they're the better team.   I'd like to see your arguments for Butler that aren't simply advanced stats"
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
Has RJ Barrett been this bad the whole time?
RJ Barrett getting jumped on in the locker room as we speak

Man fr Jamal SGA Wiggs woulda been a strong ass backcourt/wing lineup. They had a shit ton of talent on the bench too like rj barrett lu dort dillon brooks bradon clarke etc
RJ Barrett is having a fantastic season after being written off.
"We‚Äôll be rooting for (in some shape or form)  - RJ Barrett and the Knicks - Norman Powell and the Trail Blazers - Jonas Valanciunas, Dhillon Brooks and the Grizzlies - Steve Nash and the Nets (I know a few Canadian Suns fans that were still riding the 7SOL version of the team) - DeMar DeRozan and the Spurs"
You were wrong about RJ Barrett.

"Lonzo, Steven Adams, Bledsoe?  The Knicks are made of Randle, RJ Barrett, and NBA castaways."
The guy only got in because they snubbed rj barrett. He Didn‚Äôt deserve that shit.
Not that he doesn't like it. He wants to retire it out of respect to Kobe Bryant.  https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-kobe-bryant-rj-barrett-maple-mamba-nickname-hornets-20200129-3zhio2rolvfjfnx6c3ucpmu42a-story.html
"Ricky‚Äôs contract was so nice. The Ricky/Teague thing was the only Thibs decision I hated in the moment, although others in retrospect also ended up with poor outcomes. I guess Thibs just thought he knew better than conventional wisdom and could make it work with a bunch of guys that were seen as too ball-dominant to be on one collective team.  He probably learned some lessons in that and carried it on to the Knicks. I don‚Äôt read a lot of Knicks box scores but he seems to have chilled it with the stupid rotations, for example. T-Wolves Thibs would have had RJ Barrett playing 40 minutes per game."
I wanna say its a small but vocal minority because I see a lot of raptors fans happy for the knicks. Granted rj barrett is from the GTA.
"idk where the RJ Barrett hate came from tbh. Dude was in the front page in the preseason shooting wide open airballs. I feel like this sub highkey wants to pounce and sack on the next Anthony Bennett doesn't matter where he gets drafted. Nothing makes them feel more ""superior"" than shitting on other fanbases that made a drafting mistake."
"We are the most valuable team in the nba and one of the most valuable teams in sports period but we‚Äôve been the laughing stock of the nba for years. Consistently making bad moves, bad draft picks and just being bad. We were the go to team when making a joke. In 2019 we drafted RJ Barrett with the 3rd pick in the draft and we signed Julius Randle who was never considered that good of a player. Recently, Julius Randle has made an insane jump and he‚Äôs become an allstar this season. Our team isn‚Äôt as good as others but we play hard defense and hustle harder than every other team and we‚Äôve surpassed expectations. We have a few young players with potential, rj barrett, Immanuel Quickley we drafted with the 25th pick, Mitchell Robinson, Obi toppin he‚Äôs a high flyer dunker. And we have good vets, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players in the nba and would probably be an all time great but injuries ruined his career. This year he has been really good but in his prime before the injuries he was a top 10 player in the nba. Julius Randle is our teams leader. New York has two teams, us and the nets. The nets are one of the best teams in the league but most New Yorkers don‚Äôt really like them. We also play in Madison square garden.   Here are some videos about us currently   https://youtu.be/CDPJ2hlboAM  https://youtu.be/KvODVmmraZU   Here‚Äôs one of our best games this season   https://youtu.be/qRNZ7qaIwu8    Here‚Äôs a video about why we have been so bad throughout the years    https://youtu.be/TjmtQ-oee9E"
"&gt;don‚Äôt come here acting like you know shit when you clearly don‚Äôt   I‚Äôm not the one making a ridiculous claim that RJ Barrett, who can‚Äôt create his own shot without help, is better than Ja, who is the only guy on a horrible grizzlies squad."
I think RJ Barrett is a great player and a future super star
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/nesn.com/2021/04/espns-top-under-25-nba-list-has-jayson-tatum-behind-lamelo-ball/amp/  Outside of bridges, Zo who here is RJ Barrett better than? Especially given that the list is missing garland and some other guys."
"1. Julius Randle.  He‚Äôs risen to a whole new level this season that I didn‚Äôt think he had in him going into the year. When we signed him I hoped we were getting an all star and he‚Äôs proven to be even more after a rough first year.  2. RJ Barrett.  He quietly improved on both sides of the ball significantly, and after today he raised his season 3P% to 40%. Still a teenager as well 3. Mitchell Robinson.  Even though he‚Äôs been hurt the majority of this season, he‚Äôs so important for us. If we had him this year, we‚Äôd be even scarier. Noel is locking his position down for us and he‚Äôs the 5th most important Knick imo.   The other honorable mention in 4th is D Rose, he just proved how clutch he is and how good he is at his role. I think that he will be a legit 6MOTY contender next year if we resign him. He should be a Knick for life imo.   Also, I think Westbrook is definitely 2 or 3 on the wizards despite his age and contract because I think his play is what‚Äôs carried the wizards down the stretch here. Plus if you look at it the other way, he could end up in a future trade if his play continues to bring wins, as teams will take the contract."
RJ Barrett /s
Who would‚Äôve guessed RJ Barrett would be a 40% 3 point shooter before he could legally drink
Never forget that:  -RJ Barrett didn't make an All-Rookie team  -RJ Barrett wasn't named on ESPN's dumb list of top 25 players under 25  Put some respect on the kid's name
RJ Barrett: officially shooting over 40% from 3 for the year!
"Gotta be really proud of how RJ Barrett played defense, especially against Kawhi. One of the most underrated players in the league."
The 3 and D upgrade version of RJ Barrett is almost complete
RJ Barrett is a two way star in the making
"That's my man RJ Barrett.  Bricks a wide open 3.  Fails to get back at 100% and gives up a layup.  Then he gets yelled at by Thibs, which is essentially the real life equivalent to getting sucked off by a dementor.    So then he gets back and drills the 3.  That's my dude.  He ain't soft."
Rj Barrett will literally go 5-6 in one quarter and then just never shoot again until the 4th quarter
"I love RJ Barrett but he fits this description kind of perfectly. Even though it‚Äôs not even his fault when he‚Äôs hot sometimes, our ‚Äúpoint guard‚Äù Elfrid Payton doesn‚Äôt even look his way."
Pretty sure Rj Barrett is on the knicks.

I wouldn't say most disappointing, but I think Ja Morant has been relatively disappointing in the sense that he hasn't made a jump from rookie year to sophomore year, he kinda just stayed stagnant. Also maybe Tyler Herro, big things was expected of him after his play in the playoffs last season but he hasn't made a jump either."
RJ barrett sort of ticks off both of those boxes for me
RJ Barrett 2 free throws lol.  Knicks getting out hustled but that is ludicrous.
"RJ Barrett almost never gets a call to go his way.     He's more likely to get calls against him than for him, and because he doesn't really argue for it, he probably still won't moving forward."
"Teams get dismantled fast. Look at the Warriors from 2019 to 2020. Look at how fast the Nets fell apart after the Pierce-Garnett trade.      It's all about maximizing the odds. The odds that any one pick turn out decent? Slim. The odds that you get a decent pick out of the +4/+3? Pretty good. The odds that you can take your multiple first rounders and move them for the final piece? Also pretty good.         To put it simply, which is more likely? The Knicks having the assets to trade for Zion or the Pelicans having the assets to trade for RJ Barrett. (Or you could do Memphis and Ja Morant if you want.)"
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
"You're right, why even compare that midget to the towering 6 7 monster RJ Barrett"
Will you downvote me if I say Rj Barrett is better than ANT üò≥üò≥
"Wym, Wiseman still has that all-star potential. He‚Äôs probably gonna have the same trajectory as RJ Barrett in that he will improve drastically in his second year. Next year when Klay comes back, that‚Äôs when you need Wiseman to step up."
"Exactly look at the takes on RJ Barrett for example. Just gotta give them some time tbh, rookies make mistakes and learn it‚Äôs the literally a big adjustment coming from college level to the actual league with 10 year vets who know all the tricks"
"The casual NBA fan looks at Anthony Edwards points and thinks he is phenomenal. The fact is RJ Barrett missed the all rookie 1st, 2nd, and 3rd team with better efficiencies last year and was killed by the voters for his efficiency. Anthony Edwards is the worst rated rookie for defense. Looking into LEBRON metrics you can see he has less wins added than other top rookies, his efficiency kills his offensive metrics and you have to filter to the worst D-LEBRON stat to find him. It really isn't as close as people think it is. The ""highlight"" factor of Edwards is the only  thing keeping him in the race.  Thats why it is -1000. Voters aren't casual box score watchers.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://gyazo.com/8c2667175cf6e57b8cadcb63bc61be04](https://gyazo.com/8c2667175cf6e57b8cadcb63bc61be04)  [https://gyazo.com/f5189f157b195295f19caf1c51ad0d9d](https://gyazo.com/f5189f157b195295f19caf1c51ad0d9d)"
"Russ, Lavine, Ja, LaMelo, Dort  Honorable mention: RJ Barrett i knew i wasnt wrong about u"
1. FVV 2. Lowry 3. RJ Barrett 4. Dame 5. Jokic
Don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm rooting for team canada this season RJ BARRETT gonna expose that team
? Uh I guess if you want to assume key players like 20 year old RJ Barrett and 26 year old Julius Randle have hit their ceiling then sure that might be a reasonable take. But here on earth we don‚Äôt make those wack assumptions
No one is confusing RJ Barrett for Ron Artest either lmao. You don't know what you're talking about
protect RJ Barrett
Not sure what kind of point OP is trying to make. RJ Barrett has been a solid roleplayer for the Knicks while Zion and Ja are bonafide superstars-in-the-making as clear #1s on their teams.
"Derrick Rose, Quickley, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and I guess I‚Äôd go Embiid over Jokic. But close"
Rose is our sixth-man. Starting shooting guard is mostly RJ Barrett with Reggie Bullock starting at small forward. Burks and Quickley are our SGs off the bench.
Except for the last game the hawks were up by 12 when Trae got hurt in the 3Q... that was out first look of the hawks with Nate the great vs the Knicks and Randle wasn‚Äôt getting it done until the momentum changed following the injury...  I think Spo is scary In Playoffs and would take my chances of doubling randle and making RJ Barrett beat us 4 games out of 7... I like those chances a lot despite his improvement this year
Led by notorious snipers RJ Barrett and Julius Randle haha  Jk Reggie Bullock is the greatest shooter who ever lived
Oh there were multiple? Yikes. I guess I meant the last one RJ Barrett
Everyone gangsta until Rj Barrett starts taking step back 3‚Äôs.
"Quickley's trigger is quicker than Rose's, but both are high-volume 6th men during their minutes for sure. That doesn't really make either of them the 2nd option though. Rose takes an extra FGA/36 more than Barrett, while RJ gets an extra free throw. The gap in volume there is splitting hairs, and that's without taking into account that RJ spends a greater share of his minutes passing up looks for Randle. Rose's per-minute volume would decrease if his minutes increased, same as most 6th men.  &gt;Kind of like luol deng back in the day - yeah he'd score but it was more of a product of his minutes  RJ only plays 34.8MPG, he's a far cry from what Deng used to be logging."
"Who is second? When rose is on the court he's the clear nr 2 behind Randle. Barrett or a role player takes the third spot, but the drop-off is pretty big. RJ puts up 18 a game but with a very high minute load that spreads the impact over a long stretch of game. Kind of like luol deng back in the day - yeah he'd score but it was more of a product of his minutes than his role as a primary scoring option."
RJ Barrett looks high all the time lmao
"With the cap space and RJ Barrett likely getting significantly better under Thibs this summer, it‚Äôs hard to see the Knicks not being even better next year."
"I thought Ant might be in the vein of rj barrett/andrew wiggins/demar derozan with good but not great upside.  Watching him the past month, I don't know anymore.  He wont be better than Lamelo this year or next or the year after, but he has such physical tools that when his proprioception catches up to his explosiveness in his mid 20s he might be worth his draft position."
"&gt;Luka ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Doncic  This is disrespectful to the real Magic. Let Luka earn/have his own nickname, dont rehash legendary nicknames. What next? Will Gobert be the Diesel? Change RJ Barrett from Maple Mamba to Black Mamba? Joel The Dream Embid?"
"If you like betting on props, MPJ points, Darius Garland points &amp; RJ Barrett 3 pointers have been $$$ the past few weeks.  But by this point its not like the people that set the odds haven't noticed. For about 5 games all their numbers were pretty achievable, but they'll probably start to get higher now"
"I used to not kinda like Ant, but now I‚Äôve come around on him, mainly because he unlocked Clutch RJ Barrett with his comments."
"This take is fucking glacier tier, holy shit. A Knicks fan complaining that people called RJ a bust but he has a massive turnaround year two. What do you do with that, being a Knicks fan? Turn it around and try to call other players busts in year one. Mind boggling.  You'd think you'd fucking learn with a guy like Barrett going from crap to pretty good, but instead you triple down and try to do to another guy what plenty of others did to Barrett. It's just so out of touch it's not even funny. Wiseman is fucking 19, dude."
RJ Barrett was leagues more effective during his troubled rookie season than Wiseman.   People don‚Äôt understand just how poorly Wiseman grades out. It‚Äôs more than mistakes. It‚Äôs basically he needs to be a completely different basketball player.
"Case in point: RJ Barrett. Rj was quite literally one of the worst players in the league on offense his rookie season, shooting horrendously everywhere, even in transition. His 48%TS will tell you just that  Now he's at league average TS% the past 50 games after his horrible 12 first games since overhauling his shot. 8 point increase in TS%, and has improved scoring/shooting everywhere on the court. Improved PNR Handling, ISO, transition, and spot-ups, and shot 48% from three this April"
"Rj barrett didnt play a whole season and was claimed to be a bust faster than any 3rd pick in nba history. Wiseman is worse, plays on a better team with supposedly ""the best pg of our generation"" and still looks unplayable.   Wiseman is the biggest bust in the last 2 decades."
RJ Barrett
Nothing but confirmation bias here.  You can't point to this and say that the compressed season led to more injuries.  I can point to the fact that Julius Randle led the league in minutes and played all but 1 game.  RJ Barrett wasn't too far behind and didn't miss one.  It's all just factors but to go around and finger point isn't correct.  Not everyone has the luxury to have less games played meaning less money in their pockets.  Those extra games could make a difference for those guys.  We have to take into account that the PA okayed this so this wasn't some unilateral decision by the league.
SGA/RJ Barrett/Lu Dort/Andrew Wiggins/Dillon Brooks
Just like RJ Barrett too!
"I‚Äôm a neutral fan, I‚Äôd would much rather tune in for KD, Kyrie, and Harden over Julius Randle and RJ Barrett. Y‚Äôall act like the Knicks are this mythical brand that everyone wants to see thrive, it‚Äôs the opposite, it‚Äôs a huge brand that historically underperforms."
People might scoff but RJ Barrett has some pierce to his game
I remember people saying this about RJ Barrett last year. Then he started hitting 40% of his threes...
I'm not a Mavericks fan you dolt lmao. And your organization is the Knicks. They've been the laughing stock of the league for a decade. LMFAO. The future of your franchise hinges on RJ fucking Barrett LOOOL
"Capela is a better defender than Bam imo, and probably Noel too. RJ Barrett will probably be a Defensive selection in the next few years."
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
RJ Barrett   Julius Randle  Steph Curry   Mitchell Robinson   Me
RJ Barrett
"I‚Äôm so ready to move on from the lebron era and see a more interesting nba landscape of future stars like Luka, jokic, giannis, zion etc.   It was just so boring seeing lebron vs curry every year   Can‚Äôt wait to see what RJ Barrett will be like in 3-4 years from now."
1. Derrick rose  2. RJ Barrett  3. Julius Randle  4.  Immanul Quickley  5. Mitchell Robinson   They deserve it more than anyone else
Lakers vs Nets. Don‚Äôt matter that the Knicks have a larger market. LeBron and AD vs Harden and KD is more casual friendly then LeBron and AD vs Randle and RJ Barrett
"Meanwhile the 3rd pick has produced LaMelo, RJ Barrett, Luka, Tatum, Brown, and Embiid and Bradley Beal in the last 10 years"
"Idk man, you guys have an improving RJ Barrett and a D Rose giving similar/better performances at a fraction of the cost. But you guys do have money and Schr√∂der would only help your playoff runs in the future."
1. Trae game winner in game one was unbelievable! I was vibrating with excitement.  2. Bogi hitting the shot at the end of game one of the sixers game and then Shushing the crowd. Probably the loudest I have ever yelled bang in my life!  3. John Collin getting the alley oop and 1 near the end of game one against the sixers. I could not stop screaming   4. Trae taking a bow at MSG game 5   5. Bogi somehow collecting the ball after it hit RJ Barrett right in the chest and draining the three to keep us in game 1
Rj Barrett
"C'mon, RJ Barrett is definitely a useful asset for a rebuilding team. With how much he improved from year 1 to 2, I think he could be an All-Star next year."
"Fuck it let's make it an orgy, throw in Siakam, Fournier, Batum, RJ Barrett, DORT"
"I really don‚Äôt like hating, but i dont think you‚Äôre too far off.  What I take issue with is that if NBA talents who have NBA resources want to improve, they will. Take DeAndre Jordan from the foul line, or RJ Barrett going from a 32% 3pt shooter to a 40% in one season.  I‚Äôm very far from behind the scenes but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that the guy still can‚Äôt even kind of shoot"
We got two amazing years from your Tim Hardaway whom your (guess the word) incompetent organization couldn‚Äôt use.   15 years of lottery and RJ Barrett is your bragging point. Damn how sad.   We don‚Äôt want your 30% playoff Randle. He has been begging to play for his home town for years and we keep saying no.
"?  RJ barrett is our highest pick since ewing and he was third overall  you dont actually have 40% from 3 tim he's a free agent and he's going to want a raise  and you absolutely would take randle just to get off the KP contract, like it's not even a question the mavs front office would do that immediately no matter what you seem to think.   ""still shoots better than that"" he's a career 41% shooter and league average from 3 point  you really don't know anything about this stuff do you"
"Who‚Äôs getting screwed? Serious question, I think both those dudes suck. McCollum is a black hole and RJ Barrett put up basically the same numbers per 36 as Tyler Herro. A team that‚Äôs win now like the Knicks are pretending to be would probably prefer the established volume scorer. The rebuild would probably prefer the 20 year old. If it‚Äôs a matter of making the salaries match, I figured Noel would get them to the 80% or whatever."
RJ Barrett for CJ??  Is this real life?
"Assuming Dame demands a trade:  - McCollum for RJ Barrett and Nerlens Noel (S&amp;T). - Dame for Bam, Duncan Robinson (S&amp;T works bc $5 mil cap hold), Herro, FRP (after OKC unprotects); throw in Nunn if Portland wants, they‚Äôll have to add salary filler. - Re-sign Powell.  Core Rebuild of Bam (23), Herro (21), Duncan (27), RJ Barrett (20), Nunn (25), Noel (25), Powell (28), FRP.  Who says no? Maybe the Knicks."
if I'm lucky RJ barrett
No. I like RJ Barrett.
"He's 12th in the league in Offensive Rebounds.  It's actually his defensive rebounds that are so low. Below Steph, LaMelo, Jaylen Brown, RJ Barrett. etc."
"Bruh they took the clippers to 7. No doubt in my mind they can take on the knicks and finish em off lmao. If Luka scored 35 ppg against Kawhi Leonard, he is for sure scoring more against Rj Barrett.  Plus Julius Randle is not about to put up Kawhi Leonard type stats lmao. Kawhi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Randle and the mavs almost beat the clippers."
RJ Barrett will be what we expected Andrew Wiggins to be
Things I did not expect to see today:  - an RJ Barrett and *God Emperor of Dune* crossover
"Ya, Young did not play the Clippers. RJ Barrett and Julius Randle is not in the same conversation as Kawhi and PG.  Not to mention that Luka has Tim Hardaway JR as the only respectable teammate where as Young has a decently built roster.  Garbage takes as usual 1 minute after a series lmao."
Steve Nash and his godson RJ Barrett? He might have even played against Rowan Sr
"Bron just lost to the fuckin Suns. Lue was the best assistant coach in basketball for years. He‚Äôs still a top X and Os coach. He makes great in bounds plays. What fucking world do we live in where his assistant gets credit for that series?   Thibs just led the Knicks to the playoffs for the first time in years. He did it with Julius Randle who the league forgot about, RJ Barrett, old ass D Rose who he got for a second and a bunch of toys everyone threw away.    That team lost in the playoffs. No shit. The Hawks were well coached and talented. Thibs put together an incredible coaching performance all year to pull that together as a 4 seed. At what point does winning more than losing matter? Just never? Only when a new flashy coach does it so we can shit on the old guard? So stupid"
We're not trading away RJ Barrett
We aren't trade Dame for RJ barrett and some picks lmao.
"The issue is Barrett. If the Knicks give him up Dame really isn‚Äôt coming into a better situation. If the Knicks can keep RJ and give up a boatload of 1st along with IQ, Robinson ect it might work.   Idk if Portland will accept though"
RJ Barrett has potential to become a star
Lmao did RJ Barrett murder your family or something?
RJ Barrett is 20 years old by the way
"Yes actually, he's become pretty much automatic from the corners and is a great shooter. He just can't defend and sometimes looks mentally shot.   To put this into perspective in his rookie year he guarded the best player on the opposing team every night and was basically handed the ball and asked to score.   Fizdale's staff has done other suspect shit in the past too. Like RJ Barrett came out and said before his rookie year he was working with Drew Hanlen and changed his shot, and when he came in to work with Fiz's team they forced him to change it again, like two or three months before the season.  I think Kevin just didn't have anyone teach him to fill the holes in his game early, and his confidence is shot."
"You can't ignore what happened in this series, but at the same time the Knicks should keep this team together and improve it.  And I also think the Knicks are going to have a hard time evaluating their assets now. It's hard to evaluate teams that are deemed to be overachievers. But since these usually fall into your lap, it's hard not to like it and be optimistic moving forward.  Problem is maybe you could capitalize now rather than let your assets get ""exposed"", which is definitely a possibility all things considered. What would you think of a trade involving RJ Barrett and picks for a player who may improve the team straight away?"

Agree. Today you had some reporter asking RJ Barrett about how he‚Äôd view the season if it ends tonight. And now trying to ask an athlete this when they‚Äôre at a low and most vulnerable. There are some writers doing good work but some just want that sound bite.
Knicks were hoping RJ Barrett was the next T-Mac. He‚Äôs shown to be the next DeRozan at best.
"Jeez. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm guaranteeing the Knicks will be back, but I‚Äôm tempted to save this clown ass comment for posterity. I‚Äôll check back in with you in a year.  For the record, if I‚Äôm the Knicks, I‚Äôm building around Randle, Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Mitch Robinson, and I think the Knicks have the Mavs‚Äô 1st rounder as well as some other teams‚Äô picks. RJ is literally a 2nd year, 20 year old, #3 overall pick who has already jumped his game from year 1, and from earlier in the season.   RemindME! 1 year"
"Ranked lowest in the entire league. Lowest payroll in the league. Quickley D+ draft grade. No future, cursed, etc.   This Knicks team overcame everything to bring the most exciting basketball I've seen in a long time for New York. This season, although seemingly irrelevant now, marks a huge turning point for the Knicks. The Knicks have a homegrown future star in RJ Barrett. The Knicks have a sleeper pick in Immanuel Quickley that has sky high potential. All Star forward in Randle, despite the disappointing series. Even Obi already looked completely different at the end of the playoff series in a good way. I am so excited for what this Knicks team will become and this is the most optimistic I can be about Knicks basketball in a long, long time. This hurts more than I could've possibly imagined right now but it'll just make the future that much brighter. Hawks are just a better team. Next year we'll be back.   NEW YORK FOREVER."
Siakam is not a fraud AT ALL.  Randle is tho. Same with RJ Barrett  Only ballers on the Knicks were Bullock and Rose
"So motherfucking proud to be a Knicks fan. Proud of every single fucking player on this team including Elfrid motherfucking Payton. Never dreamed we would be a 4 seed in the playoffs getting 3 fucking games at MSG WITH THE BEST FUCKING FANS ON THE PLANET. Would have loved to see this series with Big Meech but even so happy with how the young guns have stepped up, IQ, OBI and RJ Motherfucking Barrett (20 years old btw)  Time for a motherfucking chopped cheese    True basketball fans know that the game is better when the Knicks are good and sorry but NYC will always be Knickstape...  YERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
RJ BARRETT INTERVIEW MEME INCOMING
"There loss isn‚Äôt on won soul player, it‚Äôs on the hole team two create open looks, space the floor etc.  There will bee a few player changes next year and RJ Barrett will grow further. The Hawks are a year or 2 ahead in team development then the Knicks.  So cry away and cum back stronger next year mate"
RJ Barrett is just too unathletic and not skilled enough
"RJ ""We'll see tomorrow."" Barrett."
RJ Barrett gives me big MKG vibes
"RJ Barrett ""We're winning this game""   Also RJ Barrett: 3-10"
RJ Barrett is just MKG with an uglier face
RJ Barrett has always been inefficient so I‚Äôm not surprised but I‚Äôm shocked at this Julius Randle meltdown
RJ Barrett is still playing like Casper the friendly ghost.
"Yeah I‚Äôm disappointed in Randle‚Äôs performance. I‚Äôm a fan. And RJ Barrett needs to step up, this is his time to shine as a young star..."
#DeAndre Hunter - Made the Playoffs  #RJ Barrett - Made the Playoffs  #Ja Morant - Made the Playoffs  #ZION WILLIAMSON - PLAYOFF VIRGIN
"Capela, Kuzma, randle, RJ Barrett, Lanzo, Teague, any Kentucky player, any NC player and especially any duke player."
Hey Knicks fans where this coming all-star that no one is talking about in RJ Barrett?
RJ Barrett is like a middle class mans JR Smith
I remember there was a time RJ Barrett was considered a better player than Zion
RJ Barrett stinks
RJ Barrett is so wild at the rim
rj barrett don't want no stupid ass questions post-game
RJ ‚Äúwe're winning this game‚Äù Barrett just gonna let Randle shoot the Knicks to a blowout loss?
"""RJ BARRETT GUARANTEES KNICKS VICTORY"""
Berman wrote that exact article based on this question.    [https://nypost.com/2021/06/02/rj-barrett-snaps-on-stupid-ass-question-with-knicks-guarantee/](https://nypost.com/2021/06/02/rj-barrett-snaps-on-stupid-ass-question-with-knicks-guarantee/)
"I do not know if you have watched any of Hawks-Knicks games but if you have, you should clearly see that Atlanta is a much better basketball team than New York. Trae young is playing better than Julius Randle and Derrick Rose.  The Knicks have poor offence but good defence. The hawks have good offence and good defence.  However, The New York Knicks might win today at home if Randle and RJ Barrett show up. In that case, Atlanta Hawks can win game 6 in Atlanta."
"""I'm RJ Barrett, y'all know who I am"" energy."
rj barrett is hinting at the fact that he has used a time machine but cannot outright discuss it due to potential scrutiny from the government and other nefarious forces PLACE YOUR BETS NOW
RJ Barrett
"Randle &amp; RJ Barrett, duh"
RJ Barrett is 20 years old
RJ Barrett
Hot Take: RJ Barrett will be an All-Star next year
"Be prepared for Marv Albert to call RJ Barrett ""Elfrid Payton"" because 6 and 9 looks similar to him"
RJ BARRETT IS 20 YEARS OLD! Can y‚Äôall just stop with these stupid fucking questions!?
"He didn‚Äôt do anything at Duke except hold Zion back. That team was atrocious spacing wise and RJ Barrett was constantly ball hogging and refusing to pass to Zion, which is probably why they lost in the elite 8."
"I doubted RJ a lot, but if you watch him play you know he is going to be good real soon. He does everything well and has basically elevated every facet of his game to the NBA level in one offseason. RJ is a bit conservative on offense because he is trying to perfect his craft without hurting the team. His strength is driving to the hoop, but the Knicks lack of shooters has resulted in RJ having to shoot a lot more. I think he will put it all together and he averages at least 20/5/5 next season. In my eyes, his floor is Demar Derozan and ceiling is RJ Barrett."
"Nate McMillan, there is a way to beat the Knicks. Please watch any Knicks game. You need to stop RJ Barrett and Julius Randle by having the guard defend Derrick Rose and the big man drop to intimidate Randle. If he or RJ takes a shot, that is a win."
"The Bigger Picture:  Rj Barrett is a bust.  Randle is good but when double-teamed he can't produce and he's not a good passer either.  For the ATL - Trae Young is an All-Star, Bogi is a Star, D Hunter is a Star.  Still have Cam Reddish too."
Jordan Poole&gt;RJ Barrett
"Party at MSG is going to over soon  .  Rose is the best player in  2021  in your team, Please . What he did for Knicks is awesome .  Sorry - Knicks need big stars . Randle is back to old Randle .. RJ Barrett disappeared"
"I know people give Randle and to a lesser degree RJ Barrett (tho he's been pretty good today) flack and rightfully so, but for being the primary shooter Bullock has been awful too and I hear nothing about it"
Fuck the media for not even voting for RJ Barrett last year.
"Wow, Marc Jones repeating the story about RJ Barrett going to Orlando word for word from Game 3 üòÇüòÇ"
DeAndre Hunter is who RJ Barrett wishes he was
RJ Barrett better start taking some mandarin classes
The fuck happened to RJ Barrett. He's not getting any special attention. He's been open too.
what does rj barrett do
RJ Barrett will make a great Beijing Duck one day I swear to god
already regretting betting RJ Barrett over 15.5 pts
‚ÄúRJ Barrett is better than Tyler Herro‚Äù
If you‚Äôre relying on RJ Barrett as a 2nd or 3rd option you won‚Äôt win anything.
"Unbiased opinion as I don't support either team but yiiiiikkkkkes!!!  What on earth happened to Randle??  Guy has been absolutely missing the last 3 games. Got his MIP trophy and called it quits?  RJ Barrett? Dude was killing the corner 3's and now can't buy a bucket to save his life.  Hawks are clearly a more talented team and were shooting the lights out, but after they kill the Knicks, they're gonna get destroyed.  If you just barely beat the Knicks with 2 of their 3 best players phoning it in, you're in trouble.  Regardless. Hawks will take the next two games. Randle will  either get traded or get the max next year (neither option is great).   Knicks will make Knicks moves in the off season and it's back to square one."
Yet again RJ Barrett is disrespected lol. All good though; he's gonna eliminate all the doubters
"KD, Lebron, Steph, Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic, Harden, Embiid, Luka and RJ Barrett"
Knicks: RJ Barrett + All future possible future picks of theirs + Pick swaps to get around the Stepien Rule and then maybe the Blazers could get the Mavs to remove the protections on the Mavs's 2023 pick (which they'll get from the Knicks) to take on the Porzingis contract
"&gt; Your downside is you've got another Matisse Thybulle on your hands that you just burned a Top 5 pick on.  2019 redraft, where does Thybulle go? Top 3 are pretty obviously Zion, Morant and Garland imo, but after that it gets a lot shakier. I'm not saying anyone should take Thybulle over RJ Barrett, but he's got a pretty strong case to go over Jaxson Hayes."
"Rj barrett, knicks ecf, celtics blow up, okc title, jalen green mvp, bronny and bron ring, booker mvp"
"RJ Barrett will be considered a top 15 player in the league  Knicks will make it to the ECF once in this timespan   Celtics blow up their core and rebuild  Kevin Durant leaves the Nets (without winning a ring) when he‚Äôs a FA and goes back to OKC, and leads them to a ring  Luka Doncic is the best player in the league (but on a different team)  Like you said, Kawhi retires early  Cade Cunningham is first team All NBA in 2026, leads the pistons to the ECF, but is not the best player in his draft  Jalen Green wins an MVP in 2026 and leads the Rockets to the finals  Kings finally make the playoffs  Lebron retires in 2025, after playing with Bronny. Wins a ring with Bronny.   Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
You're an idiot then lmao  RJ? You don't want to give up RJ Barrett for Damian Lillard?
"Every defensive metric certainly doesn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs below average. That‚Äôs just wrong.  He was in the 60th percentile of d-epm. Tatum was in 54th along with Middleton, below average would be like Lowry in the 46th percentile of Dame in the 33rd. Jaylen‚Äôs closer to Mikal Bridges, Steven Adams, and KD among others than he is to being below average.  He‚Äôs above average in d-raptor too for this past regular season. Some guys below him (below average with numbers in the negative) include KD,  RJ Barrett, Siakam, Middleton, Lowry, CP3, and Tatum. The difference between him and Tatum was more than the difference between him and Dejounte Murray, Lebron, Lonzo, Ayton and Adams as well as equal to the difference between him and Mikal Bridges and Jrue. He‚Äôs historically been above average in raptor too.  The stat he generally doesn‚Äôt look good in is regular season dbpm but even that doesn‚Äôt carry over to his postseason numbers. He also generally raises his game in the postseason. While playing less games than the Miami Heat players, he had the 4th highest total defensive win shares last postseason after Tatum, Lebron, and AD."
"Those picks dont have much value anymore though, since its overwhelmingly likely they will not be lottery. A few picks in the 15-30 range ain't gonna be enough to get it done. RJ Barrett+All their 1st+ Swaps would be the bare minimum."
"You need to already have *something* to build your championship team out of trades. There's no loaded F.A. class like there was for Miami, and they're not making themselves available to a couple of superstars looking for somewhere to team up. The Knicks core would be Dame Lillard and Randle, since they're not keeping RJ Barrett if they want Dame. I'm just not convinced that Randle/Dame/a player they can get with remaining picks is going to be at the level of competition that matches the price tag."
I know the Knicks front office is pretty stupid. But no team is stupid enough to turn down a Dame Lillard trade to keep RJ Barrett.
"A player like lillard will draw people to the Knicks, you really think that having RJ Barrett is better for the Knicks to recover as a prime nba market than having a top 10 player in the nba?"
"Damian Lillard is Damian Lillard tho. RJ Barrett can be anybody, even Damian Lillard"
"RJ Barrett, Randle, Robinson, future draft picks can make it happen"
"Pretty much.  I've literally been a Blazers fan since Dame was drafted. I'm from the UK, so I'm an odd man out being a basketball fan at all.   Got NBA 2k14, got drafted playing to Dame and that was it. Seeing him become the best point guard in the NBA (don't @ me) has been incredible.  But if he wants to leave, I understand. I've felt the same years of frustration as he has. If he does have to leave though, I hope we make out like BANDITS. Gimme all of the Knicks young talent and future draft picks and go full rebuild.  Raid the Warriors for CJ and Nurk, get Wiseman alongside RJ Barrett."
"Yeah. Send out McCollum, Nurk, Dame. Get Ben, RJ Barrett and a couple first"
"Simons, CJ, Ben, Roco, Nurk  Not bad but they still don‚Äôt have any depth. I‚Äôd strongly consider just getting a bunch of picks and a young stud if I‚Äôm Portland.  MPJ and picks from the nuggets. RJ Barrett and Quickly + picks from NYK. Wiseman + Wiggins + picks from GS"
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn‚Äôt be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That‚Äôd leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I‚Äôd rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"Ahh shit, here we go again.  Dame in NY conflicts me greatly, because while he‚Äôs one of my favorite players I‚Äôd like to see a rebuild through for once, and I also really like RJ Barrett, who almost assuredly would have to be in the package.   Elsewise the best assets we‚Äôd have to dangle is probably Mitch Rob, Obi, IQ, and most of our picks in the next few years. In a vacuum n or a bad package‚Ä¶but for Dame? No way."
"Knicks don't have a very competitive offer, but would be downright malpractice to not trade for him because he doesn't ""fit the timeline"" of fucking Julius Randle and RJ Barrett"
The Knicks are putting RJ Barrett on a train yesterday if they can get Dame.
"I don't see it at all.  The problem is that the Knicks don't have any good draft picks.  All they have is their own and the Mavericks' picks, and it's unlikely any of those will even be lottery picks.   They could do RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin, another player to make it work financially, and like 4 first round picks, but since the picks aren't valuable ones, that probably isn't enough.  I personally think a trade with PHI (probably involving a 3rd team who is willing to send valuable young prospects/picks to POR) makes the most sensse.  PHI gets Lillard, POR gets prospects/picks, and a 3rd team gets Simmons (like a SAC)."
RJ Barrett + picks and taking on any bad money???  Honestly think Philly tops this.
"RJ Barrett, but only from the corners."
Cade is not going to live up to the hype. Zion will be top 5 in MVP voting. Damian Lillard will be wearing a Knicks jersey next season (and RJ Barrett a Blazers jersey).
Question‚Äî why do more New Yorkers worship rj barrett than Kevin Durant? Are the Nets really that swagless and pathetic?
It‚Äôs crazy to think that kid would grow up and get to play against RJ Barrett
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker‚Ä¶. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"Shai, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson starting 5"
You can have RJ Barrett. He's a good young player.
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"Randle lead the Knicks in points, rebounds, and assists.   His next best players were a 2nd year RJ Barrett, and a 32 year old Derrick Rose for half the season.   So yeah Randle did carry the Knicks.   And cool, he still had way more help than Randle did. Randle was clearly better last season."
"Pels: Ingram, NAW, Lonzo, and #10  Knicks: RJ Barrett, Quickley, Robinson, Knox, 3 FRPs  Raptors: FVV, OG, #4, and 2 future FRPs.  Nuggets: Jamal Murray, Nnaji, #26, and a future FRP  In my opinion, it‚Äôs very unlikely Lillard will end up in a Dubs jersey. Wiseman is looking like a bust and the 7/14 picks don‚Äôt wow me."
RJ Barrett breakout season
"&gt; Looks unstoppable at this level though  'This level' is guys 2 years older than him.. kind of Luka or RJ Barrett-esque, but we shall see.."
"That depends on your team and what they need. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt trade Rj barrett for lebron james, Michael Jordan, and Stephen curry combined"
"Fr, put Popovich at Duke and they win 0 national championships, that 2019 team with Zion and RJ Barrett gets murdered by UCF. And in the ACC? North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida State do better than Duke"
"The Canada‚Äôs pool of players has never been this good and it‚Äôs likely to keep getting better. Now they are all playing for the team too. The 2024 versions of RJ Barrett, SGA, Murray etc. Should make them a formidable team."
"Randle and RJ Barrett played more minutes a game than anyone else in the league. They were literally first and second. You‚Äôre being disingenuous while maybe I was slightly hyperbolic.   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-most-minutes-played-in-regulation-game-2021  Thibs winning was stupid and only because of the NY media bias. He‚Äôs a mediocre coach who had the Hornets, Hawks, Pacers and Heat all get obliterated by Covid and injuries so they kind of just rose to the top.   Monty took a team to the first seed after not even making the playoffs.   It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that Monty didn‚Äôt win."
"Lebron, RJ Barrett, MJ, Kareem, Wit, Simmons"
RJ Barrett
Elijah Fisher gonna be the new RJ Barrett and drop 40 with a W against Number 2 -SA
"Rj Barrett, I can see him get to 20 points per game"
"Zion, Ja, RJ Barrett, Hunter and Garland (Top 5 in 2019) all got better in their second seasons though, and I think they are more comparable to Ant than Herro is. He just got injured, but his trajectory might just be going up from here."
"You have to get a good prospect in return not just picks  - DEN: Michael Porter Jr., salary filler, 2 picks   - NOP: Brandon Ingram, 2 picks   - NYK: RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, 3 1sts   - MIN: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, 3 1sts"
"That‚Äôs Second team all rookie, ahead of RJ Barrett, Terrance Davis"
Maybe that gets you rj barrett and a 2nd
Ok Rj Barrett ‚Äúfan‚Äù
Feels nice to have two teams that haven‚Äôt won in ages for once. Hopefully next year Julius Randle and RJ Barrett lead us to the promised land
"I honestly had no idea who Maria Taylor is before this story blew up, and I'd still rather give her the job to see what she's made of over Nichols.   Nichols just chases stupid narratives - during the predraft coverage, just hyped up Zion and the possibility of going to NY. Barrett was sitting right there, and all she goes is ""so RJ, how does it feel to watch Zion go through all this."" Zero questions about RJ himself. Then the other clown reporters ask Zion, ""if you had the pick, would you choose RJ or Jah?"" Like wtf...   EDIT: just saw Maria taylor interviewing Zion AFTER getting drafted, give her the job"
I'm just glad no one is saying RJ Barrett. The number of threads every game about his stats and potential had me thinking he would be the main mention here.
"pretty sure nobody on team canada has ever made a NBA allstar game  wiggins, nope  rj barrett, nope  anthony bennett, lol nope  lu dort, nope  wiggins is the closest"
"Yes true u got me I don‚Äôt watch‚Ä¶. many knick games hahah whenever there is a star player potentially on the move the NY media throws together dumb trade ideas and tries to pass them off as serious offers- RJ Barrett would be the 3rd or 4th player in any acceptable deal for lillard or Ben Simmons. Any deal with him as a center piece is laughable.   Best season for the knicks in decades and they still got bounced in the 1st rd by ATL, y‚Äôall will be back to the bottom of the east next year enjoy"
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
"I'd take Garland being 0.06% worse of a 3-pt shooter than Barrett while making 0.2 more 3s per game with a grain of salt. I think Garland is the better shooter, solely for the reason that he needs to create his own threes and is basically just as efficient as RJ, whereas RJ often spots up (which is still valuable, no doubt, just that there's nuance there.)  For reference, there is a 20% gap in terms of how many threes each guy is assisted on with 3s. Garland is assisted on 76%, which is still a lot, but usually guys are higher (like RJ with 96%)"
RJ Barrett is not very good imo. I don't think he has an upside.
i looked up ‚Äúrj barrett or cam reddish‚Äù threads and every single one has majority people taking rj cam was never a consensus lol
RJ Barrett
It‚Äôs almost like Kawhi and Paul George are harder competition than Dubious Handle and RJ Barrett huh
"Stop with this potential players bullshit, because no one of them will play at the Olympics. You could get a really good NBA team from Canadian potential players. At the end of the the day only Wiggins and RJ Barrett did participate in the qualifying games..."
Andrew Wiggins was their best player. It's not like they're that great of a team. RJ Barrett was his sidekick and choked in the 2nd half of the CR game.  This was also the first time out for this group.  Cory Joseph was the best player on the 2019 World Cup team. Tristan Thompson was the best player on the 2016 Olympic qualifying team. 20-year old Andrew Wiggins was the best player on the 2015 team.  What does why does this keep happening to Canada basketball? mean? This is the first time they fielded a good team and they lost an overtime game. And even though their roster is solid it's not like they have a superstar on it.
"&gt; But chemistry is for sure the biggest element. People underestimate how far above their level some international teams play just solely due to how familiar the players are with each other. Understanding the tendencies of your teammates as well as just having that deeper trust makes everyone play better.  I know a while back USA Hockey recognized this and put together a US National Development Team Program that trains and plays together to build chemistry. Not everyone wants to take part in it but a number of the top players from USA do. It's paid off quite well at the World Juniors level as the Americans have won 4 gold medals there since 2010 whereas previously they never won anything. I wonder if Canada can consider doing something like that with high school players. It seems like a lot of them jump to the US for their high school ball (RJ Barrett went to Montverde, Wiggins went to Huntington, Trey Lyles moved to Indianapolis, Brandon Clarke played in Arizona.. although in his case he might have grown up in the States to begin with) so they have no familiarity with each other."
Did you really expect a RJ Barrett and Andrew Wiggins led team to do anything? üòÇ
"Rj Barrett is an average Nba, trade filler not a main piece, why do NY fans overrate their young bench pieces?"
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
"I think most teams would rather have RJ Barrett, especially the Trail Blazers since they‚Äôd be rebuilding if they trade Dame"
"What trade do you think they‚Äôre making for Ben Simmons if they‚Äôre retaining RJ Barrett, Quicky, Toppin, Randle, Robinson, Etc.    You do know the Sixers aren‚Äôt taking Knox and a bunch of 1st‚Äôs for Simmons right? They can get much better offers."
"time is on my side.  People laughed when I told them that Trae was an all-star, they poopooed when I told them that DeAndre Hunter was better than RJ Barrett.  They laughed when I said that Okongwu was better than Wiseman.  I hope your hungry, you'll be eating your words too."
"They had a bunch of the probable top lottery picks at the draft lottery.  Rachel (and ESPN) wanted the entire thing to be about Zion.  To the point where even when they were talking to the other players like Ja and RJ Barrett, basically every question was about how great Zion is."
Didn‚Äôt she also kept asking about Zion to RJ Barrett during his interview?
PG Immanuel Quickley  SG RJ Barrett  SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Julius Randle   C Mitchell Robinson
Wouldn't surprise me if RJ Barrett doesn't make an AA team tbh
"&gt; man ... how toxic are you guys?  Really, we are the toxic? Did that just come out from you?   &gt; but we can use one game?  I'm just posting this to show he has 'potential'. Calm down, no one is criticizing your beloved RJ Barrett and his special playoff run"
You can't really use his career shooting percentage.   He didn't finished his first season due to Covid and he was out since February (under Lloyd Pierce) so it's not really fair.  &gt; he's still seen as a massive waste of a pick...  Not us Hawks fans. Insecure RJ Barrett fans maybe?
It‚Äôs pretty damn easy    22-Julius Randle  23-Kevin Knox  24-RJ Barrett   25-Zion(when he‚Äôs a knick)  26-Julius randle again   27-Obi Toppin  28-Immanuel Quickley  29-Quickley again   30-Kyden Randle
"Lets just compare our matchups in the first round shall we, you had the fucking NYKnicks lol Randle and fucking RJ Barrett. We had Kawhi and Paul George (play-off P not Pandemic P). If you mofos were in the west you wouldn't make it out of the first round either."
2022 with healthy Murray and peak SGA and RJ Barrett will be the year for y'all.
"What different rules though?  You can influence the ball after it hits the rim. Hard to get used to I guess? But happens somewhat rarely per game, so how big is the impact?  There is no defensive 3s - benefits all defenses and should make it easier to play defense, not super hard to adapt to (at least not defensively).  What else is there to adapt to? Canada won the 2017 U19 World Cup with RJ Barrett leading the way. FIBA rules weren't an issue 4 years ago for the young Canadians?  They have a ton of talent and should look to improve, not look for excuses.   Honestly, don't care how ""well oiled"" CZE is. They have NEVER been to the Olympics ever and had their first ever WC appearance in 2019 (where they sensationally ended 6th). Canada should be embarrassed and should have been MUCH better considering having the ""golden boy"" Nurse as their coach and such an NBA heavy team. Even without the ones missing."
RJ Barrett is the very definition of this
RJ Barrett üôåüôå
Damn I was really enjoying watching more RJ Barrett in the offseason
RJ Barrett will be an all star within 2 years
mine is rj barrett but it‚Äôs too early to tell if i was wrong ig
"Because a type of foul called ""Euro foul"" is not allowed in international basketball and it's far more prevalent in the NBA nowadays. Even though that yes, fouling to stop fastbreaks was common practice before (this new FIBA rule is from 2017 or so). They called it like that because it was European influence that brought it into the NBA.  Either way, it'd be interesting to see if NBA players have to adjust to that rule (during the last Canada-Greece there was an instance they reviewed a foul on a fastbreak by RJ Barrett to see if it was unsportsmanlike)."
"I‚Äôve never been sold on RJ Barrett, in college or the NBA. But I recognize that he could still be a great player. I just didn‚Äôt completely get why he was #3 overall"
"You forget that the Knicks players are all up for new contracts fairly soon so they‚Äôre not going to have talent under cheap contracts for much longer.   Knicks have 1-2yrs before it gets expensive and this offseason is terrible for top end Free Agents.    Randle is up next season and RJ Barrett the following year. Then you have Mitchell Robinson I believe this year unless they want to risk making him an Unrestricted Free Agent. Along with Rose, Noel, Etc.   Nets were fortunate that they had players still under contract for cheap and had enough cap space to sign Durant and Kyrie before their extensions kicked in."
more that RJ barrett would basically hand other teams the game in the clutch
"Honestly I think it's time the Blazers and Dame seriously think about parting. I just don't think there's any moves they can make that can make this team a contender, especially in the West. I think they have to rebuild and retool. As good as Dame is that roster construction is just not a championship level roster and they have limited cap room to really make a splash. Idk if I'd want Simmons on a max to start my rebuild, though. If I can get RJ Barrett, Quickley, and the next 3 firsts from the Knicks I trade Dame and if I'm the Knicks I do that trade in a heartbeat."
"&gt;If the Knicks arent putting RJ Barrett on the table and the Pelicans aren't putting Brandon Ingram on the table then neither team will get him which is what makes the chances equal in my eyes  The Pels would include Ingram in a heartbeat, but I‚Äôm more unsure of the Knicks actually vying for Lillard. Particular because he‚Äôd be on a worse team than before. But idk, they‚Äôre a weird organization."
"&gt; I know the Knicks are the Knicks, but do they really want to trade their future away for Dame?  Not to say either team **will** offer their blue chip young guy, but discussions both start and end with them. If the Knicks arent putting RJ Barrett on the table and the Pelicans aren't putting Brandon Ingram on the table then neither team will get him which is what makes the chances equal in my eyes"
knicks have rj barrett and mavs have luka.  both those teams also arent top tier contenders. reggie always wanted to be that ‚Äúguy‚Äù on a top contender and i don‚Äôt know if those options are better.
"I wasn't sure if it was a case of those draft guys trying to make those big brain predictions, but there were like 2 IIRC potentially having him above RJ Barrett."
It's like Vince Mcmahon describing Shane Mcmahon LMAO  *MY SON RJ BARRETT!*
*And tonight's player of the game? That's right it's my son again RJ Barrett!*  Wiggins sideeye
RJ Barrett is not very good
"Great recent examples were RJ Barrett, Trae, and both the Bridges."
"This is total bullshit, they aren‚Äôt going to trade RJ Barrett unless it‚Äôs for like Giannis. Management has done a great job ever since mills left, and they‚Äôve continued preaching that they want to build ‚Äòthe right way‚Äô, they wouldn‚Äôt trade their most promising young player for someone like Beal   Total made up, BS tabloid article"
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland‚Äôs Damian Lillard or Washington‚Äôs Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland‚Äôs Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City‚Äôs Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte‚Äôs Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
RJ Barrett straight up got exposed in the playoffs why would the Blazers trade Dame for a 6th man?
Who the hell said he was being packaged for Dame?  Portland can do WAY better than a package centered around RJ Barrett...
Rj barrett
"If it was 1985 maybe, but in the modern NBA Montreal has a lot more going for it city wise than almost every other small market. Team Francophone is pretty good between Siakam, Gobert, Embiid, Ibaka, Capela, RJ Barrett, Dort. As the NBA becomes more global being a culture more open to global players would be a tremendous asset."
RJ Barrett - 49 minutes a game. Book it.
Thibs gonna have RJ Barrett go for that record one year.
Rj Barrett should‚Äôve been ours
RJ Barrett
RJ BARRETT? Hahahaha
But on the real I feel RJ Barrett easily has the potential to be much better than Zion
"Knicks  2016 - no picks 2017 - Donovan Mitchell, Dillon Brooks 2018 - SGA, Mitchell Robinson 2019 - RJ Barrett 2020 - Obi Toppin, Immanual Quickley  I think this has been proof of how well the Knicks FO has done in the draft. I‚Äôd still take Obi over Halliburton because in the context of this prompt we wouldn‚Äôt need him.  SGA Donovan Mitchell RJ Barrett Obi Toppin Mitchell Robinson 6th man: Quickley"
Tacko Fall almost beat that Duke team with Zion RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish though.
"Coach K lost in the Elite 8 with Zion, RJ Barrett, and Cam Reddish."
its very possible rj barrett can break through this year. he was not on the athletics top 125 players by the way.
"&gt;	the Raptors have never had an edge signing Canadians  The best Canadian players are still on their 1st or 2nd contracts, like Jamal Murray, SGA, Andrew Wiggins, and RJ Barrett.  The Raptors really haven‚Äôt had any opportunities to sign Canadian star players because until very recently, they didn‚Äôt exist (besides Steve Nash)."
"What if the super team is all Canadians. Jamal Murray, SGA and RJ Barrett?"
what stats? he has a decent true shooting because he gets to the line. Are you referring to how much he passes or something. he had a higher true shooting than rj barrett in college. his efficiency was not terrible.

A guy I thought might be on the best list: Derrick Rose 46.2% on 143 attempts.    A guy I thought might be on the worst list: RJ Barrett 35.9% on 128 attempts.    Checks out.
I mean I know the team wasn‚Äôt talented enough where did I blame bud. My point is your so down bad that the regular season is a real sweep for you. The levels of delusion are incredible. You saw how fraudulent rj Barrett and randle are but are convinced Fournier and walker who were mediocre to ass on the 7 seed Celtics are gonna help you.
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn‚Äôt even close y‚Äôall got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven‚Äôt seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year

RJ Barrett
Rj Barrett was top 3 but is slept on
"Got a real one. RJ Barrett &gt; Jaylen Brown  Not only do I believe it but it genuinely fits the thread or else I never would have said it anywhere because I don't like to annoy people for no reason. I do think in time RJ's talent will make it a less crazy opinion, but I don't think it will ever be popular even if that does pan out."
RJ 40% From 3 Barrett
Darius Garland &gt; RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett.  Hes young and already shows the closer trait. I think him and Randle will be a great 1-2 punch for years to come.  I also think him and Quickley are gonna be such a badass backcourt.
RJ Barrett
"Me being a Knicks fan, I gotta go with RJ Barrett. He‚Äôs shown flashes of it but he never got the consistency down. He has to develop his off hand and make jumpers consistent and he will be a legitimate all star."
RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett  Malik Monk  Cole Anthony  Kevin Huerter  Rui Hachimura  Christian Wood  Keldon Johnson  Justise Winslow  Pat Connaughton  Malcolm Brogdon  Anfernee Simons  Spencer Dinwiddie  Immanuel Quickley
RJ Barrett
"RJ Barrett. I believe in dude and I wanted him to fall to us in the draft because I knew there was no shot at Zion. I knew nothing about Ja Morant at that time. I still believe in dude, and can't wait for his first all star selection."
RJ Barrett
Sure call me a homer but RJ Barrett.  The growth he had from his rookie to sophomore season is astounding and gets you hyped for what he could do in the future.  For someone not on the Knicks I'm going with James Wiseman to spite all you who say that he's a bust.
"I‚Äôm being a massive homer but RJ Barrett is easily the most disrespected player in the league. Every year, he‚Äôs made jump in ppg, fg percentage, 3pt percentage and he can‚Äôt even crack the top 125 but IQ who is coming off a rookie season is in."
I think RJ Barrett is headed that direction.
I could only wonder how RJ Barrett would feel knowing his godfather did stuff like this as an athlete hahaha
"Christian Wood, Darius Garland, RJ Barrett are a few that come to mind"
"Rj Barrett, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter"
RJ Barrett
Easy RJ Barrett. For someone who was the number 1 hs player and plays for the knicks he got absolutely no credit for their performance this year. Also was only his age 20 season.
RJ Barrett is gonna average 20+ shooting at least 45% from the field and 38% from 3 on good defense. Miles McBride will make all rookie first team
RJ Barrett
"Colling Sexton, RJ Barrett, Jerami Grant"
"rj barrett was snubbed on the all rookie team, and most recently the athletics top 125 players"
It‚Äôs easily RJ Barrett. Left off the All Rookie team for Terence Davis. Left out of the top 125 in The Athletic. A lot of people I know still prefer Tyler Herro over him. He was our 2nd best player all year yet he‚Äôs sorta seen as a role player. I feel only Raptor fans appreciate the guy
I'm pretty confident about RJ Barrett never being an all star. Like I'd put money on it.
RJ Barrett. He wasn't even included in The Athletic's Top 125 best NBA players.
"RJ Barrett is not a Top 125 player  edit: furthermore Nerlens Noel and Immanuel Quickley were rated higher than RJ in the tier list I'm referencing, which makes me laugh even harder"
"Bertans, but no RJ Barrett? Come on my guy."
"RJ Barrett is going to put up borderline allstar numbers. No one expected him to be as good this year as he ended up being, I expect that to be the case next year as well"
"saw bruce brown and noel ahead of him ü§®ü§® especially as a knicks fan i can tell people straight up on last years team noel was probably the 6th best player (randle, RJ, rose, mitch, quickley ahead of him in that order)  besides barrett tho this list is really bad"
"Well according to this it's RJ Barrett, it shows he traveled roughly 192 miles this season: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/speed-distance/?sort=DIST_FEET&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals"
RJ BARRETT SNUBBED
"Someone send this list to RJ Barrett, the disrespect will fuel his first All-Star nod"
RJ Barrett is going to be the best player on the Knicks by seasons end. Not because of Randle regressing or anything like that. I just think RJ is set to take a huge leap and become the Batman of the Knicks.
RJ Barrett will have the best career out of anyone from the 2019 draft.   He was the second best payer as a sophomore on a 4th seeded team that this offseason got significantly better by replacing Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. RJ himself has shown an incredible amount of progress and commitment to keeping that progress going.   Ja Morant‚Äôs Grizzlies will continue to be too good to get another high pick while also not being good enough to compete for a title. The Pelicans failed to make the play-in tournament twice and Zion will ultimately have his talents wasted there like AD and CP3
I could see RJ Barrett developing like that
So you‚Äôd rather have RJ Barrett and shoot for the 6th seed in the East for a decade rather than chasing a championship with a superstar for 3-4 years?   I‚Äôm not following.
&gt;RJ Barrett (maybe) quickley(maybe)  looooooool
"I mean, Dame for Barrett straight up, with just the contracts to make the salaries work, yeah, fucking obviously, Knicks do that. But that's not what these guys are talking about. The assumption is that the Knicks have to send the motherload - 3+ unprotected FYPs, multiple unprotected pick swaps, plus at LEAST two of Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, McBride - on top of Barrett. The argument is that if we're trading our best young player plus all of our depth plus all of our assets, we'll be left with a worse team than Dame ever had in his prime, while Lillard will not only be 31+, but making nearly double what he did during that time period. We'll have a worse team, Dame will likely decline (not to a bad player but not quite what he was), we'll have less roster flexibility, and we'll have less ways to gather talent around him, whether by trade or FA signings. At that point, what exactly are we trading for? A team that at absolute best loses in the second round 2-3 years in a row, then bottoms out to nothing while sending all its lottery picks to Portland?   This isn't a referendum on Dame, nor is it some crazy over-estimation of what Barrett is. It's just taking a hard look at the practical reality of what happens after the trade. I understand in a vacuum you do whatever you can to get a star. But the Knicks tried this already with Melo and look where it got us. And Melo was fully in his prime, AND we had Stat, AND we had more roster flexibility, AND we didn't have to give up as many picks as it would take to get Dame.   So yeah, of course. Dame for RJ straight up, you do that every day of the week. But that trade is never going to be on the table, so it's a straw-man argument"
RJ Barrett would be the best player on your squad lmao
"It's also a question of whether 10+ years of RJ Barrett is more valuable than a couple years of superstar Dame. Even if RJ never gets as good as Dame, and there's a good chance of that, perhaps the Knicks think they can still be in a better situation to win with sticking with RJ long term."
It‚Äôs RJ Barrett dude.  He is an average starting wing.  Maybe he can become more but that clearly remains to be seen. Dame is a top 10 quality player.  RJ Toppin Quickley is the starting point plus like 2 picks minimum.
"It seems like a logical trade to make for the Raps.  Siakam is really, really good as a 2nd/3rd option beside a ball dominant scorer, and pretty mediocre if he's being relied on to create offense. He has way more value on teams that already have a star than he does on Toronto, and keeping him there is just wasting his prime and killing his confidence.  It might make sense to hold onto him if the Raps had an RJ Barrett or Jalen Green or somebody like that who they hope will develop into that go-to guy, but they don't. It's better for everyone to swap him for young assets the team can build around."
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
"Top 5 best chances, in order (imo):    1. Lonzo Ball 2. RJ Barrett 3. Jaren Jackson Jr. 4. Patrick Williams 5. Collin Sexton"
Obi Toppin and RJ Barrett
A: Dennis Schr√∂der  B: RJ Barrett (Siakam apparently.)  D: Ben Simmons  E: Julius Randle
RJ Barrett is the Knicks franchise guy and he got iced out for long stretches of games during his first year due to Elfrid Payton/bad coaching under Fizdale  If you find yourself doing something in common with the pre-Thibs Knicks you're probably doing something wrong
I don‚Äôt know if they have exactly go out like that. Shai was in Canada and was recruited to Kentucky. Then a guy like RJ Barrett was from Canada moved to play in Glorifa and went to Duke.
"Top* - Nassir Little was in Zion and RJ Barrett conversations when he committed to UNC. He was solid in his 1 year, but not up to that level"
"‚ÄúGives us FRPs for the next 7 years‚Äù Nope that‚Äôs not what a swap is. 4 late FRPs and useless swaps for Harden is not good value no matter how you look at it. Yes, there were outside issues that prevented getting max value but pettiness towards Morey was the organization‚Äôs decision. Ben Simmons is 1000% worth more than 4 late FRPs. A KPJ, Green, Ben, Wood, and Sengun lineup would be quite the future core. MPJ, Siakam, or RJ Barrett would all be worth more than 4 late FRPs"
I think RJ Barrett has a shout.
"I think RJ Barrett will take another step.  Im a Knicks fan and admittedly not super high on RJ, but I do think he will maximize his talents over his career.   As such I think he'll build on his sophmore campaign, and if I hsd to be more specific I think he'll demonstrate some growth in his off the dribble shooting."
RJ Barrett could easily average 21-6-3 on above average defense and good efficiency
RJ Barrett
Murray /SGA - Dort/Brooks  - RJ Barrett - Wiggins -  Birch/Boucher   I don't include Primo and Houstan yet.  This team is potentially stacked. Only Wiggins will be 30 by 2024.    I really hope Canada will make to the next olympics.
Rj barrett
I‚Äôm skeptical. Pretty sure Luka would get smothered on every possession if his top scoring teammate was RJ Barrett
"Man gtfo with this revisionist shit, RJ Barrett just put up 18/5/3 at 20 years old on good efficiency.     At 20 Harden put up 10/3/2 with 1.4 turnovers per game on 40% fg, nobody had a clue what he would become.     This sub is dumb as fuck sometimes."
&gt; or maybe RJ Barrett  One Dame Lillard please
"They could have upgraded CJ to TJ McConnell, or maybe RJ Barrett, or maybe JJ Redick. Whatever happens, the J stays."
"Ok but Knicks have RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and Obi Toppin for basically that same amount. Soo‚Ä¶what are we really talking about here?"
"serious answer (just from a regular fan's impressions):  elfrid payton averaged 7.2 assists a game in 19/20, close to the top 10 for the season. he attacks the basket. he gets flak for his defense but some advanced stats contradict that and he played a lot of minutes for a good defensive team last year. he seems to have a good attitude and is liked by his team.  the bad, basically, is he cannot shoot from virtually anywhere. useless at three and the midrange, and not really a great at the rim, for all how he likes to drive. he does not get to the line.  he is a good passer but he ""assist hunts"", holding the ball until an opportunity to get an assist presents itself from the efforts of other players. he does not seem to really understand the flow of a basketball game the way say, Lowry does, who will pass the ball off, move around, get it back, pass it again, etc. with payton he just dribbles until he sees someone get open and if time runs out he tries to take it to the rim. if someone doubles he passes but if not he chucks something up. it is really not very pretty, even if it produces gaudy assist numbers on bad teams.  he was a terrible fit on the NYK, particularly with RJ Barrett, though RJ's remarkable ability to transform himself into a quality catch and shoot 3 point guy mitigated that a bit. but ultimately, you already had two guys (Randle and Barrett) who wanted to run at the basket and then pass (three even if you count Rose). Payton was clearly worse than all three of them. he tried hard to improve this year - his APG going down is actually a sign of him trying to play the ""right way."" but he was really no good.  overall this is a perfectly good pickup for the suns for their third string point guard. he may have chemistry with some of phoenix's bigs (they have a few). he may benefit from paul's leadership/coaching. but even if payton managed to add a shot (a huge if at this point) he just doesn't really seem to feel the game the way you want a point guard to these days. i doubt he turns it around at this point but i'm rooting for him, as i said he seems like an ok guy."
Or that  game where RJ Barrett was on fire and carrying the team then Payton comes in and refuses to pass him the ball.
Some of y‚Äôall have no idea how fucking frustrating it is to watch RJ Barrett drive the lane and make a beautiful cross court pass to a wide open Payton in the corner only for him to pass up the open 3 and wait for a screen so he could miss a contested layup
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
"Playing with Lebron and AD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Playing with RJ Barrett, Randle and Alec Burk  I assume Knicks would be in the same position they had Bron/AD"
"I am very high on RJ Barrett he gets compared alot to Morant and Zion being in the same draft class with those two having an immediate impact but I truly believe RJ will be an All Star in this league. He has 2 way potential and has already increased his 3pt shooting from his rookie year of 32% to 40% last year.  I am low on Anthony Davis. He is extremely talented but I  always felt like he should of been able to carry a team through the playoffs similiar to what we have seen Jokic and Embiid have done being the ""guy"". People view him as a 1b to Lebron but I think he is more of a Number 2"
"High on Jordan Nwora, low on rj Barrett"
"Bulls got Pippin at 5 with a pick they got from the Sonics. Their actual pick was the 10th pick and they took Horace Grant. Keep in mind, in 1987 there were not 30 teams so that wasn‚Äôt a lottery pick. The Bulls had just made the playoffs without both of them. Regardless, two fantastic draft picks. Both taken after Jordan‚Äôs 3rd season with the Bulls. Jordan had the Bulls at a 40-42 record pretty much as the sole offensive weapon on the team. He had a young Oakley and John Paxton as his next options that particular season.   The Cavs top 10 pick that was taken after Lebron‚Äôs rookie season was Luke Jackson. The didn‚Äôt have any picks the following year. I also don‚Äôt think the Cavs were as bad as everyone says. The had Carlos Boozer, Ilgauskas who was an all-star the season before Lebron, and Ricky Davis for Lebron‚Äôs rookie year. They tanked like hell to get Lebron knowing they had a bunch of other young pieces to go with him. And then made a quick turnaround like Jordan‚Äôs Bulls did. Now none of those guys ended up being championship pieces but they‚Äôre good enough to win games with. RJ Barrett is honestly too young to remember the setup of the Cavs teams. They tried to work the free agency market more than building through the draft.   Situations were different but to act like Jordan wasn‚Äôt balling out as soon as he set foot in the league is crazy. MJ‚Äôs rookie season is arguably better than Kobe‚Äôs MVP season."
I‚Äôm sure Zion is clamoring to get clowned by Trae Young on his home court while watching Randle shoot 7/30. Maybe Zion will get his jersey retired and then later banned from MSG by the owner.   Another thing what superstar wouldn‚Äôt be dying to play w/ RJ ‚Äò51.2% TS‚Äô Barrett? Guy just screams elite. Zion could get to relive his college days watching Barrett hog the ball and chuck bad shots.
Yes they‚Äôre screwed. They need to start googling RJ Barrett highlights.
"Depends on how high you are on certain Canadian talents.   1. Will Shai and Murray continue their growth and become perennial all-stars?  2. Is Nickeil Alexander Walker just a fine bench guard or will he develop into a reliable starter in New Orleans? 3. Is RJ Barrett just a solid player or will he make the leap and be viewed alongside Ja and Zion?  4. Will a reliable big man emerge than go toe to toe with Gobert, Bam, Jokic, etc.   If all of those answers are no, Canada won't likely medal.   If 2-3 of those situations go right, Canada could absolutely challenge for bronze and in some years silver.  If all 4 go in Canada's favor PLUS a current Canadian high schooler develops into a major NBA superstar, they could challenge for silver/gold."
"Canada has a pretty good roster too. RJ barrett, Boucher, Dillon's brooks, jamal murray, sga"
How is RJ Barrett &gt; Tatum not a truly awful take
RJ Barrett once again being the better Andrew Wiggins in all facets of life.
RJ Barrett gets MIP and is an All Star
RJ Barrett: ‚ÄòYo I‚Äôm a Knick!‚Äô Was part of the beginning of a culture change imo
Most intriguing star: Dame   Emerging Star: De‚ÄôAaron Fox  Unproven youngster: RJ Barrett
"Star: KAT. Feels like many have forgotten what this man is capable of when healthy.   Emerging star: RJ Barrett. I remember the hype surrounding this kid when he was drafted, he just finished this last year with 17.6 PPG. It‚Äôs clear he has higher levels he‚Äôs capable of hitting, question is how many? Low tier all-star? Superstar?  Unproven youngster: Nickeil Alexander-Walker. This last year he put up 11 ppg. He‚Äôs gonna have a bigger role, how much better his production gets with an increased role is something I‚Äôm interested in."
"&gt; Like i said id take the player who already translates to winning  You're automatically assuming the *individual player* on the better *team* is better because his team is better. That's poor logic. You should instead look at each player's impact/contribution on their team. If you traded Tyrese and RJ, the Knicks would still have way more wins than Sacramento and your dumbed down logic could be used in favor of Tyrese.  The Kings are a talented team with a bad coach who misuses the talent. No individual player is gonna override that factor. Tyrese is the superior offensive player; he's considerably more efficient than Barrett and is the *far greater* playmaker.   I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say you don't catch many Sacramento Kings games."
"My disagreement is that you only listed one guy better than him.  Yes, CGJDJDKHEADDBTPGGKKATTBZCPBBMMLVDSSWLBKMFIMSCOGMCWCJHAMPJSVDRFVVCBHPSIWDLHIJJJGMTLMTBHNNCCRHSLNJBJVNADRGGSLHWWCRBRWBWAB is good but RJ Barrett is basically the 2nd best player of this era."
"RJ is just capable of doing more. Defence isn‚Äôt like a specified offensive role where only certain players are asked to do it, it‚Äôs half the game. Everyone‚Äôs expected to defend. And while Barrett is very good, clarkson is a liability.  If anything I feel like that argument applies more in favour of RJ, since clarkson has the ultimate green light and takes more shots which allows him to put up more ppg"
Barrett had a better season though.  I think they‚Äôre close at the moment but RJ has All-NBA upside.
Kevin Porter Jr is a career 32% shooter from 3   RJ Barrett is a career 37% shooter from 3
Tyrese Halliburton is already better than RJ Barrett
"Once again if you read the threads above 1. I never said he is a bust nor will be a bust. 2. The original verbiage I used was underperformed, you can say whatever about how much he averages and this and that but a top 3 player is supposed to be drafted with all star/ all nba potential, therefore if a player drafted in the top 3 doesn‚Äôt reach that level he underperformed. I said current RJ Barrett is the furthest away from all star potential rn out of the top 3 and ‚Äústill has time‚Äù to make an all star appearance"
Make an all star game? Lead a team? Why do Knicks fans act like RJ Barrett is a superstar already?
"&gt;(RJ Barrett ((still has time))   Jesus Christ you dudes disrespect this kid so fucking much, still has time for what exactly?"
"After our offseason we prolly have a dif #2 rn but our team would legitimately be so much worse without rj barrett. Dude does everything, made a huge leap his 2nd season, and is mythically strong for someone his height/age/frame. People dont talk about him cause his game isnt flashy but hes a damn machine and just flat out plays winning basketball"
Rj Barrett
RJ Barrett doesn't get any love for some reason.  Last season he was 20 and averaged 18/6/3 on 44/40/75 as the 2nd option. Plays good defense too.  He's really improved his shooting and shot 44% from 3 in the 2nd half of the season.
"For the Knicks, it will be that an opposing team will figure out a defensive scheme to stop both Julius Randle and Kemba Walker, and they won't be able to offensively overcome it. Also, RJ Barrett will be solid player this coming season, but still not an all-star level player the caliber of Paul George or Jimmy Butler, which is what the Knicks need him to be to REALLY get over the hump.     I legit hope I'm wrong in all of this, and that the Knicks do in fact have what it takes to win a championship."
"PG: Steph SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: Lebron  PF: Zion C: KAT 6: Drose Bench: Bridges, bridges, lamelo, RJ Barrett, Myles turner, THJ"
"PG: Ja,  Shai, Lonzo   SG: PG( all-star), RJ Barrett, Cade Cunningham  SF: Tatum(all-star), Mikal bridges, Jerami Grant  PF: KD(Superstar), MPG, Collins   C: AD(Superstar), Valanciunas, Mitchell Robinson"
RJ Barrett
"There was a great video with RJ Barrett and his shooting coach that pretty much said you focus on one new skill each off season, so you make one skill great instead of a bunch of skills a little bit better"
RJ Barrett will be a top 30 player at the end of this year   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will be a top 15 player at the end of this year
Nahh. Immanuel Quickley will be better than RJ Barrett in the future.
Forgot about rj Barrett
"Monteverde has just been churning out NBA players the last 5-10 years. Other alumni are D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Precious Achiuwa, RJ Barrett, and Dakari Johnson."
"Montverde is a basketball prep school. D‚Äôlo, Ben Simmons, Embiid, RJ Barrett all went there"
RJ Barrett isn't a future all-star
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
"RJ Barrett, he nice"
"What‚Äôs with philly fans not understanding that some people just don‚Äôt like Ben Simmons and don‚Äôt care to have him on their team, much less trade a kings ransom to get him? It‚Äôs not crazy, regardless of how good players are fans don‚Äôt like some and like others. I like josh Okogie for instance and don‚Äôt want to see him traded but that does not mean he‚Äôs a good player. I also don‚Äôt care to add RJ Barrett to my team but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs bad or wouldn‚Äôt help with winning."
how does rj barrett get literally left off of everything? kid's a stud.
RJ Barrett &gt; Ja Morant

RJ Barrett
No lol don't be presuming shit. I googled RJ Barrett vs KPJ and that's how I got here   But then I saw your comment and I just couldn't help myself
"All Star floor is something that is thrown around way too much. That‚Äôs why the label of ‚Äúbust‚Äù is put on too many young guys. It‚Äôs REALLY hard to be a All Star in the NBA, only a very small percentage of players ever live up to that. All Star floor was LeBron, Melo ect. Coming out of the draft. Not RJ Barrett. If he ever gets to that level, even in one or two seasons, great! But people who are calling him a bust are way off base."
"Maybe people are looking at the franchise that has had CP3 and AD in the past and done nothing with them and hoping it doesn't happen to this player as well. And continuing with the theme of the other players you mentioned, Zion has to sit at home and watch other young players in the playoffs like Luka, Trae, Morant, and even his Duke teammate RJ Barrett."
RJ Barrett hit 40% from deep last year. RJ is my guy but yeah Jordan would have been more than fine.
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Swap out the Ball kid for RJ Barrett, nephew.  ...and get off my lawn."
Garland is also 21 years old with higher upside.  He just averaged 17 and 6 in his age 20-21 season on 45/40/85 shooting splits.   If i said i wouldn‚Äôt trade RJ Barrett or Deandre Hunter for Simmons is that still crazy to you?
This could be fun if it‚Äôs unproven/flashes potential:   RJ Barrett/Cam Reddish/Anthony Edwards/Lamelo/Cade
"&gt; The Knicks didnt,  The Knicks definitely got better. Their roster last season was Payton - Barrett - Bullock - Randle - Mitchell Robinson  Payton was absolute ass cheeks and Kemba *should* be an upgrade (though his injury status is a big question mark), plus they added a decent 3-and-D guard in the draft who could play if Kemba is hurt (assuming Randle goes full point forward). Plus Evan Fournier &gt;&gt; Bullock, they desperately needed another player who can get his own shot.   And of course,  RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley, both of whom are 21, are promising young players who could take step ups in skill."
I didn't like the idea of Thibs to the Knicks until it was made clear he was only coaching and had no part in roster moves.  Apparently he was saying the Knicks should trade RJ Barrett before the start of the season and good thing they didn't because he was probably the 2nd best player on that team.
I think Paul Pierce is a better comp for RJ Barrett.
"Good point about the Jaylen comparison, but the leap Barrett made last year I think speaks volumes to his work ethic and his capacity to improve. He is asked to do a lot as a rookie and a sophomore on the offense. He has multiple roles that he's trying to simultaneously fill and even last year that offense had no direction to it and had to deal with Payton at the 1. Brown got to be efficient because those Boston teams had scoring, playmaking, and shooting at every position.   Also I'm sorry, I really don't give a shit about defensive metrics. They are notoriously unreliable and defense is a team sport. Like you said, we were the third-best defense and RJ was second in the league in minutes played. It's not like we had any defensive stoppers on the team. True, most of that is Thibs, but I think it would be insane to say he was a negative on defense. The stats lie here, as they so often do with defensive metrics. And his heavy metrics also likely contribute to his decreased effeciency"
You‚Äôre thinking of RJ Barrett.
"I dont believe the Knicks had anything but Frank, Knox, Robinson (the best player named) + a ton picks, one of which turned out to be RJ Barrett.  Iirc, Celtics mainly had Brown and picks.   Brown was still a raw talent but definitely got better.  Both sides had solid offers but the Lakers really had the better offer."
"Russell Westbrook, RJ Barrett, Reggie Bullock, Rui Hachimura, Rudy Gobert"
I predicted RJ Barrett will become an all star. I still think that‚Äôll come into fruition.
"knicks can offer anyone on their roster besides julius and rj barrett. they also have 6 firsts in the next 4 years, and 10 2nds.   atlanta has 5 firsts and 5 seconds, but has enough depth to lose anyone not named trae.   simmons may be better than any individual player those teams can offer, but the whole reason he‚Äôs being shopped is the flaws and chemistry issues than you‚Äôd avoid with those teams.   washington is also more likely to look to rebuild, and not around a player who will keep you out of the lottery but never get you a championship as a number one."
"I think RJ Barrett could be considered one of those guys. Although, his shot has been fixed considerably since his rookie season."
RJ Barrett &amp; Cam Reddish were ranked higher than Zion on some recruiting sites LOL c'mon now.
"Knicks actually have a fair amount of decent players picked in the last 15ish years late in the draft that developed well.  Fields, Shump, Hardaway, Robinson.  RJ Barrett made a nice leap in the last year too.  Do the knicks get credit for that?"
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
[‚Äúbeside RJ Barrett‚Äù](https://c.tenor.com/wZNLBjYWLecAAAAM/skyscraper-movie-skyscraper.gif)
"He‚Äôs gonna be remembered as the old, starting center  on the Lakers that wins a title in 2027 with whichever top 3 talent they have at the time. He‚Äôs going to be a good defender still, not an all star and laker fans will be like ‚Äúwow, imagine if we had PRIME Rudy Gobert beside RJ Barrett, we‚Äôd 5peat!!‚Äù"
RJ Barrett
They let him go because for the money he makes it‚Äôs not worth it. The pelicans got a lot of mediocre talent in exchange for a top 10 player. Packages centered around Jaylen Brown from the Celtics or RJ Barrett from the Knicks would‚Äôve probably worked out better for the Pels than Brandon Ingram. Jaylen Brown is flat out better than Ingram and RJ Barrett is on the same timeline as Zion and would make an actually good sidekick to him unlike Ingram.
"CJ, Sexton, Hield?, RJ Barrett?  Idk honestly. I think a team like Portland will realize that their current lineup isn‚Äôt going to cut it and offer CJ but idk if Philly can wait that long.  Same thing if the wizards decide to tank and get rid of Beal (I don‚Äôt think they will)."
"RJ Barrett, there‚Äôs really no way of knowing what his ceiling is right now.  Wouldn‚Äôt even wanna risk losing out on what he could maybe be one day"
"RJ Barrett. Wouldn't matter if his career fell off a cliff tomorrow, he'll always be one of my favorites.  He genuinely **wanted** to be a Knick when we were a walking punchline, and I'll never forget that. The kid is tough, all hustle, and has a fantastic mentality."
"RJ Barrett. I like him too and I get it, 3rd year players take a jump, but some people are making it out to be that his jump is going to put the Knicks into a higher tier of teams in the east. He could improve drastically, but it's not guaranteed."
"RJ Barrett fits this bill, and I think our fans slightly overhype him, but r/nba undervalues the hell out of him"
"RJ Barrett, I‚Äôve seen Knicks fans say they wouldn‚Äôt trade him for Dame"
"RJ Barrett. From the Knicks game I watched last season, his ceiling seems like a good 3 &amp; D wing who struggles with self-creation in the half court. I don‚Äôt really see any all star bids in his future because young prospects just don‚Äôt magically develop a handle or new found athleticism overnight. If he turns out like Lonzo Ball, that‚Äôs a good high-end outcome."
Bruh the disrespect RJ Barrett gets now...
RJ Barrett is better than not only Tyler Herro but Ja Morant
"Its still Zion teams will sell the farm and bend over for him. Nola will want a bigger return then they got for AD and will probably end up with like a KAT to even a RJ Barrett or Cade level prospect along with multiple firsts.   Nola got 2 players who were recent #2 picks, the #4 pick + future picks for AD who already said he wouldnt sign with Boston and shit"
RJ Barrett better than Curry?????
"No. If you want to modernize it it makes more sense to replace the first 2 numbers with an equivalent TS% because individually those numbers (FG% and 3pt%) are not meaningful.   What I mean is, you can be inefficient even with a good 2% percentage, as many are. You can even have an inefficient season despite shooting the 3 very well (ex. RJ Barrett 40% from 3, -37 TS). But you can't have an inefficient season with a .650 TS."
"&gt; LeVert's indiana stats are more important because he came off the bench in Brooklyn playing 27 minutes, in contrast to Barrett playing 34 minutes as a starter  Ok I get that for box score stats but not sure why the minutes matter for his ts% which would be lower than RJ‚Äôs if you included the whole season.  &gt; I think you are massively undervaluing 3.1 ppg and 1.9 apg - 3.1 ppg is the difference between Paul George and Malik Beasley, 1.9 apg is the difference between Jokic and Kevin Porter Jr.  Sure but 3.1 ppg is also the difference between Tatum/Mitchell and PG. Judging by the comments in the Tatum vs PG thread, I think people would downplay how much significance that gap is in that context. 1.2 more rpg is also notably more.  &gt; I'm not sure why it's being assumed that defensive advanced stats are the prime indicator of effectiveness.   That wasn‚Äôt my point. You said in your initial comment ‚ÄúYou can point out defense, eye test etc. but all advanced stats and tape strongly backs up that the stats tell an accurate story here.‚Äù  I was showing that ‚Äúall‚Äù the advanced stats don‚Äôt strongly back up those stats. LeVert may have averaged more steals for example, but advanced defensive stats don‚Äôt back up the claim that he‚Äôs a better defender based on that fact. I‚Äôm aware there are other stats that have LeVert over RJ but you referred to ‚Äúall‚Äù advanced stats, and I was pointing to the ones that don‚Äôt support your claim."
Kemba's knees or the continued growth of RJ Barrett.  If the knees are reasonably healthy and rj makes another jump we level up from an interesting team.
"Right, so just as I said, ""defense"", ""shooting"", etc., - are arbitrary terms that are more intended to be unrefutable than to actually make a positive argument.  RJ Barrett is a better defender, but LeVert's lead over Barrett offensively is significantly higher than Barrett's lead defensively. Barrett has little ability to playmake or create his own shot, where LeVert does. RJ Barrett was assisted on 52% of his shots, LeVert was only assisted on 42%.  Which leads directly to shooting. The fact that they have the same true shooting (so I'm not sure why you're calling Barrett a better shooter to begin with) is not great for Barrett considering the degree of difficulty on assisted shots is much lower, so he should make more of them than LeVert makes off his own creation - but he doesn't, outside of spot-up threes, which LeVert doesn't really take.  As for playing in a system, Caris LeVert was the leading scorer on *two* playoff teams, whereas Barrett scored 14 points on 38% shooting and 28% from three in his playoff system debut. Regardless, ""playing in a system"" is more contingent on having a coach with a good system than anything to do with the players. Kevin Garnett never played in a good system the whole time he was on the Wolves, but they never had a functional system, so we don't hold it against him.  As for potential, that's just not really relevant. Evan Mobley has more ""room to grow"" than say Bam Adebayo right now because Bam is approaching his prime and Mobley isn't. That doesn't mean you give Mobley some prima facie credit for improvements he hasn't yet made.  All in all, to believe Barrett is better, you have to have a reason why ""defense"" and ""spot up shooting"" are sufficiently more important categories for a shooting guard than shot creation and playmaking, which are generally the go-to skills at that position. After all, in all the categories you value, Barrett is better than Devin Booker (better defender, higher 3pt%). But I'm skeptical you would use that to argue Barrett&gt;Booker."
Ant &gt; RJ barrett
Jesus Christ if RJ Barrett made this list than this position must be weak as fuck
Lavine is better than Donovan. Jazz just have a way better team. Bogdan bogdanovic is better than rj Barrett.
RJ Barrett gettin robbed at #15 on the list
"&gt;You can‚Äôt use a 36 game sample size to say one is better. Rj also played much better after the allstar break and his efficiency and impact were still better than Edward‚Äôs despite those numbers. Again I think they‚Äôll both be stars with Edward‚Äôs being the better player, but rn rj is better.   I mean you can compare it to Barrett after ASB. He averaged 18.6/5.4/3.1 on 55.6% TS which is still worse than Edwards. On offence you can't really compare them."
Rj Barrett!
"Anthony Edwards is better despite being a rookie.   Nothing against RJ, but Anthony Edwards looks like he could be a superstar where RJ Barrett looks like his ceiling is a few all star appearances"
"Somewhat related to meeting an NBA player, I met Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) from Entourage while he and his family were vacationing at the beach I used to work at. He was with his in-laws and had just had a baby, so he was kinda pumped to have a young guy to chat with for a bit, especially after I told him that meeting him had made my day. I‚Äôm Canadian and had played against RJ Barrett when I was younger, so we talked about how RJ was gonna fit on the Knicks and whether the porzingus trade was a good call. We then started talking about the Raptors and how pumped I was that they had won it all. Turtle said his player comp was Fred VanVleet and he loved watching him cook in the playoffs. I told him my player comp would probably be Kevin Love because I‚Äôm a relatively unathletic  white guy who can crash the boards hard, bang down low, and shoot well. Turtle roasted me for saying Kevin love is my player comp and after that, he got stuck on dad duty, so we didn‚Äôt talk any further."
Rj Barrett is better and it‚Äôs not close look at the numbers
Rj barrett
Rj Barrett
RJ Barrett... look at how he played year 1 and the jump he made in year 2. He had Elfrid Payton as his starting point guard both seasons who seemed to be allergic to giving him the ball. A much better starting point guard and an improved surrounding cast should push him to the next level.
RJ Barrett.
Literally just the Hawks/Knicks first round series:  * Elfrid Payton * Julius Randle * Solomon Hill * Tony Snell * RJ Barrett  Even in the Lakers series how you coming away thinking you'd rather have Frank Kaminsky on your team.
RJ Barrett will be an All Star within the next 2 years  Deandre Hunter will also be an All Star within the next 2 years
Thanks for including RJ Barrett in the post title
Jarrett Culver RJ Barrett Jimmy Butler
Hot take rj barrett. He averaged 19 last year. He bumps that up to like 23 on a playoff team and he has a decent shot
"We would've been stuck with a Mamba or Carter then. And we ain't winning shit with a nucleus with either of those two with Dennis smith and Harrison Barnes. Probably would have gotten a top pick the next season and had a chance RJ Barrett, Ja, or Zion"
Best player on the Knicks probably rj Barrett
"Jimmy Butler did this with RJ Barrett during a game.  Almost the exact same advice too, haha.  Butler stripped Barrett on a drive and then told him he needed to get into his body more so Butler couldn't strip it.  Thread from  when it happened:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m7urqz/in_their_february_9th_match_up_jimmy_butler_took/  And twitter with the video:  https://twitter.com/BenRitholtzNBA/status/1372559639322189828"
"I can't remember exactly when, but Damian Lillard did that to RJ Barrett last year while someone else was shooting free throws. I can't remember what move it was, but RJ did the same move later in the gsme with the adjustment Dame showed him, and made the shot."
"At this moment having them as an ECF team is higher than most others on this sub would put them. I would say the Knicks are looking like a very competitive second round team, but it's early and I think seeds 3 - 8 are going to be really fucking close this year. You're right, RJ Barrett either needs to step up or some young players + picks need to be traded for an available all-star."
His stats might take a dip from sharing the ball with Kemba and Fournier but RJ Barrett took off his Rock Lee ankle weights in the shape of Elfrid Payton and now has infinite space. He was also already the best perimeter defender on one of the best defensive teams in the league. He won't be flashy enough to be on any MIP ballots but his season is going to be so exciting to watch.
"cole anthony is gonna be in the mix for most improved.   cam reddish in the mix, jordan poole and rj barrett slipping a bit."
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"everyone after RJ Barrett had major question marks in that draft class imo, that was not a draft to trade value to move up in five spots. Granted Saric isn't exactly a big value piece, but yeah they'd have been much better off staying where they were."
25? he should gain like 60  He's taller than Shaq but is about the same weight as RJ Barrett.
"I think, and always have, that RJ  Barrett will have a better career than Zion. I just don't think he will ever be able to stay on the court at that size."
"Im a big Gonzaga fan so I am a fan of the  grizzlies and wizards.  Also Canadian so I'll always tune in to see guy like Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray and Rj Barrett when I get the chance."
"Meanwhile, in the Knicks universe - RJ Barrett still can't hold a spoon with his right hand, is more of a threat for the shot clock than the rim and he somehow logs 35+ mpg."

Poor RJ Barrett.   He‚Äôs trash compared to the other 3rd picks
"You started your comment by saying   &gt;RJ ""yikes"" Barrett has been hot garbage  That‚Äôs not criticizing a player‚Äôs performance, that‚Äôs just shitting on a player and giving him a shitty nickname with a negative connotation for no reason."
"RJ Barrett was shooting 34% from the field and 12% from 3 through 5 games last year. He takes a while to heat up, but I guess this thread is shit-on-the-knicks now, so whatever."
"RJ Barrett was shooting 34% from the field and 12% from 3 through 5 games last year. He takes a while to heat up, but I guess this thread is now shit-on-the-knicks, so whatever"
"RJ ""yikes"" Barrett has been hot garbage to start the season and he was taking so many threes in the clutch, plus he was getting cooked on defense too  Next year contract extension up, Knicks fans will hate him if he keeps this shit up lmao"
RJ Barrett star potential looks dimmer and dimmer as seasons go. Still is a great 3 (when he's hitting his 3s that is) and D guy tho.
"Man! I even remember that cool moment where he got a strip on RJ Barrett, and then when free throws were going down he went over to him and taught him how to keep the ball closer to his chest.  It's refreshing to see."
"Same things happen for people that get deep in the righteous causes as well, from climate change to social justice. People can get wrapped up in the narrative with 110% certainty that they‚Äôre correct and it‚Äôs their calling to educate and change. It changes people when they get militant. And it sucks to watch, whether you agree with their stance or not. Even when their stance is for the greater good. What I mean to say is, it can be difficult to watch the folks we love change and become aggressive.   I understand this may be controversial, but I‚Äôm just trying to make a simple point that Julius Randle is gonna be even better than last year, the Knicks offseason moves were highly underrated and RJ Barrett is primed to make that 3rd year leap into an all-star caliber player."
very high ceiling if he‚Äôs not being defended by rj barrett
"If we are going off last season, yeah he was better than RJ Barrett. Not like man was lighting it up, he was terribly inefficient. If we are going off this season so far, there are a LOT of players are better than OG right now. Man is just playing HORRIBLE. It's indefensible. Man is doing the absolute most rather and forcing his offense, overdribbling at every chance and even broke his own ankle tonight."
"On ESPN, RJ Barrett has no dots between the R and the J, but R.J. Hampton does."
some people think my boy rj barrett aint on the level of herro!
But why must this be the last move for the Sixers to obtain a title? that singular point is what I struggle most to understand. It‚Äôs to say that a strategic retreat is never possible. And it flies in the face of history. The bucks didn‚Äôt get the supporting cast around Giannis exactly right the first time. They tinkered and moved pieces. The Rockets with Hakeem are a great example. People forget that Hakeem was a bit of a malcontent in the late 80s/early 90s because the Rockets took several attempts to put a winning supporting cast around him. But they did eventually. I‚Äôm under no false assumption that getting higher level rotation players for Ben will be the final move needed to put the Sixers in the finals. But it will allow them to move forward and continue building.   And the fact that I‚Äôve put this to you a couple different ways but you continue to push suggests you know on some level that a package centered around RJ Barrett will probably be more attractive to the Blazers than one around Simmons for the aforementioned reasons. I get what you‚Äôre saying-that this is not the time to take a step back but I think this ‚Äúhold or die‚Äù mentality is really just going to result in holding Simmons indefinitely and that won‚Äôt bring the Sixers a title either.
"&gt;	who would you rather have for the Sixers right now and for the next couple years: RJ Barrett or Ben Simmons?  Both of these result in the sixers not winning a title, so I honestly don‚Äôt see a difference between the two.   Yes, RJ results in more wins. But I don‚Äôt care about that, I care about being good enough to win a title. That is the ENTIRE point of the process.    So if presented with your scenario, I bench Ben and just wait. Because we have absolutely no draft capital to improve the team fast enough for Joel‚Äôs window. He is our only bargaining chip at this point and if you don‚Äôt maximize and get equal value for him, then the team is fucked"
"I‚Äôm not saying Ben isn‚Äôt a good player. What I am saying is Ben also has huge red flags which can‚Äôt be ignored, and if someone like Lillard were to become available, many other teams around the league would be offering some of their best young players who aren‚Äôt headcases and if you‚Äôre the Blazers, why not take a nonheadcase who fits easier with the rest of the team and also has huge upside?  Or maybe to put it a different way- I‚Äôm going to presume you‚Äôre a Sixers fan: who would you rather have for the Sixers right now and for the next couple years: RJ Barrett or Ben Simmons?"
MAYBE Herro could be put in that same RJ Barrett talk...
"All those guys you mentioned were successful on the field but had personal issues. Ben has issues on the court. Namely he doesn‚Äôt shoot and it‚Äôs unclear what role he would/should play on a contending team. If you were the Blazers, wouldn‚Äôt you rather get someone like RJ Barrett as a centerpiece for Lillard who fits on a team more conventionally, is younger and theoretically has more years under potential team control, and who hasn‚Äôt revealed himself to be difficult to work with?"
Question for you: at this point why would any team with a star player want to trade that star for Ben? He‚Äôs not as talented and he‚Äôs more disgruntled and less professional? Why do you think the Blazers would prefer a package headlined by Ben over a package headlined by say RJ Barrett?
"RJ ""Rikers"" Barrett"
imagine not drafting RJ Barrett? seems uncouth
"My guy, you are reaching at this point. RJ Barrett, as of right now in his career, is inefficient. It's a simple fact.  Also, RJ's FGA isn't atleast double the league average for SFs and SGs. SFS average 7.9FGA and SGs 8.6FGA. RJ had 11.0FGA to achieve that very inefficient 53.5% True Shooting. If taking 2.4 more shots means being 3.7% points below league average true shooting, then RJ should not be taking those extra shots. A 3.7% drop in efficiency is far too drastic for a measly 2.4 extra shots a game."
Iirc be reclassified to class of 2017.  He was #1 in class of 2018 ahead of RJ Barrett and Zion and he was still the #1 recruit in 2017.  He played in the Drew league as a high schooler and played very well against NBA players.    It‚Äôs not that Bagley was shit and Luka&gt;Bagley was a no brainer but Luka was severely overlooked.
people aren't giving enough credit to RJ Barrett for defending him well last night. RJ wasn't letting him get into his normal spots or letting him drive easily.
TIL RJ Barrett was the first 10 year old on an NBA team
"I know a Knicks fan didn't just post this and didn't include RJ Barrett in that list, we really can't win on this sub"
"RJ Barrett: 54%/ 42%  This will be the norm, I won't hear otherwise"
"He‚Äôs an incredible playmaker are you fucking kidding me?  He had RJ Barrett on him and he‚Äôs Jayson fucking Tatum, you let him do his thing and see what happens."
Its just one game. Let's expand the sample size and maybe we can get to a conclusion. When it comes to RJ Barrett its hard to evaluate coz he's so not flashy (unlike Giannis or Davion Mitchell) and that's ok.
Everyone knows that RJ Barrett and Carmelo Anthony are elite defenders. Now we have the data to prove it.  https://go.nba.com/qgdv
"RJ Barrett had Tatum in JAIL last night, only starter with no turnovers, scored an efficient 19 points, my man is a 2 way star in the making"

"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"

It's bordering on hopeful optimism than anything grounded in a realistic projection."

"These are the players I can't remember hearing a bad thing about all summer long. When a person says any of these names come up on a podcast, the other person immediately falls all over themselves to agree so emphatically that they might also take some credit for bringing him up. Saying you expect big things from these players is like saying the password to enter the sports media hootch parlor.   ...and if you have a 100% approval rating from group-thinky NBA podcasters, I'm sorry but you are probably overrated.  1.

Rj Barrett top 20 if u factor in World Cup/Olympic achievements
RJ barrett needs to take a serious step up this year but I am not see it
"‚ÄúRJ Barrett got better at everything‚Äù‚Ä¶thank you for noticing, Zach!"
RJ Barrett lol
"Obviously they had the best year since Melo was there, but I still don‚Äôt think the Knicks are in a great shape.   I look at their roster and just don‚Äôt see what their future is. I rate RJ Barrett more than anyone, I pretty much locked him as an all star from day one. While no doubt he will improve (as being so young as a slasher is almost impossible, how can he bash against teal me) just from general strength and his body being more mature, I still thought he would‚Äôve showed a bit more than he has. Thibs just seems to hate him. So while I expect improvement, he still needs to take that next leap.   Apart from RJ, who/what do they have? Obi Toppin? Quickley? Not much of a future there (even though Quickley had some nice moments last year) from what we have seen.  Randle had his best season, but does he keep it up or does he go back to his selfish ways if the knicks get off to a bad start? The rest of the roster is just literally role players.  They traded their best player in a deal they couldn‚Äôt of done any worse on. Dennis Smith Jr is currently playing for the blazers and had maybe 5 good games at the Knicks and they still aren‚Äôt a free agent destination.  So while it was absolutely awesome to see such an underdog team in a big market do well for the first time in forever, I just don‚Äôt see much brightness in their future right now. Things can change and I hope they do. Just not sold."
&gt;RJ Barrett had a field-goal percentage of 44.1 in 2020-21.  That is not good+he's a mid self creator
&gt;RJ Barrett had a field-goal percentage of 44.1 in 2020-21.  That isn't good + he isn't a good self creator
I don‚Äôt think RJ is top 100 and OG is around top 50 to me. Barrett is just too inefficient for just having such little creation
"&gt; RJ is better than OG was when OG was his age, how he develops is still to be seen.  I think in general Development isn‚Äôt linear, he also has better stats than Giannis at his age. It‚Äôs a decent point though because I know RJ is a hard worker, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he reach the same level of player    As for the bottom, OG is significantly better on defense than Barrett, and is significantly more efficient (53 TS for RJ vs 61 TS for OG). Especially when you consider RJ doesnt create much from a standstill either, his inefficiency is kind of inexcusable in this situation"
What are the tools though? Barrett isn‚Äôt an off the dribble shooter and is very stiff so his space creation/handle is lacking. He‚Äôs good at attacking the rim but he also a significantly worse finisher than OG by nearly 20% (60 for RJ 75% for OG). He will also just never reach OG‚Äôs level on defense either
"RJ Barrett.   Here's what the average All-Star wings look like in their 3rd year:  Player| PPG | TS% ---|---|---- Kawhi  | 12.8 | 60.2 Harden  | 16.8 | 66.0 Klay | 18.4 | 55.5 Beal| 15.3| 52.1 Giannis | 16.9 | 56.6 George| 17.4 | 53.1 Middleton | 13.4 | 56.3 Russell | 15.5 | 50.9 Oladipo | 16.0| 53.4 Butler | 13.1 | 52.2 Hayward| 14.1  | 56.4 ---| ---  | --- Average| 15.4 | 55.7  Here's what RJ Barrett looks like in his 2nd year:  Player| PPG | TS% ---|---|---- Barrett| 17.6 | 53.5  He has a little to work on efficiency-wise but he's already ahead of schedule compared to most All-Star wings.  ***   OG is a nice player but he's now in his 5th year and people are hoping he can catch up by following Kawhi's trajectory, which is a lot less likely.   There's never a guarantee in terms of how guys will develop, but I'd take the guy ahead of schedule over the guy trying to play catchup."
RJ Barrett got 2 write ins LMFAOOOOOO
"I have LeBron Jaylen Brown and RJ Barrett (and Valanciunas), trust me you're in better shape than I am in Fantasy rn"
"one thing i can say is the Knicks last two games w burks in and no kemba is the best they‚Äôve looked, a road win at atlanta with no d rose and then going down the wire at Brooklyn with no RJ barrett past the first quarter. Definitely playing better without him"
RJ Barrett is ill but still started the game. What?
RJ Barrett what the hell was that lol
Our entire starting lineup aside from RJ Barrett‚Ä¶ glad we‚Äôre shaking it up
"I have been betting against the Knicks a lot the last few games because I figured, well if we‚Äôre gonna play like shit I might as well make some money off it. So I‚Äôve been betting on the other team for the overall spread, the third quarter spread, the under on points for RJ Barrett, etc. And I‚Äôve won most of those bets.   I‚Äôve never been happier to lose money. Kemba Walker is the 4th best PG on this team and Burks and Quickley should take all of his minutes"
"It‚Äôs crazy how my 3 large adult sons; RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin, and Immanuel Quickley, all play for my favorite NBA team, the New York Knicks."
"RJ Barrett last 10 games averages: 10.3 points, 1.9 assists, 1.7 turnovers on 29.6% FG shooting üî•üî•  Future superstar?"
Worry about RJ Barrett being a bust lil bro üòπ
"He hasn‚Äôt been great recently, but RJ Barrett not being on that list was very surprising to me. I‚Äôm not saying he should be in the top 10, but him being behind Talen Horton-Tucker was shocking to me."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"??? Not understanding why so many people are putting Maxey up here over guys like Jaren Jackson Jr, RJ Barrett and Jarrett Allen"
Thats how you guys spell RJ Barrett in the DMV? Thats crazy
Rj Barrett will be.
"Kinda a weird post to make considering Canadian basketball has really been taking off in the past 5-10 years. RJ Barrett, SGA, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins with some other talented Canadians that didn't quite pan out"
"Is Thibs really a COTY type coach, or did he just kind of line up with Randle's anomaly of a season?  It's obvious that Rose, IQ, and Toppin bring a much better pace and energy than the likes of Kemba Walker. RJ Barrett plays hard but his shooting form is so stiff he's always going to be a streaky scorer. And Randle... if they keep trying to force the offense through him, an early playoff exit is their ceiling.  In short, they got to change their starting and bench lineups."
"""RJ Barrett is better"" - Knicks fans last season"
"Is it not Herro by a landslide? I dont pay much attention to Barrett, but I do know he has never had an offensive stretch like Herro‚Äôs start to this season. I know RJ is a much better defender, but Herro has drastically improved his defense this year as well."
RJ Barrett should take more shots. He should take some from Randle. Also Randle seems to be a contract year player. Last year and his pelican year he played insane
Tyler Herro or RJ Barrett moving forward in their careers.........who do y‚Äôall put your money on as the better prospect?
Remember RJ Barrett? Whatever happened to that guy
"man i really thought rj barrett would be a star in the league, but dude just looks more like a good role player"
Tyrese Maxey  RJ Barrett
Oh don't you worry. Julius Randle and RJ Barrett will combine to go 11/31 tonight and both be -10 or worse.
"I want the Knicks to go back to being the failures and disappointments they were. I want to see Randle regress to being who he was before last year, and for RJ Barrett to be a bust. I want LOLKNICKS again"
RJ Barrett plays for the Knicks and it's not even close
you bum RJ barrett has MJ potential.
"They‚Äôre both interesting because they‚Äôre not freakishly good at anything in particular, but through a ton of hard work have turned themselves in all-NBA players. You can‚Äôt really say someone is going to be the next LeBron, that‚Äôs an unrealistically high bar that requires all time great athleticism + BBIQ. But shit, why can‚Äôt DeAndre Hunter (or the Bridges, Reddish, RJ Barrett, Devin Vassell, etc, etc) be Paul George? We‚Äôll probably start seeing a few more Middleton comps for these guys now that he‚Äôs got a ring and is a little more high profile."

what did RJ Barrett do to you üò≠ leave him alone he‚Äôs in a slump ok
if you go by our subreddit it's RJ barrett every time he has a bad game
"He definitely becomes a lottery pick.  Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Tyler Herro, Darius Garland, Cam Reddish, RJ Barrett are varying degrees of definitely to likely going ahead of him, but he gets bumped up past quite a few other players for sure."
does RJ Barrett have anything in his offensive bag other than flopping?
Randle and Barrett are a terrible fit together both only use their left it's way too predictable.  RJ Barrett is definitely worth keeping but Randle is at best a number 3 option on a contender. Trade Randle and the Knicks will be better.
Randle finally showed life tonight at least  RJ Barrett on the other hand...
"RJ Barrett? He didn't regress much, but I was expecting him to get better. All his stats this season are below career average"
"Knicks fan.  RJ Barrett is not amazing yet and his stats have not improved much from last year, and he does not get many opportunities to run the show. But you can see his handle has gotten tighter this year and he is more confident stepping into shots.  Considering the leap he had from year 1 to year 2, and the other items he has added to his bag in year three, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if 4-5 years pass and all of a sudden he is Paul George light.  Obviously that‚Äôs a very optimistic view of things, but sue me, he asked for a surprise"
"D. Fox - B. Hield - RJ Barrett - Luka - P. Siakam - K. Middleton - **Wood** - C. Capela - G. Hayward   I don't remember how high I drafted him but it was decently high, most of my team now is from trades I only drafted Luka, Wood, Capela and Hayward. I picked off games for almost everyone that week tho but Wood had the second lowest output, lowest output from the whole season so far from anyone on my teams besides a 9 point game by RJ Barrett the same week  So I guess RJ was the main reason, but Wood didn't help much either lol"
Are we sure RJ Barrett is..... good?
Those threads after RJ Barrett had a couple good games in a row were premature
RJ Barrett
"dude's been my only beacon of hope in Fantasy with LeBron/Jaylen Brown being out for stretches and RJ Barrett in a bad shooting slump, where I currently have a 0% chance of making the playoffs in my league üòî"
Imagine being a Knicks fan with RJ Barrett.
I think RJ Barrett is the player most likely to play 4 decades next. Steph and Harden are the most likely from 09 but came into the league relatively old. RJ was barely 19 when drafted in 2019 so only has to play until 40.
rj barrett is never going to be that guy

Zach Lowe brought that up on his last podcast how the starters are struggling and the bench is one of the best units in the league. Lowe went into the struggles of Randle and Kevin Pelton said he was more concerned with the play of RJ Barrett.
"Julius Randle and RJ Barrett are absolutely brutal to watch.       Julius *completely* ruins any offensive chemistry when he's in. He's gone back to his 2019 play style, but instead of driving and spinning into 4 defenders, he's now SLOWLY backing down and pounding the ball into a contested turnaround fadeaway brick.       It fucks up any offensive momentum we may have. When he's on the court it's literally ""4 people stand around on the opposite side and watch Julius Randle brick"". He was a team worst -21 last night.       I'm not sure what happened to the Randle that moved around, ran an offense, always looked to drive and kick, etc.       Julius Randle is taking 40% of his shots from the midrange (3+ feet out to the 3p line). That is 7 shots per game. He is shooting 33% on those. That means whenever Julius takes a shot from midrange, which he's doing 7 times a game, the expected points is 0.66. That is absolute dogshit, but he won't stop doing it.        RJ Barrett is forcing awful shots and missing, 40.5% FG on the year.   Kemba is in a tough spot. Even when he's shooting well, he's such a negative on defense, and the rest of the squad is so bad they can't hide him.     Fournier is trash. Similar to Kemba, but at least Kemba's been hitting his shots lately.     Obi looks great, so that's a highlight. Burks is great. IQ is awesome.        Really, I think the starting 5 should probably be Rose, IQ, RJ, Obi, Mitch. At least until Randle stops taking turnaround fadeaways with 15 seconds on the shotclock.        Just need to shit on Randle more, one sec:      He is taking 8.1 pull-ups per game with an eFG% of 39.7%. Gross."

"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don‚Äôt understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden. For most teams the 2nd option is Bojan Bogdanovic, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, or even Reggie Jackson or RJ Barrett. And out of all of those players CJ is the best scorer AND playmaker you can get."
RJ Barrett will end up being the best player to come out of his draft class.
He‚Äôs getting the RJ Barrett treatment lmaooo
"Sorry we can‚Äôt all have a big three of ‚Ä¶*checks notes*‚Ä¶Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Evan Fournier"
"&gt; Thybulle is good on a contending team not a tanking one  He's 24 so I don't really know why a tanking team wouldn't want him. Either way he's quite cheap so I'm sure you could get assets from a contender that wants an elite defender on a great contract.   &gt; The Knicks if they offer Barrett, Toppin, Quickley  Toppin and quickley quite honestly haven't shown a ton in their careers so far. Quickley is a bit better than toppin but he's below 40% from the field for his career. They both have a ways to go before being useful basketball players.  RJ barrett is a solid asset, but let's be real here. Going into year 3, he's a good defender with medium scoring volume on below average efficiency. Ben Simmons is flawed but a 3 time all star. Maxey is worth less than RJ at this point but if he sustains his level of play he could be worth more by the trade deadline. I just don't see how this package is worth more than philly's."
"Because other teams can beat you what assets do you have outside Simmons. There is a chance teams see Simmons as a negative asset with how much of a dumbass he‚Äôs being. If you‚Äôre the knicks you toss in either RJ Barrett or Randle to get Lillard not both but one, some young guys and salary fillers. Outside of Lillard who do you guys think you can get, the wizards are looking pretty good and definitely aren‚Äôt trading Beal.   You can also acquire Barnes, Buddy and get a couple firsts and possibly package that and some more firsts and some young guys for Lillard or another star that comes on the market. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but if I was blazers I would be salivating at unprotected 1st round kings picks."
No. Randle (minutes leader for the Knicks) is 16th in the league in MPG. Next highest is RJ Barrett at 48th.
RJ Barrett will average 40/7/8 on 70 ts% and carry us to wins.

"I dont judge a 21 year old player with 86 career games played. A full NBA season is 82-games. Context matters.   Similar to RJ Barrett criticism, sure Barrett is inconsistent and at times god awful, but RJ is also 21 years old.   What we focus on, in a young player, is flashes of their ceiling. KPJ and Barrett have shown their potential. The key is consistency and a proper growth trajectory."
Would you say RJ Barrett is untouchable if a disgruntled star becomes available? Just curious what Knicks fans would think if say Dame wanted to come but Blazers held out for Barrett in the trade?
üî¥RETURN OF THE KNICKS PODCAST RECAP KNICKS DEFEAT TO HORNETS 104 - 96 WHERE DID RJ Barrett GO ?
"RJ Barrett has been bad, hasn‚Äôt taken a superstar leap"
"I just wanna say that i was not very impressed with the Knicks when they faced the Cavs. Randle seemed to get the ball to far away from the basket, usually on the 3 pt line and RJ Barrett was putrid."
"If you saw recent games then I can see why you feel that way. The past 4 games Barrett hasn‚Äôt been good. But from the end of last season (not counting playoffs) to the first 9 games Barrett‚Äôs defense was top tier, his shooting was great, his driving and playmaking was strong too.   He already had multiple 20 point games, set a career high 35, and had defensive impacts that held guys like Tatum and DeRozan to low percentages.   And saying Kemba can space the floor is kinda saying that RJ can‚Äôt shoot which isn‚Äôt true since last year he shot 40% and this year he was at the 40% mark until the last 4 games.   When RJs shot isn‚Äôt going in, he‚Äôll still crash boards and play defense. When Kemba isn‚Äôt going in, he‚Äôs not worth keeping on the court, this makes Kemba a bigger liability for us"
"Unpopular opinion here;  I think Julius is more of a problem than we think. Kemba can't defend at all and so either IQ or Rose should step into being a starter BUT if you look at how Julius Randle plays, it's kinda like he's back into his old ways, tryna be the star.  He isos and takes bad shots, not really setting up for others - which in turn has hurt RJ Barrett because he's afraid of messing up when he does get the ball.  I just think Randles mentality rn is about him and not about the team."
"bro chill out lmao you seem to be the one hyper-invested and with a problem here. You're talking to someone who coming out of college argued Zo would never be able to shoot a pull up jumper and create halfcourt offense in the NBA, I'm far from a stan lol. There's nothing crazy about a young player in the NBA improving from a 38%3PT shooter to being a 40%3PT shooter. That's a jump so small that one could literally just call it year to year variation.  3PT% is not purely a function of shooting ability, it's heavily impacted by shot selection and volume. Lonzo doesn't shoot the types of shots Duncan or Buddy shoot. If those guys were more selective with their shots their percentages would be higher, but by virtue of their talent they can attempt more shots on the move and get up higher volume.  There were 78 guys in the NBA last year who shot 40% from 3. It's not the super elite small group you think it is anymore lol. RJ Barrett made 40% of his 3s, and he's not Buddy or Duncan lmao"
He had more points on that shot than RJ Barrett did the whole game.
It's genuinely crazy to me that lamelo played against rj barrett as a 13 year old freshman and now they're both playing against each other in the nba lol jeez time fucking FLEW    EDIT: [For the uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDPwQrsWeSk)
"RJ Barrett attempted more free throws last season than Lonzo's career total, so I guess sample sizes are relative here."
"I think RJ Barrett can be first team all-nba at some point in the next 5-6 years, people are starting to come around on his stock but to me he‚Äôs always looked like a really good young player who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of flaws and grows their game constantly.  Perfect intangibles"
I did not think the Derrick rose trade was going to be a big deal.  I just assumed he was already washed and would be constantly injured and also no jump shot.   D rose feels like he‚Äôs rejuvenated and reinvented himself - I‚Äôm shocked and impressed by his 3 ball.  His first stint on the Knicks was a nightmare so I was expecting the worst - instead it was the complete opposite.   Another homer take - RJ Barrett is gonna be an all star caliber player in one or two years
"RJ Barrett, who I just imagine is in the Harrison Barnes and Andrew Wiggins mold."
"RJ Barrett, Caris LaVert, TJ Warren"
RJ Barrett üò± is good at basketball.
"I don't know, imagine getting excited buy season ticket to see KAT?  Would you not rather see something like the Ant and RJ Barrett show?"
"Scalding take but I think RJ Barrett is very similar to Lebron.  Obviously he's not good as Lebron, but the way he plays being a jack of all trades atm, master of none - it really makes me think of Lebron sometimes.  Like straight up he has good passing vision, can go downhill, his IQ is pretty good, shooting is getting pretty good, drives in the lane &amp; finishes way more now, and can rebound for you if needed.   Like I said it's a scalding hot take but RJ having Lebron-esque playstyle doesn't seem too far off &amp; again he's not going to be as good as lebron ."
Its a guards league. In a redraft you take Ja over Zion. Theres a real argument for RJ over zion also.   Barrett has Kawhi/Butler level defensive potential with improvements on offense every season. specifically This year he is a better finisher and last year he showed he has potential to be a legit 3pt shooter.  Need to see zion play with the rule changes i cant see him averaging 27ppg when guys like harden and trae have regressed from it. Plus zion is fat and cant shoot theres a real possibility he regresses to a 20ppg scorer this season.

"If it‚Äôs not dame then they could pull that trigger at any time. Didn‚Äôt Portland and Philly talk about a cj trade in the off season but Philly wanted too much ?  And if Portland decides to move dame, plenty of teams could outbid Philly.  What‚Äôs Philly‚Äôs best case scenerio package ? Thybulle Ben maxey and some 1sts? Okc has their 2025 1st barring protections, which means they can‚Äôt trade 2026 or 2024. So 1sts from 2023 and 2027 ig?  Golden state could package together 1sts from 2022 and 2026 along with moody, kuminga, poole and wiseman. 3 very young lotto picks bursting with potential and a young MIP front runner.   Boston could offer more picks around Jaylen brown, maybe toss in Robert Williams and Aaron Nesmith.   Knicks could package RJ Barrett, all the picks they have which is like all of their own and a few from other teams, and young guys like Toppin and quickly"
That RJ Barrett is a bust. Most Knick fans are happy with RJ. He's become a great defender and his shooting and scoring have all made a leap. He's proving to be the 3rd best player of what was considered a 3 player draft back in 2019.
"The Knicks Fung Shuei has been disturbed. RJ ""Mengzi"" Barrett bust restore balance."
Love my ex-Breaker player. But RJ Barrett exists lol.
"some teams haven't even played ten games yet, it's way too early to be limiting your pool that much. jrue, jaylen brown, kyle lowry, and lonzo are all good players with decent season starts in the east, and then there's rj barrett and derozan (both listed g/f) who could challenge now"
"He probably wasn‚Äôt being guarded by RJ BARRETT!  RJ the Savior of NY is a future DPOY!, he would‚Äôve locked him down for sure"
RJ Barrett is actually right handed but was taught to play lefty.
great young ballers but rj bigger and stronger and overall better defender plus his playmaking ability has significantly improved as well as his overall O so my boy Barrett but love herrontoo
1. Jordan Poole  2. Miles Bridges  3. OG Anunoby  4. Tyler Herro  5. RJ Barrett

"Kyrie, RJ Barrett+Randle+Kemba, Jaylen Brown, and Fred+Siakam could all be available in exchange for Dame. And that's just from your division alone. All of those are better bets than what we know about Simmons."
If that's what you call efficient then I hate what you think is inefficient. If you want to know what an efficient player looks like check out RJ Barrett stats
I like RJ Barrett
"tyler herro, rj barrett"
"Ja at 4 is hilariously bad. Zion was a clear number one, but ja was much closer to Zion than he was rj Barrett"
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can‚Äôt decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
"Is RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson and a 1st enough? Possibly."
Rj Barrett is averaging 39 mins lmaooo
"OK pump the brakes.  Thibs took over the Bulls, and guided them to the playoffs five consecutive years in a row. His first year was his only year with a healthy Derrick Rose, and the Bulls went all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. His second year, Rose went down in the first round with his knee injury and the Bulls never recovered. Without Rose, the Bulls make the playoffs again, win their first round series, and lose the next against Lebron. The next season, Rose's other knee goes out, and frickin' Joakim Noah has an MVP season under Thibs, he comes in fourth in votes behind Durant, Lebron, and then Blake. The next year the Bulls win their first series, and lose again to Lebron.  Dude, as much as I hate to admit it, Lebron was the roadblock, even a healthy Bulls team probably wasn't going to overcome Lebron's Heat or Cavs. I mean, we know what's like having had MJ an entire generation of superstars a ring, and...yeah, it was our turn. Thibs certainly had his flaws, but dude does a hell of a job getting the most out of his players.   Is he going to run RJ Barrett into the ground? Absolutely."
RJ Barrett all-rookie snub 2020
"We‚Äôre 7 games in where most guys have crazy inflated stats and he‚Äôs still averaging almost identical PPG all of the last 3 years, including when he played alongside Anthony Davis and averaged 21 a game in the same lineup as Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. He‚Äôs now averaging 22 with RJ Barrett and Reggie Bullock. This is who he is and why the Knicks paid him. Miles different is when DLo jumped 6 PPG including a few 40 point showings. I know Knicks fans are dying to make that leap and become attractive again, but if it‚Äôs going to happen it has to be RJ and not Randle who does that, plain and simple."
MVP: Julius Randle  MIP: RJ Barrett  ROTY: Immanuel Quickley  FMVP: LeBron James  F2: Lakers and Knicks  Champs: Knicks
I think I'm in love with RJ Barrett.
RJ Barrett most improved??
RJ Barrett and Julius Randle going crazy right now. Scary Terry as well but i dont think they can sustain it
who is RJ Barrett?  in math: my solution ‚ûó  in history: my king üëë  in art: my muse üé®  in science: my oxygen üí®  in geography: my world üåé
Immanuel Quickley and RJ Barrett are the shining light in this abyss.
Julius Randle- MVP  Mitchell Robinson- DPOY  RJ Barrett- MIP  IQ- ROTY  Alec Burks- 6 Man of the year  Austin Rivers- A bucket
\*inahales deeply\* RJ BARRETT IS GOOD. Julius Randle is an all-star.  Quickley is a steal. Elfrid Payton didn't close the game. A year ago we had Fizdale.....
RJ FUCKING BARRETT AND IMMANUEL FUCKING QUICKLEY
RJ Barrett shows All-Star potential in some games and looks like a role player in others.  He just needs to be more consistent.
Immanuel Quickley  RJ Barrett   Alec Burks  Julius Randle  Mitchell Robinson  although this squad might win a ring...
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.   But I‚Äôd say we have better basketball players than baseball players right now. Thanks to Vince Carter‚Äôs popularity in the 2000‚Äôs and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there‚Äôs way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there‚Äôs:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
Rockets are absolutely getting shafted here. They not only trade away a young budding star in Wood for RJ Barrett and a 2nd round pick...they trade away a generational talent in Harden for Paul George????
RJ Barrett is better than Pascal Siakam
&gt;RJ Barrett 41:50 minutes  Thibs effect
"PG - Dame  SG - Ron Baker  SF - RJ Barrett  PF - Melo  C - Boban  Team would be amazing(Dame an Ron would be new splash bros, RJ would be an elite slasher with all that spacing, Melo/Dame would be clutch scorers and Boban would be so sexy that other teams forget to play)"
"Don't jinx it!  3-7 is still possible!   Honestly though I think this could be the new normal for Randle.  He's been steadily putting together solid seasons and might have taken the next step.  I'm rooting for RJ Barrett to have a good career too, so here's hoping he has a strong sophomore season."

Is rj barrett good yet or not? I just want him to be good man
Reggie Miller was the Knick-killer  RJ Barrett is the Pacer-killer
RJ Barrett proves he was born to be a Knick by showing that he clearly hates the Indiana Pacers.

"Ben was too busy holding RJ Barrett to 17 points on 17 shots, homie.   The salt in your tears tastes wonderful."
Do the Knicks never use RJ Barrett in closing minutes? It was all Randle ball.
What the guy who replied to u said was right. We did a bad job defending the paint and most of your points in the paint were successful pick and rolls. RJ Barrett and iq were driving to the paint and getting fouls primarily on Deandre Jordan.
RJ Barrett :)
"Canada: Only other country with an NBA team   Canadian players: SGA, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Lu Dort, Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, and a few others.

"RJ Barrett, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olynyk, Corey Joseph, Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray"
"Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, and Boucher as well"
RJ BARRETT
I agree. Technical foul on RJ Barrett away from the play.
"""And now they're saying he's not in fact RJ Barrett"""
"Hang on, have you checked to see if you're RJ Barrett?"
I remember when he was in high school and was ranked the number 1 prospect of the 2019 draft class (over Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett) before he reclassified to the 2018 draft class. I can't help but root for him to prove everyone wrong after he has been declared a bust.
"Had some clutch shots last game, a cool 22 pts  Let‚Äôs see if RJ ‚ÄúKnicks Franchise Hope(lol)‚Äù Barrett has the opportunity to make some clutch shots and get his team the W tonight"
RJ Barrett is good yes
"&gt;People don't even know how Wiggins plays, they call RJ Barrett Wiggins 2.0 when they don't play the same either.  I could be wrong, but I believe that most of the time when people are saying ""Wiggins 2.0"" they are referring more so to the guy not really being worth a #1 pick rather than specifically referring to his playing style"
"You're not wrong that hes put up disappointing stats overall, but also realize that with rookies especially you need to put more emphasis on the ""eye test"" than with more established players.  Some of these guys enter the league into a total shitshow (like Edwards.    Check out Zach Lavine stats his rookie year, Colin Sexton , RJ Barrett.  These are guys who looked solid on the eye test and it took a little bit for their actual on court production to catch up to that"
"Wiggins 2.0 is what's said by anyone who doesn't watch basketball. People don't even know how Wiggins plays, they call RJ Barrett Wiggins 2.0 when they don't play the same either."
Patrick Williams and RJ Barrett remind me of Kawhi Leonard
I‚Äôm pretty sure that was the same loser who was shitting on RJ Barrett after like 40 games.
"&gt; No ones progression is linear, because Tatum was way better than Barrett if you compare their rookie years but Tatum is while still better, not far better if you compare their 2nd years  so it shows that Barrett has improved since his rookie year and is on a similar path as another young star.   &gt;And it was to show that you weren‚Äôt rushing to make posts like this after Barrett‚Äôs rookie year either  you keep bringing this up as if it‚Äôs amazing point but it‚Äôs clear Barrett was underperforming in his rookie, evidenced by the fact that most of this sub was calling him ja bust and that he didn‚Äôt make the rookie year. why would you compare someone who‚Äôs struggling? It makes no sense.   &gt;Your fucking posts says ‚ÄúBarrett is currently having a better sophomore year than Tatum‚Äù. You just didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpost stats‚Äù why are you playing stupid bruh?   And the post contains stats... see how everyone else has made good points about usage and chemistry while you‚Äôre sitting here crying that a comparison was made all.  &gt; The reason why the comparison is Bull is because you‚Äôre comparing at a time when he wasn‚Äôt what he is now.  No shit... I compared him against RJ at the same year and same age. Usually that‚Äôs how comparisons work.    &gt; He wasn‚Äôt the best young forward in the game in 18-19 but yet you‚Äôre using how good Tatum is today as a reason to up your guy when you‚Äôre comparing him to a not as good Tatum more or less.  people were calling him the best young forward in the game back then especially after that playoff performance against Lebron. He clearly is now so why wouldn‚Äôt I compare how RJ is developing against him?  &gt;keep repeating myself because of your lack of comprehension and understanding  nah I understand ‚Äúwah wah don‚Äôt compare anyone to tatum because I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù pretty well, it‚Äôs just fucking stupid.   &gt; You don‚Äôt come here and see ‚Äúx player at this age is having a better season than y player at the same age‚Äù.   Is it your first day on the sub? people do all the time lmao  &gt;And yeah dude, you don‚Äôt watch RJ Barrett at all. I‚Äôm convinced.

"&gt;I never said rookie years changed sophomore year stats, but neither did you lol.  So then why bring them up when  comparing sophomore years?   &gt;The way YOU phrased it you meant it as a shot.  by posting their stats?   &gt; You compared Barrett to Tatum because Tatum is the best young wing in the game, not because ‚ÄúUhH tHEY boTH cAmE oUTTa DUkE ANd wERE tHe 3RD pICKS‚Äù.   So he‚Äôs the best young wing in the game + both being the 3rd pick + both coming from the same college and I shouldn‚Äôt compare them because your feelings are hurt or something? who should I compare him to?  &gt; Buddy, YOU RIGHT NOW are comparing Barrett‚Äôs stats to someone‚Äôs else and it‚Äôs looks pathetic   The only thing pathetic is how mad you‚Äôre getting about them being compared.

First half Rj Barrett when he plays Indiana on the first game of the szn.
"I never said rookie years changed sophomore year stats, but neither did you lol. You acted like the shit didn‚Äôt matter whilst comparing it to freshman years at College. Go read what YOU said  No I really wouldn‚Äôt be here if that‚Äôs what you said instead of ‚ÄúRJ‚Äôs numbers are better than Tatum‚Äôs his 2nd year‚Äù. Even if you were in any way knowledgeable about what you were talking about I wouldn‚Äôt be here anymore but you sound so ignorant to the situation that I can‚Äôt help but get a laugh at sonning you    I didn‚Äôt say all comparisons were a shot. Your comprehension skills are very weak. The way YOU phrased it you meant it as a shot. Quit acting stupid and acting like you meant it in any way than how it came off.   Oh now I see! You should‚Äôve said it all along! You compared Barrett to Tatum because Tatum is the best young wing in the game, not because ‚ÄúUhH tHEY boTH cAmE oUTTa DUkE ANd wERE tHe 3RD pICKS‚Äù. Like I said it wasn‚Äôt a random comparison you specifically had Tatum on your mind smh    Buddy, YOU RIGHT NOW are comparing Barrett‚Äôs stats to someone‚Äôs else and it‚Äôs looks pathetic üòÇüòÇ like I said when Tatum was in his 1st couple years I wasn‚Äôt here saying ‚ÄúwOW lOOk hOW MUcH BEtTEr tATUm iS tHAn *insert player here who lives rent free in my head*‚Äù. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing instead of just enjoying your own guy you gotta find a way to make it weird.

You Hate to see it  Wow man, I bet you found out about RJ Barrett when he put a Knicks hat on for the first time lol. Kid you‚Äôre a casual. I knew about RJ Barrett 4-5 years now. Guarantee Longer than you have. I‚Äôve watched more of him than you have and know him as a player more than you. Take some advice from me and stop talking about the game until you learn it"
You can thank me for this performance. I dropped him in my fantasy league for RJ Barrett(third this this season where I drop him and he pops off)
"&gt;Bruh there‚Äôs a difference between discounting the rookie year and acting like it didn‚Äôt matter by somehow comparing it to college years like you did.   Rookie years don‚Äôt change sophomore year stats. If someone had a good rookie year you would expect them to have a good sophomore year and you would expect someone who didn‚Äôt have a good rookie year to have worse sophomore comparably.   &gt; No I wouldn‚Äôt be over here. You tried to send a shot at a player on my team by acting like RJ Barrett is on track to somehow be above him  yeah you would lmao, can‚Äôt have someone making any comparisons to your boy.   &gt;Naw you could make comparisons but again as I just said the way you said it you meant for it to be a shot, don‚Äôt get mad when people see it that way. You‚Äôre too smart for that  yeah cos every comparison is a shot. funny how your only response has been ‚Äúwaaahh look at the rookie years!!‚Äù and ‚Äúwaaahh don‚Äôt compare him to my boy compare him to someone else!!‚Äù   &gt; And you mention ‚ÄúAge,Draft Pick, College‚Äù what about Brandon Ingram then? What about Jabari Parker then? They‚Äôre Duke too, what so because they were the #2 pick instead of 3rd you decided to go with Tatum? Knock it off you had Tatum on your mind  Because Tatum is the better player? Why wouldn‚Äôt I compare him to Tatum?   &gt; When he wasn‚Äôt that though, I didn‚Äôt spend my time saying ‚Äúwow look at how much better Tatum‚Äôs numbers are than insert player on a team in which I hate‚Äù  yeah, no one ever compared his stats to other superstars when they were younger.  This post is literally the first time anyone has compared anyone‚Äôs sophomore stats with someone else‚Äôs.    &gt;I made a thread a month ago, saying ‚Äúwho‚Äôs gonna make the all star team first him or Herro?‚Äù. I knew about Barrett before you did most likely. It‚Äôs the fans like you who ruin it  Wow man you knew about him a month ago? Teach us casuals how to stay up to date on young players pls"
RJ Barrett is far from being untradeable. I'm not saying he's a bust but he's developing slowly compared to other young players. If someone like Beal or Lavine wanted to go to Knicks y'all should trade him in a heartbeat.
Knicks: No one but maybe RJ Barrett
"1.1 field goal is a big difference lol. It looks small in text but that‚Äôs the difference between RJ Barrett and Tobias Harris in terms of scoring output. And like I said, Jokic has way more FGM made than Embiid, we don‚Äôt know that if Embiid were to play more that those per game stats would be sustained"
"RJ Barrett is only going to keep getting better, he's been slept on a bit in his rookie year due to his inefficiency but he's improving there and has brought his FT % up which was sorely needed.   I love the kid and been following him since he was in Sauga, he's got the tools (physical/mental/work ethic) to be a great All-Star / All-NBA player in the league. I believe he'll get there in 2-3 years' time."
I told MFs RJ Barrett was coming
"Bruh there‚Äôs a difference between discounting the rookie year and acting like it didn‚Äôt matter by somehow comparing it to college years like you did. Go back and read what you said. Apparently to you Duke is the same as Year one in The nba lmao   No I wouldn‚Äôt be over here. You tried to send a shot at a player on my team by acting like RJ Barrett is on track to somehow be above him. Fucking Knicks fans man. I know you‚Äôre lost in the your own shit but that‚Äôs what you were doing bro    Alright then send me the ‚Äúsomeone else who made the comparison‚Äù because all I see is you.

Again you‚Äôre making jokes but how long have you watched the nba if in anyway you think only I‚Äôm the one on the boat of Tatum being much better than Barrett their first years.   No ones saying you had to make that post, but it‚Äôs obvious you had one player on your mind that you wanted to shit on and waited till your guy had a similar stage could viably home a candle the one in which you hear all of these superstar conversations about and you shot your shot. It didn‚Äôt land but you tried it and the point is where was this 6 months ago?    What are you talking about? Tatum and RJ didn‚Äôt enter the league at some extremely young age. You get one and dones every year. RJ‚Äôs age right now is no different than Ingram‚Äôs was his 2nd year, or Fox‚Äôs, Wiggins, and plenty of other guys. Tatum and RJ aren‚Äôt uniquely separated from the others age wise."
"&gt; Buddy get it through your fucking skull the entire point is that any players that are as young as Tatum and Barrett are will have peaks and valleys.  Ok so? When did I say they wouldn‚Äôt have?  &gt;You bringing up‚Äúthat‚Äôs a Credit to RJ‚Äù means nothing because if he slumps next week then what will be your point? Is he no longer deserving of credit?   A week slump wouldn‚Äôt change the fact that he‚Äôs putting a comparable stats to Tatum for a season? If he finished the season poorly then he wouldn‚Äôt deserve credit.  &gt;And it isn‚Äôt a point of ‚ÄúIf Tatum had such a better rookie year‚Äù no he had a better rookie year and if you‚Äôve been watching basketball for any amount of time (which I highly doubt you have) you wouldn‚Äôt even phrase it like that.  sorry man this is my first day watching nba, how many more days of watching until I can compare the sophomore season of two players??? when do    &gt; My point is kid you weren‚Äôt here comparing Tatum and RJ back in October after RJ‚Äôs 1st year finished because there wouldn‚Äôt have been an argument.   do I have to? It‚Äôs 2021 bruzzy how RJ is playing is what matters   &gt;Yet you, sounding like a Tatum and Celts hater waits until your little Knicks get a glimmer of a W and you‚Äôre in here letting your nuts hang like you have shit to brag about lol.  There‚Äôs not many players entered their sophomore season as young as these two have. Why shouldn‚Äôt they be compared?"
"Buddy it‚Äôs not lack of comprehension skills on my part it‚Äôs your lack of clarification. I was just letting your ass know that in no way was I agreeing with your silly post.   Buddy get it through your fucking skull the entire point is that any players that are as young as Tatum and Barrett are will have peaks and valleys. You bringing up‚Äúthat‚Äôs a Credit to RJ‚Äù means nothing because if he slumps next week then what will be your point? Is he no longer deserving of credit? And it isn‚Äôt a point of ‚ÄúIf Tatum had such a better rookie year‚Äù no he had a better rookie year and if you‚Äôve been watching basketball for any amount of time (which I highly doubt you have) you wouldn‚Äôt even phrase it like that.   My point is kid you weren‚Äôt here comparing Tatum and RJ back in October after RJ‚Äôs 1st year finished because there wouldn‚Äôt have been an argument. Yet you, sounding like a Tatum hater waits until your little Knicks get a glimmer of a W and you‚Äôre in here letting your nuts hang like you have shit to brag about lol.    It‚Äôs not a point of will you be allowed you, because I know your surface level ass will if his 3rd year numbers are at all comparable to Tatum‚Äôs."
"&gt;When did I say we agree on that? Lmao I said that was YOUR point?  Are your comprehension skills really this terrible or are you trolling? Yes, you are correct, the point of this post is showing that RJ is having a better sophomore season that Tatum.   &gt;Tatum‚Äôs rookie year was so much better than Barrett‚Äôs that this post is meaningless even if you are comparing 2nd years   Again, why do you keep bringing up the rookie season? These stats are how RJ is developing currently, not where he was 1 year ago. And if Tatum had such a better rookie season than RJ and RJ is now putting up comparable stats while younger than that is credit to RJ.   &gt;you weren‚Äôt here in the off-season comparing Tatum and Barrett after year one were you?  That‚Äôs so stupid. Why do I need to compare the two at end of the season to be allowed to compare them now? Is RJ not allowed to get better?  &gt;We‚Äôll see if you‚Äôre comparing Tatum and Barrett after year 3 too  Am I allowed to? Are rookie stats included in as well? Set out the rules for us casuals"
Nobody ever said RJ was terrible but your lame ass argument was that Tatum and Barrett was close their rookie years and that Tatum was only doing what he doing because he was with the stacked Celtics. That‚Äôs all cap   And rookie stats do mean a lot acting like they don‚Äôt matter is incredibly stupid.
These numbers are RJ Barrett-esqe!
"Zion has top .00001% athleticism. Only guy with his level of explosiveness, body control and strength is lebron. That automatically raises his potential compared to a closer to average athlete like RJ barrett"
"  RJ has played 842 minutes while sharing the floor with Elfrid Payton.   Elfrid has assisted RJ 18 times in that time.   The 2-man lineup of Payton and Barrett has a -1.4 net rating. Payton and Randle has -3.3. IQ and RJ is at +5.9. IQ and Randle is at +11.5. Payton/RJ/Randle is at -2.9. IQ/RJ/Randle is a +13.8. Not only are Elfrid's individual stats abysmal, he makes the best players on the team worse. He straight up stinks. But sure, he's asked to score and is giving us a whopping 12.6 ppg on 48.6% TS so we should cut him some slack, you're right"
He‚Äôs no Rj Barrett
Rj barrett
"Fuck man I would love someone like Lonzo to play with him, RJ Barrett would be good in no time."
&gt; Coincidence that this happened when he played with a point guard who actually passes him the ball? Makes you think   It's honestly amazing people dismissed RJ Barrett last season with the shit he had to deal with on that team. He was basically set up to be inefficient with how the offense ran. And then people used it to dismiss a 19-year old 3rd overall pick.
"That legitimately might ruin his confidence or worse lead to an injury, he really need to get his weight up, he was getting dicked down by RJ Barrett the whole game today"
"sure, but is RJ ""Ronald Jenkins"" Barrett more than a sandwich?"
Haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since I saw that Elfrid Payton to RJ Barrett assist stat...   Seems like a nice guy but I can‚Äôt wait to stop watching him.
RJ Barrett scored 30 points the same year the Leafs won the Stanley Cup*
&gt; They got some other solid young guys but no superstars in the making like Luka or Zion.  Is RJ Barrett a joke to you
"&gt;	The big 3 of the Knicks RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and Immanuel Quickley  Might be my favorite title here ever."
Ja Morant is shooting 24.5% from 3 this season.  RJ is shooting 35.2% from 3 this season while playing better defense.  I think by next season we can finally put the Ja Morant &gt; RJ Barrett takes to rest.
I love RJ Barrett
3 point sniper RJ Barrett*
RJ Barrett is 20 years old.
RJ Barrett scored 30 points before the Leafs won a Stanley Cup
"Rj Barrett. He is averaging 17/6/3 on 44% from 2 and 35% form 3. He has the most points for any under 20 player in the nba. By all metrics he is having an outstanding sophomore year. He is showing superstar potential on not just offense but defense. He is also only 20. Nobody talks about him though. When mentioning young players that will be good in the league, they just skip him every time. He is literally never mentioned when he could be an allstar in his third year. Like the media is ignoring him and it‚Äôs absurd. He was like top 5 in most stats his rookie year and he didn‚Äôt make the all rookie team. Please give him some love r/nba"
Also it appears that rj barrett sucks
His second options are like RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton lmao what do u expect? This is a team that is better than the sum of its parts due to its defense so Randle will get his no matter what
"He's a forward masquerading around as a point guard. And his defense is overrated. If you just watch the highlight plays, he looks like a great defender, watch a game and he's being exposed and abused all the time, but try to bring that up, and you'll see how much influence there is hyping up his game.    Plus he has the ball in his hands all game, and can't put up numbers. RJ Barrett is a more refined point guard. It's kind of embarrassing, but fun to watch when the post season rolls around."
All my homies love RJ Barrett

This is a good thing I think. Let RJ Barrett silently develop while Randle and Thibs take the spotlight.
The term natural scorer gets thrown a lot but RJ Barrett fit the bill. He just needs some time to catch up to NBA defenses and find ways to be efficient. But he'll be able to score regardless.
I love RJ Barrett.
He‚Äôs getting more touches because their 2nd best player is ... RJ Barrett
You won‚Äôt cuz the nba community sadly doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about RJ Barrett
Magic fans must reference either 76ers or Thunder to FO.  It's even worse than being a Knicks or Kings fan because they eventually get some Allstar level talented players from the draft. (Fox-KP-Halliburton-RJ Barrett etc). They're always close to get one more piece and then get lucky in FA to actually compete. Magic seems to have no chance to compete before 3-4 years.
Is saying RJ Barrett controversial?
"I don't think we talk about RJ Barrett enough for their to be a ""narrative"" about him. And also being 33.1% isn't exactly stellar"
It's such a weird narrative about RJ Barrett because his issue was always more about forcing shots than not being able to shoot. He was a great shooter in college with a bad shot selection.
Knicks have a different FO then usual and have made any bad moves. It would be stupid for the Knicks to pick up oladipo for that amount of money. He would probably miss the playoffs due to injuries again. And would only his game would hinder developing players like RJ Barrett. RJ does everything Vic does but better.
"If I remember correctly he ended up playing his last game against the Knicks and RJ Barrett, no doubt he had some sort of influence on him growing up in Canada. The dunk contest will live in infamy, but I think a lot of VC haters downplay the impact he had on Canadian youth... now the second most represented nationality in the league just sayin"
IQ Zo Barrett Randle Mitch   Great starting 5 there. So is off ball and can defend 1-2 at an elite level so he pairs well with RJ and IQ.
From Toronto. So RJ Barrett it is!
Curry 43m  Quickley 2m  Rj Barrett 8m  Randle 18m  Mitchell Robinson 2m   Total 73m
Rj barrett and Brandon ingram still existing
Does this mean that RJ Barrett is about to break out next year?
"Houston would be sort of like Klay with no defense.  He would be more valued today than he was then.  Houston was not the passer, rebounder or defender that Middleton is.  He was a much better pure shooter than Gordon.   Sprewell would be kind of like a more explosive RJ Barrett, but Barrett still has time to improve his 3 point shooting."
&gt; He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans  Thank god for Leon Rose and Bruce Aller for saving Thibs from himself
"&gt;He pleaded for Rose to offer long-term deals to free agents such as Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris and Bogdan Bogdanovic. He wanted to trade for Derrick Rose, a longtime favorite of his.  Ok not that bad but I can see the reasoning  &gt;He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans. Initially, he was hardly sold on Julius Randle, according to a colleague.  Alright Thibs relax..."
RJ Barrett is technically a 3&amp;D player based on the criteria here
Jonas Valanciunas - Travis Kelce  Trae Young - Tessio from The Godfather   RJ Barrett - Lil Yachty  Terry Rozier - undead Gregor Clegane
"Great locker room guy that always plays his role well and he went off with us when he got to play for us this year. There were 2 games where he pretty much took over for us in the 4th and won us the game, [and in this game ](https://youtu.be/dcvBGWxIllM) he closed out the Jazz with 14 straight points. A few games after that he dropped 25 points in the first half [shooting 10/10 in 11 minutes ](https://youtu.be/WAZRnuShPnA)   Granted he didn‚Äôt score a single point in the 2nd half of that game but gist is that he can be a great role player and his interviews show how great of a teammate he is. There was maybe a 1 week period where I was somewhat contemplating whether to get an RJ Barrett jersey or Austin Rivers jersey"
"No, there‚Äôs a four year gap between RJ Barrett and Ben Simmons and I think 24 year old RJ will be better then current Ben Simmons"
"You'd probably have to throw in RJ too, honestly. Any top 10 player demands promising players and picks.   You'll hate to hear it, but it would have to be something like Knox/Barrett/2021 1st/2023 1st/2025 1st"
The Knicks will not trade RJ Barrett. RJ and Randle are core pieces to the knicks future. Thee isn't a sense of urgency to trade for a star either. We have a ton of cap space. If we are able to address the PG position in FA we should keep our picks and let the coaching staff develop those players

A lot of good rj barrett games I guess ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
RJ Barrett is the future of this beautiful team.
"If RJ Barrett and my mother were hanging off a ledge and I could only save one, catch me at my mothers funeral in a fresh autographed number 9 jersey"
Rj Barrett defense is soooooooo underrated
"Bam, Ben Simmons, Giannis ,og Anunoby and rj Barrett defense &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goebert defense"
"As a RJ Barrett stan who couldnt stand Heat fans claiming Herro was better than him, I cant believe how wild the overreactions are with Herro this year.  He is still a great talent and is going to be a good player, the whole Heat team is having a worse year than last season, yet he's the only guy getting blamed"
Rj Barrett is younger than herro and is also a sophomore but go off
.....  RJ Barrett is also a sophomore...
"I posted this mainly because I noticed in the previous thread that a lot of people disregard physical attributes and just simply watching them play in favor of stats. RJ Barrett physically is much better than Herro. Longer wingspan, stronger, and he even looks quicker in all honesty. That is why Rj's already a very good defender while Herro is not very good. Herro was also in a much better situation compared to Barrett. Herro was the 4/5 best player on that heat team while the knicks did not have any real talent at all. You could argue the situations have flipped, but Herro still does not seem to be a top 3 player on the heat."
You saw they rated kelvin Johnson as a higher potential prospect than RJ Barrett. Idk why they hate him so much üòÇ
"You‚Äôre underestimating how bad everyone on our team is outside of SGA/Dort/Horford/Williams. Oubre/Wiggins easily start obviously. Poole/Looney/Lee/Bazemore easily play more than the rest of our team.  Our current rotation with no SGA and Horford, only Dort and Jerome can create decent offense. Dort is also our only plus defender really. Bazley/Poku are brick masters. I know they have potential but they play really bad, but at least Bazley has played great since his return. Roby/Moses Brown are also a horrible rotation. Luckily they‚Äôre getting this experience to develop though. I hope Bazley can become RJ Barrett-esque and maybe Moses can be something like young DeAndre Jordan."
Good so we can chill until LeBron and Curry are ready to team up at the end of their careers and bring a chip to NYC with Randle and RJ Barrett alongside them.
"I would say Jamal Murray would be more of a ""Home-grown son of Toronto""   Like Lowry is to Philly.  Kitchener is close enough.  RJ Barrett is poised. I say this because Thompson is more of a role-player.  Jamal showed superstar potential in the bubble last year."
"I understand what you're saying, but it's opinion through and through in both cases and you're welcome to believe that for yourself. However, you saying he's a much better shooter than Barrett is a head-scratcher.   Garland averages .2 PPG more than Barrett, their shooting (gonna avoid rounding) splits are: Garland- 45.3/40.6/84.9 to Barrett's 44.6/38.6/74.4.   Their FGAs are 15 in both cases, with Garland taking an extra 3 a game and Barrett taking 1.5 more FTs per game than Garland. At most Garland is a slightly better shooter than Barrett, not much better. Barrett's raised his FT% a hell of a lot in one year and that's the one easiest to improve. Otherwise they're very comparable.  You're just extremely undervaluing how important defense is in today's game, tbh with you. Barrett can impact the game by scoring 15-25 and bother the hell out of the opponent's best wing. Big part of why the Knicks are the 4th seed in the east.   I'm not sure how you don't see RJ as having a higher ceiling. He can improve his shooting still, he can become better at finding teammates (he's already not terrible at it), and get his defense to lockdown status on the opponent's best player.   The ceiling for RJ is being a slightly worse version of Kawhi. The ceiling for Garland is a slightly worse Nash. So when it comes to where both of those guys are getting drafted, I'm sure you can understand teams would take Kawhi over Nash, which is the original point of the thread. Barrett would still be drafted over Garland. Teams care a lot more about defense than you seem to."
"Really? RJ and Bron said that explicitly about Giannis?  And for a moment when you said RJ my mind goes automatically to RJ Barrett first. Imagine my confusion; who does he thinks he is commenting about a much superior player compared to himself when he's still in the NBA and his job isn't commentating, moreover about his senior by 6 years too? Lmao"
"No dude, I‚Äôm saying I value Garland‚Äôs scoring ability (much better shooter than Barrett) and his passing (very good vision even with his TO issues which are mostly born out inexperience) more than Barrett‚Äôs scoring ability and shot creation.  I don‚Äôt really see how RJ has the higher ceiling.   We will see how it turns out but Garland‚Äôs passing ability is special. His vision is special. Guy had 10 assists tonight and last night and had teammates missing easy shots.  And the only reason I brought up assists was because the OP commenter said they average the same stats which isn‚Äôt true so I pointed it out. Then he said rebounds were just as valuable as assists so it‚Äôs still fair to say they average the same stats which again I pointed out really isn‚Äôt true."
"Short guards have a slightly harder times making passes. RJ has scoring, rebounding, AND defense, which is the most important part. I notice you completely glossed over Garland's mediocre AST/TO ratio for a PG though.  Like you realize Garland and Barrett have the same PPG average right? It's much easier to learn to be better at shot creation if your game could allow it than it is to get much better at D. Barrett's not even completely awful at it as is. You're shilling for a guy over another guy with extremely similar statlines, but one obviously has a much higher ceiling as a player than the other, which is Barrett. It doesn't make much sense outside of the obvious homerism, but it's okay to be a homer and like the guys you have. Garland's good, like I said, he's just not nearly as valuable as RJ Barrett.  But when you bust out comments like ""This PG has way more assists per game than this SF"" it's extremely disingenuous and you know it. You act like a child with comments like that, I'll do it right back in my responses. When you make legitimate comments like the one you just did, I'll pull that way back."
"I put knicks above the heat &amp; hawks because Julius Randal is playing like a superstar right now. Knicks also have a great coach, the 4th best defense in the league, and great role players like RJ Barrett.   Heat isn't as good as last year b/c they lost some key players, and they're currently the 7th seed so the road to the finals will be tough. Hawks are dealing with injuries, and I don't think their defense is good enough to win against the best teams in the playoffs.   I put the clippers above the Nets because they are playing fantastic on both ends of the floor, and they fixed most of last year's issues by getting a new coach + rondo to help with playmaking.   The Nets have barely played with their big-three together due to injuries, so there could be chemistry issues, plus the defense mediocre at best."
"Bro literally get the fuck out of here with that shit. Assists aren't nearly as important for forwards as point guards. Wash the dick out of your mouth and realize you're being ridiculous. Garland is good but he can't defend for shit. RJ Barrett could develop better passing skills down the road. Garland can't grow any taller and he's already short as is.  Your magical point guard is also averaging 3 turnovers for a smooth 2-1 AST/TO ratio, which is not good for a point guard, plain and simple. Every single team in the league would draft RJ Barrett over Garland in a redraft, including the Cavs."
&gt; Yeah because rj barrett is a guard who needs playmaking...His job isn‚Äôt to pass its to be physical. His assist are rebounds  Well he‚Äôd be a way more dangerous player if he had it. It would provide more value than rebounding. It would be pretty crazy to think otherwise.
Yeah because rj barrett is a guard who needs playmaking. Dudes a small foward and sometimes he will rarely play a shooting guard role. If you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt even know the basics of rj and his game. His job isn‚Äôt to pass its to be physical. His assist are rebounds
I wonder if Thibs is gonna keep rolling with the hot hand Rose with pick and rolls to end this game or go to his two horses RJ Barrett/Randle
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
Ive been on the RJ Barrett bandwagon since he was in high school.   Randle is an allstar level player.    I think Knicks if they get Zion from New Orleans and reunite Barret and Zion with a trade or pickup at point guard.   And then we have Duke 2.0
"Honestly think he's going to be a monster and one of the elite wing players over the next decade. Like around what Jimmy Butler is now (fringe top 10 player)  I dont think people realize how big he is, like whatever height they listed him doesn't accurately capture his size. Was watching Twolves vs Knicks and seeing him side by side with RJ Barrett who has pretty good size, Ant's frame looked wider and 2x as powerful as RJ .  And when you think about his quickness and vertical to go with it, he's in a similar category as Zion imo as far as freak athletes in the league. It's going to come out more once he works on his handle and refines his game, you won't be able to put a guard on him. Teams are gonna have to defend him with a strong wing or forward."
"ah yes, let's ignore the top 5 pick from the 2018 draft and the #10 pick from this past year because Julius Randle, who is definitely in no way having an outlier season, is now the #1 guy.  I think you've stumbled onto the Knicksiest scenario ever: they get an itchy trigger finger and trade RJ Barrett to the Suns for CP3 because ""it's about Randle's timeline now"""
It‚Äôs crazy how quickly people expect everyone to develop. Same thing happened with RJ Barrett last season. So many people wrote him off after one not so great rookie season. He‚Äôs been a beast this year. Bagley has unfortunately had injury setbacks too
"Everyone takes time. Garland, Sexton, Lonzo, RJ Barrett, Culver...some come out of the gate useful like Fox or Clint Capela. Most players take time."
"RJ Barrett is the 2nd best player on a current 4 seed at just 20 years old, who has been one of the best 3 point shooters in the league over the last couple months, and this guy thinks he‚Äôs either a bench player or a mediocre chucked. Absurd"
"Experience doesn‚Äôt equal production. Nerlens Noel of all people would body Deandre Jordan this isn‚Äôt 2014 nomore lol. In fact the second Knicks game, part of the reason the Knicks even snuck back is cause RJ Barrett etc was attacking DJ and walking to the paint in the 3rd  I think the point is pretty clear. Our defense increased dramatically when DJ did not play. That‚Äôs stats on this. Case closed"
team canada looking nice with wiggins SGA rj barrett
5th in this order  1. Daniel Gafford  2. Zion Williamson  3. Ja Morant  4. RJ Barrett  5. Darius Garland
"I think it was originally Andrew Wiggins, but I feel like I‚Äôve also heard it for Jamal Murray and RJ Barrett"
Calling RJ Barrett either a bench player or mediocre chucker is well off the mark and should signal to everyone how little you know of the Knicks
Give us Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram and then we‚Äôll give u Reggie Bullock and RJ Barrett for a season and let‚Äôs see who comes out on top
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they‚Äôd rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I‚Äôm not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion‚Äôs efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
Rj Barrett missing two threes in the preseason- in his first Organized basketball in roughly 290 days as well
Because they don‚Äôt realize efficiency isn‚Äôt the best way to judge young guards entering the league. Especially when they‚Äôre on shitty teams with horrible spacing. I watched one full lamello ball nbl game and could tell he was gonna he good.yeah he shot like 5-13 from three but you could see he was talented and that he just needed slightly better form and better shot selection. Same goes for guys like Anthony Edwards and rj Barrett.
No because the knicks were a disaster lol.  Now they‚Äôre a good team with a 26 year old all star and emerging 20 year old RJ Barrett

He has an extreme work ethic as well. You compare his rookie season at 40 FG% and 32 3pt% compared to the last 50 games and thats a 7% and 12% improvement. You couldn't convince me that 20 year old RJ Barrett who paid a trainer to completely rechange his shot for 6 months this offseason isnt going to keep improving every year.
If you Compare Tatums 3rd year he averages 5 more ppg on worst percentages as well with an increased usage. I am just implying that RJ Barrett is known to have one of the best work ethics in the league. Hes endorsed by kobe and steve nash on this. You can already see how much he has improved after one offseason. I find it extremely hard to believe he is randomly going to stop improving at age 20. I am not saying he is going to become a star because no one can predict the future. I just find it incredibly funny that people can somehow think they can predict it when his numbers are the same or better.
Except for still doing shit like playing RJ Barrett 46 minutes in a non-overtime game lol
Your best players are randle and D rose lol. Feel bad for you as fans watching RJ Barrett. What an inefficient player. Quickly has played like 50 games in his career and averages 10 pts on under 40% fg. i guess I‚Äôd need to put myself in the shoes of a lolknicks fan to understand how low the standards are
RJ Barrett? Immanuel Quickley? Mitchell Robinson?  Do you think we‚Äôre doing this with mercenaries?
RJ Barrett?
Rj Barrett
"Without KD &amp; Harden, how does the talent margin shake out?  Especially with it already said that Kyrie can't carry them.  Washed DJ? Washed Griffin? Theyve got some decent guys, but traded some of their best role players for injured Harden and KD.   Randles an all star this year. Rose is a baller still. Thibs is probably on his way to the Hall of Fame. Taj is a great vet presence. RJ Barrett is coming up.   The rest of the roster has some serviceable guys with something to prove. They're really gelling right now too."
Just like Brandon Ingram or RJ Barrett were busts after their rookie years?
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with RJ Barrett. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him drill corner threes, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body.  I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Young Rowan. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.  One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
If before this season you told me fans of the 4th seed Knicks would be serenading the Garden with ‚ÄúRJ Barrett‚Äù chants after a 9th consecutive win...
Next year we're going to be talking about how Jimmy Butler is a mini-RJ Barrett
I LOVE RJ BARRETT
Rj Motherfucking Barrett baby
RJ Barrett is better than your favorite young player.  You heard the man!
RJ Barrett with a real quiet 25/12/4 üëÄ

"I love RJ Barrett. If possible, I would like to conceive a child with him."
[THE KNICKS HAVE WON A RJ BARRETT NUMBER OF GAMES IN A ROW](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuE4tgmXIAMyqqL.jpg)
man watching RJ barrett grow this season and take the next step has been a real pleasure. knicks fans have watched a lot of big picks not pan out or just flat-out suck (not looking at you kevin knox or frank) and it just rules to see somebody put the work in and live up/past expectations. may have to cop a maple jordan jersey next year.
God I love RJ Barrett
Bars from the Bard. Barrett the hottest RJ since Montague and Capulet.
"E. Payton has LARGELY been detrimental to our team play and guys like RJ Barrett.     Seriously, there was a sequence back in the Hornets-Knicks game where he drove to the paint on the fastbreak with three defenders on him...despite RJ being in the corner.     Then he comes back the next time he gets the ball and commits a charging foul and immediately gets pulled out for the rest of the game."
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
What if the Knicks trade back for Porzingis to form a ‚Äòbig ball‚Äô lineup? This would be beneficial because Porzingis could play with other 3‚Äôs and wouldn‚Äôt have to bump down low with the other big men.   Their next year lineup would be:   PG: Immanuel Quickley   SG: RJ Barrett   SF: Kristaps Porzingis   PF: Julius Randle   C: Mitchell Robinson
Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year: RJ Barrett
"Rj Barrett and his son, the pacers Organization.  Along with Julius Randle with his son, the Hawks organization"
"Tom Thibodeau has played Julius Randle and RJ Barrett even more minutes than Jokic.  I hope they all stay healthy, this year and throughout their careers.    Thibodeau has been criticized for playing his guys too much and burning them out over the years.  But playing every game used to be standard, and, as we see in Denver, Thibodeau isn't the only coach who allows it."
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
Repost but I'm going to repost my comment and say that RJ Barrett is better than Tyler Herro
Rj ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me Ben Simmons‚Äù Barrett
"*""This the Pelicans colorway, there is an Orange-and-Blue interior lining and ""I miss you RJ Barrett"" inscribed in big font, but don't mind that--""*"
Sadly RJ Barrett
&gt; Its too early to tell if they have long term building blocks besides Randle imo.  RJ Barrett &amp; Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley might be there as well
"Agreed, I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôll find success building around RJ Barrett"
I don‚Äôt see RJ Barrett staying for long.
"You cant compare Kyrie, Harden, and KD to RJ Barrett. These guys have proven themselves, but let me ask u this. Are Clint Capela, Bogdan, Collins role players to you because the offense is built around Trae similarly how the Knicks offense is built around Randle."
"In one offseason RJ Barrett turned himself into 40% 3 point shooter, anyone that thinks this kid isn't going to will himself to be an All Star within the next 3 years is mistaken"
RJ Barrett
Soon to Be Rj Barrett üòé
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve heard RJ Barrett talk if you think he doesn‚Äôt have that drive. He is literally psychotic.

"Randle has a 57% TS overall and a win shares/48 of .147 and a BPM of 3. The dude is an average bench all star, knicks fans should really pump the breaks on All NBA and stop with the MVP consideration.  This is the same as the sounding board for RJ Barrett.  Nobody gives a fuck if you can score at 54% TS - the league average is 57% and your midrange pick and pop game doesn't work if you don't have the tools - 3 pointer, finishing ability - to offset the marginal efficiency."
Lmao RJ Barrett?
/r/NBA was right... RJ Barrett is a bust.
"It's like Clyde said, ""RJ coming out of the 1st Half like Lazarus, rejuvenated.""     RJ ""Lazarus"" Barrett!!!!"
RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett is so damn reliable man
Rj Barrett is actually the Greatest basketball player to ever exist
RJ Barrett
"Is it just me or is RJ Barrett being under utilized by the knicks offense? Even though, he isn't shooting well, he gets in the lane and good things tend to happen when he has the ball and is aggressive. It honestly feels like the Knicks role players have more involvement in the offense than their young star"
"And Wiggins, and Boucher, and Dillon Brooks, and every Canadian player who‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt RJ Barrett. But Shaq and Nikeil can stay"
We‚Äôve played that game for the last decade you absolute clown. And all we have to show for it is RJ Barrett.   At some point you have to establish yourself as an actual franchise. This team overachieved and you can already see the different way people approach this franchise
"RJ Barrett is also averaging 11.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 2.0 apg on 34.2%/25.0%/80.0% shooting splits.   When arguably your two best players are THIS bad against a mediocre at best playoff defense... yeah, you‚Äôre in trouble."
*Coach Thibs' message in the locker room:*  I'm gonna call out your name and call you trash  Rj Barrett... YOU'RE TRASH  Elfrid Payton... YOU'RE TRASH  Frankie boy... YOU'RE TRASH  Julius Randle... oh my gosh I better not see your name on any All-NBA list. YOU'RE TRASH! If I see your name on an all NBA list I might have to kill somebody.
RJ Barrett is not some star   He‚Äôs a role player
Rj Barrett looking like a bust. And Randle is MIP?
This guy also thinks rj Barrett is better than Ja ü§°
"KP has literally been way better in the playoffs than Julius Randle or RJ Barrett, your 2 ""stars."" Lmao you're down bad gonna lose in 5 to the hawks"
Knicks getting stuck with RJ Barrett instead of Zion or Ja set their franchise back 10 years lmao dude is a future Guangdong Tiger
Cam Reddish &gt; RJ Barrett
Rj barrett? Fuck no
Rj Barrett is a bust he is another wiggins
talking about rj barrett
RJ Barrett needs to step up man
Hunter over RJ Barrett is looking better day after day‚Ä¶
The knicks cannot have rj barrett starting the 2nd half
RJ Barrett with a triple zero this man so overrated
RJ Barrett now 3/14 on 3s this series.   Shooting 40% from 3 this year in empty stadiums (after being a career 30% shooter) was fake and a total fluke + doesn't count. Still a bust.
RJ Barrett is transforming into Arron Afflalo
What an idiotic comment  The knicks do not have a player on their team being paid $20 million or more. Their only top 7 pick is RJ Barrett.  The knicks built their team the way most small markets do: through solid drafting later rounds and mid tier free agents.
MVP: Julius Randle  MIP : RJ Barrett  DPOY: Mitchell Robinson  6Moty: Immanuel Quickley  ROY: Jared Butler  COTY: Tom Thibodeau  EOTY: Leon Rose
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins, New York‚Äôs RJ Barrett, Memphis‚Äô Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City‚Äôs Luguentz Dort, Houston‚Äôs Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans‚Äô Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana‚Äôs Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  ‚ÄúThere is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,‚Äù Canada senior men‚Äôs program general manager Rowan Barrett said. ‚ÄúOur players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.‚Äù     Let's go"
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
He‚Äôs definitely better than RJ Barrett though.... RIGHT?
Besides RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson‚Ä¶ who else is under contract to even make that trade?
"They'd also have Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Robinson, and Quickley from their young core. He wouldn't just be going there to play with Lowry or CP3.  The problem is there are no moves to be made. They traded all their picks and swapped the rest. You can trade Paul George, but can you trade Paul George for a better star? Probably not. A situation where they trade Paul George, it makes more sense to be blowing up the team for draft picks and young players at that point."
"He's not ""most regressed"" player, but he definitely didn't improve like people thought he would. Meanwhile guys like RJ Barrett and PJ Washington have stepped up, and guys like Ja/Zion kept cruising without much of a slump"
You forgot rj barrett who‚Äôs Canadian
"And Wiggins, RJ Barrett, NAW (Shai‚Äôs actual cousin), Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, and Dwight Powell. The only guys not going to training camp so far are Murray &amp; Shai. Murray must be faking too lol. According to you, Shai rests the entire back half of the season healthy, and is still skipping out on all the marketing and endorsements that would come from being THE guy for team Canada, in order to be ready for the tanking Thunder‚Äôs start of the season. How much rest does he need lol?"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
"Sure, if the league was composed of only RJ Barrett."
RJ Barrett breakout session üëÄ
RJ Barrett is the leagues future
"The cheering after the RJ Barrett dunk last game was sending chills down my spine, Im fuckin loving this series and happy we at least will get to see another at MSG"
"RJ Barrett is up there for me too, it‚Äôs hard to not just rally behind him and hope he succeeds. Luka too, great guy."
Which RJ? Roderick Hampton Jr or Rowan Barrett Jr?
Rj Barrett is better though right Knicks fans ü§ì
I agree but it just happened to be one of the biggest foul calls though which was the one on RJ Barrett.  I'm a fan of letting guys play at the end of the game unless the fouls are egregious.
"If Rj had hit one more 3 I would have won 600 bucks!  What a great game. Run after run, Knicks were scrappy and the crowd brought so much life. Hawks just couldn't buy a basket in the 4th quarter.  New Knicks fan. Why is Barrett not playing crunch time? Is his defense not great?"
"Man, I had a Knicks fan try to argue that RJ Barrett is the same level of prospect as Ja Morant. Dude isn't even in the closing lineup tonight."
RJ Barrett is just Andrew Wiggins but with shorter arms and way less hops. More focused/determined then Wiggins at his age tho.
"RJ Barrett has bulked up big time and he uses his body really well, didn‚Äôt think he would do much after his rookie year. Amazing growth physically and mentally."
&gt;RJ Barrett went from shooting 30% from 3 his whole career to 40% in empty stadiums  Bro he was literally a rookie last year lay off. I'm sure it had something to do with it but you'd expect some improvement in his shooting after a year of working with professional shooting staff.  Randle's been brutal though for sure
NGL I haven‚Äôt watched much Knicks basketball this year but for as hyped up as the core players got Julius Randle and RJ Barrett look like 2 of the worst players on the court.
Rj Barrett is so trash üóë
Rj Barrett can you please get a right hand
RJ Barrett just keeps missing everything.
RJ Barrett running the game with his foul baiting
Best=Julius Randle. Young exciting=RJ Barrett. Vet Beast= Derrick Rose. MVP=Frank Ntilikina.
Arent Julius Randle and Rj Barrett like top in minutes per game?
"The best SG prospect since Harden was RJ Barrett imo.   Wiggins had more hype around him than RJ (he was also pretty damn good in high school as well), but RJ was more dominant in high school than him and Fultz."
"Harden could have fetched one Ben Simmons  and one of Thybulle/Matisse but either the Rockets owner was being petty or the 76ers owner was being greedy.  Don't know.   Looking across the league I can't think of a team that would trade for PG.  I think he would be redundant on a lot of teams that could trade for him, like Bulls or the Wizards.   Perhaps the Knicks, but I don't think they'd want to give up RJ Barrett."
"no thank you. I'll do RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin and Quickley for PG and Morris."
"LMFAOOOOOO THEY TURNED THIS AROUND, BUT COULDNT RETRACT THE FOUL ON RJ BARRETT BY TRAE IN GAME 1???????"
I‚Äôd be shocked if NY parts with Barrett for jimmy. RJ pretty much answered his only concern as a prospect (shooting) this year.
Nah he hunted the foul against RJ Barrett near the end - minimal contact and majorly exaggerated by Trae
RJ Barrett can go an entire season without the ball touching just his right hand.
I knew RJ Barrett was going to be the player he is turning into since his high school days. Even despite his less-than-ideal rookie season I still believed he‚Äôd figure it out.
Rj Barrett is not bad
"Not a Bulls fan, but as a Canadian I'm definitely rooting for RJ Barrett and the Knicks."
RJ Barrett and it isnt even close
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
"RJ Barrett is def waaaaay better than Wiggins. RJ can actually play defense and is a viable off-ball option who can shoot 3s and is still developing. Wiggins is not and is about a finished product at this point. He‚Äôs entering his 7th season, right?"
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
RJ Barrett. Not even close
"He gets the slander because delusional fans said they wouldn‚Äôt part with him for Lowry or Harden. Also people been thinking Herro is better than RJ Barrett, what makes them think that? I have no idea it‚Äôs not even close at this point"
Heat fans still taking Herro over RJ Barrett???
He was the consensus number 1 recruit in high school so probably a few people.   [source](https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2019/6/12/18652045/rj-barrett-zion-williamson-nba-draft-2019-recruiting-duke-highlights-aau-high-school-stats)
"While this play shows you all you need to know about RJ Barrett üò§üò§üò§, it also shows you all you need to know about Trae Young. Missed a foul baited shot then flops after he‚Äôs boxed out by D Rose for the rebound. What a soft, soft af player."

Imagine being dumb enough to draft some injurty-prone fat ass over RJ fucking Barrett
I want this timeline. Heavy feature on RJ Barrett v Cam Reddish too.
R u really gonna try and tell me that the ‚Äúfoul‚Äù on Barrett was a foul???? Not to mention the phantom call on Taj but I can‚Äôt let that slide cause it happens to every team. But that RJ foul is just indefensible
"Thinking he will be hunted in the playoffs is somewhat reasonable. Thinking he is a bad player because of it is not reasonable.   People have such a narrow window of how an offense is run. People look at, say, that play that had RJ Barrett on Trae and Barrett bullied him inside for an easy bucket. People see windows of stuff like that and go ""Trae is being targeted because he's a bad defender"" and maybe say ""just do that more,"" when in reality that is a classic mismatch and teams try for mismatches basically every play if they can. It's by no means *not* a negative, but it's also by no means special.   And yeah, you want to try and force bad defenders into, yknow, defending. So you're right. But the point is that why do people hold Trae as some unique weakness that other teams with bad defenders don't also deal with."
Garbage can Knicks fans are absolutely seething lmao.  A far cry from their regular visits to other team‚Äôs subs to explain why RJ Barrett is akshually a future all star
"Nah.  Knicks fans have to set the tone for the series.  We're in for a log one.  Atlanta better come back with a ""Fuck RJ Barrett"" chant."
RJ Barrett!!!
Barrett has Trae on him? Fucking shoot it every time RJ
RJ Barrett is the best player in this series
If I was a 10 year old Knicks fan this game would‚Äôve made me a RJ Barrett fan for life

RJ Barrett vs Hawks 5/23/2021  He had a monster game
"Sigh....  Jay Williams, Luol Deng, Chris Duhon, Carlos Boozer, Elton Brand,  Corey Maggette, JJ Redick, Sheldon Williams, Gerald Henderson, Josh McRoberts, Jason Tatum, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Jahil Okafor, Grayson Allen  Clearly you don't understand what the word TYPICALLY means. Now you have been schooled. Enjoy the L."
"Again I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong that more talent would make for a better product, but your take on Zion is revisionist history. He was a hyped prospect, sure, but he wasn‚Äôt even the most hyped on that Duke team entering the year - that was RJ Barrett. Zion‚Äôs play at Duke is what grabbed the headlines and elevated him to the clear cut #1 ovr pick."
RJ Barrett.
RJ Barrett...in the playoffs  Ja Morant...in the playoffs  Zion Williamson.... ü•∏
RJ Barrett or Alec Burks - if they can spread the floor when Randle attacks and knock those threes then it will make everything easier for them. But every team benefits with their guys hitting their shot so yeah
 &gt;Stats will never tell the whole story tbh  Never claimed they did tbh.   &gt;Sometimes you need to watch players to form a true assessment.  I have watched the Atlanta Hawks play basketball.   &gt;It‚Äôs weird to argue a players importance only using stats.  I haven't talked about any players importance.   &gt;Ex: RJ Barrett shot 40% from 3 this year. I don‚Äôt consider RJ to be near the shooter Bertans is yet the stats say he is.  That example isn't very good because it doesn't include a super important factor which is volume. I did include the frequency part to show volume.

"Just commented this elsewhere:   There's some reports Donovan Mitchell is unhappy in Utah. He's also supposedly a huge Mets fan, and is from NY, and may want to go play there. Could something like this happen if that is all true?  Knicks get:   * Donovan Mitchell  Raptors get:   * RJ Barrett  Jazz get:   * Fred VanVleet  * 2021, 2023 Dallas picks (from Knicks)  * 2021, 2023 Knicks picks  That may seem like an overpay from a Knicks fan's perspective. But you're giving up a guy who *might* become a star for a guy who *is* a star, plus four non-lotto 1sts. And the star you're getting is a guy who loves NY and wants to be there. A Mitchell/Randle core is a good place to be. And you're really not leveraging the future since you're giving up Dallas picks and this year's 1st, you still have all but one of your future picks.   Raptors do it to trade a win-now player for a SG prospect with higher upside (and one who's Canadian to boot!). If they draft Suggs, they'd have a sexy young core with Suggs, RJ, GTJ, OG, Pascal   Jazz do it (again, if Donovan wants out) since they get a proven win-now guard (same height as Donovan, believe it or not) that will let them continue to contend. And those four 1sts could be used to further shore up the roster via trade. Maybe you offer the Rockets Favors and 6 1sts for Christian Wood. (Would be 6 1sts since none of them would be lotto picks). That would be a significant upgrade."

"Knicks fans are completely overrating our core.   IQ did great for a rookie but he basically only has two ways to score and once you take away either of those things, he‚Äôs completely ineffective since his ability as an actual point guard is not great   RJ Barrett had a good season but he‚Äôs unproven as a star and his playoff performance proved it. Is he capped out as a solid starter, or can he eventually become budget Dwyane Wade? Evidence seems to point at the former.   Mitchell Robinson has basically only played half a good season, and been injured for the rest, so you‚Äôre asking to commit serious money and time to a player that‚Äôs only had half a season of actual good basketball in his career   The Knicks FO is in a more precarious position than people realize, and their newest lottery draft asset was a complete flop this year. The one year we didn‚Äôt tank was the Cade Cunningham draft, a point guard for a team that desperately needed a point guard."
Lol at Randle being unknown before NY.  Also RJ Barrett has been known since highschool.
Randle and RJ Barrett üôè
"Lu Dort,Rj Barrett,and Andrew Wiggins wouldn‚Äôt be the worst player on team USA this year"
For real - RJ Barrett has to be untouchable. Without him this would literally be a G-League team around Randle and Dame.
RJ Barrett next year
"Idk if we can somehow keep a starting five of Dame, Bullock, RJ Barrett, Randle , and Mitch Robinson I think that‚Äôs way better than what Portland had this year.   Trading 2 first rounders in 2021, Quickley, maybe Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox. ü§∑üèºü§∑üèº"
"Knicks, they have the 2 first round picks from the Mavs, plus their own 2. the 2nd rounder from the Pistons (#32). As for players they have Quickley, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson (doubt they'll want to include RJ Barrett but in the right package I could see it)  Kevin Knox is 22 and needs a change of scenery. I think they have the ammo and could include pick swaps if necessary to pull it off. A point guard has been the achilles heel of this roster and I don't see another player of his caliber at the exact position of need for them coming available while Julius Randle is still in All-NBA form and the window to make a run is open"
Hopefully that'll change with RJ Barrett.
Knicks? They have a grip load of picks courtesy of Dallas and can toss RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin into the mix.
"Yeah exactly, I think there's a reason it feels like the same few teams have the highest rate of missing on their draft picks. There are very, very few prospects who will end up great regardless of the team around them. It's especially clear for players who rely on somebody to get them the ball on offense and aren't ready to create their own looks yet (so less so the Luka and Trae types). It's going to be hard for an RJ Barrett or a Wendell Carter to develop their game, build confidence in their shot, and learn to play in an NBA offense when their PG is dribbling the air out of the ball for 20 seconds, only passes it to them to avoid the shot clock turnover, or can't even make an entry pass."
"Wiiggis, RJ Barrett, Dort , Olynk , Brooks   I mean Greece can qualify, it's just gonna be a difficult task."
Rj Barrett dunks on kd
As the Knicks I protect  Julius Randle  RJ Barrett  Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley  Obi Toppin  Luca Vildoza   And since we'd have 8 or less under contract I'd put Kevin Knox as our unprotected pick
"RJ FUCKING BARRETT.  Yes, the bad shooter THAT SHOT 40% FROM 3 ON 4.3 3PA THIS SEASON.  He‚Äôll be an all-star by 2022-2023, if not 2021-2022."
Mobley Cade   RJ Barrett prime Kobe
Rj barrett proves the haters wrong and becomes the face of the nba over giannis and Luka and he basically becomes the next Jordan. Leading to he knicks to multiple championships

Rj barrett end thread
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
"Outside of RJ Barrett, you have literally nothing we'd want in return."
Because the teams didn't have good enough guard play to punish that. The Nets do. That's been my entire point.    The Nets would have made him guard somebody or whoever was originally guarding the ball handler would get fucking cooked. Giannis can't consistently cook anyone from 30 feet.  Embiid can't cook anyone from 30 feet. RJ Barrett damn sure can't.  The Nets have multiple people that can.  If you think scurry back to you man is a viable screen defense against good teams then why haven't teams tried it before? Because the shit doesn't work against good teams
Zion be going to the Knicks for RJ Barrett and Julius Randle
RJ Barrett was our second best player in the regular season if you actually watched our games.
RJ Barrett could jump way higher than that tbh
I‚Äôd rather build around RJ Barrett but that‚Äôs just me ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
RJ Barrett and Nickeil Alexander-Walker
"Young has scored more...points? Luka is the better finisher at the rim by a laughable amount (Luka shoots 71% within 3 feet while Trae shoots 57% within 3 feet) and Luka literally shoots better than Trae everywhere on the court except for long 2s and free throws. Luka is a much better scorer from the field than Trae but Trae has Luka beat at free throws - hence why their TS is so similar (around 59% for both) while Luka has a much better effective field goal percentage (55% vs Trae's 50%). When controlling for similar attempts, Luka's shotmaking from the field is equivalent to Dame while Trae's shotmaking from the field is equivalent to RJ Barrett."
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm willing to give up a large piece of my team. Maybe a combo of RJ Barrett/Kevin Knox/whatever else we can give up that‚Äôs not D Rose or Randle.
"Knicks were projected #1 to get Zion but we feel to #3 and more than thrilled with RJ Barrett.  Now Kuminga who's likely at #5 isn't really a consolation here but who knows?  Maybe Cavs psych themselves out of 3 because it'll be between guards Jalen Green and Suggs, and trade down to round out their roster.  Who knows?"
"If Cam was made for this era, he would have been found some way to be at least a neutral basketball player or at the very least shown substantial in his second year as basically every all star has been in the NBA.   As a fan of the team, you are giving him every benefit of the doubt and looking at every bit of context but there are so many players in his position who never even come close. RJ Barrett who did actually make a leap in year two is going to have a hard time making one."
RJ Barrett
USA really trying their best to beat RJ Barrett and team Canada huh?
Recency Bias at its best  Randle averaged 24/10/6 and won MIP  RJ Barrett took big strides and averaged 18  Derrick Rose looked great for them   Thibs won Coach of the Year
Julius Randle or RJ Barrett.
"Canada has Wiggins, RJ Barrett, Cory Joseph, Dwight Powell, Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Trey Lyles, Mychal Mulder, and home court so it will be tough for Turkey to qualify, but should be a good tourney with Greece and China also having decent teams."
You guys think RJ Barrett would look good in a sixers jersey?
You're saying you don't enjoy seeing 20 posts about an RJ Barrett 20 point game in the regular season?
"I mean, I still think we‚Äôre in a good spot, but the Celtics seem primed for solid long-term success as well. Just a question of whether they‚Äôll make the right coaching hire, I think.  Sixers are in a bit of a bind, but we have Joel. So as long as he‚Äôs around, there‚Äôs a chance. But we need to retool, try and ship Ben off to finally build fully around Joel. I think Morey‚Äôs in a tough position, but I have a bit of faith.  Knicks are in a great spot rn, but I think that team was really buoyed by effort in the regular season. I don‚Äôt think Randle is truly a guy you build around, but RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley are solid. I just wonder about the ceiling of this core. Still, good spot to be in, imo.  Raptors probably should rebuild. Lowry‚Äôs likely headed to South Beach. Siakam‚Äôs a good starting point for a rebuild, still young. Need to snag more young talent, GTJ is a good piece.  Really, all four teams have a fairly good outlook for the future imo."
"""the same roster"" come on champ - the players improved, I don't know if you can put that all on Thibs. RJ Barrett was always going to develop and julius went to a new level.    Not to mention going from Bobby Portis to Nerlens Noel as back up big is essentially guaranteeing you a top 10 defense. Thibs is quality coach but don't forget he couldn't do much with a talented unit in Minnesota. 1 year sample size is a bit too small imo."
"Doing it by year:   2016: no one 2017: Donovan Mitchell 2018: SGA, Miles or Mikal Bridges, MPJ and 2nd round Mitch Rob or Gary Trent Jr 2019: RJ Barrett 2020: Tyrese Haliburton, Quickley"
"SGA  Donovan Mitchell  RJ Barrett  Porzing*s  Mitchell Robinson  But obviously if we drafted SGA and/or Mitchell we wouldn't have been bad enough to draft Barrett, so this would have never happened"
RJ Barrett had a terrible shot last.  Still shot it.  Spent all year training and looked a lot better this year.  Why can‚Äôt Simmons do the same.   Maybe even join RJ who will continue to work on his shot.
"Lmao remember when y‚Äôall were down to suck everyone‚Äôs dicks to get Williamson, Kyrie, and Durant? We have two of those guys and y‚Äôall have RJ Barrett.  Fuck off. We‚Äôll be fine and will continue to root for the better NY-area team. Like we have in the past 20 years‚Ä¶looking pitifully at your Dolan-owned poverty franchise who‚Äôs biggest boasting point has been ‚Äúattendance‚Äù and ‚Äúhow loud MSG gets‚Äù.  Bahahhahaha idiot"
RJ Barrett would never
Dude said RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin lmao
"Knicks. RJ Barrett, Obi, Quick + picks. Don is a NYer at heart. He is a big Mets fan"
I love you Knicks bro; RJ Barrett future MVP and FMVP
"The Cavs are great for player prop parlays. The online site I use has a section for them but call them ""accumulators"". You can add up to 10, one gets you a few bucks, 3 gets you maybe $5-10, 5 starts getting a bit more and 10 you can win like $800- 1600 on a dollar. Garland was one of my favorite players to add for pts and threes. The star players it gets kind of difficult, like Beal the lowest you might be able to take for a certain game is 24. And even 24 doesn't give you great odds, if you want those really tasty odds you gotta take like 28-32. Which is fucking hard! Lots of games at 24-26. So star players I'd do assists and rebs, those are more easily attainable. Threes as well. Then look for mid tier guys to take their points, someone like Garland at over 18 or 20 seems much better. RJ Barrett in the same range, those kind of guys. Garland and Sexton are so good for those, because they're not an unreasonable level. Jarrett Allen rebounds too. I liked Cleveland for those, someone's gotta score on the team, it's not like GS where Steph may score 46 which made everyone else score significantly less. Until Kevin fucking Love came back and threw a wrench into my low key favorite prop team. Those 3 were so reliable until his return. Moses Brown and Christian Wood too.  As a Cavs fan.. since you're obviously not winning a championship next season if you're looking for something to keep the games interesting, you have a really fun team to take for those kind of bets. And again, it's only a dollar, so you don't have to worry about spending crazy money (although obviously you can always bet more). If I had to guess, I'd say the start of next season might be a great time to take them, before those 3 all have solid numbers for a month and people realize. Kevin love should go away though, leave my guys alone so they can get their stats. Really disappointed with the Moses Brown trade too. I liked him on OKC where everybody could forget that he existed. Christian Wood better not go anywhere"
"RJ Barrett is a better player than Ben Simmons, pass it on"
It‚Äôs risky but if the Pelicans want to make Zion happy and stay in New Orleans maybe the trade they need to make is for RJ Barrett.   Ingram is a much better player but I‚Äôm sure something could be worked out value wise from the Knicks.   If the Knicks wanted to get raspy they could then try to swing a trade for D‚ÄôLo and get the ole Lakers band back together with Randle and Ingram.
Are you implying that RJ Barrett is better than MPJ?
RJ BARRETT
Knicks fansü§ùRaptors fans loving rj barrett.
RJ Barrett
"I mean it‚Äôs not really the media that does it for me lol. His good friend and former college teammate RJ Barrett is there and he loves the Knicks I could very easily see him trying to recruit Zion there. NY is also a big market and it‚Äôs somewhere I‚Äôm sure Zions family and friends would love to see him play, and the marketing potential of being the best player on a winning team there is far greater than in NOLA. And to top all of this Zion is quoted saying he would love to play for the Knicks in college and as you mentioned he says he loves playing at the Garden. It‚Äôs just one of those things I feel like is lining up to happen."
and his buddy RJ Barrett
"Zion, you and RJ Barrett are apart of the Duke Family. Do you want to be apart of the Knick family also?"
&gt;Orlando?   You mean Miami with Bam and Rj Barrett  in 2026
You could remove RJ Barrett a right hand and see no noticable drop in production.
"i just really haven't seen anything from reddish to make me understand the hype. this is from a canadian RJ Barrett stan who watched almost every duke game that year. i have nothing against the guy, i'm rooting for him, but he has a pretty good situation in duke and didn't put it together, and same thing in atlanta so far.   but cam's only 20, so best of luck to him."
Barrett plays forward minutes and there wasn't a single thing Paschall was better at that year except finishing and free throw shooting. RJ is a better defender too
"very very good pickup for the Jazz, that being said...  Can't believe 2019-2020 First Team All Rookie Paschall got traded for a 2nd round pick, smh. I'm sure he deserved that spot over 2019-2020 Second Team All Rookie RJ Barrett."
"Nah bro the Jazz have 2019-2020 NBA All Rookie FIRST TEAM athlete Eric Paschall now, the Knicks only have RJ Barrett, who was on the second team"
he made all-rookie team yet RJ Barrett didn't.
c- Mitch Robison.     f-  Julius Randle.    g/f-  RJ Barrett.     g/f- Fournier.     PG-  Kemba.       Derek Rose prefers to come off bench but iften is finishing the 4th quarter for us. He's the ultimate team player.. Zero ego.
Knicks fans believe in RJ Barrett much more than Fournier
"Rui, Drummond and RJ Barrett are NOT all star level"
"Randle had consistently been doubled and trapped. There wasn‚Äôt a good enough shot creator outside of Rose. RJ Barrett should have taken that as a massive insult but instead took the ‚Äúlook, Julius has the ball!‚Äù then run and hide approach"
"The Knicks have won one playoff series since RJ Barrett was born.   One.   If they can consistently get to the 2nd round for a few seasons, that's a major step towards long-term relevance.   If the Knicks are relevant and competent, they will attract top-tier stars."
"It took ages for this sub to accept that Wiggins is trash. First he was the next LeBron, then the next T Mac, then the next DeRozan, ""BuT He'S OnLy 22!!!"". Blog bois love to bash the eye test in evaluating players, but watching him even at Kansas you could tell he was missing something.   Now we have to do the same thing with RJ Barrett. So all the RJ Barrett takes right now are going to age like milk."
"RJ Barrett, SGA or Jamal Murray"
"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
"Randle May regress, but what if RJ Barrett takes a leap. That could propel them a bit further especially with Fournier in the mix and a competent starting point guard."
"Someone here mentioned Randle, but RJ Barrett going from 32% as a rookie to 40% was pretty impressive and super unexpected"
"Burks and RJ are primarily shooting guards who can play the 3 based on lineups. They're 6'6 and play more like guards than forwards. I think Barrett needs to learn to play the 3, but Burks especially is usually the primary ball handler when he's on the floor."
Traded him for RJ Barrett big W last season
"really?  I think it is quite good for his level of production  he's more productive than tim hardaway jr who just got signed for about the same amount of money but this one is more team-friendly with a 4th year team option  don't know why boston didn't re-sign him since a deal like this can be packaged as part of a big deal for a superstar.   nets only had to give up caris levert and jarrett allen + picks and they got harden.  even if he just stays at the level he's been at the last few years this is a very moveable contract that makes it less likely we would have to include RJ barrett as part of a big package for a superstar  I see boston fans didn't like his defense but hey thibs seems to get the best out of everyone on that end so I'm not really sweating it, our guys played great defense last year and almost all of them are coming back"
RJ Barrett will surely be a Free Agent draw.
RJ Barrett going somewhere?
They are probably going to extend RJ Barrett in 2 years.
Joakim Noah was the third highest paid player in Knicks payroll. Trailing RJ Barrett by only $2.2M ‚úåÔ∏è
"Yikes RJ Barrett on a max, kid's nice but still yikes"
"If your core is Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, you're staying right where you're at lmao"
"RJ Barrett. Jaden McDaniels.   Anthony Edwards will be a legitimate all star and the Wolves will fight for a play-in where nobody wants to play them.   Also not star, but as a role player Aaron Nesmith is going to surprise a lot of people. Think Danny Green esque role player."
"RJ Barrett is going for 22 ppg this coming season, book it"
RJ Barrett
"ja is better right now but the gap really isn't as wide as people think, barrett took a far greater leap as a player than ja did this year  it could be argued ja also has far better spacing. he is still better than rj for now tho"
"RJ Barrett is not anywhere near Ja. Barrett is barely a net positive player, his stats do not paint an accurate picture of how good he is.  Ja is like 5 tiers higher than Barrett."
"Porzingis didn't suck in NY and none of those players were even top 3 picks. Also, the Knicks never tanked, we're just really fucking bad   RJ Barrett IS that good and is 20 years old."
"the only offer I like is the Warriors one, I personally hate anything Wizards can offer personally, Warriors one is very compelling, Wiggins, Wiseman, Kuminga, and picks probably (I would love Moody but I think he is the one player they would keep in any deal simply because he can help now, doubt they include him). Who knows though, if Curry, Draymond, and Klay pressure them enough to make a WIN NOW move, and beal or Dame arent on the trade block, they may be pressured to overpay who knows.  All the other packages, I ain't feeling it, especially wizards, no offense to them. If knicks wanted him I would def not mind trade him there with a package around RJ Barrett and obviously more pieces."
"Player needs to be better than Rui. Thinking someone more in the realm of like Tyrese Haliburton, RJ Barrett or John Collins."
"Just a minor correction:   RJ Barrett was picked third overall, Ja Morant went second in the 2019 draft."
Man said RJ Barrett and Duncan Robinson
"RJ Barrett without a doubt. If we're talking about RJ as a prospect in 2019 vs Jalen Green, then probably Green."
To be fair he was in a bad situation at Duke. The entire offense revolved around drive and kick for RJ Barrett and feeding Zion down low. Cam was pretty much asked to stand in the corner and take spot up 3s most of the time
He never was I followed his class closely he was always in the top 10 but rj Barrett was always #1 until he left the class. Cole did finish second tho his last year
I‚Äôd hope there‚Äôs teams out there that can beat a RJ Barrett + picks package.
"I think there's a solid case that Lowry/Demar in addition to the Knicks functional core of Mitchell Robinson/Orange Julius/RJ Barrett and their team defense can compete for the east.   Especially once we build some distance from the playoffs and the newness of the Bucks as champions, I don't think anyone with a straight face can say Brooklyn, Philly, or Milwaukee have a firm hold on the East heading into next year."
RJ Barrett.
RJ Barrett once y‚Äôall herbs saw he was going to NYK
"Rj Barrett went to my highschool and is cool with my grade 9 math teacher. Even practiced in our school gym one time but they closed it off so we couldn‚Äôt interact with him, everyone was so exited tryna see him work out."
"RJ Barrett and to a lesser extent Anthony Edwards. I don‚Äôt think either guy is bad, but I just don‚Äôt see either guy being a top-2 guy on a championship roster.   Barrett is a pretty awful finisher, doesn‚Äôt take many 3s and his defense isn‚Äôt much to write home about. I see a high end outcome as DeMar DeRozan for him.   As for Edwards, it‚Äôs a similar thing, although I see his athleticism helping him a lot more.  Basically, if a guy‚Äôs only premiere attribute is scoring, they better be damn amazing at it if they want to be a superstar."
"Gianna and Luka and hot take, RJ Barrett.   All three foreign born players. Great time for nba"
But if the Pelicans somehow add RJ Barrett plus other player/draft assets for Ingram it may help them keep Zion.   Bringing in Zion‚Äôs best friend should pretty much guarantee that Zion is happy in New Orleans until Unrestricted Free Agency. Right now the threat it asking for a trade or the nuclear option of taking the 5th year option and leaving early in Free Agency. Even though that is extremely unlikely since players give up a ton of $.   Plus the Pelicans would likely open up like $20m in Free Agency with the price difference between Barrett and Ingram.
just leave rj barrett alone
RJ Barrett sucks bro
"Nah, if our young guys were as hyped as the Lakers‚Äô young guys, than RJ Barrett would be 10x more popular than Kuzma is rn."
RJ Barrett
"RJ Barrett, Kevin Porter Jr, and Jordan Poole also didn‚Äôt make an all rookie team and they show more promise than Herro now. What‚Äôs your point? Rookie seasons aren‚Äôt definitive of shit."
RJ Barrett
future super-MVP RJ Barrett  crazy that he‚Äôs still only 14
"Have you ever seen RJ Barrett play? He is good at open corner 3s and thats it. Terrible finishing, no handles or shot creation, cant pull up, mediocre defense etc."
"You dont need to downplay RJ Barrett because he did something your favorite player hasnt done  \-Lebron-stans dont need to downplay Rj because he made the playoffs without a HOFer         \-KD-stans dont need to downplay RJ Barrett  because he made the playoffs without a superstar   \-Stephews dont need to downplay RJ because he led the 2019 draft class in three point percentage after being marked as a bad shooter              \-Harden-stans dont need to downplay RJ because he‚Äôs on the cooler New York team   etc.            RJ Barrett deserves his respect. No need for insecurity now.            Fact of the matter is that RJ carried a World Cup team to the championship without an nba player beside him, something nobody else in the league right now can say except maybe Luka"
"You really left out rj barrett in the 2019 class like he didn‚Äôt just put up 18, 5,3 as the second guy on a 4th seed. I genuinely wanna know what was going through your head when you put Tyler hero and cam reddish over rj?"
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"I said that. Zion and Morant look like they are on an allstar path. RJ Barrett looks like a scorer at the very least and Deandre Hunter a solid 3+d guy at worst. I think this will be similar to 2007, 2 stars and 2 solid borderline allstar guys."
Rj barrett fans stand the fuck up!!!!!!
No RJ Barrett for ‚Äò19 ü§î
"As a Knicks fan, I would like to log a complaint:   * RJ Barrett needs to replace Cam Reddish on the '19 team  Aside from that, great job OP. This is really good creative post"
"I went back to check when there wasn't atleast one bust in the top 4 and these were the best i could find.   2019 - Zion, Morant, RJ Barrett, Deandre Hunter (still too early to call this one)  2007 - Oden (idk if he qualifies as a bust), Durant, Horford, Conley  1999 - Elton Brand, Steve Francis, Baron Davis, Lamar Odom  1996 - Iverson, Camby, Abdur Rahim, Marbury  It's rare for all 4 to be good players let alone allstars."
Dukes Young Core  Cam Reddish  RJ Barrett  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Wendell Carter Jr
"As recently suggested in the Cavs sub‚Ä¶ Collin Sexton, Kevin Love and Taurean Prince to the Knicks for RJ Barrett, Immanual Quickley, Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and picks 19, 21, 32, 58 lmao."
[Can carry a team confirmed](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett)
"Rj barrett - Michael Jordan   And no I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, I‚Äôm not being humorous, Im not being ironic and im not joking , I fucking mean it. Rj barrett is the next Jordan and will be the face of the nba in a few years"
"I mean who are the #15 picks from the last 5 years? I can't name any until they make an impact (like Saddiq Bey, Giannis, etc.). Unlike Zion, RJ Barrett, and others who people know before they step on an NBA court."
"My favorite will always be the Zion draft lottery.  When she interviewed the other players there, and almost all her questions to them were about how great Zion is and what it's like to be sitting with Zion (or in the case of RJ Barrett, how honored he was to have played with Zion.)  She is just the worst.  (Or, the ESPN producers are just the worst, if they're making her ask those questions)"
Similar to what rj Barrett and Julius Randle are gonna be doing when they hold up that Larry O‚ÄôBrien trophy next season
Rj barrett finally got some competition now
Rj barrett has some competition now finally
"I didn't say Rj ""self creates"" you said he doesn't and I said Rj could develope a handle and create for himself. So clearly reading isn't your strong point    I was bullshiting with just the points, rebounds and assists, I haven't brought that up since the very beginning so your grasping at straws man. Rj is quicker, more explosive and strength is very debatable 6'6 215 Rj Barrett vs 6'5 220 James harden at age 20  not a huge difference there.   Again and I will say it again so you maybe understand this time   Rj Barett has star potential and probably won't be a top 5 player, he was the 3rd option on 47 win pace team at 20 and showed signs he could be a star throughout the season.    RJ Barett at 20 is a better shooter, finisher, Offball player, iso defender and is more athletic than harden at the same age    Harden was obvious better at playmaking and handling the ball even back then but he got progressively better not just massively better from 1 year to the next even in 2013 when he made his first allstar team his usage went up and he went from a 3rd option to a 1st option and his efficiency fell a by a significant amount.    Again so you understand I don't actually think Barett will be too 5 but you never know because he's better than harden was at 20 and we saw what he became just 3 years later"

Put rj Barrett in the starting slot and team usa getting fucked
You can see Jimmy Butler doing this exact same thing with RJ Barret in this video  https://twitter.com/BenRitholtz_NBA/status/1372559639322189828  &gt;New York Knicks wing RJ Barrett shared some advice that Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler gave him during a game this season.  &gt;Butler apparently advised Barrett to go into his body in order to avoid getting stripped when he is driving to the rim.
"I‚Äôd say Hali is definitely more valuable than Mitch. He‚Äôs an efficient, tall, playmaking point guard/off guard combo with good on ball and off ball skills, while putting up shooting splits of 47.2%/85.7%/40.9% with a 5.3/1.6 ast to turn over ratio. He contributed significantly last year and closed out multiple games scoring and facilitating as the lead guard, or by hitting clutch shots as an off guard.   I like Mitch but I don‚Äôt think many teams would choose him over Tyrese. I‚Äôd rather have him than RJ Barrett too, but that‚Äôs more my belief in Tyrese being more than what he showed last season than it is something that I can back up, and RJ showed some major improvements last year. But I‚Äôd for sure rather have Fox than RJ."
"RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, and Obi Toppin is a pretty nice start‚Ä¶if Grimes and McBride have nice rookie years, the Knicks are in this convo next summer.    For now, in addition to the other teams mentioned already, I‚Äôll toss in Memphis‚Ä¶Morant, JJJ, Bane, Melton, Tillman, plus some other dudes just outside the 25-year old cap (Brooks, Clarke, Winslow). Not the best at the moment, but lots of potential."
RJ Barrett Year 3
"Amare stoudemire and Tyson Chandler signing there debunks the no free agent star in 20 years. They both made the all star team their first years in New York, Stoudemire got too 5 MVP voting and Chandler win DPOY. It‚Äôs funny people think ESPN wants stars on the Knicks, they repeatedly shit on them every chance they get. Stephen A Smith complaining and hating on the Knicks is a whole half hour segment on ESPN daily. Their analysts slander RJ Barrett and denigrate any accomplishment they might have. Usually they don‚Äôt even mention the Knicks in NBA free agent discussion. The only reason people think that is because of the KD to NY hype and that‚Äôs because James Dolan went public on some radio show hinting they were gonna sign someone ‚Äúbig‚Äù."
"Zach Collins over RJ Barrett? Bruh, come on"
RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett
&gt;somewhere he could be more marketable   Remind me of all the RJ Barrett commercials I must've missed
I like being nice to people who disagree unless they're fascists or think RJ Barrett is the 151st best player in the NBA
"Actual underrated players, not just hipster shit:  James Harden  Gordon Heyward  Karl-Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons  Clint Capela  RJ Barrett  Anthony Edwards  Terry Rozier  Malcolm Brogdon"
Yeah NAW late season when he started averaged like 18 a game people got mad when I said a while back going forward I would have DeAndre Hunter and him in a similar tier long term but is what it is. Same thing with both you hope their most recent 15-20 game stretch carries over   How low are Wendell Carter‚Äôs odds because if they are low enough might put a few bucks on it   MPJ I could still see an offensive explosion happening to some extent. I agree SGA Zion types are waste of $$ for this. Ayton not a bad choice either   I also still like OG at +6000 may put down a few $$ on it. Rui I think those are good odds also.   Cam Johnson +6600 as a tota dark horse not terrible. I‚Äôm not huge on Gary Trent or Terrance Mann but once you get into +10000 territory it‚Äôs the type of thing worth looking at a little. Keldon Johnson +3000 and RJ Barrett +3000 a hair rich but both I might look at especially Keldon
"In no particular order Lebron, RJ Barrett, Giannis, Steph, KD, Harden, Kawhi are the top 7 and in a tier of their own. Luka can be slotted as high as 8 reasonably and as low as 13 behind Jokic, Embiid, AD and Dame. I recognize the big man erasure, I just don‚Äôt value them as highly as other positions and could easily see someone putting Jokic and Embiid in with the top 7"
Inb4 RJ Barrett has been traded to the ______.
that will hopefully change with RJ Barrett in a yr from now
"I was responding to another thread and found an interesting comparison:   RJ Barrett - 6'6 SF  Jayson Tatum - 6'8 SF   **Age 19 rookie season:**  Player| Pts| Rbd| Ast| eFG| mpg ---|---|----|----|----|---- Tatum | 14| 5| 2| 54%| 31 RJ | 14| 5| 3| 45%| 30  **Age 20 sophomore season:**  Player| Pts| Rbd| Ast| eFG| mpg ---|---|----|----|----|---- Tatum | 16| 6| 2| 50%| 31 RJ | 18| 6| 3| 50%| 35  As you can see, they put up very similar numbers, as wings that can score from multiple levels with the ball in their hands. Now, Tatum's third season, he made the leap to 26/7/4 on 53% eFG% in 36mpg. The third year is when lots of young guys make the leap. We may in for a big jump from RJ Barrett."
"&gt; RJ was at 53.5%TS last season, OG was at 60.5%TS and league average was 57.2%TS. Thats an even bigger difference  Look at system they played in and their roles. Barrett was a big part of New York's offense while OG was a spacer and close-out attacker.   It is absolutely a discussion and saying otherwise just shows you're looking at numbers and nothing else. There's nothing wrong with taking OG here, but Barrett is 3 years younger and could be in for a really big season."
Let‚Äôs settle for same conversation as Rj Barrett
As usually nba Reddit underates RJ Barrett. Barrett is the better player easily.
I agree. Rj Barrett should invite you to his house since you pay his salary. He literally owes you.

"Canada is going to compete for gold in the 20's. We're coming. Every year we're putting out better and better young players and building up the infrastructure in domestic competition and youth leagues. SGA, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Shaedon Sharpe, they're just the tip of the iceberg."
can't wait for RJ Barrett to have the best season out of anyone from his draft class this year :)
What if Randle just came off a 42 PPG season and RJ Barrett is shooting 65% from 3?

RJ Barrett is good
"I would rather have RJ Barrett than almost any other young player in the league, exceptions would be Young, Morant, probably Zion.  He‚Äôs entirely slept on and looks like he‚Äôs on the Jayson Tatum track to being an mvp candidate imo"
RJ Barrett.  I really think Kemba is gonna help unlock his game.
"Not in terms of potential, he wasn‚Äôt. He was hyped in terms of flashiness with dunks and athleticism. RJ Barrett was seen as the best player in the 2018 high school class and Cam Reddish and Zion were seen as interchangeable on a lot of recruiting rankings."
"idk, I'd put SGA, Wiggins, and jamal murray above him. Then you have Dort and RJ Barrett. Imo, he's fighting for 6th at best, with dudes like Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, and (if he makes a jump) NAW."
"I mean I think that comes down to not knowing about the players. Huerter this season was 12 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds on 43% FG/36% 3P/ 78% FT.   RJ Barrett was 18 points, 3 assists, 6 rebounds on 44% FG/ 40% 3P/ 75% FT.   RJ did this with Elfrid Payton his starting point guard not passing him the ball, while Huerter played with Trae Young."
Type in RJ Barrett on Twitter any random day and you‚Äôll see what he‚Äôs talking about
Ah yes I remember RJ Barrett being compared to Lebron leading up to the draft‚Ä¶
Who‚Äôs going around disrespecting RJ Barrett?
"They always forgetting my boy, RJ Barrett"
Where's the Maple Mamba? RJ Barrett is going to breakout too
"You‚Äôre being too specific in your comp. The best player at that spot is less relevant than the best player that could have been picked at that spot, ie don‚Äôt just look at 8, and 17, look at 8-30 if you are going to use a best pick comp.  There is a chance this year that NAW is as good as  Hunter ( not betting my life on it but wouldn‚Äôt surprise me). NAW‚Äôs per minute stats were really similar to RJ Barrett and his stats as starter, though likely unsustainable, speak to a really impressive upside for this year.  I would definitely do this deal over again, especially given the excitement around Trey Young."
RJ Barrett?
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."

nba 2k saving the day for my boy rj barrett
"I agree the depth of the Sixers is better, but a lot of those Sixers team was mostly comprised of G-Leaguers that aren‚Äôt in the NBA anymore either so it might not be a huge difference. Especially with a team like 2019 Duke,  it‚Äôs possible the star power could win out. Like that team had Grayson Allen, Zion, Cam Reddish, and RJ Barrett. Even though the bench sucks, they could definitely compete with those Sixers teams."
Monty Williams was coaching a starting backcourt of Devin Booker and Chris Paul to the playoffs.  Tom Thibodeau was coaching a starting backcourt of RJ Barrett and fucking Elfrid Payton to the playoffs.  One of these things is very clearly not like the other. Give it a rest already.
"He was a good ISO scorer for a young guy.  That's it. In every other aspect of the game he was terrible. He refused to pass, and when he did he made bad decisions. He refused to defend, and when he did he was awful at it. That alone was enough to have him out of the rotation after Fizdale's firing.  But the biggest issue with him is his attitude. He couldn't fathom that not playing defense and not passing the ball makes for a bad guard. He'd bitch constantly about his minutes, and far worse, he'd bitch directly about other guys' minutes. He even took shots at RJ Barrett on Twitter.   It's been a long time since I've been so happy to see the back of a player on the Knicks, and given how good the locker room chemistry was last season, I imagine the players agreed. I hope for his own sake he can turn it around, but the first thing that needs adjusting is his attitude, and that can be the hardest thing to change."
"Recently there‚Äôs been some ***very specific criteria*** to win MIP. Those two criteria have been: first time all-star, make the playoffs as a first time starter. Another concept has been picking guys who aren‚Äôt in the 2nd year.  Making the playoffs has actually been the more predictive of winning the award but someone who doesn‚Äôt make the playoffs basically needs to be a first time all-star. Going back to Love, the only players to miss the playoffs have been Love (first time all-star), Dragic, and Ingram (first time all-star).  Dragic actually has been the only player since Love to not be an all-star or make the playoffs and win the award. 2nd year starter, but the suns improved by 23 wins (up to 48) and just barely missed the playoffs in a stacked western conference. He is the exception not the rule.  Picking a most improved candidate is actually pretty easy when considering these. Guys who haven‚Äôt been all-stars or are finally getting a full-time starting job on a potential playoff team.  My picks this year are **Lonzo**, **RJ Barrett**, **Garland**, and **SGA** as first time all-stars. Reddit hypes up SGA *a lot* but the rest of the NBA world hasn‚Äôt caught up yet. If he can get his first all-star appearance and put together a solid season he can get it. I think **MPJ** can get here too if he‚Äôs solid defensively.  For making the playoffs as a first time starter, my pick is **Gary Trent Jr.** I‚Äôm not wild about anyone else for this criteria right now. This one doesn‚Äôt usually make itself clear until late in the season. I like the raps to sneak in and GTJ will be a big part of that.  Putting it all in order I‚Äôd have Barrett, GTJ, Garland, MPJ, SGA, Lonzo."
RJ Barrett  Markelle Fultz  Aaron Nesmith   Are all my picks
My money is on RJ Barrett. Big jump in efficency last year and plays on a team theoretically on an upswing. It‚Äôs a good combo for this award. If he keeps it going this year your talking about making the jump to lower level stardom.
I love RJ Barrett. I wish he got more love from the fans but someone a 6/3/2 guy got more appreciation than RJ despite being a career underachiever.
Fav non-Knick is Giannis  Fav Knick is RJ Barrett  Least favorite is‚Ä¶I really can't think of may active players I really dislike. I guess it'd have to be LeBron for being a fake woke hypocrite + a serial winner. That or KP.
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Yeah the only player in this list who might be a truly elite player at some point is Edwards because of his ridiculous talent and athleticism. Maybe Green. Barrett will maybe be a top 20 player at some point down the road but I doubt it.  Look at OPs name then completely disregard anything he has to say because he‚Äôs one of those weird stan accounts. Can‚Äôt even tell if he‚Äôs a troll or just has a few screws loose. Sorry bud RJ ain‚Äôt gonna let you blow him in the parking lot, maybe if you make a big sign he‚Äôll wink at ya."
Rj barrett
Rj barrett will be top 10 and prove all u guys wrong. Also jaylen brown
Anything RJ Barrett and Ja Morant
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."

"Three way trade suggested by a lakers fan    Knicks get: KCP  Lakers get: Kyle Lowry   Raptors get: rj Barrett, Kyle Kuzma  This was last seasons trade deadline"
"There's a lot of RJ Barrett mania going on. ""There's a conspiracy in the media to not talk about how good RJ Barrett is"", ""RJ Barrett already had a breakout season and is better than X"".  Even though I don't really buy into it, I can't help but absorb the takes to the point that if he's not an all-star I'll be disappointed."
RJ Barrett is going to be a legit superstar.
RJ Barrett will have the most successful career of his draft class.
RJ Barrett will be better than Zion
RJ Barrett will be the consensus best player from his draft in 3 years time
"RJ Barrett will be a top 20 player, Tyler Herro will make an all-star team"
RJ Barrett is just a better DWade
"RJ Barrett, IQ, and Obi"

Rj Barrett
"This is going to sound highly homerish but I‚Äôm saying RJ Barrett. He made a big leap from Y1 to Y2, especially in areas like FT and 3pt %. If he can make another one this year the guy is going to be a problem."
"This is literally the most brain dead argument ever, Siakam was on a team with Kyle Lowry and prime Kawhi where he could pick and choose his spots playing with two other allstar teammates lol. Julius  Randles second and third best players were 32 year old Derrick Rose and 21 year old RJ Barrett   Literally such a brain-dead argument."
Spalding.. Wilson.. it doesn‚Äôt matter.  The RJ Barrett era is here and everyone just needs to wait it out.
On behalf of Wisconsin I think Knicks fans can run rampant based of their history. Run the meme dream. We ran with our meme dream of Bucks in 6 for  ~7 years and it came true. A decade from now RJ Barrett will Bing Bong in the finals
I will support every positive RJ Barrett post made on this sub
"You‚Äôre fucking clueless. Duke Zion was far ahead of Trez now, he was already a top 25 player in the world. They didn‚Äôt even make final four. And that was with RJ Barrett too."
"In reality, Zion last year had a better season than RJ will ever have in his career. I still would take Zion every day over Ja, but I at least understand why people would take Ja. It‚Äôs absurd to think that someone would pick RJ Barrett over Zion Williamson in a redraft."
Rj is still #3. I honestly think they got it right. No way you don‚Äôt draft Zion 1. Morant is obviously above Barrett.
RJ Barrett becoming a star
RJ Barrett throws rocks. Yuck.
RJ Barrett coming into his own

"FVV, Mikal Bridges, RJ Barrett, Jaylen Brown are all some realistic one for one offers"
Rj Barrett has to be up there this season
to rank him as a top 100 player was an insult to guys like my boy rj barrett.

"This is what happened to RJ Barrett. They changed his shot before his rookie year and be shot below 30% from 3 for the season. Dumb thing to do with a rookie coming into the NBA, but Cade is too good not to come around eventually"
Proud rj Barrett believer since the beginning idek why I loved him so much
RJ Barrett all over again
I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs not in rhythm or he needs to get back to full health and not a case of coaching staff tweaking his shot. The Knicks ‚Äúshot doctor‚Äù under Fiz fucked up everybody‚Äôs shooting on the Knicks and it took a lot for RJ Barrett to get it back to a shooting form that works for him.
"ayy I‚Äôd put him below Ja and Zion, and above RJ Barrett and Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson 6"
"that's fine, if it's all the same to you I'll keep believing RJ Barrett will continue to shoot 50% from the field and 41% from 3 the whole season as well then lol"
"The Knicks have been pretty good to start, but they‚Äôve gotta ramp up the defense a bit.  RJ Barrett has really surprised me thus far. He‚Äôs looking like one of the best picks this organization has made in the last 20 years.  They‚Äôre doing good. It took Kemba a few games to get it going, but they‚Äôre getting solid production from him now. Fournier‚Äôs been good as well.  The rookies haven‚Äôt gotten much playing time, but they‚Äôve shown flashes whenever they‚Äôve been on the court."
"you're joking..of course Mitch gets traded for prime Kareem. If you posted right now in the Knicks subreddit ""hey for some reason Denver wants to trade Jokic for Mitchell Robinson"" no shit every single person is going to say yes  a Tyler Herro for Lowry trade is one that Toronto wins, same goes when trading RJ Barrett for prime Jordan or Zach Lavine"
"The Good:  -  This team is definitely much better than last year with upgrades in shooting and other ball handlers to take pressure off Randle.  -  RJ Barrett.  The Bad:  -  This team can't close a game for shit right now.  Horrible turnovers along with just turning into a dead paced, all iso, offense that's too easy to defend.  -  Julius Randle is looking pretty rough.  Shooting hasn't been too good and he's making a lot of bad turnovers.  Still making great passes to open shooters but gets pretty careless.  This team needs him to find a rhythm to really get going.  Overall I definitely like this team way more than last.  They definitely made the improvements they needed from last year.  Now it's all about everyone finding their role and locking in.  This team is just too damn likeable and fun."
"Yes you can?  Rookie Luka was worse than Khris Middleton that year, but nobody would have argued if you said Luka's ceiling was higher than Middleton's.  Kendrick Nunn was on an All-Rookie that RJ Barrett wasn't on, but you'd be crazy saying he had a higher ceiling."

"RJ Barrett still that guy, if only the rest of the team followed suit"
"The Toronto Raptors and Orlando Magic are the 2 best teams in the league. Better than those trash Celtics, Bulls, and 76ers  RJ Barrett is a star. That‚Äôs my takeaway."
Hey RJ Barrett don't you wish you were drafted by the RAAAAAPTORS
*RJ Barrett has entered the chat*
" LaMelo, RJ Barrett, Luka Doncic,Tatum, Brown, Embiid, Beal  The only bad one really was Okafor  The meh ones are Otto, Kanter and Favors  Damn #3 is stacked"
I'm guessing because RJ Barrett was the first option? Only thing that makes sense. Not that I agree with it.
"Alec Burks, Kevin Knox, 4 FRPs and 4 pick swaps? Or whatever the max is. Even then it's only if Zion publicly demands a trade to the NYK.  The problem is the Knicks don't have any young talent the Pels would want other than RJ Barrett and I can't see the Knicks departing w/ him, especially if it's Zion coming in as they're college buddies.   Also Thibs would get Zion killed playing him 42 minutes a night."
NBA Legend RJ Barrett
I can see Rj Barrett becoming at least a borderline superstar soon. Dude just has it all
We‚Äôre judging players from the same draft class not decades between each other. Stop with the nonsense. Usually young players make the leap in the beginning of each season and RJ Barrett is tracking on the same trajectory as last season. Also RJ Barrett will have less possessions with a players like Kemba and Fournier. So his FG attempts will remain the same so where can his growth be achieved this season? Also Herro plays against starters throughout the game and his usage will always be higher because he plays point.
Tyler Hero / RJ Barrett i think have better cases
"There's probably a whole host of guys who were juniors but didn't go by ""[insert name] Jr."" in the league prior to this, so for the sake of a fair comparison I tried to go with just guys who are *listed* on their rosters with a suffix.  Steph I purposely omitted because he doesn't go by Wardell or Jr at all, if Draymond puts it on his jersey or in the roster I'll add him.   RJ Barrett is a trickier one but I allowed it because the ""RJ"" is for ""Rowan Jr"" as his real middle name is Alexander."
RJ Barrett is actually Rowan Alexander Barrett Jr to add
RJ Barrett had a terrible jumpshot in college
"All the big guards that aren‚Äôt traditionally athletic but become truly elite in the NBA all share one common athletic trait. Luka &amp; Hardenall have incredible deceleration that allows them to still get to the rim and finish at a high level in spite of other limiting physical traits. It‚Äôs why as much as I love RJ Barrett, he‚Äôs struggled to finish at the rim in the NBA and I worry about Cade as well"
Rikers Rowan was gifted a sniper riffle.  Squid games part 2: RJ Barrett
"The ‚Äúoverpaid‚Äù thing blew my mind  A-list superstars are making over $50 million a year now  How is a reliable veteran all star who excels at what he is signed for an ‚Äúoverpay‚Äù at just under 60% of the cost?   And don‚Äôt get me started about people overvaluing these late first round picks, how many times do you have to draft a player at 19 overall and develop him for several years for him to be an impact player?    RJ Barrett is a good player and looks like he can improve.  Maybe he‚Äôll become great some day.  He was drafted #3 overall several years ago.  He scored 32 points and it is a huge deal.    DeRozan scores 32 points and it‚Äôs ‚Äúhuh, a good game from DeMar.‚Äù  There‚Äôs a mile of difference between ‚Äúa guy may score 30 points someday if he develops‚Äù and ‚Äúthis guy scores 30 points every 5th game today.‚Äù    Thad is a good player but he‚Äôs not a go to bucket, I know we like metrics but being able to get up quality shots reliably in the NBA is a rare skill.  It‚Äôs easier to build defense than it is to conjure up a legit scorer.    So yeah, I think it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to give up a future late first and a solid NBA player for this guy, and you need to spend your cap money on someone, seems like a very good #2 scorer is worth 60% of #1 guy money."
"In order I‚Äôd say:        1. Heat: the defense is definitely top 3 at worst and guys like Herro and Bam are looking like they‚Äôre in for career years. Lowry hasn‚Äôt found his footing yet but he will so that‚Äôll only help more. I‚Äôm not entirely sold on their offense quite yet but they‚Äôre certainly much improved overall and will put up a fight against anyone.      2. Knicks: I‚Äôm biased cause I was high on NY coming into the year but I really like what they‚Äôre doing so far. Randle is wildly effective and they might be the deepest team in the East, the bench has made the difference in some games and that‚Äôs been without Noel. Also looks like RJ Barrett has taken another step so maybe he‚Äôll finally start getting the credit he deserves.      3. Bulls: I‚Äôll start off by saying I think Zach Lavine is an elite scorer and does not get nearly enough credit for how good he is. After that you have some nice additions in Lonzo and Caruso which can give any guards in the nba a tough time. I‚Äôm very biased on Demar as well, I just don‚Äôt see it with him. He‚Äôs a very mediocre playoff performer and gets tunnel vision sometimes. They‚Äôve played a fairly easy schedule so far so hard to gauge but Utah was a nice win and they were right there with NY. My biggest concern with them is their big man depth. Vucci mane is rock solid but he‚Äôs not a difference maker defensively and there‚Äôs not a whole lot after him. When it comes down to it how do they stop Giannis, Embiid, KD, etc?       4. Wizards: I‚Äôm not particularly high on the Wizards. Not a bad team and I think they‚Äôll make the playoffs but clearly below the other 3 teams listed here imo. I like the bench, seems like the Westbrook trade was a huge win. My issue with Washington is I‚Äôm not sure Beal or Dinwiddie are good enough to carry them. Yesterday was a really good example of how their ceiling is capped with those two mostly looking to score first as opposed to spreading the ball around. I will be interested to see how they look whenever Rui comes back and Gafford gets healthy."

'RJ Barrett isn't anywhere close to an all-star' FOH
"You wanna see pasta? Here you go:  .  RJ ""yikes"" Barrett has been hot garbage to start the season and he was taking so many threes in the clutch, plus he was getting cooked on defense too  Next year contract extension up, Knicks fans will hate him if he keeps this shit up lmao"

"RJ BARRETT  Every game I wish for an RJ 40 point game, realistic or not. This only fuels that dream."
"First, r/nba said Rj Barrett will never be a good shooter. He came out shooting 40% from on good volume his second season. They said he would never really have a developed handle. His handle is already looking better and he is defending at a really high level. You guys always move the goalposts. Now r/nba says he will never be an all-star and he will never develop to that level, let‚Äôs see if they‚Äôre correct."
My heart can‚Äôt fucking take this for 82 games. RJ Barrett is a star.  Hey KD?

We beat Boston and Chicago because RJ Barrett is an elite defender.  We‚Äôre super concerned about closing out games but a win‚Äôs a win.  I agree that we‚Äôre above Boston and at Chicago‚Äôs level but Philly is a mess.
"I understand the desire to temper expectations but there are things that can be derived from early success or failure at least with more set (and healthy) teams, I think.   Like it's too early to bury Russ and the Lakers or proclaim that Harden is done, but I think you can see that someone like RJ Barrett has taken steps forward as a defender or that the Knicks have continued to take the gains from last year and build upon them.  Alternatively: **FRESH OUT THE GARDEN BABY! WE TAKEN IT ALL THE WAY!!**"
"I think this is the divide right here. If the majority of your exposure to Barrett is via online discourse and advanced stats, it‚Äôs pretty impossible to see why Knicks fans/people who pay attention to Barrett in live games are happy &amp; excited. Ja and Zion have nothing to do with RJ, and as you said RJ was never asked to be the best player on his team.   This idea that he‚Äôs been disappointing as a #3 pick is ludicrous IMO. I think the majority of people upon Barrett being drafted saw a potential ceiling of a Jimmy Butler-esque player. The body to guard an opposing team‚Äôs best perimeter player while being a reliable 18-22 ppg scorer. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever rise to actual Jimmy Butler levels, but he can easily be the 2nd or 3rd best player on a great team.   It‚Äôs also a big time LOL that fans just write dudes off when they enter the league so young. Jaylen Brown averaged 13 ppg in his third year at 22 years old, and now he‚Äôs a pretty obvious all star player in his sixth year at 25. If you‚Äôre not a bonafide star talent entering the league from the draft (Zion, Ja, etc.) then the incremental year to year improvement is the beautiful aspect of rooting for these kids."
In 3 years we will be saying RJ Barrett.
"man ja looking incredible and singlehandedly keeping his team in the game, RJ barrett best player for the knicks tonight  poor pelicans can't catch a break"
RJ Barrett also known as the Maple Mamba and most recently known as Demar Derozans father
"Exactly thats what the caption should be about. ""RJ Barrett shuts down Demar for final shot"""
"Come on, man...did you actually watch the game?     We GAVE the Bulls that comeback because we're fucking dumb when it comes to crunch time.     Julius was shooting like shit the entire game and then ISO'd the entire 4th quarter, meanwhile, RJ Barrett only got like one shot off despite balling his ass off in prior quarters.     I guarantee if Randle didn't have a shit game and we actually passed the ball to RJ, the deficit would NOT have closed the way it did."

I agree. Jamal Murray is complete shit and RJ Barrett is the better player.
"Quickley&gt;Bane in my opinion and I feel like Wiseman will get second team due to his draft position. Although you never know, it somehow didn't help RJ Barrett"
im just saying plenty of knicks fans do think they can get zion and theyre not wrong that they probably have a good chance being in new york and likely having rj barrett.
Mine is similar I‚Äôd say below MJ Lebron and Rj Barrett
Rj Barrett and his beautiful Smile
Pelicans second best player is an all star. They can win some games if you take out Zion. If you take out randle from the Knicks your best player is a second year RJ Barrett and we‚Äôd prolly be one of the worst teams in the league.
"Define ‚Äúgood.‚Äù You said he‚Äôs ‚Äúpure ass.‚Äù Going by BPM (worse than Kuz), here are some players this year that are crystal-grade ass:  Schr√∂der  RJ Barrett  PJ Washington  KCP  Seth Curry  Darius Garland  Tyler Herro  Gary Trent JR  Lou Williams  Ricky Rubio  Lu Dort  Ant Edwards  Dillon Brooks"
RJ Barrett broke into a sweet saxophone solo when we asked him if he liked beignets  *uhoh*
"I've always pointed to JB's development, as a fan of RJ Barrett. This guy didn't look anywhere close to a 25ppg shot creator coming into the league. Every off season he just added something to his game. He tightened up his handles and learned how to create his own looks.  We all know guys can shoot off screens or off assists, but shot creation is what propels you to all-star/all-pro caliber (effectively, of course). JB took that leap. Boston is lucky to have two bonafide studs"
"Well, how else is he supposed to bring RJ Barrett to New Orleans without stopping in New York? See, Pelicans' fans can play this game too."
Rj Barrett/s
I definitely agree with most of this but under no circumstance can they trade RJ Barrett. He is untouchable
"add more to the narrative, reunite with his fellow Dukeian RJ Barrett"
"people overhype his knicks tenure. he's just fine player, but the projection from fans (especially knicks fans at that time) out of the world. same like this year knicks, narrative told me that randle and rj barrett can be duo on contender teams"
"Coach of the fucking Year. Just give it here.  Hand Randle his MIP cause nobody else in the league comes close and fucking throw him into the All-NBA team 2 or 3.  Get Nerl in the All-NBA Defense squad, Idgaf if it's team 1 or 2 - he belongs there.  Hand RJ Barrett his respek in this fucking league. 2K had this kid at 73 overall at the start of this season, now they can suck my dick, and his, from the back."
"True. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, who says no?"
Twitter fans of any team will put their teams guys above everyone. I saw Caruso &gt; RJ Barrett on twitter by more than one person
"KAT is way more talented there‚Äôs no doubt. But the fact that you say ‚Äúworse surrounding cast‚Äù gives you away. The Knicks roster is a joke. They start Elf Payton, Reggie Bullock, Nerlons Noel, and RJ Barrett. But Randle‚Äôs playmaking makes them better. KAT hasn‚Äôt shown he can make crappy teams better yet"
&gt;You‚Äôre also the guy who used a 20 game sample size to try to prove Anthony Edwards is better than RJ Barrett. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs too low? Be consistent man.   How does your argument make sense? Even with improvements you are still below average in 3 point attempts and that's the entire point. And yeah he's better and it will be clear by the end of the season lol
You‚Äôre also the guy who used a 20 game sample size to try to prove Anthony Edwards is better than RJ Barrett. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs too low? Be consistent man.

"Definitely less tactful than that.  ""Hey, RJ Barrett, you were roommates with Zion and you're both in the draft now.  Yall play naked Twister before and you were definitely bottom bunk if you know what I mean, right?"""
you absolutely made this entire post for the explicit and sole purpose of disrespecting RJ Barrett
"So true, some serious stars making huge noise early in their careers. Just adding Booker, Donovan, and as a Knicks fan I'll let you know I've got RJ Barrett as an All Star next season."
Any unpopular opinion thread or something about RJ Barrett or other young players always has people calling him overrated. Nobody watches us. They just use whatever advanced stats fit their stance or go with a random created narrative

How old is RJ Barrett again? He‚Äôs like 30 right? Haha scrub
Disappointed that Julius Randle and rj Barrett aren't number one.
So the RJ Barrett Tyler Herro debate can officially be put to bed right? It‚Äôs clear RJ is at least one tier above Herro
Still surprises me how much rj barrett is slept on. Didn't make the all rookie team last yr and cant even make it into the top 25 prospect list of espn   Some people/analysts really are dumb
Julebronius Randle cannot be tamed  Also RJ Barrett is going to be so good for a long time. He‚Äôs only 20. Wild
Everyone wants to talk about Julius Randle's performance but MAN RJ Barrett is proving again and again how clutch he is.   I think everyone needs to take a hard look as to how and when RJ Barrett has scored today cause it's becoming a real thing that he makes a surge in the clutch.
RJ BARRETT EVERYONE
can you fucking imagine your two best players not being Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
RJ Barrett really reminds me of some celebrity from like 15 years ago and it‚Äôs really bothering me that I can‚Äôt think of who it is
Who the hell thought it was a good idea to put 52 year old JJ Redick on RJ Barrett
mavs blew all their good luck against memphis and now rj barrett is making the mavs look like the guangdong tigers
Does RJ Barrett ever rest?  Wasn‚Äôt his ass in there all 3rd quarter
"Since when was RJ Barrett 6'9"" 225 lbs?"
Zion and RJ Barrett still in college? Scary thought
The only broken records here are the all-time worst franchise win percentages for the Knicks over the last few years   I'm sure RJ Barrett and Julius Randle will lead you to 50 wins again someday LMFAO
Rj Barrett [Jimmy Butler]
Ask again next season. This is RJ Barrett all over again
"THT is mot a better player than MPJ, Tyler Herro, Cam Johnson, RJ Barrett, De‚Äôandre Hunter, Brandon Clark, Kendrick Nunn, Terence Davis, PJ Washington, or Thybulle. And that‚Äôs just from the top of my head.    He‚Äôs a good player, but thinking that he‚Äôs top 3 in that draft class is absurd homerism."
"Listen im as big of an RJ Barrett fan as the next guy, you can check my comment history. But THT has IT"
"&gt; Other than Zion and Ja I dont think theres anyone in that draft class    RJ Barrett, hello?"
Ja and RJ Barrett will be in the playoffs before Zion‚Ä¶ just think that‚Äôs interesting
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion‚Äôs? Fit is one thing, but he‚Äôs playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
Ima just leave this here: RJ Barrett
this sub tried to tell me RJ Barrett is better than ja hahahahah
Lmao I remember when this sub thought Morant vs RJ Barrett was a debate
1. Demar Derozan 2. Pascal Siakam 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steve Nash 6. Jamal Murray 7. RJ Barrett  8. Jeremy Lin 9. Norman Powell  10. Jayson Tatum
RJ Barrett incoming
"Having a good bench doesn‚Äôt mean anything in the playoffs when rotations are shortened to 8 players. Even less so for a coach that runs his starters nearly 40 mpg in the regular season. It would be a massive improvement because the Knicks have a one dimensional offense that‚Äôs primed to get exposed in the playoffs and no true playmakers to take over and keep the ball moving. Having 2 guys that keep the ball moving and who set up Randle and RJ for easy shots rather than repeatedly running those guys in iso would give the offense a plethora of different looks and with those guys you don‚Äôt lose anything defensively. The Knicks have the 9th worst offense in the NBA, Barrett making improvements isn‚Äôt going to move the needle. They need to get into the top 10 and have an easy avenue to do so.  It‚Äôs also not an either or scenario, im pretty confident they can bring in 2 max contracts AND extend a few of their free agents. But extending those guys to long term contracts will eat into cap space next offseason and prevent the signing of another game changing level player."
"You'd be leaving the entire floor open to drives from RJ, Barrett, and Quickley. Not even mentioning sucking up extra defenders inside to make up for capela's absence would give shooters like bullock opportunities from the corners.   Trae guarding the knicks PG's with no real defensive presence behind him (collins isn't terrible but he certainly isn't capela) seems like a recipe for disaster imo. In addition, anyone guarding randle is at the highest risk of picking up fouls, so you run the risk of clint getting into trouble since he may be more prone to fall for jumpshot fakes, which randle utilizes quite well."
I think you would probably give the slight edge to Barrett at this point but you could go either way.   The point is you‚Äôd be a fucking nut to take Kevin Porter over RJ Barrett today.
"I listened to that and then listened to the Dunc'd On pod where he listed out the following reasons:  1. Zion's agency not being happy with David Griffin following they treated JJ Redick (this is my inference), who is also a client of theirs 2. He had an awesome season, but the acquisitions they brought in were all bad 3. Things he's heard behind the scenes (vague) 4. David Griffin going out of his way to say something that was completely disprovable and ridiculous as a misguided effort to prove how much he loves Zion (believe he's referring to [these comments](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31406267/zion-williamson-indefinitely-fractured-left-ring-finger)) 5. Zion's own comments about NY where he said ""Yes, I'm glad you asked me that question"" about MSG and said he loved playing there when he had only played there once before in college 6. There was a lot of hope that he would go to NY before the lottery, his friend RJ Barrett is there instead and they presumably talk about playing in NY  He ends the rant with ""I can't remember ever a young star this early on in his career batting his eyes at another market like that"".  This is all from the second most recent pod, starts about 46 minutes in."
6 degrees between Bill Russell and RJ Barrett.
I tried RJ Barrett and Michael Jordan... dont think they have a connection. Cane up as 'Player Not Found'.  That was the only non connection of all the players I tried. This is fun.
"Monty Williams did a hell of a job . But it's gotta be thibs. Shame the man only won it once in Chicago. Dude whipped the Knicks into shape . That's what he does , they weren't open to it in Minnesota , that's their loss. He's a great fucking coach , culture changer , talent developer. I love what he did with that roster. I'm fan of the man since he was running the Celtics defense . RJ Barrett looking like he's gonna be legit two way star , like Jimmy Butler turned out to be . Julius Randle looking like the new Mr knick . Thibs is the man . I never forgave the bulls for firing him , it was always them and the Celtics for me , now I find it hard to root for the bulls , I even find the new regimes moves stupid. Still sour about that one. One more beer and I'm going to bed."
What the fuck are these people on about. What should I just golf clap when Draymond blocks the shit out of RJ Barrett and starts screaming?
Kevin Knox and Kevin Knox II separated by.....RJ Barrett.    What does this mean?
"Uh was it a draft scandal or just a conspiracy? I don't remember anything definitive about it ever coming to light. Even if that's the case, there's 35+ years of us getting nothing in the draft after that. Our best pick after that has been RJ Barrett at 3 when we had the best odds at #1. RJ's literally our only top 3 pick since Ewing"
"If the league was that dead-set on boosting New York, wouldn't they have given them Zion in the lottery instead of Barrett? I know that RJ is contributing to the Knicks now but if the league is *this* concerned with big markets, why has the ""lottery"" allowed the Wolves to pick #1OA so often?  It's more likely that the league schedules biased refs at opportune times with the purpose of having a level of control on the game but I don't see it extending beyond that."
RJ barrett
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
This and with RJ Barrett
"It‚Äôs a *little* bit sad, but its also kind of exciting at the same time, bc if/when the Knicks ever get a top 3 player in his prime (*especially* if it‚Äôs someone they draft) millions and millions of people will go totally fucking nuts and lose their minds on some citywide uncut gems vibe‚Äîwin *or* lose. I‚Äôm figuratively so here for it.   I‚Äôm a Sixers fan, but I lived in New York for a while, through Linsanity and some middling/decent Melo years during which basically no Knicks fans I met harbored any illusions about actually winning a title. But they did mostly gave a shit about the team and the league in general. They were all over the city, knicks fans, and there‚Äôs something stupidly charming about a city where you can have a conversation with somebody from pretty much any walk of life about, like, whether or not Steve Novak or Iman Shumpert are top 50 players in the league or not. I feel like those fans deserve maybe just some little sliver of hope ever now and then.  I *mostly* don‚Äôt believe in karma‚Ä¶ for the most part‚Ä¶ exceeept for maybe, justhearmeout, that of fucking course the guy who sells overpriced cable internet service while he pays 0 property taxes on Madison square garden and tours as JD and the Straight Shot won‚Äôt ever ever win a title. It wouldn‚Äôt be *fair,* goddammit. And fairness is one of the deepest fantasies of sports ‚Äî A world in which things are, at least occasionally, decided through some weird abstracted form of meritocracy.   But anyways, it *would* be super fun if, like RJ Barrett and Julius Randle somehow become the second coming of Westbrook and Durant or something similarly insane.That way the emotional stakes will be extra juiced when Embiid and Sixers knock em out of the playoffs en route to their multiple consecutive titles, heyooooo.   But seriously, that would create enough global pathos to wake the Cthulhu.   Hard not to root for that on some level."
"Luke's never had a stretch as bad as Fizdale at the Knicks though.   Fizdale went 21-83 with the Knicks and had the worst spacing in the league despite having Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Reggie Bullock who would all go on to shoot over 40% from deep the year after he left. He's not only a shit coach but he makes players significantly worse"
That would be RJ Barrett
Julius Randle and RJ Barrett
"Jimmy Butler is bad perimeter defender? May be RJ Barrett is better? NY run Barrett-Payton-Bullock on perimeter, dont tell me they are better than what we had.   Also, I like the confidence of NY fans. All credit to Thibs for changing the culture, but you guys were one of the worst teams for last 10 years while being in New York, city that all free agents want to come to. And dont tell me you all expected to be 5th before the season."
"I think the ""If he dies he dies"" award should be most minutes played instead of MPG. For example, Fred VanVleet (#2 on the MPG list) played 1899 minutes this year (68th on MP list). RJ barrett played 2511 minutes this year 2nd only to his teammate Randle. It's not surprising the top 2 guys in MP this season are Thibs guys, given his name on the award"
I love it when you talk to me about elite shooter RJ Barrett
"They‚Äôre really neck and neck imo. Don‚Äôt know if I can give one the edge tbh. The suns running the west is bananas.   But the Knicks also have had legitimately the most improbable and drastic single season turnaround i‚Äôve ever seen, with basically the same roster and the lowest payroll in the NBA. Their second highest paid player is RJ Barrett at $8m"
RJ Barrett is overrated and so is Julius Randle. I apologize to Knicks fans everywhere for another 10 years of mediocrity.
"If RJ barrett keeps clearing benchmarks at that rate he's gonna be so good when he's 40, shooting 80% from 3 while averaging 37 ppg"
RJ Barrett is also the only Canadian left handed 20 year old to ever shoot 40% from three in the NBA in 2021
RJ Barrett hasn't played many 38+ minute games since midseason. I don't know what caused Thibs to change his rotations but there was a drastic change... Well except that one blowout Knicks were up 30 and Barrett stayed in the 4th quarter...  Randle continues to play 40+ minute games.  It's never just about the MPG because blowouts drastically alter that stat. The issue (back when Thibs was on the wolves) was he played LaVine 40+ minutes on B2B and just as much when LaVine was injured.
KD is RJ Barrett lite confirmed
RJ Barrett
"For COTY, I feel like Thibs is more clearly a sign of the coaching than any of the other candidates (besides maybe Macmillan, but he showed up late).  The Suns ran through the bubble and then they got Chris Paul, so how much is coaching on that?  Up for debate (not saying Monty wouldn't deserve it though).  The Jazz have two top 3 6MOY guys and the DPOY, so is that on the coaching or was there core just already getting better?  We were garbage.  Most of this roster is the same as last year.  Thibs came in and we're the 4th seed and turned Julius ""bull in a china shop"" Randle into an All-NBA player.  He turned RJ Barrett into a sniper from deep.  I feel like Thibs' fingerprints are just more clearly on this resurgence than the other guys, but there are plenty of deserving coaches."
And he's going up against 40.1% from 3 this year RJ Barrett.
Did you guys not learn from RJ Barrett

"Lmao I thought RJ Barrett was a rookie for some reason, even though I know he's not because I never thought about him in my mind in the Lamelo/Haliburton/Ant convo."
"Future All-Star RJ Barrett also played all 72, tbf."
"Shout out to Julius Randle too, leading the nba in minutes this year along with RJ Barrett."
"RJ Barrett - 17-5-3 on 43% and 40% - 14 FGA - 4th Seed    Jayson Tatum - 15-6-2 on 45% and 37% - 13 FGA - 4th Seed   I ain't saying, I'm just saying"
Is Kawhi a reasonable comp for RJ Barrett (ceiling obviously)?  Is Kawhi that much more athletic than RJ?
RJ Barrett playing well and then getting iced in the 4thQ. Name a better duo. Anyway GG Boston lets go 4th seed!
"Yeah but how many situations are there like this where he can really be the star of the franchise.  The only other person on the knicks I can think of off of the top of my head is RJ Barrett. I know they have other solid players, but Randle was able to take them to another level this year."
RJ Barrett is going to be a star one day - rough start but he's getting after ittttt
Or RJ Barrett of all people
"Zion wasn‚Äôt actually definite number one heading to duke. His teammate, RJ Barrett, was arguably just as hyped. That he stomped everyone in college basically ended that.  Nonetheless if Zion had been in g league, he probably would have done the same thing and gotten paid for it (but less brand recognition)"
Who's to say RJ Barrett won't be better than Ingram eventually? He's made a nice jump this season.
Yoooo. The Hornets bench waved off the help defense on RJ Barrett and he just sonned all of them with a baseline spin into a floater. GTFO
Neither.  RJ Barrett will be better than both of them in 2 years.
"Every team would rather play the Knicks than the Heat or Hawks. Sorry but Julius Randle and RJ Barrett are not scaring anyone. I'll get downvoted because of the Knicks circlejerk in here, but in 2 weeks when the Knicks get swept in round 1 ya'll will see what I meant."
"Raps fans screaming about Dwayne Casey putting CJ Miles on Kevin Love years ago, but they fail to realize it's because of D-Rozan. Right now he's defending RJ Barrett rather than Rundle who is being defended by Lonzo.  D-Rozan game-worst starter +/- at -10 right now."
RJ Barrett man
