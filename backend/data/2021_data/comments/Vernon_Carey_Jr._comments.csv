&gt; Vernon Carey JR  who
"we were never taking him, just wanted to squeeze picks out of LAC. One of those 2nds got us Vernon Carey Jr so I like it"
"CALL VERNON CAREY JR UP AND START HIM, i knew he was killin it for the swarm but i had no idea he was leading in ppg"
"people who are talking about it as a straight-up bridges for sga swap are missing that another clippers pick became vernon carey jr, national freshman of the year, acc rookie of the year, first team all-acc, averaging a block and a half a game for duke. i believe carey is on the hornets' g-league affiliate rn but when he comes back up he'll be a very good piece for them, mark my words."
I thought Vernon Carey Jr. wasn’t really all that good. Did I miss something?
And he did get a 2nd from us that turned into Vernon Carey jr.  It is early but he should have a nice impact.
"June 21, 2018: Traded Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to the Los Angeles Clippers for Miles Bridges, a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Vernon Carey Jr. was later selected) and a 2021 2nd round draft pick. (CHO's 2020 2nd-rd pick from LAC is CLE's pick.)"
"**Skill Boost**: Miles Bridges. Bridges has developed a really good jumpshot and really good defense. If he had a better handle he’d probably be a perennial All-Star.   **Athleticism Boost**: LaMelo Ball. He’s not bad athletically, but a more athletic LaMelo would be pretty similar to LeBron...  **Length Boost**: PJ Washington. He’s been our best defensive center this season, but is a little small to play the position full time. If he added a few inches in height he’d be able to play the position full time and would fix our biggest weakness.   **Other Contenders:** A 6’4”-5” Terry Rozier would be a beast. A 6’7” Malik Monk has a lot of potential. An athletic Vernon Carey Jr would be a really good rookie. If the 6’10” McDaniels had a really good handle and playmaking he’d be super interesting, especially since he’s already a good shooter."
And let's not forget that Graham was a second rounder. Vernon Carey Jr. and Jalen McDaniels both show potential as well.

"How is Vernon Carey Jr. not number one? I’m tired of big markets like Minnesota getting all the hype.   Just kidding, Ant is the truth. This draft is already looking much better than it was made out to be. I think there’ll be multiple perennial All Stars in LaMelo/Ant/Haliburton and some really strong starters."
"This is pretty misleading.    The three second rounders were Grant Riller (PG), Vernon Carey Jr (C) and Nick Richards (C)   Riller has barely played any minutes and as one of the last picks in the draft he is likely very raw.  Graham, Rozier, Monk, Wanamaker and a Martin in front of him makes sense if the team is trying to be competitive. If it's garbage time the HC has gone with two-way player Nate Darling, whom I would assume is closer to being ready for minutes than Riller is.    The Martin problem: Cody Martin has been a decent bench guy throughout the season and has no reason to be replaced by Riller or Darling at any competitive moment of basketball.  There was an in-depth writeup on this on /r/CharlotteHornets the other day.    Caleb Martin, the UDFA Martin, is quite raw but has shown flashes.  He just came off a 15-10-3 game against the Lakers, one of the best teams in the NBA.  I could still see Caleb being significantly better than Darling/Riller at any competitive stages of basketball.    Bismack Biyombo may have stone hands but he is the only defensive player and true rim protector  the team has in the front court. If there's anyone on the roster that even has a chance to attempt to slow down the other team's best bigs it's going to be Biyombo.  Throwing out Vernon Carey (who I really believe in) or Nick Richards at this point will get them eaten alive on the defensive end in the paint, while still allowing the shooters to drop buckets from 3 as we've seen all season.    I do think we will see some of these players in the closing weeks, and really there is no point not to because the Hornets players are dropping fast, but to say that there's no reason why these second rounders haven't played is just inaccurate."
Vernon Carey jr. big strong guy who can shoot from range. Slightly more well known but I think miles bridges would be a strong bet to get one aswell
"Depending on what we do at C, Vernon Carey Jr. I thought this pre-draft as well but I think he's a lot more skilled than people realize."
"By gawd, that's Vernon Carey Jr.'s music!!!"
"We got rid of Zeller and Biz, and now have Miles Plumlee, two young centers we drafted last year (Vernon Carey Jr and Nick Richards), small ball PJ at the 5, and Kai Jones.   So I'd say it's improved a fair bit, but it's not amazing. I'm expecting bigger things for Richards and VCJ this year. We'll probably be alright."
"I just don’t get the average defense. I hear Suns fans say it a lot but I can’t see how he’s around the 50th percentile by my eye test or the stats.  For the regular season, epm put him in the 28th percentile of the league with -1.1 making him 360th of 511 in the league. Other 28th percentile guys included Vernon Carey Jr., Jeff Green, Sato. and Okoro. He was 511th in defensive Lebron out of 539 with a -1.58 this past regular season. He didn’t play enough to qualify for their overall playoffs metric (combined multiple postseasons for a better sample size).  His best ever defensive bpm was -1.1 this years playoffs and his best for the regular season was -1.3 in 19-20. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify, he was 77th tied with Rondo His -1.5 in the regular season put him 155th at worst 159th (bballref sorts by the rounded numbers not the ones that go past the hundredth place) tied with CJ, Fox, Joe Harris, and Shamet.  His best stat is d-Raptor which is -0.5 for the full season (regular and playoffs since they recommend at least 1000 minutes for stable results) putting him at 153rd of 250 players. He did very very well in the playoffs with a plus 2 putting him at 27th of 100 qualifying players. That really brought his numbers up because he was at -1.5 for the regular season tied with Garland and Hield for 195th out of 249th."
No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
"&gt;I live in constant fear of not spending enough time talking about NBA players who should be talked about more, or not respecting players enough who aren't getting enough respect or are even being disrespected  Vernon Carey Jr in tears that r/nba aint giving him the respect he deserves"
"&gt; Then it’s a rather pointless discussion isn’t it?   I made that clear in a comment down below that is rather pointless, but certain players have certain skill sets that they can or cannot develop due to some limitation. Not everyone is equal.  &gt; Nothing was stopping Thabeet from reaching the potential than a second overall pick except himself.  Agreed, but his ceiling is higher/lower than other players in his class based on specific skill sets, physical limitations, ability to read the game etc.  James Wiseman might be a guy who can be a positive impact player, but there are reasons why he was taken 2 and Vernon Carey Jr was a 2nd round pick. I would say Wiseman’s ceiling is significantly higher than Carey even if they both end up as busts.  Kawhi shot 7 ppg on 25% from 3 in 24 min the first 20 games of his rookie year, and no one here would have told you he has superstar potential from the first 20 games."
Vernon Carey Jr has got to be the only guy with a +0. Or -0 depending how you look at it.  And how the fuck is Luka so low?! Damn!
"I agree, which is why it's so baffling why Nick Richards is getting so few minutes and Kai Jones has yet to see the floor. Idk, maybe they're hoping Vernon Carey Jr. will bloom. He's in the G league rn"
