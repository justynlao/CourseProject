"I can see Rodney McGruder getting a run with the 76ers considering the history with Doc Rivers.  Contrary to popular belief, he's actually been solid when given minutes this season - it would make sense for a contender to pick him up as a spark plug off the bench."
Lmao. He‚Äôs talking about Rodney McGruder.
"the ghost of rodney ""dame time"" mcgruder still lives rent free in his head..."
Rodney McGruder &gt; some G leaguer I‚Äôm hearing of for the first time
i‚Äôve had it with the disrespect to Rodney McGruder on here smdh
Lmao he had no chill when he was destroying Rodney Mcgruder earlier this season üòÇ
I‚Äôll try for our team:  ‚Ä¢ Jerami Grant ‚Ä¢ Mason Plumlee ‚Ä¢ Saddiq Bey ‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart ‚Ä¢ Wayne Ellington ‚Ä¢ Dennis Smith Jr. ‚Ä¢ Saben Lee ‚Ä¢ Josh Jackson ‚Ä¢ Frank Jackson ‚Ä¢ Rodney Mcgruder
"Currently as they are they will have about $1 to $2 million only. But they can free up $15 million because Corey Joseph only has $2 million of his $12 million dollar salary guaranteed and Rodney McGruder has $5 million non-guaranteed. Not guaranteeing both frees up $15 million. They also have Josh Jackson and Okafor who add up to $7 million in expiring contracts that could be easily moved if they needed more. If they really wanted him, they wouldn't have a tough time creating the cap space."
Klay just has to come to grips with the fact Rodney McGruder has outscored him now two years running
"Damn, meanwhile Rodney McGruder is walking around just fine, squatting to pick things up, jogging down the road and shit  Living his best life"
Rodney McGruder
Should have been Rodney McGruder I agree
tbh i think we did get comments that we were deep last season.  one game i vividly remember was when we [defeated portland with our third stringers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRe2oYnznM&amp;ab_channel=ESPN) when Rodney McGruder got a go-ahead basket with 26s left in the game.
Unless you're Rodney Mcgruder
He also made fun of Klay‚Äôs injuries when Klay attacked Rodney Mcgruder.
"You know, I think we probably tanked to avoid the Lakers, too(and don‚Äôt really think it matters either way, dunno why you do), but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs impossible that rest was more the goal here anyway. We have a deep rotation this year, and not playing guys and giving them rest for the last two games of the regular season which were pretty meaningless anyway, especially in a season that saw some serious injuries this year. Like we rested like 10 guys. We‚Äôve basically played everyone we‚Äôve rested those games.   And hey, what if jay scrubb or otoru popped off? They hadn‚Äôt had any opportunity resembling that in the nba before. Rodney mcGruder did against Portland the year before in a game we were similarly tanking against.   , the Lakers still almost lost the first play in game to the warriors, that came down to a pretty bad illegal screen call on draymond. If the Lakers hypothetically beat the 9 seed grizzlies, we‚Äôd of ended up in the same bracket anyway."
"Nah, the god tier shit was last year when we somehow ended up beating the trailblazers in an apparent do or die for them lead by Rodney McGruder"
"Ahh yes the super team roster of Rodney McGruder, Joahkim Noah, JayMychal Green, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George(who was injured mostly), Lou Will, Trezz and Bev Is equivalent to having KD/Kyrie/Harden and Blake fucking griffin. Before that we had zero stars."

"1 three a game but yeah lol. They tried to give him a chance and the dude was just bad, and clearly didn‚Äôt show up in practice cause Spo loves dudes who ball out in practice even if they don‚Äôt in game (source, Rodney McGruder)  I really wanted him to work out but he just didn‚Äôt."
"Denver don't have Rodney McGruder, so you should be safe."
Just a cocky a player who thinks he's better than he is lol. Like the 16 finals and whining when he got snubbed from all nba 3rd. The shit he said about Rodney Mcgruder was just so goofy too.  &gt;lol ok. any reason why you think that ?  The only REALLY good team they've defeated without KD are the 16 Thunder.
~~Zapruder~~ Rodney McGruder Film
Lakers are at 110m if Harrell declines option. I think they're fine and this narrative of them having no space is overblown. I know pistons players salary better than the rest of the league and am waiting to see which team looking for extra space trades for Corey Joseph (12.4m/2.4m guaranteed) or Rodney Mcgruder (5m/0 guaranteed) plenty of guys like that around the league and they may not have to give up anything of real value for immediate cap space or relief. I suspect the Lakers are competing with teams looking for tax relief who may be willing to give up a late first instead of 2nd round picks since tax teams prefer cheap 2nd rounders to fill out the roster.
"True that. Spo never got his respect until years after Lebron left.. which blows my mind given he took teams led by Dion Waiters to the playoffs multiple times, AFTER he just won 2 titles.   I don‚Äôt believe any other coach could have averaged &gt;.500 over the years Lebron/Wade/Bosh left with the talent left on those Heat rosters (Luke Babbitt, Rodney McGruder, Hassan Whiteside, Justise Winslow‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad)  I‚Äôd put Spo in a higher tier as far as coaches goes but I do think Lue is finally getting his respect as a very good coach, which is nice to see."
Rodney McGruder destroyed the blazers in that apparent must win game we were trying super hard to lose
Put some respect on Rodney ‚ÄúVictory Cigar‚Äù McGruder
"Rodney McGruder, he was literally our worst player and OP adds him like he‚Äôs part of our big 3"
"Pistons PR official twitter posted a random Jaden McDaniels gif  Twolves fans, are you ready for RODNEY MCGRUDER TAKEOVER???????!!"
Ain‚Äôt nobody scared of no damn Rodney McGruder
Oh no! Not Rodney McGruder!!!!!
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
"Their scouting and player development is solid; they find hidden gems not only in the draft but in the pool of undrafted players. Their G-League program keeps churning out rotation players (Rodney McGruder, Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, Duncan Robinson). They seem to get the best out of guys, even revitalizing discarded veterans (Wayne Ellington, Dewayne Dedmon, Birdman, Anthony Mason had his only All-Star year with the Heat). They employ a lot of their former players: Anthony Carter, Keith Askins, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Chris Quinn, Shane Battier, Malik Allen, Caron Butler, Kasib Powell."
Rodney McGruder.   Can't even bend a spoon telekinetically.
Rodney Mcgruder
Rodney McGruder.
Except Rodney McGruder and Zach Collins
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"apparently not far off because the first ""what do people search"" suggestion on google is ""what happened to rodney mcgruder"" lmao"
"The Rodney McGruder comments, as well, were extremely disrespectful, imo. He got off easy with that."
Yea he‚Äôs a bit too loose with his mouth lol. Tells it like it is. I remember when he said Rodney mcgruder would be out the league soon on tv haha
"&gt;Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney   I strongly disagree with this. I think the 5 players would win.   The thing about these star players is that they force help defense from a second defender and create an imbalance. Defending them is about weighing up stopping them vs creating the imbalance.   If you have an extra player then you can help out while everybody else stays home.   And the 5 will get an open shot at the other end almost every time down."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
Who he play for?  1. Derrick Favors 2. E'twaun Moore 3. Denzel Valentine 4. Rodney Mcgruder 5. Aaron Holiday
Only fan base that might not be a fan of him is the Pistons since there was some sort of beef with Rodney McGruder. Everyone else should be rockin with Juan T.
"Rodney McGruder. I know he was a bench warmer for the clippers but now that I think of it, I couldn‚Äôt tell you where he is without looking it up."
Rodney McGruder too
TIL Rodney Mcgruder is still in the NBA.
Respect to Draymond for this because it was pathetic seeing him and Klay just punching down on Rodney McGruder of all people.
Why are they ducking Tough Guy Rodney McGruder
Draymond is ducking Rodney McGruder.
Glad to see Rodney McGruder is still in the NBA
"Awaiting the return of his Splash Brother, Klay Alexander Thompson following a lengthy sabbatical, Prince of no dribbles, Master of Boats, the Chillest, fellow holder of 3 rings, affectionately known as the 77th Knight of the realm, instant buckets Specialist, and Best Friend of Rocco and everyone not named Rodney McGruder."
Spo had teams led by Dion Waiters and Rodney McGruder making the playoffs. People aren't ready to see how good that second unit is once Oladipo is back  &amp;#x200B;  Strus-Herro-Oladipo-Morris-Dedmon is an insane lineup off the bench
"Do any Pistons fans hate the way Dwayne Casey deals with rotations in these less than competitive games? I would rather see the actual important potential franchise cornerstone players get 30+ minutes, even in blowouts, and have a shot at building more chemistry than muck about with minutes for guys like Rodney McGruder, Trey Lyles, and Frank Jackson."
&gt; Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.   cmon
Yeah so if Wayne Ellington could not sink 8 3s and if Rodney McGruder could be who Klay Thompson thinks he is that‚Äôd be great. We‚Äôre trying to lose around here.
&gt; Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.  are you smoking crack j/w
"Looks like it‚Äôs either Otto Porter for Drummond plus a 2nd or something or Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.  Idk if Jerami Grant is going anywhere but other than Blake Griffin there‚Äôs no way to get the salaries to match. I would like to see Grant in a Cavs jersey, really fits this team well. Especially if we are... trading Cedi üò¢üò¢"
"At least this will be a loss to a worthy opponent. I can't believe we got tripled doubled by both Plumlee and DSJ, allowed 8 threes by Wayne Ellington, and let Rodney fucking McGruder and Saben Lee (whoever the fuck that is) each drop 20"

Rodney McGruder sends his regard
"&gt;Because apparently, you did not.  But I literally quoted the comment referencing it below this comment along with an explanation. You were saying something about reading comprehension a comment ago, right? I suggest you take your own advice.   &gt;Now you're clinging to the idea that I made a value judgement about who was right... I did not  If you frame the events in a way that clearly shows bias to one side, you might as well as have made a judgement. It's possible I interpreted your comment wrong, judging by the voting on our comments, more people agreed with interperating.   &gt;If you feel that summary is inaccurate, you really ought to find a better way to address it than shrieking incoherently about narratives and subjectivity and accusing people of bias when you apparently can't even decipher what the person who so offended your sensibilities even said.  C'mon, man. I thought you were the reading comprehension master. You can't seriously tell me that you interperted any of my comments in this chain as ""shrieking."" I've given zero indication with my diction, punctuation, or letter case that my comment was meant to be read as anything but neutral tone. As for ""incoherent,"" it stands to reason that you wouldn't be replying the way you are if my comments were incoherent.   &gt;What I'm not going to to is act like McGruder was 100% in the right without more information, so... you're not going to get what you wanted from me.  I have my own personal opinion on who was in the right in this particular situation, but that's really irrelevant to the point I'm making; If you're going to ignore OP's specific question and instead give a recap on the sequence of events, do it in a way that lays out the facts in their relevant entirety instead of that half-baked and, yes, biased shit you used. Something like this:  'McGreuder confronted Toscano-Anderson  because he took offense to something Toscano-Anderson said to Ellington; Klay, who was talking on the broadcast said something along the lines of 'Rodney would be out fo the league soon;' those comments promoted Big Baby to respond. """
"Well Nick Friedell who I understand was at the arena reported that ""Rodney McGruder just went all the way down near the Warriors tunnel after the game and was yelling at some Warriors players as they made their way off the floor. He had to be pushed back a couple times by Pistons staffers because he was getting heated.""    McGruder being aggressive matches up with the commentary live where the Warriors broadcasters were asking what was going on as they clearly saw an issue on the court.    Then there is the fact that no one is claiming mcgruder was just asking Warrior vets to chill Toscano-Anderson out (especially since the person he was talking to was Toscano-Anderson with the Klay / Draymond/etc. having to ask what was going on/what happened).  We're not hearing from the Pistons (anonymous or on the record) that the McGruder wasn't being aggressive.  Nor are we hearing anything from any of the reporters who were at the arena indicating anything different.    But yeah, the partial video that's available totally shows nothing happened."
Indeed. See the bleeding hearts club deriding Klay for saying Rodney Mcgruder will be out of the league soon.
"&gt; Again though, this approach makes perfect sense in a world when the shit talk is restricted to guys that actually got on the court. If we opening it up to dudes that don't even dress *and we know will never be on the court*, it seems illogical to want McGruder to handle it on the court.   Not gonna lie, this makes me really curious on what JTA actually said that made it really important to McGruder to come at him after the game. Like this dude doesn't even play, why is Rodney giving him the time of day?  &gt;...which is fine, but I think that what is considered ""basketball trash talk"" is generally limited to people that actually played in the game or, at the very least, dudes that actually dressed.   &gt;   &gt;If you want to give some leeway to include guys that didn't even dress, then ok, but I think we should probably give similar leeway to someone that talked shit 30 seconds after the game ended.  Agree. But at the same time, if you continue on talking trash after the game has ended then it's not unprofessional if some comes at you during the same timeframe like what Klay did.  &gt; Again, this goes back to the issue with two different standards. Yeah, I'm generally all for the idea of ""settle any shit talk on the court before the final buzzer."" It can be kind of hard to settle shit on the court during the game though *with a dude that was never on the court.*   &gt;   &gt;So, to me, you either need to restrict this approach to guys that actually get in the game (or, at the very least, have a *chance* to get in the game) or you need to give players a little leeway for people to do what McGruder did.  Makes sense. I'm all for this approach too, but at the same time if you decide to do it you better be ready for whatever talk comes to you during the time you were doing it. Which is why I'm against Dray's comments but not Klay's.  &gt; Judging ""right"" and ""wrong"" is probably more than we should be doing. What I would say though it that what I think Klay did was substantially different. Even if you not 100% happy with how he did it, McGruder went up to the guy he had a problem with and said what he had to say to his face without doing anything to try to put the shit out publicly.   &gt;   &gt;That's about the opposite of what Klay did. If Klay had gone down to the court in person 20-30 seconds afterwards and said what he said to McGruder's face, I would view it much differently.  How far is Klay's seat from the court anyways? It would've been better if Klay did go down, but I personally don't think it was a big deal if Klay said it from the commentator's booth. If he were Jim for example it would've been a big no-no but Jim's a professional commentator. And during games it's not like players try to hide their trash talk and probably don't care if other people heard it."
"&gt;Just feels like two different standards. I mean, it wasn't like McGruder came over 30-40 minutes after the game. Wasn't it more like 30-40 seconds after the whistle?  Well fwiw I don't think Draymond's postgame presser was warranted too. I just think that basketball trash talk should remain during the game itself. And if you're spilling it to after the game then sure go ahead but you're opening yourself for some more trash talk (Klay).  &gt;When you acting like something 20-30 seconds after the final whistle is a completely different animal than something 5 seconds *before* the final whistle, I get the impression that you are drawing pretty hard lines and boundaries.  I think it's different because allowing this shit talking to linger some time after the game leads to these guys to take cheap shots during the postgame presser because reporters ask about it and you get something like Draymond's response. But even then, there's a difference between some trash talk after the game and going over to the opponent's bench just to start something up. Like when the team's heading back to their tunnel it's pretty much over.  &gt;See what I'm saying? I'm fine with the idea of ""well yeah, he wasn't dressed and wasn't playing, but he is part of the org, so it's sort of the same thing as players talking shit during the game"" but then I'd think we'd give McGruder a little leeway to say something in the first minute after the game ends.  Definitely. As I said, if Rodney wants to talk after the game then go ahead. I personally think there's a difference between running over to a team's tunnel and just having a heated moment on the court right after the game, but disregarding that, at its most basic, talking trash generally leads to some other guy talking back, and it just so happens to be Klay. I don't think McGruder did anything really wrong aside from COVID protocols, but neither did Klay imo.  &gt;...but Toscano literally *didn't* play and *didn't* compete in that game. If we going to be flexible enough to treat a guy that *didn't* play and *didn't* complete like he *did* play and compete, I'd think we could be flexible enough to give McGruder a minute of leeway.  Same thing for me. I'm not saying McGruder was really wrong, but I also don't think Klay was wrong. The issue I actually have with this is Draymond and Big Baby's statements. One was petty and the other a real below the belt cheap shot.  &gt;Agreed, but Toscano on the bench talking shit in street clothes when has only dressed once in the past \~15 games isn't a good look either.  Agreed, it's not. But that doesn't make either JTA or McGruder objectively wrong imo, just that talking heads' and Dray's responses made it even worse than it actually was."
"&gt;Toscano is part of the Warriors though.  Just feels like two different standards. I mean, it wasn't like McGruder came over 30-40 minutes after the game. Wasn't it more like 30-40 seconds after the whistle?   When you acting like something 20-30 seconds after the final whistle is a completely different animal than something 5 seconds *before* the final whistle, I get the impression that you are drawing pretty hard lines and boundaries.  To me, if we talking about shit talk during the confines of the game, and we drawing hard lines and boundaries, I'd think that guys that aren't even dressed would be considered outside the game.  See what I'm saying? I'm fine with the idea of ""well yeah, he wasn't dressed and wasn't playing, but he is part of the org, so it's sort of the same thing as players talking shit during the game"" but then I'd think we'd give McGruder a little leeway to say something in the first minute after the game ends.  &gt; And your personal standards may not think that it doesn‚Äôt apply, but players in street clothes talking trash isn‚Äôt the rarest thing in the NBA.   Neither is talking that happens after the final whistle.  &gt; They‚Äôre still competitors playing for a team...  ...but Toscano literally *didn't* play and *didn't* compete in that game. If we going to be flexible enough to treat a guy that *didn't* play and *didn't* complete like he *did* play and compete, I'd think we could be flexible enough to give McGruder a minute of leeway.  &gt;...but Rodney going over to the Dubs bench after the game wasn‚Äôt a good look either.   Agreed, but Toscano on the bench talking shit in street clothes when has only dressed once in the past \~15 games isn't a good look either."
‚ÄúI know ain‚Äôt nobody scared of no Rodney McGruder.‚Äù  The lack of basic grammar is shocking.
&gt; If Rodney McGruder took offense it obviously hit too close to home and he should accept that they‚Äôre right or work harder and prove them wrong  This fuckin sub man
if rodney mcgruder is a nobody then what are you? aren‚Äôt you talking shit right now?  also ‚Äúcraptalking‚Äù lmao
Rodney McGruder can buy and sell your entire family tree.
Klay said something in the heat of the moment while it was actually transpiring. He just happened to be mic‚Äôd up. I don‚Äôt understand why there needs to be ‚Äúsides‚Äù. Obviously I‚Äôm with Klay but I don‚Äôt think any different of Rodney Mcgruder
"Not really, Rodney McGruder has every right to feel disrespected. Too bad he‚Äôs still a scrub on a losing team."
Ngl I don't really know who Rodney McGruder is
"&gt; Was Rodney McGruder exhibiting professionalism when he went over the Warriors bench and instigated a confrontation? Why are you only focusing on Klay's response to that incident, in which he publicly defends a teammate by insulting the offender.  Of course not. Nowhere did I say McGruder was being reasonable. He was being even more unprofessional. Didn't think that such an obvious thing needed to be said.   The question I responded to was ""What did I expect?"", not ""What about McGruder"".  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; I know that you don't set the expectations for how NBA players should act  We all expect adults to behave with some modicum of professionalism at whatever job they're doing."
"I'm biased, but I laughed out loud at ""psh Rodney, ain't nobody scared of no fucking Rodney McGruder"""
How else can all these kiddos earn upvotes? It‚Äôs not like they actually watch any basketball. They must comment 700 times on a post that is hardly basketball related to white Knight for  fucking Rodney McGruder I guess
"&gt;""Well, the Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you!"" &gt; &gt;~ Rodney McGruder, ~~2 hours later~~ in the locker room shower"
I dont know but you are Rodney McGruder
This whole post is soft as fuck. Rodney mcgruder is the type of guy to send a comeback the next day. And Wayne Ellington is lame for not handling his own
"God this entire 'drama' is so fucking stupid. r/nba is seriously grasping at straws sometimes, like 99% of the people crying for pOoR rOdNeY mCgRuDeR literally never even heard of the dude until a couple days ago."
&gt; no repercussions or having to face the music  What repercussions do you think Klay should face for making fun of Rodney McGruder?
I don‚Äôt get the big deal. If Rodney McGruder took offense it obviously hit too close to home and he should accept that they‚Äôre right or work harder and prove them wrong. They‚Äôre just talking shit I‚Äôm sure Draymond and KLAY didn‚Äôt premeditate this before the game just to pick on him. Shit happens move on
Rodney McGruder would kick Klay Thompsons ass
"yeah but all shade aside, him and draymond were in the right here. Trying to start shit after the game is over 2 hours after the incident is straight clown shit. Maybe they didn't have to be so disrespectful but how are we not criticizing rodney mcgruder for that dumb shit."
Imagine If rodney mcgruder started the first NBA civil war but on Twitter and it's all subtle messaging or likes on less important players making accusations.
"""Well, the Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you!""  ~ Rodney McGruder, 2 hours later"
so it's ok to punch down when someone does something u dont like? where is this energy with rodney mcgruder &amp; klay lol
"Nope, the Warriors were all drinking milk and saying their prayers when big, bad Rodney McGruder sauntered over to bully them."
"I know that you don't set the expectations for how NBA players should act.  Was Rodney McGruder exhibiting professionalism when he went over the Warriors bench and instigated a confrontation? Why are you only focusing on Klay's response to that incident, in which he publicly defends a teammate by insulting the offender."
"totally! especially after the bad taste that draymond and klay left in my mouth last night from going in on rodney mcgruder so hard, it‚Äôs nice to see some of the mentorship and respect from stars to other players."
It‚Äôs going to be hilarious when Klay comes back as a glorified Rodney Mcgruder.
"The cadence on ""no one is scared of no damn Rodney McGruder"" is perfect old man talking."
"of course he is...  Why is Dray any ""tougher"" than rodney mcgruder? Because he kicks people in the balls and gets a lot of Techs? Really?"
When the dust settles nobody will remember anyone‚Äôs beef with Rodney mcgruder
For a bunch of superstars Klay and Draymond are super sensitive about Rodney McGruder.
Woah there. We still don't know which 5 years Pat Bev has. Who's to say those 5 years would be within this decade? Just how long will Rodney Mcgruder wait? Lol.
"It doesn't match up with Draymond interview though, he said McGruder was trying to defend Ellington for something JTA said in the 1st quarter. I don't think Rodney went to search JTA in the tunnel to ask for his gf digits"
Incoming MIP season from Rodney McGruder.

the brotherhood between Wayne Ellington and Rodney McGruder started this whole beef. The Heat are always there
‚ÄúWhen the fuck did Rodney McGruder become the tough guy for their team?‚Äù - Draymond Green
"He was sticking up for his teammate apparently. If you watched Draymonds interview here, Draymond said Wayne Ellington told Rodney Mcgruder that Juan said something to him in the 1st or 2nd quarter. Rodney then confronted Juan after the game."
