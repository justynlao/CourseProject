2013 Derrick rose could guard Danny green
Derrick rose and just take myself to the bench in game 1 of 2012 playoffs
"Peak Jason, Kidd, and Derrick rose didn’t have jumpers, but they became better shooters later in their careers. Magic, rondo, and simmons were always below average. Tony Parker and penny hardaway would probably be considered bad shooters, but it can go either way."
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

"Cant guard a fire hydrant.    Hold up. Derrick rose left with a fade, and came back with DREADS!"
Derrick Rose said it was most of the league. Then Adam Silver made him walk it back.
"LeBron didn't win the 2010-11 season MVP because the Heat despite being a superteam were the 2nd seed in the East and Derrick Rose barely had worse counting stats than LeBron. (1.7 less pts, 0.6 less steals and virtually the same assist numbers)   The Harden case is different as it assumes that the Nets will eventually pass the Sixers and claim the 1st seed and Embiid will have missed too many games. (And Harden still won't win MVP I can bet my savings on that)"
"You're telling me this swole ass battletoad looking mother fucker brought the ball up court, drove and pulled a hesi to poster dunk like he baron davis/Derrick rose/Russell Westbrook?"
LoL true wasn’t Derrick Rose with adidas having all those ankle problems.
"While I agree that the MVP has usually gone to the top 1-2 teams in the past 20 years and that Westbrook's MVP was an outlier when it came to his team's record, Westbrook was #1 in PER that season and the person who has been #1 in PER has been MVP the last 10 out of 12 seasons. Only Derrick Rose, in 2011, won MVP outside of the top 3 in PER (#9). Anthony Davis topped the league in PER but Steph Curry (#3) won MVP in 2015."
"No, not if we're just talking about the regular season.   Aside from the Derrick Rose year (when people hated LBJ for the decision), LeBron has never had a claim to the MVP."
"It very well can switch. People get emotional in the heat of the moment. After everything settles and people think more rationally, they might realize that Harden gave a lot to that organization and he didn’t really betray anybody. The stories about him helping during the power outages and freeze help a lot. Harden still calls Houston home.   Derrick Rose was boo’d his first time back at the UC and he was traded! Brady even got hate after he decided to leave New England. Dust settles, people come around. It’s not that strange."
"Actually you know what... we’ll give you Alec burks, taj gibson, Obi toppin and Derrick Rose for Jamal Murray... deal?"
Derrick Rose was never at any point the best offensive player in the league
"Meet James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Dirk and Derrick Rose!"
shout out to derrick rose
It's even crazier when you realize Jeremy Lin had elite combine stats. Talking Derrick Rose/John Wall level speed.
"Zion's touch around the basket gives you Tony parker, Derrick Rose kinda vibes. Just so crafty, always finds a way to finish no matter the angle."
"His argument is that he played better.  * Lebron James - 26.7 points on 59.4 TS%, 7.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.6 steals, 0.6 blocks, .244 WS/48 * Derrick Rose - 25.0 points on 55.0 TS%, 4.1 rebounds, 7.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.6 blocks, .208 WS/48.  I don't care that Lebron lost the MVP that year and am happy that Rose won it, but Lebron has a clear statistical case over Rose that year."
MVP Derrick Rose
"By this metric no one had any g-damn right beating a 2017 Cavaliers team with LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, and Richard Jefferson"
"When Lynn was drafted/undrafted/came into the NBA, he had a better lateral, 3/4 quart sprint, and benchpress then Derrick Rose John Wall and Russell Westbrook. The man was incredibly athletic but… He lacked a vertical wingspan and skin melanin  By the way… Jimmy Butler is probably the most athletic player drafted in the last 10 years off his combine statistics don’t @ me"
"No, you were saying he was unathletic and that he just got attention because he's Asian.  That's literally the whole point Lin was making about racism in the NBA stupid. Only you're creating this narrative that people are saying he's a 30-10 guy, nobody ever said that.  At one point in his career he was as fast as John Wall, that's it.  That doesn't mean he's the next Michael Jordan or Derrick Rose"

Derrick Rose with Payton out and the Knicks weekend back-to-back. Bucks only have 1 game left this week after tonight.
Those in glass houses should not throw stones... Especially when the key piece to the Porzingas trade got you an over the hill Derrick Rose....
"Wait, Derrick Rose started the game?? damn shoulda watched it. looked like he ballin like it was 2010"
He got dem Derrick rose knees?
I love you Derrick Rose!
"Drafting Frank over Donovan Mitchell. And he can't use the ""no one knew Mitchell would be this good"" excuse, with multiple people in the FO banging on the table for us to draft him.  Forcing the triangle  Hiring Fisher and Hornecek  Running Melo out of town  The Derrick Rose trade was pretty bad  The aforementioned Noah contract  Drafting KP, and deciding to trade KP when they could have gotten a haul for him were probably his only good moves."
"So Cleveland traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose, and 2 seconds for George Hill and Rodney Hood? In retrospect I wouldn’t do that"
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
Homer pick: Brandon Roy  Non-homer pick: Derrick Rose or Grant Hill
"They prob don't know what to do with him. He is not a big and lanky Point guard just hoisting threes, he is not a complete two way Wing, he is not a dominant Center like Embiid and Jokic, both pretty good on both ends of the court. Zion is basically a power-guard. Not a point-forward and def not SG/SF. He looks like some unholy amalgamation of Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp and Derrick Rose."
Derrick Rose had his prime from age 20 to 24. You never know what a player's actual prime will be
Derrick rose
"For sure, Derrick Rose."
"To me, Derrick Rose is a good comp for Walton. He played 4 years pre-injury, including the last 2 at an MVP calibre level, and then his career was entirely different. Would anyone seriously argue Rose is the #2 GOAT in Chicago? I don't think so. (This comp falls apart because MJ was there.) But how many franchises would put Rose's accomplishments in CHI higher than their GOAT? Not many, I would think."
"Mitchell-Sexton is basically a tossup in my eyes. Sextons a tad more efficient while Mitchell’s a bit higher volume. Ultimately I went with Sexton since I think being in the jazz system helps Mitchell out a ton while every Cavs opponent is laser focused on stopping Collin. The numbers aren’t particularly close on any of the other guys though.   Idk if I underrate jazz players, since I’d go to bat for Rudy as a top 6-7 player above Lillard and Doncic. I just happen to think a big part of why Rudy is underrated is because Mitchell is overrated, like most leading scorers on defensive teams tend to be, from IT to AI to Derrick Rose. The latter two were great players but should never have won MVP and Isaiah didn’t make all nba either of his title winning seasons for a reason."

"He finished 4th, Blake Griffin was 3rd. But like you said they weren't realistically in the MVP conversation, no one was actually picking them over KD or Lebron. Post-Shaq the only times a big man was legitimately in the MVP conversation through the whole season were the year Dirk won and the year Dwight was runner-up to Derrick Rose.   But since Shaq actually retired I don't think a big man has gotten a single 1st-place vote for MVP, this could be the first time in a decade."
Derrick Rose fell hard.  I hate that you have to slam on the ground to draw that charge.
Knicks GOAT Derrick Rose.
"Fan votes actually don't mean shit. Klay Thompson, who has played exactly 0 minutes in the NBA this season got more than 200k and was 8th in the Western Conference frontcourt. Melo and Derrick Rose both got more votes than CP3. Players can't tell the difference between Kostas and Giannis, 10% of them think Kobe is the undisputed GOAT.  Fans are fucking idiots, and players aren't much better."
"15/16  regular season Curry was the most exciting player I ever seen. I didn't watch MJ in his prime, but that version of Curry was more exciting than Lebron, Kobe, Wade, Carmelo, Nash, Kidd, Westbrook, KD, Kawhi etc. The closest in terms of excitement was Derrick Rose from 2008-2011. Vince Carter earlier in his career with the Raptors was also up there, the same with Tracy McGrady when he played for Orlando."
"First, lavine is not having a 50-40-90 season. Second Boozer was not a vocal leader and him and noah both missed substantial time. Derrick rose took a team without noah and boozer in half their games and Keith bogans averaging 4 points a game starting all 82 games to 62 wins and the best record in the league"
"It's a pump and dump for the wealthy that got in early. The influencers and guys that stay behind the scenes are pumping the shit out of it right now and will offload. Guys like Gary Vee always do this shit. They did it with Pokemon and sports trading cards that have led to the stupid overpriced bullshit that's happening now.   This won't last. There simply isn't enough demand to handle hundreds or thousands of specific Moments at thousands of dollars with the number that will eventually be released.   They just did some shit where they took all the base Moments and made them limited edition and prices are skyrocketing.   People will get fucked and lose tons of money, but in the meantime there's still some money to be made.   Easy money buying packs. It's guaranteed profit at this point. Hard part is actually buying a pack. Last few releases they have put out 5,000 packs with something like 50,000 trying to buy. It's all luck based right now too.   I'm up to $775 after putting in $18 in actual money of my own. And I sold the day before they made everything limited. I missed out on *thousands* of dollars if I had just waited a day or two.   A crash will come eventually.   Just pulling up the marketplace now.   755 Trae Young Moments on a specific one that has a release size of 15,000. Lowest price is $139.   You gotta be a fucking fool to think there is enough demand for 15,000 of those to sell at $139. You gotta be a fucking fool to think there is enough demand for the 755 listed for sale at $139. And $139 is only the lowest asking price right now.   On the same page. Derrick Rose. 299 available. $2599 lowest asking price.   The demand will not keep up. Many of these will drop heavily in value. Very quickly.   Only question is when?"
Which came full circle when the Jazz traded for Derrick Rose
The shoe wasnt even Dames idea...it was Adidas idea. Derrick Rose got one for a regular season game lol.
"Remember to tell your kids about the time Lebron, kevin love, d wade, IT, crowder, Derrick Rose, JR Smith, Kendrick Perkins and Kyle Korver all played for the cavs at the same time"
Reminds me that Derrick Rose is one of the most painful what-if’s in NBA history.

Derrick rose and Jimmy Butler both as much admitted towns and Wiggins were choads...organization caters to young choads...eventually catering to biggest choad and gets the biggest choads best friend on the team who is also an overrated choad...but seriously this team and player are so far removed from relevancy at the moment...if they kept Butler and the coach they would be far more stable and possibly an annual playoff team....maybe edwards will be the real deal
Derrick Rose
"Derrick Rose was a free agent. Unless you mean this year when he went to NY, but a trade like that would require Tristan Thompson's contract to work, which stops being worth it.  The Lakers wanted a rotation big for Zubac (and inexplicably viewed Muscala as one), which is exactly my point. You're not getting those guys for just picks. Would it have been worth Theis AND picks for Zubac (would have had to have been Theis, as Baynes made too much money)?"
I don't know about that. Derrick Rose just went pretty cheap and I would take 2015 JR Smith any day over what we currently have on the bench. Zubac from LAL to LAC I think was nothing crazy of a deal. I think a team would trade a decent bench guy for 2 firsts and a second which we could have done with our like 8 picks or whatever it was we had. Obviously would depend on the team and whether that team thinks they would like him long-term. It is a good conversation. There's a good amount of talent out there and somehow we managed to end up with the bench we got.
"I might be reading your comment wrong, but it seems to me you think I'm talking about young star talent? I'm talking youngish like 25-27 that are role players. We had plenty of picks to pull off a trade or two for bench types. There's been multiple reports of how it's hard to trade with Boston. So there were definitely some serious conversations that have gone down the last few seasons that other teams have backed out on because they weren't dumb enough to get fleeced. But the Myles Turner situation is a perfect example of us screwing up. The reports from all sides have said he was ours if we said yes, but we asked for more, allowing Charlotte to swoop in. Stuff like that has been hurting us for multiple years at this point of trying to take the team to that next step. Hell, I would have been happy to seriously target Derrick Rose as 6th man, but he went to Detroit for cheap and played pretty well for them."
"Not everything is about the sheer numbers. Yes fouls per game may have decreased but most of these fouls are absolutely bollocks. We are in an era players don't defend for whatever reason and i would say there should be like 1/3 of fouls compared to 2000s or 90s.   Look i am not the person who reminisce the old golden days. But honestly when I see players push themselves in defenders box and get a call i am instantly turned off. When Trae just turns into his defenders lane who is doing nothing but just running along and gets a foul, it is worse than hack a shaq at this point.  I want that little shit to be punished and pushed around a little bit and in return i want him to persevere and beat the defenders anyways with his talent and then grin to me from tv so that I go mad at him. That's one of the reasons why I watch sports. I don't want untouchable stars just do their thing. That's why it was fun to watch MJ, or Shaq, Derrick Rose or even Kobe. They were not untouchable. Some of these stars cheated even more than today's stars, they baited fouls but they were also beaten on the court, literally. They deserved those fake ass fouls when they did cheat."
Contrarian take. But my personal definition of the MVP is the player who is the most valuable to his or her  team's chances of winning the championship. So I would not have given westbrook the mvp even though he had a phenomenal year. I would not have given it to derrick rose either.    The short answer is I would have given it to lebron every year of his prime the same way I would have given it to Jordan every year of his prime.
"The answer will always be 4. There is no way LeBron deserved 2011. The expectation was that the Hear were the new Superteam, they were going to RUIN the league. Everyone hated them and what was coming of them.   And here's Derrick Rose, who lead his team to ""Just 4 more wins"" with 62, with his best teammates Joakim Noah and their big free agent acquisition Carlos Boozer missing ~80 games combined so his best consistent help was Luol Deng.   Meanwhile the Big 3 Miami Heat had Dwyane Wade as a SECOND OPTION and they lost to the Bulls in EVERY regular season matchup they had that season, and didn't even get the 1st seed (Keep in mind this was before ""playoff LeBron"" was a thing and he was coasting through the regular seasons, he had zero rings and only 1 finals appearance at this time). The Big 3 SUPERTEAM that everyone thought was going to ruin the league didn't even get 60 wins, but who did? Derrick Rose with his MUCH less help. The only other team with 60+ wins? The San Antonio Spurs. Rose leading his team to a better record than BOTH the Spurs and the Heat is far more impressive than what any advanced stats tell you.   I never ONCE even mention age or ""Youngest MVP ever"" in my argument  Rose 100% deserved the 2011 MVP. You can say LeBron was robbed of 2nd place but he never had a claim to win it."
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday’s game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it’s been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks — Reggie Bullock — RJ Barrett — Julius Randle — Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
Shaun Livingston Brandon Roy and Derrick rose
It's either Derrick Rose or DeMarcus Cousins. The What-Ifs for each are just too much for either player to ignore. The Bulls with MVP Rose attempting to stand up to LeBron's Heat? The Pelicans with Cousins in the playoffs against the Rockets/Warriors?
Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose can go higher?
"To be clear, I don’t think this is the sole cause for the ratings drop (nor do I actually think the NBA is in trouble long term, fwiw) but I do think the KD Warrior’s dominance was a major driving factor of the decline in ratings. You say superteams drive ratings, and I agree, but that team was more than a superteam. The 2017 warriors were not Lebron/Wade/Bosh teaming up; an actual parallel would be if Derrick Rose had joined the heatles after 2011 due to an unprecedented cap spike. It was patently unfair, unsporting, and made the league’s second best player look like a loser. That, in the context of increasing sentiment against the high amounts of player movement in general these days, absolutely killed interest in the league imo. But, reasonable minds can differ, and you’re entitled to your opinion.   That said, I really do appreciate the irony of you writing 4 paragraphs to say I’m blaming the league’s bad ratings on a particular problem that I hate (KD warriors) when you’re doing the exact same thing with the problem that bothers you (unnecessary drama/narratives)."
"I don't know Derrick Rose and I don't know what you watched to be convinced that he was humble, but I'm pretty much not going to believe any NBA star is doing humility as more than an act. They would have to give me 72 hours unbroken footage of their on and off court behavior."
"Good points! I’d challenge Westbrook as not the same as Derrick rose and co. But off the court, I’ve seen his good deeds. I like Jokic on the list!"
"D will didn't murder him, usually outplayed him. Bigger guards usually gave CP3 issues. Derrick Rose and Westbrook gave him so issues too."
"He should get in. People on r/nba don't get the Basketball HOF isn't the MLB HOF or NFL HOF. It's not nearly as rigorous or exclusive. Like I see silly debates about derrick rose all the time. He's like a lock, he's the youngest mvp in history, he'll get in. In totality Rubio should easily get in. He's been playing professionallly since he was 15, he started a Olympic final when he was 16. He's won a FIBA world cup and been the mvp of the tournament. He's had a disappointing NBA career but it's still been solid. His international career is remarkable though."
derrick rose giving mudiay flashbacks
In Derrick Rose's MVP year he took at least one of these per game. A bulls reporter kept track and his 3pt percentage rose from 32% to 35% if you took out his half and full court heaves. Huge difference in how his shooting that year is viewed.
"I generally don’t like even putting players on lists like these until they retire so I can accurately compare them to their peers in every aspect. Lebron and KD are obvious exceptions because they have balled out since the beginning of their careers.   Kawhi took a little bit of time to get going, but he’s a super star right now. Kawhi has only had around 5 Top Tier offensive seasons so far in his career. I want to see a little bit more of sustained scoring greatness before I bump him up.   Melo was a bad defender and wasn’t efficient, but even right now, he can get hot and become borderline automatic. I have seen very few pure, unadulterated scorers like Melo and I respect that greatly. Also a phenomenal technical rebounder when he puts his mind to it like he did in international play.   Luka could blow out his knee a la Derrick Rose and never be the same player again. The NBA is fickle. Some players burn out, some don’t and go on to greatness. I don’t even rate Jimmy Butler that high at this point in time. He’s not even a top 30 or 40 SF of all time."
Derrick Rose can go UPSTAIRS
i love the r/nba users who hate analytics   go reminisce about derrick rose vs Melo on facebook or something
"&gt;That’s pretty wild honestly.    Not really.. LeBron been dominating the league for almost 2 decades now. Won a lot of the MVPs, and should have won more.   Durant shared MVPs with him. Just different LEVELS. Peak LeBron and Durant. Derrick Rose had that ""youngest MVP"" year. That was wild  &gt;   Then Curry won. Westbrook and Harden. And then Giannis  &gt;  What player the Atlanta division ever had since AI.. that could have even challenged these lot for the MVP, or anything else?  It's really that simple if ya think about it"
"There’s been like one season where lebron deserved an mvp he didn’t get, the Derrick rose year. Somehow people just forget that he’s doesn’t have the best performance every regular season, because he saves it for the postseason. Just because he’s probably capable of being the mvp every year doesn’t mean he deserves it on potential production."
"Analytics sucks the joy out of watching the game.  Two of my favorite players the past decade are, of course, Derrick Rose and Zach Lavine.  And I have to listen to idiots tell me they suck instead of just watching beautiful basketball"
"When people think Derrick Rose was better at his peak or that Devin Booker is currently the best player on the Suns, I am confident he is still underappreciated. Many don’t recognize what he brings to a team."
Lol ur maddddddd. Kyrie better than trae. Wtf yall getting outta hand with this kyrie disrespect. Kyrie is shooting 40/50/90. Derrick rose aint doing that
Is it weird that i thought of Ben Gordon as the surprising omission here before Derrick Rose?
Damn why does Derrick Rose hate Giannis and speak Japanese

"Stacy kings commentary on d rose dunking on dragic  WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DRAGIC? DIDN'T YOU GET THE MEMO? DERRICK ROSE CAN GO *UPSTAIRS*!"
"lol it's all good my guy. I remember the word ""max"" being associated with the Derrick Rose rule when it first came out and wasn't aware it had nothing to do with the super max, which is good imo, so we both got some info out of it!"
Today I learned. I’ve heard the Derrick Rose rule referenced so many times and never bothered to look it up. Thanks for teaching me something new. Sorry if I was overly snarky.
"""Back in 2011, the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement included a rule named after Derrick Rose. ... The rule allows a player finishing his rookie contract to make 30 percent of a team's salary cap — up from 25 percent — if he's twice been voted an All-Star starter, twice been voted All-NBA or won an MVP award"""
"Derrick Rose rule. Sorry it wasn't max contracts, but yes it is a factor in contracts."
"I mean, you clearly don’t remember when Dame was averaging what Derrick Rose did in his MVP year and wasn’t even selected as an All-Star at all"
He also has been dirty af to Derrick Rose and a bunch of other players. And every single time he walks away and acts like he doesn't know what he has done.
Is this a real question? Dude averaged 30 a game and was an MVP candidate. This is like saying why do we care about Derrick Rose when there’s obviously a reason we care about Derrick Rose
Add derrick rose and d'angelo russell
Rajon Rondo Derrick Rose Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Kevin Garnett
"&gt;Dame's offense is ranked 5th. Curry's is ranked 19th  The warriors second most impactful offensive player is Draymond.  That's the reason for that gap.  The warriors right now are like the early 2000s 76ers, the derrick rose bulls or the 07 cavs. They are a great defensive team that relies on a single player for all there offence.   Steph has great defensive teamates just not great offensive teamates. As a result you cant compare the two teams offensive ratings."
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
Derrick Rose literally guarded Trae with his hands behind his back and the refs STILL called a foul. It’s the most ridiculous shit I have ever seen. Silver needs to fix this shit. It’s making for a terrible product.
I want MVP Derrick Rose back...
There’s a universe or timeline where Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler brought multiple rings to Chicago together.
"&gt; That it's the same for Lillard is not really relevant since he's not the one with the MVP  And since when winning MVP means that you have to win? Karl Malone, Charles Barkley and Steve Nash didn't, why with a 6-3 point guard would be any different?  &gt; Russ is actually ""supposed to be"" the better player, according to basic stats and accolades  He was, in his prime, but he isn't anymore. That's like saying that Derrick Rose should be a better player and have more expectations than Damian Lillard right now because he's won an MVP, Russ isn't in his prime anymore, ofc Dame is better. Dame is younger and plays a style of game that is conducive to doing well into his 30s, Russ is 32 and always relied on his freakish athletecism."
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
"You can argue that, it'll just be dumb. No matter how much money you have to throw around, there can't be 30 competitive teams. There can't even be 15. In any given year there are maybe, maybe 8 teams that could be legitimately considered as contenders. The way a team goes from ""not a contender"" to ""a contender"" is through acquiring talented players.   What you are saying is essentially that it all teams except ones currently in contention should abandon all hope. Even if they manage to get a star to keep their team relevant, that guy will just leave to a contender and not only is it justified but it's actually your owner's fault for not spending money to summon players out of the aether.   The Pistons got one year with a new coach and mostly-healthy Blake and they made the playoffs. That off season they signed Morris, Wood and Derrick Rose and looked primed for an even better playoff spot but Blake suffered a season-ending injury. The FO was actually doing things right, they were putting the best pieces they could realistically attract around a star player who got hurt. No they weren't contenders, but they weren't the KG Wolves either.   Additionally, Blake signed with the Clippers who had just traded away their star PG, who ended up with the 10th seed. He knew he wasn't going to compete, but he wanted to get paid. If he'd wanted to compete there were 10 better teams he could have taken a pay cut to sign with."
"Derrick Rose couldn't shoot, he won MVP.   And Ja Morant is more well rounded"
Good for Wall not being a Derrick Rose
"I vehemently disagree. Derrick Rose had a good defensive team, but he was that teams entire offense. No other shot creators, and lots of injuries that year. Trae is a talent but that’s ludicrous to say, especially when there have been so many good young players recently."
Not really. You can’t tell the history of the league without the youngest MVP Derrick Rose and he’s a long shot to get in.
Prime Derrick Rose syndrome
"Derrick rose had plenty of detractors even in 2011, theres gonna be plenty of people 25+ who aren't high on D Rose"
Derrick Rose.  The whole “DRose is trash” narrative existed in here from about 2014 until he got to Minnesota.  It was a tiring 5 years or so defending the dude.
"Westbrook doesn't have that touch. Nash, Tony Parker and even Derrick Rose had some of it. Zion actually plays like Rose when he drives from on top of the key. Basic in and out dribble moves, spins and lay-ups with body control and touch. Zion is like Rose, Parker, Zach Randolph had a baby."
"No order:  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Wall   Russell Westbrook  Derrick Rose  Tony Parker  Kyrie Irving  Rajon Rondo  Kyle Lowry  Damian Lillard  Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas and Kemba Walker are very close"
1. By far Kobe Bryant   Allen Iverson  Trae Young  Dominique Wilkins  Dwayne Wade  Derrick Rose  Lebrun James  Magic Johnson  Durant   Westbrook
"Well what other explanation is it lol  This happens to Steph Curry, kyrie irving, and Zach lavine  It happened to derrick rose.  Some players get way less calls than they deserve   Are you saying that it's a conspiracy? Because I'm saying it's a simple answer. Refs are biased toward certain players."
"1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Dwight Howard  5. Chauncey Billups  6. Derrick Rose  7. Rajon Rondo  8. Bradley Beal  9. Avery Bradley  10. Michael Jordan  To change it to people I grew up watching, I'd swap out Hakeem and MJ for Kobe and Paul Pierce"
"I mean Diego Costa looked massive playing for Chelsea but he's both shorter and lighter than Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook who aren't terribly big by NBA standards. They're all different types of athletes that excel at different things. From a raw explosive athleticism standpoint NFL players are the most athletic men on earth. Are sprinters faster? yes. Are Basketball/Volleyball players better leapers? yes. Are soccer players more balanced and agile? yes. The thing about them though is they're close seconds in every category and they're physically more powerful. They can get away with that because the play between breaks lasts on average no more than 6 seconds. You can't train to be as strong heavy or explosive short distance as football players in soccer, you won't have the endurance to play the whole match."
Derrick Rose.
Why is that a stretch? Like have you watched melo at all this season? Would you like to comment on how his rookie year has been far and away better than Tatum's?   Im not saying my opinion should be the majority but I don't think it's far fetched at all that Lamelos ceiling is higher than Tatum's. Derrick Rose is my favorite player ever and I think Lamelo is more gifted than him even without Roses injuries.
I love Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose?
"They can’t do much dunking any more, but, Derrick Rose and Blake are up there for me."
Ask derrick rose how he feels about landing upright vs controlled falls.
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
Derrick Rose getting injured
"&gt;I think if it was possible, Derrick rose should come out publicly to renounce his MVP and award it to LeBron, the true MVP of that year anyways. So LeBron can have 5 MVPs and be the first 5- peat MVP. Rose doesn’t have the stress of what the MVP carries anymore  You know the funniest/most idiotic thing about this comment is that Dwight Howard was actually #2 in voting that year."
Derrick Rose.
"I don't think being a super human athlete has any bearing your virus susceptibility. They may have better outcomes though and an easier time. Based on the few things I've read, Jayson Tatum and Derrick Rose had a rough time with COVID."
7 foot Derrick Rose
"Do athletic players careers not last as long? I always hear about this but I am not sure this really is the case. We all know about Derrick Rose who suffered an injury or someone like Cam Newton in the NFL but athletic players can afford to lose a step while borderline slow players can't. Like Kevin Love and Blake Griffin are both the same position and same age and 1 was an athletic freak while the other one was very skilled. They are both dropping off at around the same age. Zion Williamson isn't just really athletic, he also has really great BBIQ so I think he can be someone who continues to develop skills as he ages like Karl Malone and Lebron James did."
Crazy how Schroder isn't worth 20M unless he's averaging peak Derrick Rose numbers but all Vanfleet needs to do to be worth his contract is look good for 3 total playoff games.
Lol Derrick rose lol
"This one was a little awkward but he usually lands with both of his feet.   Derrick rose was fucking wild with his dunks, guy was just flying all over the place. Also his crossovers were very sharp, back and forth repetitively most of the time. He also had this hop step where he flew his entire momentum a certain direction and landed super aggressively putting tons of pressure on his knees. He was so good though looked like bulls found their new MJ for like a season and a half"
Paul George and Derrick Rose? Derrick Rose was the MVP year and I don't know it they get past Dallas since he was but a baby at the time all things considered and if they got past the Cavs in 2014 i don't see them beating the Warriors at all. 13&amp;14 George but even then does that Pacers team beat the Spurs?  &amp;#x200B;  you could argue 2012 Melo but like those Knicks weren't beating OKC  now if he beats the Nets this year in the finals that's a big one on Harden. last years rockets weren't winning a title but this is probably the Nets best chance at a ring
"Honestly it was for me seeing Nash in Lakers jersey, and it’s still weird to me that Derrick rose don’t play for the bulls anymore, even tho he’s probably been away from the bulls longer then he was apart of them at this point"
"Holy shit, he was dead wrong about the final four. Kansas beat a Derrick Rose-led Memphis that year. Mario Chalmers was the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four."
Derrick Rose beat us on a buzzer beater last season in The Blender.   https://youtu.be/Cd0gx4tK-Go
Was Derrick Rose not at the buzzer?
Tell that to derrick rose
Young Derrick Rose should be in the conversation for quickest ever.
my all time favorite BIG TIME TIMMY JIM is probably Derrick Rose if we're making analogies here. If D-Rose won 3 chips that is.
"Go ahead make an argument for Lebron instead of talking out of your ass. This isn’t Derrick Rose stealing the mvp with a narrative, in fact it’s the opposite."
Are you forgetting that the Knicks are missing Derrick Rose. If he comes back the Knicks and Warriors are being talked about as the super teams
[Derrick Rose](https://youtu.be/BwUah8UiGoQ?t=14) for sure
"Next Derrick Rose in the making, hopefully with better injury luck. I really like watching him play."
"I don't follow baseball or football, but I think it does good to realize this is the Basketball Hall of Fame, not the NBA Hall of Fame.  I know you and I weren't discussing it specifically, but if Len Bias is able to make the HOF based on his college acclaim and play, I think Derrick Rose, in addition to his NBA MVP in his Rookie year, would for sure be inducted as well."
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose allegedly had somebody else take his SATs to get into Memphis in the first place
"If Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill are in the HOF (and first ballot I believe, inexplicably) then Westbrook and Harden are beyond locks.  Derrick Rose might also join Steve Nash as the only MVP not to play in an NBA Finals, though he could've if Lebron didn't trade him from the Cavs lol."
Yeah cause Derrick rose didn’t make it to LA
Buddy. You mention that the “heat got swept by the bulls” in the 2011 regular season  yet the LeBron James led heat beat the 2011 Derrick Rose bulls in the Eastern conference finals.   What have you been sipping on tonight my dude??
"2011 lebron was worse than Derrick Rose, yes. He couldn’t shoot the ball and had a variety of offensive flaws that effectively rendered him useless if taken advantage of by teams such as the Mavericks. I wouldn’t even say that 2011 lebron was better than Dwayne Wade. His stats were mid, and he was the third in the running behind rose and Howard. That’s not to mention the heat got swept by the bulls in the regular season and Lebron’s total lack of intangibles at that time as shown in his humiliating finals appearance."
"MVP ABSOLUTELY does not mean he was the greatest basketball player in the world that year lmao. It means he had the best regular season that year.   Tell me, would you consider mvp Derrick Rose that year better than say...LeBron James? Trul?  If so, than any basketball opinion you ever have should be disregarded."
The Bulls had a 1.7% chance when they got Rose.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-2008-bulls-win-nba-draft-lottery-derrick-rose-story.html%3foutputType=amp
"Remember DeMarcus Cousins? Or John Wall? Or Derrick Rose? Or Kobe? One injury is unfortunate, but two major injuries within a year and it's pretty much a done deal. Klay will have to be the first player in NBA history to make it 100% back off of two career-altering injuries. I want Klay to come back but just plugging your ears and singing seems tone-deaf to how bad his situation really is."
Yeah thing is regardless of knowing who is most deserving these awards just matter. The way we talk about Derrick Rose vs Dwight Howard changes drastically based on who won the award in 2011. Same with All NBA teams etc. A hypothetical completely undeserving candidate winning still benefits massively long term.   The fortunate thing is I think this year is an outlier year. Most seasons the winner is fairly clear cut to where politics/clout/access cant do enough to change it. Or at least a 2017 situation where as long as one of the 3 legit deserving candidates won it Im fine with that.
"To be fair, Derrick Rose is and has been a significant contributor to multiple teams over the last few years now after basically not having knees. He definitely isn't the insanely explosive guy he was in the early 2010's but he's a great bench piece.   I think we just have to reset expectations with Wall. You see senior citizens, although slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose."
"I agree. I think the questions around Zion are more, how long will it last? We saw Derrick Rose go from MVP to a shell because of how hard he pushed his body, it’s not hard to see the same thing happening to Zion when you watch him play."
"Pains me to say this but Derrick Rose might become the first MVP to buck that trend, he has no college career to speak of basically since that year he spent on Memphis has essentially been struck from the record books while his NBA career was derailed by injuries.  Rose has gotten his career back somewhat, but I'm worried he might not play enough to get the stats he needs to improve his chances. T-Mac getting in does give me some hope though, as T-Mac was basically ruined by injuries at 30."
don't forget post injury Derrick Rose Bulls now LOL. that was like the worst the eastern conference ever was in its existence.
“They’re saying it’s us and the warriors”- Derrick Rose
Gilbert Arenas... Derrick Rose
Maybe that brief moment where the cavs had Lebron/d-wade/derrick rose/korver/J.R smith/K love lol
"He played, and didn't dunk with Ish Smith, Derrick Rose,  Langston Galloway, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard. All guards who can throw a lob. Bruce does it frequently now. All that said the gravity the stars on the nets cause opens up alot of space. Blake just isn't good enough to outright beat guys anymore. He needs to be open and he wasn't for us. He's not a good first second or third option. But he can be a solid 5th or 6th on a stacked team. It's no conspiracy."
Lonnie Walker is the anti-Derrick Rose.
"No. At 21 ppg, it’s entirely possible that he may not be the leading scoring on his team. Jamal Murray is close to 21 ppg, but Jokic is the MVP candidate. Middleton is averaging more ppg, yet Giannis is the MVP candidate . Tobias Harris is around 21 ppg, yet Embiid is the MVP candidate.   The player you described could possibly be DeAngelo Russell. If the T’wolves were 52-30, KAT would be the MVP candidate.   Or it could be Malcolm Brogdon. If the pacers were 52-30, how many people would say it was because of Sabonis?  When the Raptors were a top seed... Kyle Lowry didn’t get much consideration as an MVP candidate. They looked toward Derozen/Leonard/Siakim as the MVP candidates.   Your player would need to do more...essentially they would HAVE to win the conference with inferior talent... aka CP3 with the hornets, Derrick Rose with the Bulls, Iverson with the 76ers, etc."
He was an All-NBA first team player in his sophomore year. I personally believe he's in that same tier as derrick rose in the greatest what-ifs if not for injuries.
"""... Derrick Rose""  Cries"
Derrick Rose knees are calling.
"Zion is Derrick Rose, Larry Johnson and Charles Barkley mixed into a 280+ tank with a 45 inch vertical"
7 years of Jose Calderon is probably better then 1 year of past prime Derrick Rose.
"Embiid plays nothing like Shaq. He is like a slower and bigger Hakeem and Patrick Ewing had a baby. Giannis does remind me of the Admiral, just freak physical specimens and dominant on offense and defense. Zion has a bit of Chuck, Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason and Derrick Rose in his game. He gave me some Shawn Kemp vibes in college, but don't see much of the same explosiveness in transition in the NBA that he displayed in college."
I'm pretty sure old Derrick Rose might actually be the best FA that Minnesota has ever signed
That genuinely broke my heart Derrick rose was supposed to be our Chicago kid that fucked the bitchboy up and it hurt me so much to see him playing with Lebron even though I knew it helped his chances to get a ring
i dont think hes perfect but why would he apologize for something that the legal system proved innocence on. seems like you're problem is with the legal system more than derrick rose. i dont really care about drose personally i just think they shouldve convicted him if what you are saying is true
"The wolves have only picked at the top of the draft twice.  They had had many players on the roster who were drafted number 1.  Joe Smith, the Kandi man, Derrick rose, etc etc.  So have a lot of teams lol"
Young player who can contribute right now on the level of Matisse Thybulle/Terrance Mann/Donte DiVincenzo  Veteran with experience but can still be a very quality rotational player (Dwight Howard/Derrick Rose/PJ Tucker)  AT LEAST 2 1ST ROUND PICKS  1-2 2nds  Salary Fillers
"Do you know sexual assault cases work? They’re rarely “proven” in court. A jury found OJ innocent too. You also haven’t acknowledge a single point I’ve brought up. I get it, you like Derrick Rose, but there’s no need to bury your head in the sand and pretend he did nothing wrong."
"And Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Blake Griffin, Chris Webber, and Khris Middleton"
"Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Bruce Brown, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Reggie Bullock are all in NY now"
"Against better judgment, I bought near front row seats last year to watch Derrick Rose's return to Chicago. Everyone in the arena wanted to see Rose do his thing, but Drummond wouldn't stop playing point center. Dumbest shit I've spent money on."
"So does Mo Williams, Derrick Rose, and KAT."
"On the one hand I feel bad for Mike because he obviously knew he fucked up. On the other hand, who the hell greenlit that question to Derrick Rose of all people?"
just average out Derrick Rose with Shaq and you get Zion.
"Not for nothing, but the city of Chicago absolutely adores Derrick Rose."
I will never not love Derrick Rose. Hope he gets a ring.
"Hmm lots of unprovoked attacks on Rachel Nichols and Doris Burke, almost universal worship of “good guy”‘ Derrick Rose, if that’s not telling I don’t know what is."

"I will always be a Derrick Rose fan regardless of what team he is a member of. This dude is an inspiration of perseverance and hard work. He had potential career-ending injuries, and is still playing in the friggin NBA. Let that sink in...do people realize how much rehab comes with his type of injuries? For a regular dude, that’s just so you can walk again. This guy rehabilitated to the point of still playing (very well I might add) with the greatest athletes on the planet. From my perspective, that’s a life achievement more respectful and admirable than a ‘chip."
2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers:  PG: Isaiah Thomas  SG: Derrick Rose  SF: Dwyane Wade  PF: LeBron James  C: Kevin Love
Get Derrick Rose while they’re at it too
"It's usually the exact opposite of what you're hoping for.  I had a friend who had the potential to be a decent center at the D1 and possibly even NBA level.  He had the size, the skill, the touch and the love of the game.  But he had feet the size of someone much smaller and he was literally in pain at night after we played any decent amount.  And this is when we were teenagers.  Obviously he never got anywhere with that in the long run.    It really sucks man.  And I think Derrick Rose knows better than almost anyone to have the god given ability to do amazing things and yet your body fail you time and time again."
"Nothing destroys me like Derrick rose, I just want him to hug the trophy in Chicago I’ll cry like a damn baby for a month"
"Derrick Rose blew out his knee the first time as I was pulling into my future wife’s driveway to pick her up for our second date ever. I was waiting in her driveway (because the Bulls were up like 28 at the end of the third and I left before the 4th began) and my phone erupted with “omg dude I’m so sorry texts”, then she opened the car door, and I had to pretend I still had an intact soul. Then I had sit through The Lorax pretending I wasn’t two steps away from suicide. Love you D Rose."
"He is bigger than Barkley and way more agile and explosive than Malone ever was. He is Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason and Derrick Rose combined."
"My honest opinion:   Toppin's main strengths were ability to rim run in transition with the ability to translate into a good roll/pop man on screens at the NBA level immediately provided there was a primary ball handler running the play.   The knicks right now NEVER have him playing w/ a decent playmaking PG because it's either Elf/Burks/IQ (unreal but not a traditional P&amp;R distributor) but more importantly we're running the statistically slowest offense in the league. On the rare occasions when he has the ball in transition and looks to push he ends up turning around because the team just doesn't run with him, they're not asked to play that way.   Couple the bad fit scheme/team wise so far with a rookie player getting 7 minutes a night after being injured the entire first month and losing any ability to establish a real role in offense means he can't find his groove and he's never going to resigned to spot up 3 duty at the end of TT's bench.  The only saving grace, he's shown flashes of good play and vertical ability offensively when coupled with Derrick Rose. He really was finding a small role on the second unit before Rose got COVID.   This year is a disaster for him and I'm a lot less excited about him now but I'm in no way writing it off until he can get 15 minutes a night pushing the pace on the second unit with a real ball handler running P&amp;R with him instead of shunting him to the corner."
Derrick Rose too
"I understand the context and you either have a reading comprehension issue or ignored it intentionally because I addressed that.   Correction: Derrick Rose was being empathetic. People in this thread are being ""weird"". He's going to live. You dudes need to get out of your feelings."
3 All Stars and then former All Stars such as Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade teaming up
"&gt; “We had a lot of fun in Las Vegas. During the trip to Vegas, the plaintiff told me that she had not heard from Derrick Rose for a while, and she had recently had sex with Derrick and two of his friends — Randall and Allen. She told me she had sex with all three of them, and that she was upset that Derrick was okay with it. At no time did she ever state or claim that Derrick Rose (or his friends) had raped her or done anything non-consensual. Just the opposite: she informed me in her own words that she had partied with them and been with all of them, but all indications were that it was consensual.”  &gt;“I bluntly asked her is she was raped. She said “no” but that she did sleep with all three men. A month or so later, she told me she was going to sue and that she expected an out of court settlement.”    This is literally straight from a close friend of the woman who accused Drose. They also found texts corroborating this story. Drose never sexually assaulted or raped anyone stop with the slander."
"If he is in the running to take the youngest MVP from Derrick Rose, than I think he is old enough to not complain. Rose hardly ever got calls and rarely complained."
Derrick Rose trade coming maybe Sixers Clippers Raptors would be Interesting to see what packages to be offered.
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
Derrick Rose
Dont forget that derrick rose career high game
Why isn’t Derrick Rose on here?
Don’t see what Derrick rose is doing to get on there but Demar isn’t
"Jarrett Allen, Derrick rose, buddy hield, JJJ, and D-Lo over John Collins?"
"If they get Derrick Rose, Al Horford,  and Paul Millsap they can have a big 8"
"Give the dude credit, he’s at least trying to trade for Derrick Rose again"
Pseudoscience. That’s like thinking healing stones would help resurrect the careers of Derrick Rose and Isaiah Thomas
"That’s fair , I would say Zion is more unique than better. Because of his frame and skill set if he grows he simply a mismatch to 99.9% of the league . I see Ja Morant as a Derrick Rose/Russel Westbrook type , so you wouldn’t be wrong in saying they’re a cut above their draft class .   This is why the NBA is about to get more teams . Too much talent already in the league and incoming in the next four draft classes to put on 30 teams"
"Half of the dunks in this clip shows him landing on 2. Klay rarely dunks, he's not putting Derrick Rose levels of stress on his knees. It's obvious the lack of balance from Green hitting his hands and back of Klay's head forced him to land purely on one leg, which was nearly fully extended.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF_zSEbNL0c (1:22 look how far he had to keep both legs apart)"
I remember back when that fool said he wouldn't give derrick rose even a minimum contract too.  Fuck zach lowe.  Westbrook for life!
He has his flaws as a coach. He’s also only had like one year of coaching real “elite” talent.   And even then I’d argue the Bulls team short of Derrick Rose weren’t really that much more talented than most mid-tier teams in the league.
Prime Derrick Rose is an mvp though
I think the Bucks will look to acquire Derrick Rose.
"I am not talking about MVP conversation at all. Im talking about Rose as a player and his career being a little overrated. He deserved the MVP, but he wasn't better than certain guys.  It's not hindsight bias which is why i said ""obvious at the end"" meaning after the playoffs. There's no way you realistically watched the 2011 season after the playoffs and say yeah Derrick Rose was better than Dirk Nowitzki. I think after watching the whole regular season and playoffs, I would take those 6 guys over Derrick Rose. Just like in 2017, I would still want Lebron/KD/Kawhi/Steph/Harden over Russ. I understand steph and kd had no claim to MVP that season, but it never for a single second made me think Russ was a better basketball player, and that was more than confirmed in the playoffs."
"And why did the Bulls have the best record?  Because Rose led them to the 11th best offensive rating in the league? Wow. Or because they had the top-rated defense in the league, something to which Rose contributed very little? Or maybe because the Bulls bench had a better Net Rating than most team's starting lineups, including the Bulls?  The voting wasn't close because Rose had the better media narrative, that was it. Homegrown local talent ""leads"" major media market to its best finish since MJ? Obviously he was winning over ""the Decision"" Lebron and Dwight ""lol where even is Orlando?"" Howard.  He wasn't even the best player at his position that year, CP3 was. If the Bulls had an average defense, if they had an average bench, both things Rose had nothing to do with, they wouldn't have won even 40 games with ""MVP"" Derrick Rose.  I will die on this hill."
"I think Westbrook is more than what Derrick Rose could have been. I don't actually know if people claim that what if-Rose would have been better than Brodie but if that's the case they def overrate him. It's moresoe that people just like DRose in general, grew up with his MVP season and would love to see him succeed in the league. So every game he puts up like 25+ is highlight-worthy and titled as ""vintage Rose"" but I really believe that this happens mostly because people like Rose, not because people think he's actually that great or could have been that great. It's just sympathy for a childhood/teen hero that never got the chance to really develop."
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"If Derrick Rose can do it, so can Luka."
Hes gonna be Derrick Rose and get injured young because hes too reckless
Yea exactly lol. Derrick Rose had a better 3rd season than Dirk but that doesnt make him better
"Ja has a ceiling closer to prime Derrick rose for me. Not as high as MVP, but an all-star, 3rd team all-NBA type player. Ja can lead a team to the the playoffs. That Memphis team will be special when they are all healthy. Ja and rose have similar stats through their first two years."
Derrick Rose or Livingston. What could’ve been.
"Do you think in the future there will be league-regulated prosthetics for amputees/Derrick Rose? I know a lot of athletic prosthetics are springy/bend to let you get up, wonder if that would be an issue. Also what if there was a “breaking ankles” version for people with prosthetics where it pops out."
I just think it would’ve been cool to see Derrick Rose have a healthy career lol
Reminds me of Derrick Rose finishing on LeBron and Wade
"Toughest part about this is the Derrick Rose era shouldn’t have even been his prime. Dude was young a.f and as we see in the comment section on any Lonzo ball post, point guards take forever to develop. D-Rose could’ve been the goat with better luck and better injury prevention."
"Demar derozan is like 6'7"" with way better footwork and more variety of shots in the mid range. The guy is playing the 4. Westbrook can't do all that.   If anyone Westbrook should look at it's Derrick Rose imo."
That’s the consensus but I disagree. The year LeBron was denied back to back to back (by Derrick Rose) the Bulls had the 1 seed. I think someone would need that same argument to beat Giannis.
The real mvp was Derrick rose tho
Post injury Derrick Rose wants no smoke with pre injury Derrick Rose.
"Derrick Rose was the third best player in the league that year. LeBron, Kobe, Rose...everyone else.  And he was what? Like 23? He wasn't overhyped...he looked like he was about to take over the league.   He was fun to watch. He played hard. When your pg can go over the top and put you on a poster...this guy was out there catching lobs while looking at the rim. He was nuts.   It wasn't and ""era""...but the hype was real. If you watched the NBA back then there was no question that D.Rose was a top top player. I had him as the third best player in the league, and it shocked me too."
derrick rose MVP season and 2020 ez
derrick rose era was 8 months long tho
"There is no need for hypotheticals. In a 2014 Grantland article, Kirk Goldsberry wrote this:   &gt; Of course Derrick Rose can shoot. Just a few years ago, **Rose was, hands down, one of the best jump-shooting guards in the NBA**. At his peak, he blended volume and efficiency in a way that made him the envy of every other backcourt player.  &gt; Consider his second year in the league. Rose turned 21 a few weeks before the beginning of the 2009-10 season. During that campaign, his calling card was his insane midrange game, which he used to become one of the best scorers in the NBA. Rose’s combination of speed, vision, balance, and finesse was not only incredible to watch, it was virtually impossible to defend.  It's pretty obvious a lot of people commenting here did not actually watch him play before his injuries."
"Derrick rose was more nba ready than all those guys and proves it by winning mvp so young.... d 🌹 could have came out of high school straight up. Besides CP, those other guys needed a couple of years of college or playing on really bad teams to get the feel of the game."
"derrick rose had the #1 defense behind him by far. That team was carriedd by their defense not offense. Drose was the classic example of a player getting a lot of credit for team record on a defensive team. Its not like that team was devoid of offensive talent either with boozer, deng, noah, korver, watson, bogans, gibson. it was a really well balanced defensive juggernaut and somehow rose gets the credit for carrying their offense to just an above average level.  Rose's mvp was likely the worst in history if you look at most advanced numbers, he quite literally had an average all star season and was given the mvp because of the team he played on was a defensive juggernaut and because the rest of the offensive talent was spread out instead of on one person."
"Yeah Chris Paul had a down year coming off of injury and then the very next year re-claimed his status as best point guard in the league though. It was literally one year sandwiched in between Chris Paul's career that he was the best point guard in the league.   in 2012: CP3 averaged 20/10 with 2.5 steals per game on 58% TS  in 2012: Derrick Rose averaged 22/8 on 53%TS  There was a magnificent Derrick Rose season. In reality, it was a Chris Paul era that continued until it became a debate between Westbrook, Curry, and CP3. and then eventually became the Curry era."
CP3 was always better than Derrick Rose
Ehh even in 2011 there's the argument that the Heat superteam (which at the time was viewed like what the KD Warriors were) didn't even have the best record in their conference.   Derrick Rose had the better record without a teammate who was anywhere close to Dwyane Wade or even Chris Bosh.
"The worst argument is 2011 for sure. Fun fact about that year btw, Dwight Howard received twice as many combined 1st and 2nd place votes as Lebron.         |Player|Points|1st Place Votes|2nd Place Votes|3rd Place Votes|4th Place Votes|5th Place Votes| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Derrick Rose (Chi)|1182|113|6|2|0|0| |Dwight Howard (Orl)|643|3|57|31|16|11| |LeBron James (Mia)|522|4|26|39|31|12| |Kobe Bryant (LAL)|428|1|18|32|40|12| |Kevin Durant (OKC)|190|0|6|10|20|38| |Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) |113|0|5|3|11|30| |Dwyane Wade (Mia)|24|0|1|1|2|6| |Manu Ginobili (SA)|20|0|2|0|0|6| |Amare Stoudemire (NY)|9|0|0|1|0|4| |Blake Griffin (LAC)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Rajon Rondo (Bos)|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Tony Parker (SA)|3|0|0|0|1|0| |Chris Paul (NO)|2|0|0|0|0|2|"
Bruh Derrick Rose is completely washed. Even in his prime he's no where near kd
"Derrick fucking Rose, are you kidding me? His talent level was never close to matching Durant"
Not even Harden or Leonard or Derrick Rose ?
Not even Harden or Leonard or Derrick Rose ?
Derrick Rose is turning into the 08’ Celtics
"Thats bullshit. if you were there you knew he was cooking every guard in the NBA. he overshadowed Miami Big 3 by himself. It was a whole take over, Rose had every arena losing their shit. I think you dont remember  [Derrick Rose ULTIMATE 2010-11 Season Highlights - YOUNGEST MVP! | GOAT SZN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSQ8yZ4haHc)"
"everyone acknowledges Linsanity was just a temp thing though  It's pretty common around here to pretend there was a Derrick Rose ""era"", like Rip is doing. No, he had literally one elite season then got hurt the next year and was never the same. Those other guys had sustained great performance for several years."
"Yeah Kyrie was in the league for the ""era"" of the  2011-2012 season when he was a rookie and Derrick rose played 39 games before tearing his ACL."
Not even Jason Kidd wanted to smoke with Derrick Rose and that guy has lung cancer cause he some with everyone
The Prime years of Derrick Rose never happened :(
derrick rose is turning 33 later this year bro lol
I don't think any player ever has had one elite season milked more than Derrick Rose lol
"Exactly, he was so scared of Derrick ""I wanna go higher"" Rose, he focused on his education instead lol what a nerd."
Where was Trae Young during Derrick Rose era? Probably scared cuz he didn't want no d. Rose smoke.
Derrick Rose
"Since I followed the NBA in the 2001-02 season, none of them.  Let's take a list in order: Tim Duncan 2 straight years, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash 2 straight years, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James 2 straight years, Derrick Rose, Lebron James 2 straight years, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry 2 straight years, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokuompo 2 straight years.  Not one time did I feel anyone else should have been MVP over them."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are my two freshly posted player profiles from this week:  P.J. Tucker: [https://basketballbeacon.com/pj-tucker-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/pj-tucker-player-profile-stats/)  Derrick Rose: [https://basketballbeacon.com/derrick-rose-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/derrick-rose-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks."
"Welcome to fandom, young buck. I've been watching the NBA since the 70's. Saw Bird's back go out, Magic get HIV then come back in a disastrous season. Jordon on the Wizards. I've seen it all. The lesson to take from it is too enjoy watching these players at the height of their powers. Most players are an one injury away from losing their quickness or athletic ability. Think Derrick Rose"
"Derrick rose, chris bosh, amare stoudamire. That number is cursed."
"I know he’s talking about having 4 players on the same team going to the ASG together but he’s really selling Jazz team short if he’s comparing them to Paul Millsap-led Hawks.   Also, Millsap being a 4x All-Star is wildly hilarious. I don’t think he was ever even a Top 20 player in any stretch of his career. 4 All-Star games is as many as HOFers Milan, Spencer Haywood, Connie Hawkins, Earl Monroe, to name a few. 4 is more than guys from his era like Arenas(3), Marc Gasol(3), Derrick Rose(3), Deron Williams(3) and even Draymond (3), if Draymond never makes another ASG. Millsap was never better than any of these guys."
"If he played in the east. LeBron's competition in the last decade in the east. One knee Derrick Rose 🌹 Bull's, old dementia Celtics &amp; the baby raptors..lol"
Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose vs THT. Chicago bench war
Derrick Rose look like he writes poetry
I have 2 words to say to that.  Derrick Freaking Rose.
"As a Bulls and Derrick Rose fan (and while we're at it, MJ &gt; LeBron too)  1: Derrick runs into foster here. Might be the video quality but I'm not really even sure why Derrick took exception to it. Maybe you can point it out to me  2: Dirty play. Fuck Jeff Foster. But that is a bang-bang play and we have no proof that Vogel instructed Foster to do anything  3: Yeah people were calling LeBron out for this at the time, the only reason he didn't get as much heat for it was because Draymond took all the attention as soon as he (yet again) went after some balls. Bad manners? Sure. But dirty? He's not trying to injure Draymond, just piss him off. Which I think is still shitty but I wouldn't classify as dirty  4: To me it seems clear that this is a lazy swipe at the ball. Unintentionally dirty I guess is the phrase I would use. Shitty as fuck and probably reckless, but we can't really conclude dirty here  All in all from your videos I think we can safely say Jeff Foster is an asshole, I don't like LeBron, and there's not enough evidence here that there's an endemic problem with dirty play in the Lakers org right now  Taking OP's post into account though...LeBron is a bitch for sure"
Jeff Foster cheap shot on Derrick Rose 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lynrCDw3W6A  Jeff Foster tries to injure Derrick Rose in the air  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TKZcnkIQxY  Lebron James steps on Draymond Green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrBgdV1wy_Q  Dwight Howard concusses Jimmy Butler with a cheap shot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQI1vlulm0I
"I’m talking about Westbrook the previous 3 seasons, not 2011 or Derrick Rose.  Out of the last 3 seasons you have 20 something games where Westbrook’s scoring efficiency was slightly above average and everything else is him shooting in the low 50s TS% and sub 50s TS% in the playoffs. The decline was obvious."
"Derrick Rose in his MVP season, .550 TS%, 32.2 usage. Rose sure was tanking his squad that year eh?"
"That's because the Lakers don't care. They (the Lakers) did the same thing to Butler in the finals and he had to play game 6 with a concussion, guaranteeing the Lakers a win.   Lebron knows that suspending and injuring the other team helps you win.  It also goes back to Vogel, who creates a culture of this. Look at the 2011 playoffs between the Bulls and Pacers. Vogel had his goon Jeff Foster try to injure Derrick Rose on a drive to the basket similar to the Lebron takedown on Embiid."
"Great game for Sexton, he was lights out. Also, not that it's relevant but I never really processed that the Pistons can almost run a lineup of just top 5 picks when healthy between Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Josh Jackson, and Jahlil Okafor."
"Kevin Love, Derrick Rose, Osman, etc. are good at defense? Since when?"
"This happens all the time, just players usually don't average a triple double before.   It's the same as Dwight Howard and more- this is what happens when somebody's game is based purely on athletics and not finesse/technique.   Everybody knew when his explosiveness was gone he would have almost nothing. His shooting has always been horrendous.   The only reason why guys like Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are still around is because they worked on their shooting and developed their overall game. Westbrook hasn't done that and will probably be out of the league within a couple years"
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
Thibs is probably just still enamored with Derrick Rose 😔
"Zach Harper sums him up really well:   &gt; Drummond is the most intriguing player on this list outside of maybe Derrick Rose. A couple of league sources mentioned after the Harden trade to Brooklyn that it’s a matter of time before he finds his way into a buyout and joins up to give them help with the interior. Drummond is a difficult player to figure out because of how he wants to fit. He’s obviously better than the Kendrick Perkins option the [Oklahoma City] Thunder once had, but Drummond does require you to waste possessions throughout a game throwing it to him in the post. If you can get Drummond to run the floor, catch lobs, set screens, rebound the hell out of the ball and play defense, he’s a great option for someone like the Nets.  &gt; However, if he wants to be hyper-involved as a scoring option on a team with KD, Kyrie and Harden, then that’s going to be a problem. He’s better than Jordan at this point, but how much better when you consider how he’ll want to be used?"
Appreciate you Brodie. I see what Derrick Rose fans were going through now 😞Shits hard to watch.
Derrick rose
"Artis Gilmore, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Derrick Rose"
2 mvps vs 14 All-NBA selections   Is derrick rose greater than damian lillard because rose has more MVPS but dame has a couple more All-NBA selections
"Absolute nonsense, and everyone knows that Reinsdorf/Paxson were infamous for shunning attention for 22 years &amp; not letting any information get in or out.  They were impossible to cover.  If one of their in-house media agents was leaking into to major media outlets, they’d get fired on the spot.  It was the shadiest sports regime ever &amp; was literally impossible to gain coverage on.  They also deliberately made the team bad &amp; were clearly piggy banking it.  The Knicks ownership is obviously bad but they’ve always been very lenient with what gets in &amp; out, making them easy to cover.  The Celtics are a good team, that’s why they get talked about lol, and Ainge has always had a good report with media outlets  seriously, get out a bit lol, spread your wings, go watch sports at bars in international cities.  The NBA still hasn’t recovered from The 90s, those television ratings still have never even come remotely close to being topped.  Talk to any casual sports fan around the world, and literally all you’ll here is “basketball = Chicago/mj” and “the NBA is terrible after the 90s”, etc.    there’s a reason Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the freaking planet after *one* (insanely overrated) season, and it’s not because he was playing for the freaking Boston Celtics 🤦🏻‍♂️😆"
Stacey King is a national treasure  “DID YOU NOT GET THE MEMO DRAGIC? DERRICK ROSE CAN GOO UP STAIIIRRS!! WHOOO”  I will never forget some of those from the DRose days.. BIG TIME PLAYERS MAKE BIG TIME PLAYS (when Rose drilled a game tying 3 against us his MVP year)
"This is honestly the weirdest troll brigade I’ve encountered in a while lol.  No one gave two shits about the lakers when they sucked except for lakers fans, same as any other fan base.  Lmao @ Nick Van exel &amp; brandon ingram, no one cared  The Knicks!?  Again, *no one even knows what the Knicks is outside of the tri state area*.  Trust me, I travel, a lot, and am able to catch basketball games at establishments all over the globe.  The way the overwhelmingly vast majority of the entire planet views basketball is:  The Chicago Bulls.  That’s it lol.  “Chicago &amp; MJ”, that’s literally it.  Even amongst little kids, their parents tell them that “basketball peaked in the 90s”  The NBA *still* hasn’t even come remotely close to approaching the ratings heights that they did under Chicago/MJ.  Heck, The lion’s share of casual sports fans view the NBA as “lame” &amp; as a “dead league”, “peaked in the 90s when Chicago was good”.  Seriously, this is a common rhetoric amongst casual sports observers.  Get out more lol.  Even here in Los Angeles where I live now, I see more bulls gear than clippers gear hahaha  As far as name value amongst casual sports fans worldwide, it’s the Bulls, the Lakers, And then everyone else.  There’s a reason Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the entire planet after *one* great (hugely overrated) season, and it’s not because he was playing for the Celtics 😆🤣😂  The Knicks aren’t even worth mentioning.  No one has heard of them outside of the tri state area.  Except for in east Asia, they gained some traction there after the whole Jeremy lin thing, but that was very short lived &amp; not even really bringing up"
Casey is looking awful in Detroit. They're playing directionless basketball and he's entirely dependent on the creativity of players like derrick rose and jerami Grant to make something happen in his mediocre system.  His defensive principles are also dated and I can see why they got destroyed whenever they were faced against a player with great court vision.
Yeah I still think the impact of Derrick Rose can never be forgotten in Chicago if we’re talking about most influential bulls. But that’s about where the list ends.
"1)no??  That doesn’t even make any sense lol  2)the bulls just came off of 4 years of tanking, no one cares about any team that loses all the time.  And yet, they’re still like #3 in NBA merch sales 😂😂 with NO superstars (although ZLV is making a strong case thus far, the point still stands) they’re one of the most profitable global sports mega brands to ever exist  3)Jimmy Butler bulls jerseys outsell his heat jerseys 🤣 fun fact:  I watched two of the “finals”** games this year in Nairobi, and literally ever single bar was flooded with Bulls #21 jerseys   4)Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the planet literally overnight after ONE great (massively overrated) season because “omgomgchicagoisgoodagainomgomg” lol  The Chicago Bulls = basketball, to the most people around the planet.  The NBA &amp; sport of basketball in general is still coming down from that singular high 23 years later.  The entire world has been salivating for the Bulls to be good again for over two decades, and it’ll never change"
"Chicago** arguably the most iconic sports city on earth.  The Madhouse, soldier’s field (sp? I don’t watch football, am Scottish.  Still, I know what that stadium is), Wrigleys Field, etc.  The world has been waiting for the Bulls to rise again for over 20 years, they’re still #3 in the entire league in merch sales LMAO.  Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the planet after ONE great season because “omgthebullsaregoodagainomg” LoL"
"&gt;when the Cavs traded Kyrie and then their offense was basically just as good the next season despite replacing Kyrie with a bunch of really bad offensive players (IT, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose).  This is the Lebron's effect for me. The young LA was 4th in western conference before his injury. If he wasn't injured, I definitely think he could carry the team to the Playoffs and maybe at least winning the 1st round and at most went to the conf final.   But Kyrie is great, imo, just maybe he wasn't a good fit to play with the Celtics."
"Celtics going to ECF without Kyrie is probably the biggest component of the argument. Second is when the Cavs traded Kyrie and then their offense was basically just as good the next season despite replacing Kyrie with a bunch of really bad offensive players (IT, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose). And then they made the Finals without him too. Kyrie is an enigma. Although, the level of production he has had the last 2 years is pretty undeniable. Hard to argue him not being a winning player at this point."
Derrick Rose for Brook Lopez and a pick if the Bucks even have any picks left
"Yeah it’s sad too because the Linsanity story was fun to see unfold, but people have done some serious revisionist history to make it out to be some sort of crazy “what if” on the level of Derrick Rose or Brandon Roy. People act like he would have been destined for superstardom if it weren’t for Melo. The guy had an extended stretch of games where he played far past his usual abilities, then as defenses got to gameplanning more for him since he was relatively unknown before he dropped back down to reality."
"I don't think they would have gotten past LeBron but they'd definitely have been in pole position to meet the Heat and Cavs in the ECF if they tooled the roster right over the years. Derrick Rose was a bad motherfucker and a continuation of him healthy paired with Jimmy, Thibs running things, and making the right moves on the margins that would have been a hell of a team. Maybe they could have gotten one or two past LeBron."
Derrick Rose. Unstoppable at young age. Was leading a nation at a young age and tenure ended shortly due to unfortunate circumstances.
"- Lavine isn't as good as Harden, not sure why you would expect the same package for Lavine  - Lavine isn't going to re-sign with the Bulls  - The Nets and Lakers picks have the same chance of being good  - The Rockets did not deny a better trade from the Sixers out of spite  - The article does not say that the Bulls aren't interested in trading Lavine, in fact it suggests that a decision will be made on him in the summer  - Lavine isn't going to have more suitors than James Harden lmao  Might want to get ready to watch the Last Dance and Derrick Rose highlights again."
"Lebron, Steph, Klay, KD, pre-injury Derrick Rose."
"I don't really understand the point of this thread... if by comparing their stats, Rose would be inflated if he was in his prime right now with no injury and at Brogdon age. Time has changed, offense is a lot more fast paced now, while Bulls offense back then was literally Derrick Rose. So for him to be able to average that while being the main focus of the defense is actually insane, it's literally how Stephen Curry is being guarded now, but Curry is the best shooter of all time, defense doesn't collapse on Curry like Rose when he gets to the rim, but defense would literally clobber Curry no matter where he go with 2-3 people guarding him."
"AI and Derrick Rose comes to mind, those Sixers and Bulls team (with Thibs as HC) were defensive monsters."

Flashbacks of the Derrick Rose dunk on Dragic.  One of my all time favorites.
Derrick Rose
"David Robinson, Kevin McHale, Julius Erving, Clyde Drexler, (prime) Derrick Rose"
"Draft classes since 1980 w/ multiple MVPs.      1984: Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon      1996: Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant      2008: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook      2009: Steph Curry, James Harden"
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"
Derrick Rose please. Thank you!
Derrick Rose
Jokic is going to the HOF unless he has a Derrick Rose-level fall from grace
"Jordan, kobe, Yao and to a much lesser extent derrick rose he was and still is insanely popular in China"
That’s Derrick Rose
"Derrick Rose, please and thank you"
Free agents weren’t attracted here when we had Derrick Rose or Jimmy Butler. Players don’t want to deal with Reinsdorf and Chicago winters. Free Zach
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
Derrick Rose coming for that ass
"This is kinda bait-y not gonna lie but I’ll answer. Knicks easily. Im a Nets fan, but even I didn’t expect the Knicks to surge out of nowhere and be this good. Especially when they got MY GOAT Derrick Rose and the man went on a tear transforming the team instantly. As long as they keep this lineup and stay healthy, they can legitimately knock out the Hawks(assuming the playoffs started today) out the first round. And Julius Randle is legitimately an MVP candidate while being a lock for 1st or 2nd All NBA"
"We'll def see a better shooter within the next 20 years. There have been a lot of players in NBA just as entertaining and some even more entertaining. I think 2008-2012 version of Derrick Rose was just as entertaining to watch play. Hakeem was fun to watch both on offense and defense, MJ, T-mac, Shaq when he was peaking from 2000-2002, Vince Carter, especially his Toronto years."
"Blake Griffin, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, or Robert Parish... who would be historically the worst MVP of all time if things worked out like this??  Didn’t include players from before the 80s."

"Currently, no NBA player who has ever won MVP has not been inducted into the Hall of Fame or been a basically guaranteed inductee once they become eligible (although Derrick Rose could be the first). With this list, that number would grow to at least four: Red Kerr, Terry Cummings, Penny Hardaway, and Jermaine O'Neal, in addition to the still-active Rose and maybe Blake Griffin."
Derrick Rose
Even if she’s lying and Rose is to be believed 100%  The most charitable reading of these events is that Derrick Rose repeatedly asked this woman something that she repeatedly said no to.   They partied at his house and he asked again and she said no and **left**  She invites him specifically over and he arrives with his friends and gets in after an hour of waiting and the woman has sex with them  Like imagine yourself in a similar situation and that’s so uniquely terrifying that your “no” doesn’t matter.  He literally treats the denial as an eventual yes and very clearly forces the issue.   That alone should be enough indication of his character and how he treats women.
"I actually don’t like rapists and something is wrong with you if you do.  Before I get downvoted and someone blathers on about how D. Rose was legally acquitted, [read](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation) about the actual case. It’s *bad*. And the worst parts come out of D. Rose’s own mouth. He really should have taken the 5th.  &gt;Despite Rose admitting to not knowing what consent meant, and admitting that, yes, he and his friends did have sex with the woman while she was intoxicated, he was not held accountable in any way for his actions."
"You don't know that, you weren't there. You are going off of what you have read in media. You don't know derrick rose, you aren't personally invested in his or this women's life. You care because it involves a system you subscribe to, and in your perspective, point out a failure in a system you rely on. Go be mad at the system. You aren't going to convict rose from your comments on this page. If you really care, get your fingers of your keyboard and go do something about it."

I love Derrick Rose.
"Talen Horton-Tucker is 20 years old, which everyone knows.  He also grew up in Chicago.  So he was eleven years old when Derrick Rose won the MVP.  A couple years later, Horton-Tucker followed Rose to Simeon Academy in Chicago.  Imagine what going head-to-head with Rose, and then hitting this shot, meant to him.  That kid isn't going to sleep for days.  When he does, he'll need a new dream."
"""We had a lot of fun in Las Vegas. During the trip to Vegas, the plaintiff told me that she had not heard from Derrick Rose for a while, and she had recently had sex with Derrick and two of his friends — Randall and Allen. She told me she had sex with all three of them, and that she was upset that Derrick was okay with it. At no time did she ever state or claim that Derrick Rose (or his friends) had raped her or done anything non-consensual. Just the opposite: she informed me in her own words that she had partied with them and been with all of them, but all indications were that it was consensual.”  “I bluntly asked her is she was raped. She said “no” but that she did sleep with all three men. A month or so later, she told me she was going to sue and that she expected an out of court settlement.”  Should also read this, straight from the mouth of a close friend of the accuser"
"Derrick Rose was a better +/- vs Payton in the first half.  But this is a Derrick Rose who had to play through half of Q3, whole of Q4 without any rest. He's not going to be the same Derrick Rose you get in the 1st half.  It's just physics. There's a reason why bball has bench players. Starters are not physically capable of playing for prolong stretches without dropping in production."
"Thibs gets praise for his defensive schemes and unjoking the Knicks.  But holy cow his rotations makes no sense sometimes. Why are you playing your bench PG for half of Q3 + **all of Q4 without any rest???**  And then when he bricks every 3. Clearly tired. The only 3 he makes is Laker's leaving him open, wanting him to shoot the 3. Because he's clearly tired. But apparently this is not apparent to Thibs. Because guess what? Derrick Rose is playing all 5 min of OT zzz.  The poor dude played 22 min's of basketball nonstop. This is the NBA. The top 0.1% of PG's are in this league. Surely putting in any NBA PG with fresh legs is going to generate more points."
Derrick Rose was off the court and couldn't reach the play in time
I love Derrick Rose
Chicago was very well represented this game   Derrick rose and Julius Randle man I love that duo
"Derrick Rose playing his best basketball since his MVP season. What a story, what a redemption, what a resurgence! I'm just happy to be witnessing this future 30 for 30."
Is Derrick Rose the best performance-per-dollar contract in the league right now? jesus
Shout out Derrick rose!
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Derrick Rose is such a hustler
DERRICK FUCKING ROSE.   ALL HUSTLE
* Derrick  * Rose
Look at Derrick Rose man.   So inspirational.
Shoutout Derrick Rose.    Man
"Wow Derrick Rose is strong, can fling AD around like that!"
Derrick Rose missing all that time may be a blessing in disguise (assuming he's not dealing with any COVID aftereffects)  Thibs is fucking grinding these guys into a dust with all these minutes. Rose with the fresh legs has been a monster lately

"What about Derrick Rose? Young kids nowadays don’t remember the MVP Rose and with that being said, his prime was derailed quickly by injuries."
Should read this and make your own conclusions: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2016/09/15/derrick-rose-accuser-says-he-doesnt-understand-consent/90428194/
Derrick Rose absolutely should not be celebrated as if he has a clean history off the court.
I grew up in the Chicagoland area and saw how miserable the Bulls made their fans even with Derrick Rose and wanted no part of that. Then Dame hit that shot against the Rockets and I decided I wanted to root for the Blazers. Best/worst choice of my life!  Similar story as to why I'm a Niners fan and not a Bears fan.
Derrick rose unfortunately. League has so many talented point guards
"wait who are your two all star player lol. are you seriously considering derrick rose or barrett all star level players lmao. Barrett could develop into an all star but he isnt close to it now. and theres a huge difference between 3 and 4 this year. yeah you're 4 but in reality youre in the boston/miami/hawks tier not close to a real contender. You guys are like 2-3 pieces away, not just one.   Also thibs teams are consistently regular season  over achievers because of how much he plays his starters. i mean you guys are often playing bullock and barrett 45 mins in regular season games which is insanity. You guys are a regular season team right now, your having a nice season but arent a top 10 team this year."
its easily derrick rose
Derrick Rose and I think that’s it for top 10.
"Derrick Rose probably isn't getting in at all, tho that one I was like ""Why is he listed?"""
The Cavs championship win was bs. Draymond should've been suspended earlier and the league drew it out on nonsense for ratings and money.  NBA is entertainment more than sport.   Fuck David Stern.    While the league is more profitable now it's harder to enjoy the games the way it's being called by refs and by announcers. They need to have whatever home team call that nationally televised game.    My front office was the reason we didn't win a championship with Derrick Rose and Thibs their reputation warded away free agents from coming. Wish Melo joined us the year we got Pau
I don't like to definitely state rankings for a player who is still active after the derrick rose injury
"Lol not only had he not made the leap, but in 2012 when ""#1 seed lost in the 1st round"" was the Derrick Rose injury. Even it it wasn't, Jimmy Butler played 4 minutes that series. Total."
"Derrick Rose, but I'm biased because I want to see him win more stuff. Hope he gets a championship, Chicago homecoming, and a couple more individual accolades before he retires"
"Kd, melo, AI and bulls derrick rose."
"Derrick rose, it just feels like new York always has a chance to win when he's on the floor. Such a game changer."
"Russell Westbrook: 182 triple doubles, more than Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Bob Pettit, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Kawhi Leonard COMBINED (181)"
"am i tripping or there was a time period when if the #1 pick was a superstar level player the #2 pick just ended up being dogshit/meme player . Blake-Thabeet, Rose-Beasley, Kyrie-Derrick Williams, Wall-Turner, AD-MKG.."
"Al Horford Resume:   College National Champion  SEC Tournament MVP  5x All-Star   1x All-NBA   1x All-Defense  1x Centrobasket Gold Medalist   1x FIBA Bronze Medalist, with a non-America team (always viewed as impressive)   Derrick Rose Resume:   1x MVP  3x All Star   1x All-NBA  2008 ROY   2x FIBA Gold Medalist   So...not really an opinion just more like backed up by history facts"
Derrick Rose deletes covid
"Derrick Rose played 1 year of college ball, his stats were good, not mind blowing though, and he didn’t win a Natty   He has 2 Fiba gold medals and 0 Olympic   That’s not hall of fame"
"That's why I said apparently, but I definitely should have qualified it more accurately. I'll edit my comment for clarification (even though nobody will see it lmao). And while yeah it probably didn't happen, and I know it's all conjecture, I've seen more than a few accounts that Herro was kind of an asshole in high school. I don't think that this is really analogous to the Derrick Rose, since that's a severely fucked up federal crime, and since this is all contained within the OP's perception of Herro. Yeah he can definitely be lying, but I just posted the link in response to the guy who asked what Herro did to him. I'm just giving insight amd context."
&gt; But point guards much older than that have had success  But they're usually already in the league. Like Derrick Rose. He's been out of the league for a long time. I guess coaches don't have a great relationship with him or they would bring him to their young team (Pelicans?) to help mentor those younger players. But he's too washed to help a team like the Lakers or Clippers. He's not Rondo. At least no one thinks he is. But I see no use for him on the Warriors. We have vets on the team and we have youth. There's no point of wasting a roster spot unless he's young and will be around for the next few years.
That's future HOFer Derrick Rose to you sir
"That is pretty much a copypasta that you're taking at face value without any evidence. It's hearsay. I mean shit, Derrick Rose went to trial for allegedly gang-raping a woman and was found not guilty even though the whole case is highly suspect, but you never see people bring that up. He is loved without question. That case has 1000x more merit than this one, and it still doesn't even matter when it comes to his popularity."
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Acting like Derrick Rose isn't gonna activate his second prime and clamp LeBron the fuck up and go 25/8/5 in 20 minutes.
"Wow, so no injuries ever I think Penny Hardaway would be a top 5 point guard all time , Grant Hill would be a top 30 player, Bill Walton might overtake one of the main guys we think about on the greatest centers of all time list, look at the career of Derrick Rose and how different that would be oh, and just not to mention the Championships and Seasons that would be different if other all-time great players never got injured, like what if Chris Paul didn't get injured in the 2018 Conference Finals , what if Kevin Durant doesn't get injured in 2019, what if Kyrie and Kevin Love don't get injured in 2015, what is Steph Curry doesn't tweaked his ankle against the rockets in 2016, etc the shit would be all over the place lol"
"I see Derrick Rose, I watch"
I think Derrick rose  is going to actually play big minutes which  he didn’t  do back then and take the pressure off of both. I think Randle isn’t going to miss turn around jumpers that he normally hits in his sleep 4 times in 7 games. I think rj will shoot 3’s like he does now and not back then
Derrick Rose rising from the ashes to win a title with Thibs in NY is the best timeline.  It would also be exactly 10 years since he won the MVP and Thibs won Coach of the Year
"It wasn’t world’s better and it wasn’t  near-MVP — he finished in 9th place, with no first place votes, only 9 MVP-share points (less than half as many as 8th-place finisher Manu Ginobili) compared to the 1,182 points scored by the MVP winner, Knicks legend Derrick Rose.    But that’s fair to put Stat’s 2010-11 ahead of KP as well. I would still rather build a team around KP than that version of Stoudemire though. I think it’s fair to put KP ahead of Stat, but it’s close."
"I was at this game and the game before I remember when Derrick Rose hit the game-winner in game 3, I thought that was huge because there was a chance that LeBron's finals streak would end (because let's be honest the Hawks were not getting there) and then seeing this in person I knew the Bulls were done and so did other people in the building lol"
Watching Derrick Rose the last few months has been amazing.  So happy for him!
"I dont know a single person, with even a speck of basketball knowledge, who doesnt want Derrick Rose to do well."
"Joker would be better than Derrick Rose, Steve Nash? Kevin Garnett, and Dirk."

derrick rose?
That's former MVP Derrick Rose to you sir
"I see Derrick Rose, I watch"
It’s the hall of fame not the hall of stats. Derrick rose is one of the most influential nba player.
Shout out Derrick Rose
As a Knicks fan and a Derrick rose fan this has been amazing to watch
"Derrick rose is going to be an interesting HOF case, he's def aging better than most people thought"
"Having Michael Jordan on your team doesn’t hurt. I’m not arguing that these players weren’t good, but that Derrick rose fits in with the group. They weren’t great. They were good.  If Vlade got in, Rose gets in."
"These Knicks are a lot like the Post Injury Derrick Rose Thibs Bulls. Yes they have the same coach and Rose and Taj are there but the team just plays super hard and is so sound defensively. Even though the Knicks might not make it past the second round it is so fun to see a team that plays good defense and plays hard. Been so many years of watching bad defense and low effort, just very refreshing to see different."
yea derrick rose is literally brandon roy but 3-4 inches shorter
grant hill was way better than derrick rose in all honesty. rose is a big what if but grant hill was a  god
"We are the most valuable team in the nba and one of the most valuable teams in sports period but we’ve been the laughing stock of the nba for years. Consistently making bad moves, bad draft picks and just being bad. We were the go to team when making a joke. In 2019 we drafted RJ Barrett with the 3rd pick in the draft and we signed Julius Randle who was never considered that good of a player. Recently, Julius Randle has made an insane jump and he’s become an allstar this season. Our team isn’t as good as others but we play hard defense and hustle harder than every other team and we’ve surpassed expectations. We have a few young players with potential, rj barrett, Immanuel Quickley we drafted with the 25th pick, Mitchell Robinson, Obi toppin he’s a high flyer dunker. And we have good vets, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players in the nba and would probably be an all time great but injuries ruined his career. This year he has been really good but in his prime before the injuries he was a top 10 player in the nba. Julius Randle is our teams leader. New York has two teams, us and the nets. The nets are one of the best teams in the league but most New Yorkers don’t really like them. We also play in Madison square garden.   Here are some videos about us currently   https://youtu.be/CDPJ2hlboAM  https://youtu.be/KvODVmmraZU   Here’s one of our best games this season   https://youtu.be/qRNZ7qaIwu8    Here’s a video about why we have been so bad throughout the years    https://youtu.be/TjmtQ-oee9E"
#SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Taj Gibson and Derrick Rose are like the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams of the NBA.
Shout out to Derrick Rose. Love how he's reinvented himself as a sparkplug scorer with some playmaking.
The young guys must love playing with him. I mean it's fucking Derrick Rose. I'd run through a wall for him and I'm in sales.
But he didn't have Derrick Rose! Oh wait.  Thibs was just a bad front office guy and great coach.
[He was traded along with Jae Crowder](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2693564-report-cavs-trade-former-nba-mvp-derrick-rose-to-jazz-in-3-team-deal.amp.html)
"If Giannis never played another game, does he make the HoF? It would be borderline. Derrick Rose is never going to make it.  Kawhi just doesn't have anyone with a similar enough profile that has made it to the Hall to compare to. His career games played are very low for this point in his career."
Play Lou more moving forward pls. Could be a Derrick Rose situation we had in the 1st series
"Seth Curry, Chris Paul, Tatum, Durant because people forget, Mitchell, Trae Young, Derrick Rose"
"Because they shot uncharacteristically poor in all three of those games and basically fumbled one because of injured players? Look at the way the team is shooting now, even with the Clippers going balls to the wall defensively the Jazz are pulling in 40% three point shooting nights. If they continue to do that they'll win.  Also, ask Derrick Rose what he thinks about a regular season sweep of a team means and he'll give you a good answer."
"I've had to explain this to my patients a bunch.  Like, okay, but that's Derrick Rose?"
What about Derrick Rose?
Derrick Rose was out for like eight games.  He came back fine but said it was the worst illness he’s ever had (don’t know if he was vaccinated at the time).
The most unlucky player since Derrick Rose.
"Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick Rose, and Jae Crowder lead by a GOAT is not a trash team. Just because they were misused by the Cavs doesn't make those players bad."
"He doesn't necessarily lose it, he loses the possibility of it being part of this contract, but if he remains elite, he'll get another max contract after this one.  The only scenario where this hurts is if they fall off/get injured.  A Derrick Rose situation, etc."
knicks were 11-14 before they brought it derrick rose so tell me again how it was Randle that led them to 4 seed?
This is definitely derrick rose
Considering we’re currently building a statue of Derrick Rose outside MSG — I think we resign him.
Shout out Derrick Rose
"Tough era to get over the hump because any given year during his career, him, Kyrie, Curry, Dame, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker, IT, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Kobe Bryant were all in the mix for all-NBA. I think the 2 years he absolutely deserved it were the years he got it which I think were 2015 and 2016."
"I edited the YOU’RE to YOUR before you even replied but you still tried to play typo grammar police because you have no other defense for your hero Kristaps so you had to switch up the plan of attack LOL.   You can continue to attack the Knicks flair like that’s bothering me but unlike you I don’t give a fuck and I’m not a complete pussy so I have no problem repping the team lmao.  You just called Porzingis “Kris” like you know him personally Lolol. I literally can’t imagine idolizing an athlete that doesn’t give a fuck about me that much, let alone one that isn’t even good. You better at least be getting a portion of that $150M he’s stealing from your favorite team if you’re gonna keep defending his honor on Reddit like this. He’s WOrTH eVeRy pENny BruH ALl StAr. HAHAHA.  #DERRICK ROSE IS BETTER THAN KRISTAPS PORZINIGS LMAOOOOO"
weird way to spell Derrick Rose
Derrick rose snubbed
Derrick Rose or Lonzo Ball...
"It’s Rose. The thing about Rose is he could finish all around the rim with both hands will ALL sorts of little moves and angles on top of dunking at times. Russ has always been a great finisher, has had better in game dunks (not my much) and has more overall power than Derrick, but Rose has more finesse and much greater an overall arsenal."
"I agree that awareness should be made. I just don’t think bringing it up at every opportunity is helpful either. Like for example, people do the same thing to Derrick rose or Kobe, etc. I think at its base level it belittles the person’s suffering. The point of focus is not the victim and their suffering - the focus is on the perpetrator which I think does more harm than good."
Derrick Rose as well
"I do but there’s a lot of people who don’t. So should porzingas, Peyton Manning, and Derrick rose die there as well?"
"Counting those that have been eliminated, I think Derrick Rose earned himself a nice payday with both his regular season and playoff performances.  Dillon Brooks too, he was ready for the big moment. Shoutout Kevin Huerter as well, money from deep."
"I think Giannis gets a pass because he's not on a super team. He will still have to beat either Kawhi or a good Suns team in the finals. LeBron had plenty of years where he didn't play a good team until the finals because of injuries to Derrick Rose, or later on, Paul George. The Cavs didn't even have an intarconference adversary during his return."
Derrick Rose and Kevin Garnett were the best players he played in the East.
[Knicks' Derrick Rose Received 1st-Place MVP Vote from Fans](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10005238-report-knicks-derrick-rose-received-1st-place-mvp-vote-from-fans)
"But he didn’t do anything.... he allegedly ignored it but he himself did nothing. And he deserves to die in prison because of that? So by that logic you think Derrick rose, porzingas, joe paterno, Kobe, and Peyton Manning should all die in jail correct?"
Literally what was said about KP this time in his career.   Derrick Rose would only get better right?
"&gt;Raw numbers aren’t a great indicator when some of those games were no longer close in the 4th.  He played close to 10 minutes per 4th quarter, none of the games were that far apart where he didn't have to play. Lowest minute total was seven minutes in game 7 against the Clippers last year.  &gt;You claimed that Campazzo would be in the full-strength playoff rotation which is objectively false. You even listed last year’s rotation, which featured only 3.5 guards (Craig as the .5, Campazzo is the 5th guard currently) as if it helped your case. In the same typical, misplaced, patronizing tone you normally use.  This is impossible to know ""objectively"" as the Nuggets were never actually in this situation, but I also didn't claim Campazzo would be in the playoff rotation. What I said was:  ""You just going to pretend Campazzo wasn't in the rotation when you were at full strength""  That's me talking events that happened in the past. The Nuggets were healthy in the past, and Campazzo was in the rotation. You seemed very sure that he wouldn't be in the rotation, I wanted again to bring the facts to the table, he was in the rotation in a similar situation during the regular season. I see exactly [two](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202104040DEN.html) [games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202104120GSW.html) where all of those guards were healthy (Murray, Barton, Morris, Dozier, Campazzo) and Campazzo played a total of 32 minutes in those two games, playing more than Dozier for both of them and more than Morris for the second.  We won't know if Campazzo would be in the rotation because the team was never healthy enough, but I think it's fair to point out that he played significant minutes earlier. The bit on the rotation was just pointing out the other guys flawed argument where he said the Nuggets run a 7-8 man rotation. That's objectively false as you can clearly see they play at least 9 guys heavy minutes. Nowhere in [that comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ny4d9w/jokic_once_again_outplays_his_entire_starting/h1ma7yt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) did I claim Campazzo would be a part of a healthy 9 man rotation.  &gt;If you’re going to claim to be “bringing facts to the table”, maybe start with getting your facts straight. I know you’re upset that your man got the same number of first place MVP votes as Derrick Rose after you pushed so hard for him all year, but nobody thinks you’re objective when you’re always on the same side of every Jokic/Nuggets thread, regardless of the context. You aren’t, your arguments are largely invalid, and it’s not fooling anyone.  I try to be a little objective at least, which is more than I can say for you. I can't [find](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/l3cr3n/so_15_games_into_the_season_who_are_your/gke0d7m?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [every](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/mggmij/who_are_your_top_10_players_this_season/gstu4mf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/mt0ktt/with_nikola_jokic_playin_every_game_the_nuggets/guxnmp4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) right now, but I've been pretty consistent for a few months that Jokic would be my MVP pick. Do I wish Embiid got more votes? Sure, but that's not the end of the world."
Julius Randle. Not seen any evidence that he is a legit 2nd option in a top team.. derrick rose was the best player in the squad for playoffs.. not sure what Knicks is going to do with him.
"7-2 in elimination games. That’s what I thought. Raw numbers aren’t a great indicator when some of those games were no longer close in the 4th.   You claimed that Campazzo would be in the full-strength playoff rotation which is objectively false. You even listed last year’s rotation, which featured only 3.5 guards (Craig as the .5, Campazzo is the 5th guard currently) as if it helped your case.

You aren’t, your arguments are largely invalid, and it’s not fooling anyone."
"Of course KD cleared himself to play, the players almost always want to play. The medical staff aint always right either, just look at the spurs staff and Kawhi, or MVP Derrick Rose. The medical staff puts the organization first when it comes down to it. It's like HR in a company, they're there for the organization, not you."
"That's why PG's shouldn't be under the basket unless its a layup.  If you don't believe me, look up Derrick Rose, they would HAMMER him around the basket and they tore up his knees."
You can be an MVP 1 year and due to multiple reasons not be a top 10 player the next it happens all the time.   Derrick Rose anybody   As it stands after the regular season was over lebron in my opinion is not a top 10 player and if I was being generous maybe I slide him into 9 or 10 hes top 15 but hes not top 10.   The biggest reason for that is the injury concern I said before the lakers series with the suns that both of their star players were very injury prone especially of recent memory and without one they aren't going anywhere lebron isn't in his prime anymore while hes still a really good basketball player he can't carry a team like he used to.   You are starting to see the actual decline doesn't mean hes a bad player but hes not top tier anymore.   Next year don't be surprised if hes injured again or if he sits for 20 or so games of the season to keep him fresh.   The lakers window of opportunity is closing very fast.
Eye test. Derrick Rose is up there too. But go look at the list mvps in the past 15 years and tell him if this guy will be considered even in any of their leagues when he retires
&gt;2012  Derrick Rose torn ACL for the first seeded bulls?!
"Oh my god you fucking baboon it matters about fit. Fine I’ll fully explain it.  REGGIE FITS WITH THE CLIPPERS SPACING AS AN OFFBALL GUARD. Elite playoff shooting is not as common as you are portraying you are literally lying blatantly. AS GM BOB MYERS SAID; once the floor shrinks in the playoffs you can see who is truly a good shooter or not once they go from having two feet of room in the regular season to two inches. Reggie clearly backed by statistics and the eye test is an great playoff shooter. Historical data shows that you are lying about playoff shooting and that’s pathetic.  Not every team needs a ball dominant guard running the show, when in fact historically those are the teams that struggle the most in the playoffs. Eliminating a point guard in the playoffs will always be easier than shutting down a wing.   Teams with elite wings or bigs with quality role plays tend to win more than point guards (see; Kobe-Shaq Lakers, Kawhi-Raptors, KD-Warriors, Lebron-Cavs, Boston-Pierce Garnett, Spurs-Kawhi Duncan, Rockets- Olajuwon Drexler, Bulls-Pippen Jordan, Pistons Sheed, Big Ben, Rip and Chauncey,  Heat Wade, Lebron, Bosh.  SO LETS SEE WHEN HAS A BALL DOMINANT GUARD WON A RING? Steph the SHOOTER, Magic Johnson the point forward?! Oscar Robertson and Walt Frazier. That’s it. Looks like it’s extremely obvious which one is better. I’d rather have Reggie since the statistics show building a team is better when you allocate the cap space for elite wings and bigs instead of guards.   Russ is a great slasher, but as a guard this is nullified in the playoffs to some extent since it’s easier to gameplan smaller players. (see; Arenas career, Steph vs Toronto box and 1, Lillard vs Lakers, Westbrook vs Lakers last year, Nash vs Lakers, Lillard vs Pelicans, Derrick Rose vs Heat, ).  The fact that you think Westbrook elevates anything in the playoff is laughable he hasn’t had a good series since vs Memphis years ago. Jason Kidd got clamped by the Lakers years ago and Russ has been dealing with the same problem with the same skill set. Sadly he won’t become the SHOOTER  to have spacing that Kidd eventually got with Dallas (ironic that he won a ring with spacing isn’t it).  At this point I’ve given enough examples and quotes that you can look up. I’ve literally led the horse to water at this point so your either going to finally get it or not."
LeBron - AD - DeRozan - Westbrook - Lowry  6th man: Derrick Rose
He ain’t no Derrick rose
Sign my man Derrick Rose and help him to get one ring before he retires.
Derrick Rose
"In my opinion, point guards are probably the most saturated position when it comes to talent. There are so many talented point guards around the league and unless you think your guard is a star or superstar, the drop off in the middle of the pack guys is not much.  For non-stars, I think you can get serviceable guards for under $15mil/year but even then, there's so many good guards that you can probably pick one up for less than that.  Derrick Rose, Cam Payne, Forbes, Seth Curry, Dragic, George Hill, and many others can probably give you similar or slightly less production than Schroeder and for half the price."
Allen Iverson hesitation crossover   Derrick rose crossover where he would slow down completely and then crossover and be at full speed   Giannis Run and dunk apparently
Oden didn't need to be looked at for potential. Oden was literally already monster on the court. Derrick rose was too. Then he got hurt and was never the same. You think rose was a bust because of that? Oden was talented and showed it. He just got unlucky with his legs.
"Agreed, most of these NBA players aren't angles either, Kobe, Derrick Rose, they all raped someone. I'm not justifying what Malone did by the way, what he did was fucked up but if people gonna bring that shit up when someone mentions his name, they might as well do the same for Kobe and Derrick Rose."
"Leaking shit to the media is lame. Put your name on it. I would love to see teams, players etc be more honest.  I enjoyed the 2010s basketball to an extent more than currently. Mainly because I miss Derrick Rose MVP fun.   It's easy to blame a star player but it's hard to blame the FO.   Woj is lame"
1. Derrick rose  2. RJ Barrett  3. Julius Randle  4.  Immanul Quickley  5. Mitchell Robinson   They deserve it more than anyone else
Derrick Rose would still get the mysterious fan vote.
Nah that guy blows too. You need to get a solid player like jrue holiday or Derrick rose
"1. Nikola Jokic 2. Derrick Rose 3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis 5. Joe Ingles         Joker is fresh on my mind after the game but I tried to avoid putting on the really really young guys like Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker excetera, as far as Joe Ingles I like the what can I say lol"
"Somebody askewd for my reasons, so here it is:   &amp;#x200B;  1. Derrick Rose - His pure love and respect of the game is just visible.  2. Chris Paul - It's the only thing that's missing in his HOF career.   3. Seth Curry - He's worked hard and made his own path. Same the Gasols for me.  4. Joe Ingles - He's quite a character, foreign impact, a sportsman.  5. Jordan Clarkson - He's an inspiration to aspiring Filipinos (A little bias cause I am), and him embracing the second squad roles is something young guys can learn from."
Remember when Embiid got the same number of 1st place MVP votes as Derrick Rose in his peak career season?
Need someone decent coming off the bench. That’s why Derrick Rose starting didn’t fix anything
I think the Hawks would take Derrick Rose
"Depends on what you mean by better. If we're going just by stats, the game is played at a faster pace than it was even 10 years ago, so some numbers will be higher just based on that. And I think that in the back of our minds, the GOAT conversation is more than a little influenced by who is fun to watch on the court. '11 Derrick Rose was absolutely electrifying to watch, that enhances the legend in our minds."
LOL no  Derrick Rose 2011 is worse than your average Chris Paul season.
so it's okay if someone shoved Derrick Rose since he is a role player at this point? but it wouldn't have been fine in 2012 because he looked like a future HOF back then?
"You're delusional if you think current Damian Lillard &amp; Luka Doncic aren't better than 22-year-old Derrick Rose.  I love Derrick Rose but if you slot him (his 2011 MVP self) into the current Blazers/Mavericks teams, those 2 teams aren't doing jack shit."
Derrick Rose was on pace to be in the GOAT conversation. The dude was awe-inspiring.
Definitely not Derrick Rose.
Klay Thompson or Derrick Rose 😤
"Derrick Rose shouldn’t be on a team. He was drafted in 2008, so realistically he only has 2 seasons in 2000-2010 which equates  to 1 rookie of the year and 1 All-Star"
"I just remember him on the break. He'd beat so many defenses down the court when he turned the jets on.   His prime in Miami was different. Like, he defended Derrick Rose for big minutes in the playoffs and then was bodying dudes down low right after."
Derrick Rose.

"I always thought the difference was Lebron and Wade planning with each other to end up together with a third star. It was just a question of where and who the third star would be.   To add to this, it led to a small controversy a year or two later when Derrick Rose said his job wasn’t to recruit."
"He’s a 2x MVP and DPOY winner.  Every player to ever win MVP has made the hall of fame. Him winning them back to back, and a DPOY in the same season locks him in no matter what. Derrick Rose is the only MVP that might not make the HoF, but he probably will"
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
Derrick Rose is the only one. People might pretend he'll get there tho if he wins a 6moty award.
why do people think it’s appropriate to make fun of injured players when it’s players they don’t like?  “wasn’t Rose hurt last year too? when isn’t Derrick Rose hurt? December?”  that’s a fucked up thing to say isn’t it?
Twitter decided the Derrick Rose should be the MVP. I don't see how it could be wrong about anything.
"Sure, and that’s why we don’t have a vote. And when we got the chance to do it collectively we voted Derrick Rose for MVP."
How dare you besmirch Derrick Rose like that
Yeah looking back at the last 2 decades there's only a handful of schools:  99-00: Shaq (**LSU**)  00-01: AI (**Georgetown**)  01-02: Tim Duncan (**Wake Forest**)  02-03: Tim Duncan (**Wake Forest**)  03-04: KG (No College)  04-05: Steve Nash (**Santa Clara**)  05-06: Steve Nash (**Santa Clara**)  06-07: Dirk (No College)  07-08: Kobe (No College)  08-09: Lebron (No College)  09-10: Lebron (No College)  10-11: Derrick Rose (**Memphis**)  11-12: Lebron (No College)  12-13: Lebron (No college)  13-14: Kevin Durant (**Texas**)  14-15: Steph Curry (**Davidson**)  15-16: Steph Curry (**Davidson**)  16-17: Russel Westbrook (**UCLA**)  17-18: James Harden (**ASU**)  18-19: Giannis (No College)  19-20: Giannis (No college)  20-21: Jokic (No College)
"I'd rather not continue on a roster that isn't going anywhere. at least with a younger player you can sub them out a lot, have them healthy and develop players that might be in the rotations for years to come.   dude is playing at about his career average. Kemba was never efficient. he didn't improve his game like Conley by upping his efficiency and mind you Conley is one of the best defensive guards in the league and hes 2 years older.  the knee issues hinders his availability, but when he plays, he just plays at his career average, thats just who he is he was never an efficient shooter or a good defender and hes a bad fit with the wings   he shoots at like league average for a guard, and hes a horrible defender and his playmaking is just bad for a point guard. hes the kind of player you give derrick rose money to. to come off the bench not a max contract"
Derrick Rose outplayed Kemba down the stretch.  Kemba sitting in streetclothes on the Knicks bench eating up $35M in cap space isn't going to help them.  You know...the reason why Boston is trying to move him in the first place.
"The fact that the NCAA still acts like athletes don't get paid is among the biggest lies still told in the entire country. It's bullshit and anyone who pays attention knows it, it's not even that well-hidden any more. Unfortunately it's not evenly distributed and you get guys like Derrick Rose having people take the SAT for him but lower tier guys probably only get extra meal swipes on campus.   I don't know what's worse - acting like everything is on the up-and-up and knowing it's bullshit, or still acting like allowing college athletes to get endorsements will ruin the ""integrity"" of the college experience or whatever bullshit reason they still stand by.  I just realized that I really fucking hate the NCAA."
Current: Kelly Oubre Jr   All time: Derrick Rose
Currently: Cristiano Felicio  All Time: Derrick Rose
Welp Rudy gobert officially takes the cake from Derrick rose as the most overrated player of all time
"I think Derrick Rose can be a contributing sixth-man to a championship team, we shall see         If the Nets are healthy, Harden probably going to win the championship this year          I don't see it happening for Westbrook         With Giannis and Joker, it's a little too early to tell , I still think they both have a shot their teams do need a little tweaking though"
Nikola JokBUM won mvp over Derrick Rose??? 😹😹😹😹😹 league is doomed
Derrick Rose!
"This applies to NBA players too though. Went to school with Derrick Rose. Love him but dude never did jack shit in class, if he showed up at all lol"
No Derrick Rose?
He had no business winning it. Derrick rose deserved it and last year Jimmy butler should have won
As long as he stays on par. No injuries.  Derrick Rose will still be the only MVP not in the HOF
Ahem what about 1st overall MVP vote recipient Derrick Rose?
"So? Neither does Derrick rose, Jeff teague, other Thibs point guards"
Knicks might need him to help the reanimated corpse of Derrick Rose (and John Wall would far better imo).   Not sure why the Mavs would move for Kemba.  KP on paper is what the Mavs need. He just hasn't delivered what was promised.
for Derrick Rose
"And yet because of Twitter, Derrick Rose finished ahead of Gobert lol"
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
Whoever did this vote is a total dick and if I'm Derrick Rose I'm pissed. Cuz the only thing it does is make people complain about it and go analyze how much derrick rose sucks and then go on twitter and tell everyone how much he didn't deserve it.  It was a pretty douche move that put Derrick Rose in the crosshairs for no reason.
Probably because it's the first really wonky results since it's been disclosed  [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/09/explaining-derrick-roses-first-place-mvp-vote/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/09/explaining-derrick-roses-first-place-mvp-vote/)  Last year LeBron received the 1st place vote and also in 2019 LeBron has received a 5th. Weird but not as weird as voting for Rose
Derrick Rose with as many first place votes as embiid what a joke
The awards are narrative driven. It’s not an exact measure of quality. Derrick Rose and Shaq have the same number of MVPs.
He played a season where 35-year old Wade and Crazy Rondo were his sidekicks.  The two years before that with the shell of Derrick Rose and 35-year old Pau Gasol as his sidekicks.   Minnesota hadn’t been to the playoffs since 2004 and hasn’t been back since after Jimmy left.   Miami was a non-playoff team before he got there too. Then they went to the finals. Last year’s Miami team was terrible outside of Bam too. Still made the playoffs.
"Did you see the Knicks awful postseason. Randle is bad, they had to give Derrick Rose 30min per game to save face. He wasn't left off of anything, he just didn't make the team..."
"I think the ridiculous nephews are the ones upvoting the idea that peak Derrick Rose is ""easily"" the second best Bull of all time, but we'll agree to disagree."
"Why is it controversial? If you don't think defense and winning titles matter, peak Derrick Rose is the second best Bull ever pretty easy. If you do, I think it's debatable but I'd take Pippen."
"Cool to brag about acting in bad faith lol?   It’s really not that hard   2009:  LBJ, Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant you could make arguments for more people also Kobe was 31 and his numbers were dipping and his defense was getting a lot worse   2010:   LBJ, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, and again Dwight Howard   I’m not even sure this is a discussion unless your argument is Kobe is better because he was popular? He was contributing less than these guys that’s nothing to be ashamed of he was top 5 both years, but not top 3, which is a criteria you created"
"And that's coming from a guy who would take Derrick Rose, Reggie Jackson or John wall over Kyle Lowry. Absolutely garbage take. Basketball is more than regular season offence. What other PG in the last 50 years can be switched onto an all star 7 foot centre and make them pass the ball out instead of posting up? What other PG of this generation can take a charge, get a steal, hit a long range pull up 3, and run a pick and roll alley oop to perfection all in a 3 min span - and that's a normal night for him? Have you ever actually watched an NBA game before? My god."
"Derrick Rose suffered from this same thing. I am still frustrated by it. After paying very close attention, I came to the conclusion that Rose is so strong in his core that he does not appear to be fouled. His body absorbs the contact so well, that it’s harder to tell when he is fouled.   I’m not sure if that’s what’s going on with Middleton, but I’d bet it’s a combination of him avoiding direct contact and not appearing to get fouled.   The plays at the end of games are hard to extrapolate. Refs swallow their whistle at the end of the game. We all know that."
Derrick Rose has an MVP. Stockton does not.  You would take Rose over Stockton?
Derrick Rose  WINDY CITY ASSASSIN
Derrick Rose is pretty lucky he got that MVP. Would be sub 50% otherwise IMO.
Derrick rose
Google Derrick Rose sexual assault
"LeBron James / Kevin Love / Dwyane Wade / Isaiah Thomas / Derrick Rose  I mean, how many All NBA level guys does LeBron need??"
"Derrick Rose is quiet and reserved Giannis is cheerful, upbeat and willing to dish about almost anything lol they’re not similar."
He has to maintain his excellence to be compared to those guys. His resume is great but he could fall off tomorrow. Like Derrick Rose has an MVP but he may not even sniff the hall of fame. (Weird example but I’m trying to say that accolades aren’t everything).
"Derrick Rose was humble and gracious, but dude was Xanax personified. He was nowhere near as engaged and excited as Giannis is, like you said."
Imagine claiming Derrick Rose after your organization shipped him out after he gave his all for his hometown. Sounds like a poorly run team to me...
"Lmao when did I say all sexual assaults are fake? Derrick Rose was exonerated, my guy."
derrick rose is nothing at all like giannis wtf.   this sub will always be so full of stans for that dude and it will never make sense to me. he’s no role model.
"Derrick rose and his friends (probably) sexually assaulted a woman and defended it by saying ""we men"" (obviously a simplification of the entire events)"
https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-derrick-rose-verdict-20161019-snap-story.html
Why would you dunk when you hit 98% of your floaters without fucking up your knees over a 15+ year career? Look how bad Derrick Rose has fucked his knees up.
Derrick Rose is in the same market as a guy like Lou Will or Rajon Rondo. The MLE was meant for 30 year old back-up PGs
He’s what (kinda) Derrick Rose would have been from a personality standpoint.   But he’s more playful
If Curry was as athletic as Giannis he’d be driving and dunking like prime Russ or Derrick Rose (not saying he’d be the same player as them with his shooting.) But he and Giannis aren’t even comparable.
"Also:  Shawn Kemp, Derrick Rose, Walt Frazier, Antawn Jamison, Deron Williams and Andre Miller."
Derrick Rose would be the best guy for that money
"He's up there with Tim Duncan and Steph Curry, yeah. I don't know if Derrick Rose counted as a superstar, but he won MVP and was a BFD and it seemed like everyone completely loved him. Did anyone not like Nash, btw?"
I love Derrick Rose
You won’t see Russ age because at that point he will be even less effective than old Carmelo Anthony and unplayable. Russ has no 3-pt shot and his game is 80% athleticism. He needs to get a better 3-pt shot like Derrick Rose did or older Jason Kidd.
Why would they draft him?  To come off the bench as a 6th man? You can find that type of production in free agency.   Lou Will is a FA. Derrick Rose is a FA.
Derrick Rose said he was going to win MVP and everyone laughed at him. Then he went and won MVP the next fucking year.
Derrick Rose. I don’t think he really deserved to win that MVP. LeBron or Dwight Howard should have won it. Rose was great but I do think people tend to over exaggerate how good he was before he was injured just a little
Derrick Rose is coming for ya!
"The 2017-18 Cavs birthed “we got a f***ing squad now”, “he boomed me”, had the JR bowl of soup thing AND the Lue two-soups-as-one-soup thing as well as all of the other weird Lue stuff not to mention the crazy players everyone forgets were on the team (Deron Williams! Kendrick Perkins! Derrick Rose!) they’re the meme GOATs until further notice"
"Whenever NBA fans bring this up I always point to Derrick Rose. Won his MVP in 2011 and gave all those interviews saying he'd never leave for a superteam, wouldn't beg and recruit for superstars, and said the Bulls can build a title contender around him for years to come. He was defiant about it.  Now he's had a recent resurgence sure, but look at all the squads that left the Bulls in the dust since. His body failed on him too, and now Rose bounces from team to team. The Bulls are in perpetual purgatory.   You never know what's going to happen. Don't blame any of these guys for wanting to win now. Dame held out for awhile, just like those other dudes."
"It wouldn’t be everything. It’d be all the young guys.   I used tradeNBA quick, and the Knicks would still have plenty of money to sign a guy like DeMar DeRozen and a bench big like Daniel Theis, before they re-sign their RFA’s (Rose, Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, and Alec Burks).   A starting lineup of:   Dame, Reggie Bullock, DeRozen, Randle, and Noel.   With a bench of:  Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Daniel Theis  Isn’t horrible. Dame, DeRozen, Randle, and Rose can all score and the rest of guys can create a pretty strong defense. Of course, the Knicks would have to have a good free agency, but getting Dame would probably help convince guys like DeRozen to sign."
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn’t be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That’d leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I’d rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"Sexton would actually be a nice fit in NY. Randle is a good playmaker for a big, so there wouldn't be as much pressure on Sexton to create for others, and he can sort of be like a supercharged Derrick Rose for them."
Someone did that with Derrick rose. It was all him in a suit injured. 😂
Derrick Rose should be out the league when he was the 2nd best player for that cavs team and averaged 18 ppg for the knicks. Scores 50 the next year and Pikachu surprise face.
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"Which top 10 players legacy is about what they did before they were 20 though?   Like good for him for getting 1st team All-NBA at a young age, but if Derrick Rose showed anything your ability at a young age doesn’t always predict how your career pans out.   The youngest to do something, is more of a result of kids going semi pro at a young age now, compared to the past where they did multiple years in college. It’s about how they perform at their peak, and right now Luka is around the 7-9th best player in the league."
"I was at a Cavs game a couple years back when Drose was on the Pistons who we were playing and there was a drunk guy in my section trying whole heartedly to convince me that Derrick Rose was better than MJ. I assumed, incorrectly, until then that takes that hot were limited to reddit."
The last all nba first team player lebron played in the east when he made 8 straight finals was derrick rose in 2011. In 2020 alone he played james harden and ad being his teammate was also nba first team. There is a reason why hawks made the ecf and lakers got bounced in the first round. Lakers even with ad injured are wayyyy better than the hawks but got bounced because of the competition.  Lakers had to play in a play in game when they are tied with the 8th best record but the knicks had home court advantage with a worse record then the lakers. East has been trash this century and still is just as trash. Ad never made it out of the second round before lebron cause west has been dominant.
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"&gt;I can’t think of another great player that had this kind of a fork in    the road decision that could’ve catapulted them to all-time status  Derrick Rose, Tmac, Grant Hill, Raplh Sampson, Arvydas Sabonis, Len Bias  Atleast Kawhi got a chance to prove himself"
Derrick rose is probably still the most intriguing what if
"You're not gonna find a day 1 playoff level playmaker in the draft, even Cade is gonna have some down nights because he can't turn the corner reliably against NBA level guys and NBA game speed always takes adjustment. You need a guy with more league experience to fill that specific hole meanwhile you can draft good shooters and they have a better track record impacting teams day 1  I'd be crossing my fingers the Knicks FO could outbid Sexton's dirt cheap offers. Despite the hit pieces Kevin Love gave anonymous quotes for, Sexton had a good assist rate for a guard this past year. Not quite floor general level, but he's at the very least in that John Wall/Derrick Rose slash and kick mold. That or Ricky Rubio would be a good Thibs PG too."
shoutout to Derrick Rose
"So random question - who had a better career so far? Derrick Rose or Jimmy Butler?  Rose had the higher peak, but Butler was great for a lot longer"
"Kinda reminded me of Derrick Rose, without the crying.😂😂😂"
"another Derrick Rose situation ""Will he or Wont he"" return this season"
"It always bothers me when people mention Adrian Peterson and the 9-month recovery because it was widely suspected that Adrian Peterson used steroids in his [recovery.](https://grantland.com/features/derrick-rose-rob-gronkowski-rise-acl-tears/)  The timeline or rehab protocol was very briefly at 9-months before significant studies came out suggesting 12-24 months to be better. That’s why you’re seeing guys like Klay, Porzingis, etc. take 12-16 months. Can read the study here for [yourself.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27402457/)"

"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot.

I think it’ll be interesting to see what happens to Derrick Rose and whether his MVP is enough to get him in
"In order to be an all time great you have to have skill, leadership, durability, and some luck… it a combination of everything that makes you an all timer…  Otherwise you’re just a Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, T-Mac, Derrick Rose, etc…"
"Randle lead the Knicks in points, rebounds, and assists.   His next best players were a 2nd year RJ Barrett, and a 32 year old Derrick Rose for half the season.   So yeah Randle did carry the Knicks.   And cool, he still had way more help than Randle did. Randle was clearly better last season."
"I’m sorry. I gave Pietrus some serious consideration.  But I currently have him behind LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Ron Artest, Elton Brand, Tyson Chandler, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, and JJ Barrera for the 2000’s. Maybe if I have time, I’ll do a deep dive on his film and see if he has a case for moving ahead of those guys."
"Here’s the BEST player from every decade. (Copied from a previous post)  2020’s Dame Lilard. What he’s done in Portland is amazing. He does more with less help than anyone.

1 mvp usually does that  (Derrick rose to be determined)
"Maybe watch the games? Jimmy was bad. Like bad bad. Almost as bad as he was against the Bucks this year (okay, maybe not THAAAAAT bad). He didn’t really score, he vacillated between too passive and too aggressive (either doing absolutely nothing or trying and failing to play hero ball). Plus his defense was pretty poor. He had one good game (game 3) but only scored above once and only even hit 14 twice.   The Wolves’ best player in that series is hard to pin down. Wiggins was the best the first few games because he scored decently while also playing solid defense, but he did play pretty poorly in the final two.   KAT started really poorly (partially because he was pretty clearly the focus of the Rockets’ scouting report). They were sending quick doubles from a variety of angles and he didn’t respond well at all. By game 3 he had started to get his feet under him and was the Wolves best player in the final few games.   Heck, there is an argument that Derrick Rose was the best player on the floor for the entirety of the series considering how he played in limited minutes (he only averaged like 23 minutes a game because it was his first season back from people thinking his body couldn’t handle it anymore). He was also good defensively in that series."
"Surprised no one is mentioning John Wall. People forget but he was considered to be one of the best college prospects since Derrick Rose at Memphis, only 3 years but that includes a lot of talent."
Prime Derrick Rose
Prime Derrick Rose is my favorite. He moved like a cat.
"Did you even watch us this year. Our two best playoff performers were Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson. They might not even be on the team next year. Plus it's not like we have a team that's poised to go deep in the playoffs. Randle and RJ need to get over their mental struggles in the playoffs, and the best way to get there is to actually get there in the first place which DeRozan will help with."
"Alright, I'm sure a professional athlete who has to cut at 100% intensity on hardwood 82 games/year + practice + playoffs is at a much lower risk to reinjure a notoriously fragile part of the body.  Maybe he can get the same guys as Derrick Rose."
Dennis Schroeder / Derrick Rose level
Bulls had a great team with Derrick Rose but we all know how that went. Had a tough couple years with rebuilding and are starting to see it pay off with Lavine and Vuc. Bulls gonna be a playoff team again next year.
"DWade has also done tons of work in his community and helped make alot of people's lives better. No fan has any idea what kind of person most players are, people just latch onto things like ""Oh he acted like a dick this one time"" when its convenient because they already dont like the guy and are just looking for rationalizations or reasons to double down on their original take of how they like/dislike someone. Many of these Wade haters will then do shit like be Kobe or Derrick Rose stans, none of them actually give a shit about what kind of people these players are."
The bulls had a very good team back then they didn't win 60 games just because of derrick rose get off his dick
"He was just too quick and explosive. People really forget how dynamic young Wade was. Injuries fucked him. People mention players like Derrick Rose, T-mac, Penny, Grant Hill, Oden and Brandon Roy and how injuries ruined them, but nobody mentions Wade cause he won championships. Wade was also a big game player. Clutch as hell on both ends. Incredible heart, drive, athleticism and creativity. I don't care what numbers Harden puts up, I am never taking him over peak Wade in a big game."
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
"He shouldn’t be the 6th man, he’s the most talented offensive player on that roster. Randle cannot produce nearly at the same level when defensive schemes are focused on him in the playoffs. He doesn’t have a bag as deep is Derrick’s plus Derrick has proven throughout his career that he’s more than capable of delivering in high leverage moments. D rose injury history is the reason he’s coming off the bench"
&gt;NY: Derrick Rose  Bruh come on
"I was more talking about him declining from being a star, him being out of the league that quickly is definitely not normal.  I honestly think he didn't care as much as he should have. Rondo is still in the league. Derrick Rose is still in the league. Jason Kidd was 40 when he retired. Those guys were slowed down by age and serious injuries but still contributed."
I know this maybe controversial but a lot of teams would be better with Derrick Rose. I know he has nowhere the consistency of these other starter pgs but in the playoffs even alot of superstars can’t take it to the next level like this man. I am very very certain he can provide more consistency and bigger performances than all stars can in the playoffs.
You joke but at least Derrick rose have a reliable shot.
Derrick Rose is a stat padding chucker.
Bucks FO better be ACTIVE this offseason. Derrick rose would be a nice signing to bolster the offensive firepower of that backcourt.
I agree he should team up with Derrick Rose in New York
Bucks should sign Derrick Rose in FA
"Yep Len Bias is always the one to me as a Celtics fan.   We were in the perfect position where he will take over from the 80s Celtics and allow us to be competitive in the 90s but that tragedy caused to Celtics to be largely irrelevant for almost 20 years.  Brandon Roy &amp; Derrick Rose are the two others, Rose, Thibs, Noah, Deng etc were one piece away from a Chip imo."
"Considering KD is 5 inches taller than Dudley, yes I do believe he’s heavier. And you’re going off of looks rather than the player’s listed weight which is stupid. I’m 6’1 200 lbs and people say I’m anorexic. Why? It’s because I have long arms and a stretched a torso. Who’s body type does that remind you of?   Derrick Rose is aggressive in the paint so I guess he’s a big. What are you talking about? Giannis plays primarily from the perimeter. He dribbled in and takes it the paint but that’s what all perimeter players that can’t shoot do. That’s how Rondo played in Boston as well.   If you actually think Simmons would be better as a big you A. Don’t know what a big is in the modern NBA. B. Don’t know or understand Simmons’s game at any meaningful level. He’s like 6’10 so he’s not even big enough to be around protector and he’s not an elite rebounder. What are exactly would he be providing as a big relative to being a point Forward?"
"Other potential assistants Neil Olshey likes: Derrick Rose, Ben Rothelsburger, Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump."
"Good list. Derrick Rose, Joe Ingles,Boban, Tacko,"
"“Tony Parker was the closest and I even think Ben is faster than that,” Brown said, via Michael Pina of SB Nation. “There are times when we all think ‘oh he’s really fast.’ What I do is count the steps from foul line to foul line and there aren’t many. Count the dribbles. There aren’t many. He covers ground quicker than anybody I think that I’ve ever coached and the closest would be Tony.  ”And you’d all go back and you’d look at Russell Westbrook, maybe early days Derrick Rose. John Wall. Like, those greyhounds that just take off. But really, forget your stopwatch, count the dribbles and count the steps. He is elite when it comes to that part of the game.”  According to private data provided to SB Nation by NBA Advanced Stats, Simmons’ top recorded speed this year was 19.7 miles per hour, which translates to him racing the length of a court in roughly 3.25 seconds.   Direct quote above  If the Raptors try to get Simmons for OG, the 76ers laugh and hang up.  I like OG a lot but he’s not the same level as Simmons.  Some stats might say OG is number 2 in defensive versatility but from the games I’ve seen, I’d say:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Giannis  3. Kawhi 4. Healthy Issac  5. OG  Paul George, Tatum, playoff LeBron (might be too old now), Covington, Gordon, Butler, Bam, Smart, and Jrue are very versatile defensively too"
If no off the court then Derrick Rose should be on this list somewhere
"Context matters.   Ingram’s team had Zion as the leading scorer with 27PPG to Ingram’s 23.8.  The next leading scorer on the Pistons after Grant’s 22.3 was Derrick Rose with 14.2 before he left, and then Josh Jackson with 13.4."
You don't think Derrick Rose was the best in 2008?
"In the last 13 years, since 2007, five guards - Anthony Edwards, Markelle Fultz (yikes), Kyrie Irving, John Wall, and Derrick Rose - have been taken #1.      Only Fultz was a mistake IMO."
"I mean, look at the odds for any other single pick lmao. Draft isn't a science but you definitely have the best chance with 1.  This way of looking at it also ignores outcomes where you get a really really good player at #1 who just happens to not be the absolute best in the draft. Hakeem is the best player in almost any draft, just happened to be in the same class as MJ. AI and Kyrie were/are both excellent players that just happened to have all-timers hiding in the late lottery range. John Wall is the 2nd best career in that class and could have been argued as 1 at points. Blake Griffin was in MVP consideration at a certain point even though he was obviously not Harden/Steph. Derrick Rose won an MVP but got derailed by injuries. I think it's hard to truly feel bad about those picks."
"&gt; Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night.   That was at least rational at the time. OJ ended up 2nd in rookie of the year voting behind behind pre injury Derrick Rose the next year.  He just decided he liked getting high better than playing basketball, I think, and didn't pan out."
People forget that Derrick Rose sacrificed his ACL for that MVP. The dude didn’t know how to be efficient with his speed early on and his burst and landing were always not soft. Took him years to realize what he was doing wrong.
Reminds me of prime Derrick Rose bounce when he used to slice through the air for layups
"&gt; Derrick Rose is to this day the biggest what if in NBA history.  I mean Rose is up there, but Greg Oden, Sam Bowie, Len Bias to name a few off the top of the biggest ""What ifs"""
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
I still remember the day everyone gasped as he went down with the ACL injury. Just brutal. Derrick Rose is to this day the biggest what if in NBA history.
"he doesn't attack in weird angles like derrick rose and while Ja jumps high he's not as explosive like derrick rose was. His landing has improved in his second year, he plays at a slower pace while doing some reckless abandon attempts time to time.  Not like 24/7 like what rose and westbrook does."
Lowry - No  Lillard - Yes  Carmelo - Yes  Derrick Rose - No  Paul George - Probably   Kyrie - Yes  Kevin Love - No  Rudy Gobert - Maybe  Andre Iguodala - No
January 2010. Rose's second season in the league. He would win the MVP in his third season.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14158628/looking-back-game-derrick-rose-went-upstairs
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Usually when someone drops 40 no matter how they do it it’s still fairly noticeable   What if your layups are Derrick rose acrobat style?   I’m taking dropping 40 all day
Derrick Rose did. I'm worried Ja's gonna go the same route :(
"there are a lot of wilt chamberlain records that can come up here, but i think wilt and wes unseld's spot as the only players to win mvp as rookies is pretty much guaranteed to remain just them. given that players arent required to do 4 years of college, nobody with the potential to win mvp at 22-23 is going to stay in college until then like wilt and wes had to, for example derrick rose was in that age range but it was his third season and not his first."
He looks like a cross between MJ and Derrick Rose
"I think Derrick Rose's MVP record is definitely beatable. Had Luka won MVP this year, which was a very real chance, then he would have been younger than Rose. Zion is the only one who has a chance this year and it wouldn't surprise me if he took that next step. However, I feel like MVPs are given to the best player who has had MVP caliber seasons before their MVP season and we're beat out by another player who did the same thing a year prior. I doubt we will ever get a MVP who only had 1 MVP caliber season again."
Derrick Rose was absolutely majestic in the fast break. His dunks were filthy.

"&gt;The two records I can’t see being broken is Derrick Rose being the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22....Another one that probably won’t be broken for years is Devin Booker’s record for most total points in a players first playoff appearance with 601.  Those records will be broken soon IMHO because they were circumstantial records. Too many players now coming in the league at 19yrs old, for the DRose record to stand for long. And the Booker record for points is just not going to be that hard to break *---since it depends on an All-Star player being the #1 option on a team that makes it to the NBA Finals during his first time in the playoffs. That won't be so hard of a feat to repeat nowadays.*  **Records I see not being broken, are the ones that have stood for decades**. Such as  1961-'62 season when Wilt Chamberlain avg. 51ppg . Or the 1960-'61 season when Wilt avg. 27 rebounds per game ----then he did it again, the following season. I also think Mark Eaton's \[1984-'85\] record of nearly 6 blocks per game, may not be broken."
"When Nothing Else Matters - Washington Post beat reporter follows Jordan’s last two years and some of the internal struggles between a fading Basketball God, a new generation and a team mired in mediocrity.   The Last Pass - biography of Bob Cousy by Gary Pomerantz with interviews from the legend himself. The best parts are his interactions with Bill Russell, but all in all a great inside look at an era of basketball rarely seen.   Sam Smith’s The Jordan Rules are great too so I’ve heard, but never actually read it. His book I’ll Show You which appears to have been a ghostwritten autobiography by Derrick Rose is pretty hard to read.   The biographies of Kobe Bryant and MJ by Roland Lazenby are pretty great too but doesn’t really do a ton for you if you wanted something new, just a good wrap up of their careers  Bernard King’s autobiography Game Face was also just okay. He’s a very interesting person (his take on the NBA game is pretty unique). But the biography is pretty flawed in not mentioning MJ even once despite King having played through the latter half of his career in the same league."
"&gt;The two records I can’t see being broken is Derrick Rose being the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22 because it’s rare for a player that young to play on a team that good that early in their careers,  It's definitely rare, but it's not unheard of.  Magic was that good, that young and he won finals MVP as a 20-year-old rookie.  That's probably even rarer than what Rose did, but a great young player performing well on a team that's ready to compete is probably a once every 15 ish years type of thing.  If the narrative aligns I could definitely see that record being broken."
"Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash.  Pretty much every MVP that people dispute over because they look at the stat sheet in hindsight and didn’t watch the games"
PG - Jeremy Lin SG - D'Angelo Russell SF - Derrick Rose PF - Dirk Nowitzki C - Nikola Jokic  Admittedly pushing it here with the abysmally defensive 3 guard lineup but hey what can you do.
KD or D Rose. Both of them made me fall in love with basketball. I remember watching Derrick Rose at Memphis in 2008. Great times
"\&gt; Derrick Rose being the youngest MVP in NBA history at age 22 because it’s rare for a player that young to play on a team that good that early in their careers, and some people said Rose shouldn’t have won that year regardless.  Jonathan Kuminga."
Derrick Rose didn’t deserve his MVP
"If Derrick Rose was never injured he would be the best PG ever, and would be in the GOAT discussion."
I counter you with curry and Derrick rose

LeBron James  Dwight Howard  Anthony Davis  Derrick Rose  Kyrie Irving  Blake Griffin  John wall  Yao Ming  Karl Anthony Towns  Zion Williamson
Crazy thing is that MJ had at least a couple more seasons where he was the clear MVP and they didn't give it him because they got board.  LeBron should have another from the Derrick Rose year as well.
Derrick Rose before he got injured or D12
 &gt; Charles Barkley   &gt; Karl Malone  &gt; Allen Iverson  &gt; Steve Nash   &gt; Derrick Rose  &gt;What does it mean?  It means that they ran into other MVP's from their era who were better.  Barkley and Malone got denied by MJ.  Iverson got denied by Shaq.  Nash got denied by Duncan.  Rose got denied by Lebron and then by injuries (Rose is still active but he's a different player from his MVP days).
Do you judge Derrick Rose right now off his career before the ACL year or after the ACL tear
"Used to be Derrick Rose. Man, OG Derrick Rose. Blink and he's gone"
"Derrick Rose, the return 🌹"
Derrick Rose floater
"How many times have you heard *MULTIPLE players* not front office, fly cross-country to recruit a free agent?    I've heard star players might make pitches at home. For instance, Kobe pitched Dwight Howard back in 2011 or so to join the Lakers.  And Derrick Rose, when he was MVP, had no interest in recruiting Bron"
"How long are people going to make excuses for an aging or injured player?  Why don’t you guys do the same thing for others?   “Look man, Derrick Rose clearly isn’t himself. If you think the last 10 years is how D Rose plays then keep exposing yourself. He’s the youngest MVP ever, a great play maker, and it’s not his fault that his body failed him.”  You could literally make these excuses for any older or injury prone player ever. Why does lebron get this benefit of the doubt? He’s getting old. He’s getting nagging injuries the last few years. Father Time eventually gets to everyone.  But that’s not a good excuse to still have so many people saying “Yeah but but but he’s still the best in the world! Imagine if he’s completely injury free and plays like he’s 30 years old again!” Yeah keep imagining."
I think you would want someone that can create offense for themselves or others. 6th men types  So my best guess is current Lou Williams or Derrick Rose
"History isn't really going to give a damn about Derrick Rose beyond some kind of trivia question like ""who is the only NBA MVP not in the Hall of Fame?"".  There's plenty of ""what if"" type guys like Rose whose careers were derailed by injury - Ralph Sampson, Bill Walton, Greg Oden, etc.  Then you've got the tragedies like Reggie Lewis or Len Bias.  (And Len Bias is *the* biggest ""what if"")"
"show me all the times Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant made the playoffs without another All-Star  KAT made the playoffs with Jimmy when KAT was 22.    are you docking him because he couldn’t get past the 66 win Rockets with Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Andrew Wiggins, and pissed off Jimmy Butler?"
1970's - Dave Cowens and Bob McAdoo  Karl Malone in 1999  Derrick Rose and Steve Nash this century
"Derrick Rose will realistically be the answer to this question for decades.  Unless Jokic falls off a cliff suddenly, he's going to be an annual All-NBA player for years.  He's still only 26."
- Wes Unseld  - Derrick Rose  - Jokic
Derrick Rose stopped being good right after his MVP. He couldn't help it. He was injured all the time. And he clearly benefited from voter fatigue against Lebron.
Derrick Rose didn’t have a problem with KAT. Robert Covington didn’t have a problem with KAT. Taj Gibson didn’t have a problem with KAT. Ricky Rubio never had a problem with KAT. Literally no one ever had a problem with KAT but Butler yet somehow KAT is the one to blame for running people off his team. Gotcha. Great argument.
"Amnesty Perkins and meet Harden's demands during 2012 offseason. No Harden for Houston = no playoffs for Houston = unlikely injury for Westbrook (no Beverley). No one would have beaten that core after 2012, especially if Brooks were to be replaced with a more competent coach, and Miami wouldn't have been able to take advantage of Perkins during the likely 2013 finals rematch.  A close second would be encouraging FO to resist the application of the Derrick Rose rule to KD in 2011 which messed up OKC's salary situation and made OKC too stingy /cheap in dealing with upcoming free agents like Harden. No one can fault KD for trying to earn more, but everyone forgot that the application of that Derrick Rose rule meant OKC had less to offer to Harden.  The third would be drafting Curry instead of Harden. With Curry's injury problems during the early part of his career, OKC could have afforded keeping KD, WB, Ibaka and Curry and the GSW dynasty would not have occurred.  Fourth would be trading up further than the 11th pick during the 2010 draft to get either Hayward or PG13 instead of Aldrich (or at least drafting Sanders or Whiteside).  Fifth would be firing whoever that was making draft choices was infatuated with long/athletic non-shooters during the 2010s - OKC could have built a village with all the bricks from their 2010s draft picks.  And lastly, if none of the above were to have happened, I would have traded KD after his 2013-2014 season for Kawhi + Danny Green + picks (sure it would have looked stupid back then but knowing KD will leave without even yielding OKC some draft picks like what the Cavs did with Lebron when he first left would have made this better in retrospect). Westbrook + Green + Kawhi + Ibaka + Adams (or small-ball Westbrook + Green + Kawhi + Roberson + Ibaka) would have crushed the 73-9 GSW and Lebron in 2016."
"Before his injury sure, since Boston has IT had his Derrick Rose game where he puts on a clinic and drops 40?"

"Lebron and the heat didn't even have the 2nd best record, if he is so valuable how come he can't lead a team with 2 other HOFers starting to a 60 win season?  This isn't me trying to knock lebron but he just straight up didnt deserve that one, the bulls had less talent and a better regular season record and it is a regular season award. Derrick rose had the highest OBPM in the entire league, he wasn't just the best offensive player on a defensive team, the advanced metrics have him as the best offensive player in the entire league that season. Also he had 4.8 DWS so it's not like he was playing shit defense on a team with Noah covering him, that was literally his career year in terms of defensive metrics."
Derrick Rose?
"It doesn't go to the most valuable player all the time either, sometimes you give it to Derrick Rose."
"Speaks how poorly the MVP voting was.  The last SEVEN seasons, the winner of the MVP lead the league in PER.   Derrick Rose in the last decade had the worst PER to win MVP (at #9). Other than Steph Curry at #3 PER when he won MVP, every other MVP winner led the league in PER.  IIRC, When Nash won his MVP's he was #13 and #18 in PER. This is the worst PER ranking from 1980-onward to win the MVP.   In 1998-99 when Karl Malone won his 2nd MVP, Shaq lead the league in PER with 30.6. That's FIVE points higher than 2nd place Karl Malone at 25.6  While Karl Malone did have a higher VORP than Shaq, it was only by 0.1 (4.0 to 3.9)  Box +/-? Shaq lead 7.1 to Malone's 6.7 (#1 and #2 in the league)  But how did the MVP voting breakdown?   Malone got 827 points. Shaq got 89 points and finished SIXTH behind Mourning, Duncan,  Iverson, and Kidd.    Also Shaq lead the league  in PER in 1997-98 as well as 2000-01 (30.2 vs Iverson 24.0) as well as 2001-02 (29.7 vs Duncan 27.0)  Also in 2004-05, when Nash won his 1st MVP, Amar'e Stoudemire had a better PER than him.  Also in 2005-06, when Nash won his 2nd MVP, Shawn Marion, his teammate, had a better PER than him.    Shaq should have minimum 2 MVP if not 3.. and maybe 4.   Although Nash never took away any MVPs Shaq should have won."
"Dwight Howard was 2nd in MVP voting that year. Even if Derrick Rose didn't win (he fully deserved to win that year), Dwight would've been the runner up. It's absurd to think that people wanted LeBron to have that one."
They won 60+ games and Derrick rose in 2011 was a top ten player. People forgot how good that dude was
"Westbrook was the first MVP not to come from a 1 or 2 seeded team, right?  (season): [Best Record East] and [Best Record West]   20-21: Sixers and Jazz - Jokic in 1st, Embiid in 2nd, Gobert in 10th (Mitchell hurt a good portion of the year I'm pretty sure)   19-20: Bucks and Lakers - Giannis in 1st, LeBron in 2nd  18-19: Bucks and Warriors - Giannis in 1st, Steph in 5th  17-18: Raptors and Rockets - Harden in 1st, Demar in 8th  16-17: Boston and GS - Westbrook in 1st, Isaiah Thomas in 5th, Steph in 6th  15-16: Cleveland and GS - Steph in 1st, LeBron in 3rd  14-15: Atlanta and GS - Steph in 1st, no hawks received votes  13-14: IND and SAS- KD in 1st, PG in 9th, Duncan and Tony Parker tied for 12th  12-13: MIA and OKC - LeBron in 1st, KD in second   11-12: CHI and SAS - LeBron in 1st, Tony Parker in 5th, and Derrick Rose in 11th (only played 40 games)   10-11: CHI and SAS - Derrick Rose in 1st, Ginobili in 8th, Tony Parker in 12th  There is definitely a correlation between being the best player on the best team and getting MVP consideration, at least going back through the 2010s to today. Players can definitely break that mold (Westbrook) but it's definitely there"
"Yep. By contrast on first picks overall win shares:  48, 20.8, 65.9, 242, 138.2, 50.6, 18.9, 7.3, 42.8, 77.2, 44.1  So, if the first pick gets you a 50% chance of getting: Lebron, Blake Griffin, John wall, Derrick rose, Dwight Howard, or Yao Ming   That’s a better than 50% chance at an all NBA player. The two biggest busts are Bargaini and Oden."
Derrick Rose was worse.
"Because one requires 70+ games of work and means you had arguably the best season out of 500+ players in the NBA, and the other means you had a great 3-7 game stretch.    Even if you look historically, every MVP in league history has made it into the Hall of Fame, most of them first ballot, and the only active MVP who might not make it is Derrick Rose who will miss out exclusively because of injury.  Whereas there already is a FMVP who didn’t make it (Cedric Maxwell) with Iguodala and Billups also likely missing out.    FMVP is amazing, but it’s not on the level of the actual MVP award."
"i didn’t imply that, you inferred that.   i do think Derrick Rose is a game changer of sorts. anyone who watched what he did last year in elevating our team can attest. he was irreplaceable.   Fournier is just a guy. the difference is, he’s gonna get you damn near 20 a night on good efficiency while being a secondary shot creator. that opens up a lot of offense, and that particular skill set - to me - is more valuable than good perimeter defense."
A guy I thought might be on the best list: Derrick Rose 46.2% on 143 attempts.    A guy I thought might be on the worst list: RJ Barrett 35.9% on 128 attempts.    Checks out.
He was supposed to go number one if Derrick Rose wasnt from Chicago or if Chicago wasnt the number one overall pick.
I mean. Derrick rose got more first place MVP votes this past year than Luka. And the stats weren't  even close.
Every day Thibs checks in with Derrick’s agent to make sure he got out of bed. His agent hits Thibs back: “Derrick rose.”
"Every day he gets out of bed in the morning, Derrick rose."
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
"This narrative is so old. The only guys who played more than 30MPG last year were Randle and RJ and technically Bullock (who hit 30.0 on the dot).  Derrick Rose and the whisps of cartilage that remain in his knees played 27 minutes a game, which was very manageable until the playoffs when we literally could not play Elfrid Payton anymore.  This year with Kemba and Rose plus guys like McBride and IQ able to soak up some lead guard minutes Kemba and Rose will be fine."
"Mitchell Robinson is not close to Derrick Rose you clown.  Your supposed star choking is why you lost, not because of an injury and foul prone bench center being out."

"Except you know, this year when he flamed out against the Suns in the first round and his first year when he could not even get into the playoffs.  But yes, he sure did get into the finals every year when he had a stacked superteam in the weak East. So impressive beating Derrick Rose and his squad of bell bottoms when you have Wade and Bosh on your side, or alternatively Kyrie and Love.   ""But what about 2018?!"" Yes its totally impressive that Oladipo dragged you to a 7 game series, just before you got swept again in the finals and set history as the only player to get swept twice in the finals. Very impressive indeed.  At least he got his mickey mouse ring in the west."

"People act like the Wolves never had talent when almost every year they are a dark horse playoff team. I spent like five years thinking, “oh man, these Wolves are a team to watch!” until I realized KAT just doesn’t make anyone any better. They underperform every year. It certainly doesn’t help him that Wiggins never ever developed at all considering his own hype.   I think it is also telling that Jimmy Butler couldn’t get out of Minnesota fast enough, because all he wants to do is win and he didn’t feel like MN was the right place for that. A lot of that was on KAT. If you are the dominant big everyone says he is, than there would almost be no better team to be on than the Wolves for Jimmy. I mean, that 17-18 team was absolutely loaded. KAT, Butler, Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Jamal Crawford, Taj Gibson with Tom Thibodeau coaching and people act like KAT never had any help.  They were the 8th seed after Jimmy got hurt halfway through the season. They were in the top 4 of the West before that. It’s like KAT tries to not make the playoffs. I’m sure if the season were ten games longer, they probably would have missed it then too.   All those underperforming seasons really soured me on KAT."
derrick rose
Derrick Rose
Uhhh Philly won as an 8 after Derrick Rose shredded his knee and my heart. Idk if that’s the best example.
Derrick Rose
"2012 Derrick Rose. Great that he made it back, but there was still growth to be had from that point.  Klay Thompson. 2019 &amp; 2020. He handled the knee like a G, but this had to be the most pointless Achilles tear ever."
He committed to the pro-am games before this year's summer league and requested the time off to do it. I don't see why we wouldn't let him. It's not like that time Derrick Rose just went AWOL in the season and not tell anyone.
"You a stupid mf, ain't you? The delusion that you exuberate is disgusting, now out of ALL the players to ever play for the Bulls, you pick Derrick Rose... You know the mfin GOAT played for the Bulls, right? I am immensely dissapointed in you for not picking Artis Gilmore"
As a bulls fan I’d say Derrick rose
Derrick Rose. That Bulls team would have been a beast if he didn’t get injured
I remember watching this clip a while ago about derrick rose and he would pull out a bag of candy when hes on the bench and just munch on them

"Yes but DRose never got to be as good as he should be. People love to act like NBA fans are dick riding Rose for no reason and while that may be true for some fans, those same people forget that DRose had great success and some of the best moments of early 2010's.. in 3 years. From rookie season to 22 years old. And he never played that well again. Hard to imagine a world where Derrick Rose doesn't get injured and doesn't win at least one more MVP and a championship."
"He’s already a little forgotten unfortunately, Derrick Rose is his name 🥲 Edit: Just saw the other commenters mentioning this &amp; don’t want to rub it in lol   D. Rose will probably be remembered for his MVP, bright future &amp; him reinventing his self as a role player. Perseverance essentially, that &amp; his name is in a lot of rap songs."
Hate to say it but possibly Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose: So forgettable that people who remember him can't spell his name.
Man...idc. Derrick Rose will always grt a spot on my team
Didn’t Derrick Rose do some crazy shit too and he’s still very much widely loved?
"Age doesn’t matter lol, youre either better than a player or you’re not, and the facts are he only sustained that level of play for 1 season until his body broke down. I literally remember Derrick rose from Simeon on to his whole career, I’m not forgetting anything at all."
Hedo Turkoglu &gt; Derrick Rose
Luka Doncic is already better than Derrick Rose ever was
"The response to my comment shows that this is wildly unpopular for sure haha. Think Derrick rose gets mystified a lot, he was a great player for sure and deserved his MVP but saying a 28-30year old player is better than a 23 year old (at the time of his injury) isn’t that crazy to me"
1. Derrick Rose  2. Ron Harper  3. Kirk Hinrich
"He was Prime Derrick Rose, before Derrick Rose, but built like Harden/Lowry + 5 Hamburgers/day diet"
"Overrated. He’s seen in the same light as Derrick Rose and Penny Hardaway is. “If he was healthy”. Well he wasn’t healthy, he was a great player but you’d think he was in WCF battling Kobe wit how this sub treats him."
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Derrick rose
"Derrick Rose used to be up there. Did y'all know, Rose is faster with the ball than without."
"Sure but the easier competition helped fuel that, there where so many dumpster fire teams then, that was prime process 76ers time. The post Derrick Rose bulls, pre Blake pistons, lots of sub par rebuilding and retooling competition to feast on"
"Just because the team can withhold pay for failure to render services doesn't mean they will.  For example, the Rockets could have fined Harden for the games he missed while holding out last season. But they didn't.  Ditto for Kyrie's absences from the Nets. The NBA fined him for skipping media sessions and for violating Covid rules by attending an indoor party, but not for missing games after going AWOL.  For an example going the other way, in 2017 the Knicks fined Derrick Rose for no-showing a game vs NO. Rose missed the game because he was contemplating retirement.  Obviously Wiggins doesn't have the franchise-level pull that Harden or Kyrie have, but he is probably a more valuable asset than 2017 Rose. So GS could go either way on how leniently they want to treat him."
I’d be crushed if we fumble the bag this season and give him a reason to leave. He’s the best thing to happen to the bulls since Derrick rose
"Top 5-7 is also top 10.  MVP ladder… yeah  I don’t really care. You think Julius Randle, Derrick Rose and Rudy Gobert were top 10 players in 2021, they were all top 10 in MVP voting.  It’s okay he was a teenager, and he was significantly better as a teenager than Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett who are two top 20 players of all time. LeBron I believe is second only to Jordan, there is no reason to pretend he was better than he was in 2003-2004."
"&gt;In what way exactly Kyrie, Dame, Luka and Lowry accomplished more than Rondo?  All these guys have more all nba and allstar selections  than Rondo. Except Luka who was 2 allstars to Rondo's 4 but he has 2 1st Teams compared to Rondo's 1 3rd team.  &gt;Again, Rondo is the best defender out of these names and only Luka can compete with him regarding playmaking ability.  Rondo is MAYBE the best defender out of them but he's easily the worst offensive player out of everyone I listed. You could argue on Chauncey and Lowry being better defenders. Rondo is basically a smaller, much less talented Ben Simmons that isn't afraid to shoot.  &gt;And since when does the point guard has to be the best player of his team and be a leading scorer?  They don't. But everyone I mentioned has that ability and Rondo doesn't.  &gt;But still go watch the Celtics run in 09 playoffs when KG was injured and tell me if Rondo wasn't the best player of that team, and since you're watching go see his work on defense against guys like Billups and Rose..  You mean vs an old Billups and rookie Derrick Rose. So that one time match up puts him ahead of them when Billups has a fmvp and lead his team to 6 conference finals and Rose went on to be the youngest MVP ever."
"The only exception I can think of where you have an early 20s talent that has this level of production in the early years and doesn't become a first ballot HOFer would be Derrick Rose.  With Rose, that's only because of injury.  I'm certain he would be considered at the top of his generation without that.  .Luka is 22 and this will be his 4th year.  If he doesn't play like a top 10 or top 5 player he would strongly buck the development pattern that all the other greats follow."
"TIL 3 straight years of excellency is recency bias.  Plus, you know, this is a ranking for right now, not best players of the last decade.  Why the fuck do you think récent seasons dont apply to à ranking for the present? You make zero sense, clearly just a Giannis hater trying desperately to justify the unjustified.  You upset that Dywane Wade and Derrick Rose aren't in the top 15?  After all, it's just recency bias to consider the fact that it's not 2011 still!"
"What a stupid question. Dirk= HOF, Jokic... well he pretty much just started, who knows could turn out to be a Derrick Rose, where really good and then injury ruins your chance for greatness."
Derrick rose won an MVP keep his name out of this.
So would’ve derrick rose. Talking absolutes so early in just comes off a bit ridiculous imo
"He'll play, but its like leonnard or people quick to forget Grant hill. There whole career and short career at that is on the line to trust who they have. Grant hill had all the people calling him a wuss and even his own organization leaking  things, similar to Derrick Rose, Luol Deng or even Hakeem in the 90s.  Its a hard thing bc the body is dependent on the person, thats why a stand out organization lost trust with Leonard.  So zion who has such a unique body type now has lost trust with their training program and Griffins method.  Those are not guys who make the headlines but for players they deal with it each day. Trust that your golden goose career is handled right by a guy who came in and over promised and underdelived and from coaching and players has made wrong moves, its fair if the trust is there to be skeptical.  So he'll paly. hes not sitting out, but he won't play with their training practice schedule if he doesnt have to. The offseason stuff isn't apart of their contract"
I would say that honor goes to Derrick Rose. Joker is super young and poised to become a HOF. He’ll be Dirk 2.0
Oh man Derrick Rose without injuries...  Damn man thats a top 5 guard right there.
And I totally forgot Derrick Rose was on the knicks before this stint.
"No, pretty much 55/60 rookies priority is already fit (propably an even bigger percentage for internationals) and when it comes down to those elite 5 talents, I think it isn't that easy. I doubt Zion (as an example) would have gone to the Lakers being a 2nd unit guy behind LBJ and Davis, but I do think Charlotte would have had a good chance. Derrick Rose would have ended up in Chicago for sure and OKC would have had a good chance to get Blake Griffin or Trae Young. Back in 2013 OKC would have been the team that could have snatched some elite rookie, in the 2000s San Antonio and Detroit could have delivered great opportunities. I think this 'big market doomsday scenario' isn't really realistic. They all have billionaires funding the whole thing, there are enough options convincing a young player of yourself, especially those who just want to ball. If a Luka Doncic is ballsy enough to step into the spotlight right away, then I'm also cool with it."
"AD’s fine. If we’re giving Karl Malone’s health and endurance to anyone, it’s Derrick Rose"
"RJ is an overrated defender, Randle is an overrated defender.  How the heck did we end up with the top 3 defense in the league then? Derrick Rose?"
Derrick Rose Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen Dennis Rodman Pau Gasol
"Derrick Rose, Dwayne wade, and Lebron James.   We will only score in the paint."
Derrick Rose and Grant Hill are in the same category.
"Derrick Rose wasn't even a top 5 player his ""MVP"" year."
"Yea it’s a pretty favorable filter to add.  I have Derrick Rose, CP3, Westbrook, Jason Terry, Jason Kidd, Deron Williams, Tony Parker, Mo Williams, Rondo, TJ Ford, Chauncey Billups, Nate Robinson, Steve Nash, and Baron Davis all come to mind as better than Janet Nelson. He was barely a starter by league standards."
Derrick Rose is overrated.
Westbrook and Derrick Rose before he changed his shot pass that threshold of jumping “too high” to the point that as fatigue set in it affects their natural shot. Theres a cool basketball breakdown video with Coach Nick on YouTube if your interested
Griezmann switched from Atletico to Barca. But he stayed Team Derrick Rose.
"I’ll always love Kirk. I loved the intensity he brought to those young Bulls teams. Come playoff time he was able to elevate his game and scrape every last drop of his potential. He was a great mentor too and usually took the rookies under his wing. Derrick Rose credited Kirk as one of the guys who really helped him. That’s incredible when you consider Rose was basically there to take his starting PG job. Kirk knew Rose was going to be the better player and did everything he could to support him. Rose also lobbied the front office to re-sign Kirk after he spent time on the Hawks and Wizards. Rose didn’t even try to help recruit Lebron, but he did for Kirk. That tells you how great of a teammate he must have been.  They called him Captain Kirk for a reason. Not the best player, but a fucking fantastic leader and selfless player. I think he’s too much of a family man to get into coaching, but I have a feeling he would be great at it if he made that decision."
"KG to the 1996 Bulls would keep them a dynasty after MJ left.  Derrick Rose to the Grizzlies would be interesting, maybe they never trade Pau to the Lakers.  D-Wade to the Bucks with Michael Redd would be a contender.   OKC might have forfeited Harden to get Blake Griffin.  Jaylen Brown on the Warriors maybe makes them still legit contenders."
TIL DeAarron Fox is MVP Derrick Rose and the Kings still suck ass
Derrick Rose' TS% was better relative to era. But yeah I kinda see what you mean.
"Derrick Rose didn't change his entire game in a single off season. It took literally years of rehab and practice. No one can re-invent their entire game in a single off season.  Clearly Westbrook understands he needs to modify how he plays as he gets older, but do not expect huge changes this year. It is very hard to break what is probably like 25+ years of playing and shooting the way he used to. Especially as a long season rolls on and fatigue sets in your body reverts to what it knows."
"Derrick Rose. Westbrook is arguably the hardest working player in the league, itll dedication and a reality check for sure, but if he doesnt have to jump out of the building for every shot like this videos he could have a role similar to Rose rn in his golden years"
"Also Joakim Noah  And none of the Bulls jerseys I have are currently with the team: Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah (autographed), Kirk Hinrich (I got lucky at a thrift store and found a jersey from his first tenure right before his second tenure), Michael Jordan (another getting lucky at a thrift store). Being able to wear a YL or YXL helps with thrifting."
"Walton the tip in, Bryant with the save. Final seconds, Bryant for the win, bang! https://youtu.be/rMs8bnQTE9A  Sefolosha will throw in. Here is Durant... For the win!

MVP Derrick Rose
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
I know Bulls fans are gonna shit on me (they are doing it for years) but i really don't think Derrick Rose is that wholesome. I'm not gonna say anything about he did it or not i'm not the one to decide but we all know what he said during trial.
"my teams: Wiz, Knicks, Kings, Rockets, Spurs, Hornets, Grizz  this is a tough list of teams  PG: Derrick Rose (4)  SG: Bradley Beal (1)  SF: Dillon Brooks (5)  PF: Thad Young (3)  C: Christian Wood (2)  6th: Harrison Barnes (6)  Bench: Kelly Oubre Jr (7)"
"Timberwolves, Suns, Spurs, Knicks, Nuggets, Hawks, Pistons.  PG: Chris Paul (2nd)  SG: Hamidu Diallo (5th)   SF: Michael Porter Jr (3rd)  PF: Danilo Gallinari (6th)  C: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  6th: Derrick Rose (4th)  7th: Doug McDermott (7th)"
How can people say Derrick Rose when he’s still in the league as a perfectly serviceable guard currently? Also AI had a pretty long career so that one is a head scratcher as well.   My vote is for Brandon Roy.
Derrick rose is first in line
derrick rose maybe
"Cam had one of the all time college careers, then went to the NFL where he was dominant and an MVP for a time then was derailed by injuries.   I think Bill Walton and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Derrick Rose."
Derrick Rose
Derrick rose
"Of course, the best and possibly only answer from the last 15 years is Derrick Rose."
I absolutely agree i thought derrick rose instantly. Hes still doing wel but the guy was the youngest mvp. Think hes the perfect answer
"I mean, lebron kinda thoroughly kicked his ass the one time they truly met in the playoffs— 2011 ECF. It was a 5 gamer (a *close* 5 gamer, iirc). But there was absolutely no doubt who was better. Lebron literally guarded— and shut down— the prime, high-flying, quick-as-hell Derrick rose.  Af a certain point, lebron had no rival because literally no one can match his athleticism and body. Steph was a fun foil because he was no where near a physical match, but the shooting was so transcendent that he became a legitimate foe to lebron for a couple years"
Derrick Rose…
Not trying to sound cliché but Derrick Rose
Derrick rose?
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose.
"&gt; As for the MVP, it is an award relative to the strength of your peers, and it is also narrative-driven, meaning it’s intrinsically flawed.  I'd argue this is an example of a good argument that doesn't actually help your case.   You're right that the strength of an MVP should be seen in the context of its time but your implication that Kobe faced more competition is wrong.  Bird had more competition in those years than Kobe. When we talk about Bird being Top 2 for 7 out of 8 years, the only year he came 3rd was because Jordan and Magic were 1 and 2.  Kobe never really faced that sort of competition.  &gt;Also if we are arbitrarily looking at Top-2 finishes, Bryant has 2 more Top-5 finishes.  During his prime, the **only** people who beat out Bird were:  * Kareem  * Erving  * M. Malone  * Magic  * Jordan  When it came to MVP voting, prime Bird only ever really lost out to consensus all-time top 20 players having one of the best years of their careers.  Kobe lost to guys like LeBron and Shaq but in his top 5 finishes he would also lose out to the likes of:  * Rose  * Dirk  * Jermaine O'Neal  * Stojaković	  * Nash   * Dwight   * Kidd  * McGrady  Still great players, but as you can see, he lost to a lot of guys Bird would never have lost to.    Along the way, Bird would beat out guys like Drexler and Wilkins. He would tower over young Hakeem, Isiah, Barkley and K.Malone.  Bird wasn't losing to a young Derrick Rose or Dwight Howard."
So basically you’re saying Derrick rose would have been his rival if he could stay healthy
Derrick rose?
Isn't the obvious answer Derrick Rose. I know he is still a pretty productive NBA player but he is certainly not at the same MVP level and doesn't start.
Derrick Rose. Both got MVPs they didn’t deserve too.
Derrick Rose already has one
Derrick Rose.
derrick rose for sure.
Derrick Rose maybe based off your description?
Derrick rose
Derrick Rose
"Ralph Sampson, Bill Walton, Derrick Rose. This sub is too young and is comparing non #1 pick generational talents to Cam who when healthy and young is a unicorn at his position."
"Odell Beckham Jr. and Derrick Rose.  Early in their careers were viewed as some of the explosive highlight reel players and close to the best at their positions, but injures slowed them down and they both got traded much earlier than you'd expect based on how good they were not long prior. They are still very solid players now and at their best can put up great numbers here and there, but they definitely aren't what they used to be."
Bo Jackson and Derrick Rose?
Maybe Derrick Rose?
Derrick Rose isn’t as outspoken as Cam also DRose reinvented himself.
John Wall maybe? Derrick rose comp above was good
Derrick Rose was the youngest MVP.
It’s Derrick Rose and there’s really no other player that matches Cam better. He had an insane MVP season. Went off in the playoffs and nearly beat LeBron (Cam made the Super Bowl). And then proceeded to get injured constantly and just never got back up until recently where he’s been a 6man. Cam could still find himself on the bench somewhere (MAYBE starter on some desperate team) if he decided to not be a dumbass
"Cam’s prime was MVP. IT4 was never actually MVP material. Cam was also the best player on the best team that season, but fell short to an all-time great. Derrick Rose is a much better comparison."
Yup. Gilbert was an mvp level guy and then completely flamed out. IT was never really an mvp level guy except one freak year. AI and Derrick rose have had successful long careers so they’re not really fair even if rose never got back to his early peak. Grant hill is kind of similar to Derrick rose too in that he still rehabbed himself into a borderline all star.
"Ralph Sampson? Derrick Rose? It’s a tough comp, because the “diminished ability” phase plays out very differently for a quarterback than any basketball position."
"I meant that they both thought they were better than they actually were. Great stats. Great individual play. Little impact on winning.  When they got injured, they could never adapt their game to be effective. This is why Derrick Rose is a bad comp. Derrick Rose can impact winning, even post injury."
Derrick Rose
How is Allen Iverson the comparison when Iverson had a full career and is one of the best players ever?  I think Derrick Rose is the most obvious example.
Derrick Rose but Cam couldn't make the same revival/reinvention with the chance he had with the Pats.
Allen Iverson played 14 seasons where he averaged 26.7 PPG (7th all time). He might be the greatest ball handler and finisher at the rim in NBA history. His signature crossover-move changed the game forever. He’s an NBA icon and a Hall of Famer. Not a fair comparison.   To answer your question tho - I think Derrick Rose might be a better comparison. Former MVP - injuries derailed his career
Derrick Rose fits your description
"Derrick Rose makes 30% of John Wall’s salary…  That’s your example?   Okay, maybe if he works really hard and does something he hasn’t done in 5 years, he can be almost as good as a guy who makes 30% of his salary lmaooooo"
Who would have thought Derrick Rose could get to where he is today?
"Not saying this is my final answer, but I would have loved to have had Jazz legend Derrick Rose at his peak"
"AI led the league in scoring 4x over a period of 7 years and could average &gt;30pts as late as 2007. By no sane standard is that a ""brief peak"", we're not exactly talking about Derrick Rose here  &gt;His high usage in Philly wasn’t only because there were no better options, he maintained that high usage through his whole career  This is just a flat out lie, AI went from leading the league in USG multiple times as a Sixer to straight down closer to average as a Nugget. For reference lower than either of Kawhi or PG for the Clippers this past year and about equivalent with Lou Will. His TS% went up to his career high those years too, higher than average in fact.  &gt;even when he really SHOULD have become more of a playmaker for others when he finally had better teammates  This part doesn't even make sense, there are practically no great playmakers that don't have a high usage, off the top of my head you're talking like Manu and Draymond and not a whole many others. Even Jokic as one of the most nontraditional playmakers we've ever seen has a 29.6 usage"
The Derrick Rose one got dark
From 2011-2018 the only all nba first team player lebron beat in the east was derrick rose in 2011. Literally kawhi leonard made all nba first team in 2021 and that team was better than every team lebron faced from 2011-2018. There is a reason why after making 8 straight finals lebron missed playoffs in the west (lakers had a losing record when he played in 2018) and lebron got his first round exit this year. In fact lebron without ad in the west missed the playoffs and lost to the first round. Luka without an ad type player had historic stats in the postseason which is actually really impressive.
[Bonus Derrick Rose](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+office+i%27m+ready+to+be+hurt+again&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmoZn19YTzAhWyl60KHRCzC08Q2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=the+office+im+read&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQARgAMgQIABANMgQIABANMggIABAIEA0QHjIFCCEQqwI6CAgAEIAEELEDOgcIABCxAxBDOgQIABBDOgUIABCABFDNpxRY68MUYMXKFGgBcAB4AIABugGIAZsNkgEEMC4xM5gBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=-_dDYaa4ErKvtgWQ5q74BA&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=nivx#imgrc=MQm-c166OKjoaM)
I'm totally down for that. Honestly I think DeMar would be best as our super 6th man like Derrick Rose was for the Knicks last year. Better distribution of offense &amp; defense between the starters &amp; bench.
"Fr, like Lavine for Derrick Rose? Easy"
Derrick Rose....oof
Derrick Rose one is outta pocket
It's funny you say that bc I was just thinking about that as a Timberwolves fan. We have sucked so long that almost our entire fanbase is hardcore and loyal and humble. You'd have to be to follow this team. By sheer probability and statistics SOMEDAY we'll be good again (maybe in 20 years? Hey the Clippers did it) and we'll get bandwagon fans who could then be terrible like this. It'll be weird. Bc this isn't like a year or two of bad basketball. It's basically 15 years and other than some Derrick Rose Stans it's been just us for a long time. TLDR: Someday Timberwolves fans will have to deal with an identity crisis (if we're lucky).
We'll give you Derrick Rose and usage rights to the Eye of Agimoto.
"I said most successful PG. Wade is a SG. Additionally I considered him being more sensational (which is meaningless and hard to quantify) as a player but in terms of recognizing them as a Chicago product I think Rose has to get the edge and with how electric he was during his tenure and the narrative surrounding his comeback. While Wade is a Chicagoan and played as a Bull he never game close to capturing Chicago’s heart or really creating anywhere near the hype in Chicago itself for any team. But within the city and probably national Derrick is seen more “Chicago” because he was drafted by the Bulls where as Wade was nearly a Heat lifer and is very, very much synonymous with Miami Heat Basketball."
It’s the Basketball Hall of Fame not the NBA Hall of Fame. Derrick Rose is the most sensational athlete to come out of Chicago and other than Isiah Thomas IMO the most successful Chicago PG EVER. Last I checked I think his collegiate career would unfortunately be overlooked but that with being the youngest MVP in NBA history should guarantee him a spot.
"""The legal definition of sex offender isn't even accurate, but my personal definition is, and derrick rose is guilty of it.""  Very thorough and thought out things we are coming up with here today."
The old Derrick Rose cult in Chicago was ridiculous
"The biggest what if in NBA history, IMO. I really believe, to this day, Derrick Rose would’ve been the greatest PG of all time if he never got hurt."
"“What does this mean for you Derrick?”  “Man… everything, man… I worked my ass off bro”  From a choked up and very emotional D Rose, will never fail to pull a few heart strings and make my chest cave in. An amazing moment."
"This is exactly why I hate judging HOF standards by stuff that's voted on. Every year we debate obvious snubs and disagree on who was named what, but then years down the line, it's all treated as objective fact.  Although I don't think I've seen anyone say Derrick Rose shouldn't have been MVP that year (he pretty much won in a landslide).  On a side note, it's interesting that LeBron won it the two years before and the two years after."
That’s not true. If we compare him to bill walton they had very similar career trajectories. If Derrick rose can manage to be a sixth man or decent contributor to a championship team I think he’s a lock.
"MILWAUKEE-Asked Walmart cashier:  “God, did you hear about Derrick Rose?”  Cashier: “No.”  Me: “ACL. He tore it.”  Thought he would cry."
https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-derrick-rose-verdict-20161019-snap-story.html   We'll never know
How come people haven't moved on? I'm sure Derrick Rose already has.
I love Derrick Rose
I think he was talking more towards playing for many years to come. Derrick Rose may not be what he was 10 years ago but he is def not washed lol
"I mean that’s what CP has done, and if he were so dirty or played so far outside the rules he would be punished for it. But ya Derrick Rose is also an NBA point guard and he is actually deserving of hate for his actions, which makes him relevant."
Derrick Rose couldn’t possibly be less relevant here. I was pointing out how ridiculous it is that you think CP3 gets hate for “kicking the league’s ass” lol
Me too. It was my freshman year at RIT and I remember being very stressed out from studying. I was streaming the game in my dorm and it’s one of those days I’ll never forget. Derrick Rose is so special to the city and I remember feeling a part of me died that day.
The whole City will stop what they are doing to watch when Derrick Rose is honored.
I never liked him much anyways but derrick rose fans are cancerous tumors on society’s left ass cheek
"I remember exactly where I was. I was taking a piss because I thought the game was over, and my daughter yelled Derrick Rose is hurt. She was like six years old"
Kobe stans and the Derrick Rose cult take turns being the most embarassing sub group of NBA fans.
Derrick Rose
Nobody:  ESPN:   &gt;WAS DERRICK ROSE TEARING HIS ACL CHICAGO SPORT’S 9/11?   &gt;STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT.
He’s getting the same calls Derrick Rose recieved for the past 6 years and he doesn’t know what to do. This is not suprise James Harden  has always had the most padded/shallow stats of all time. Look wht happens when he doesn’t get free throws all those “missed shots” are no longer counted as fouls and now his % is in the gutter and his ppg is cut in half
"If you need any more proof that the draft is rigged, see the Derrick Rose trade."
 it was mesmerizing seeing how much noise derrick rose would generate at *away* games while being so young. i'm watching old highlight videos and it really just takes me back
They made a little run in 2014-2015 when they went 50-32. They were also really good during Derrick Rose prime years. So from like 2010-2015 they were a pretty solid team. A lot better than the Bucks during that time.
Derrick Rose the best point guard in New York
"You want him to fall. It lessens the impact on a huge body like that. Look at Russ, embid, lebron-  they almost always fall. Compare it to young derrick rose as an example as to why it’s good"
"I'm surprised Derrick Rose didn't make top 75. Youngest MVP in league history, took the Bulls to a 62-20 record by being the only star on the team, went against the Cavs in the Playoffs in 2009 and actually gave LeBron hell."
I swear Dante Exum was supposed to be a taller prime Derrick Rose
Yep. Imagine if Derrick rose was taught to land softly or let himself fall and absorb impact with his body rather than violently sticking one leg into the ground on lands. History could’ve been rewritten
"then they claim it’s because ad is “injury prone” and that’s his fault somehow and we should dislike him because of it but then love saying shit like “imagine derrick rose career without all the injuries, sucks man so much potential”"
&gt;Derrick Rose has to be on that list of the biggest differentials  I genuinely think Rose in his MVP year was more athletic than Westbrook. Maybe psychologically he was at a disadvantage because he didn't have the caliber of OKC teammates like KD and Harden.  The way I feel about not seeing a healthy dominant Derrick Rose is the way old timers talk about whether Len Bias could've been as good as Michael Jordan.
"It’s “could”, and yes, in any given generation there are probably 20-25 guys who’d be top 10 in the league for a couple seasons or more if everything breaks right. Everything very often doesn’t break right, hence John Wall and Derrick Rose and hell, maybe even Greg Oden."
*future Hall of Famer Derrick Rose
2009 was Rondo. 2010 was Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose is a HOFer. I don't think his injury history holds him back enough to keep him out.
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
It's cool that Matisse was probably watching Derrick Rose on tv when he was in sixth grade and now he's guarding him at MSG
Derrick Rose better than Westbrook.
Derrick Rose has to be on that list of the biggest differentials
"I liked the adidas short sleeved jerseys.  Kawhi would possibly be a 3x champ by now with the Raptors had he stayed in Toronto.  Celtics would’ve won Game 7 of the 2010 Finals if they had Kendrick Perkins. I rewatched the game and they couldn’t rebound for shit without him. So many second opportunities for LA.   Derrick Rose was never bad before his career resurgence in New York. His first Knicks run, Wolves, and Pistons runs were all pretty decent. He just wasn’t MVP level so he had super high expectations. The only exception was his Cleveland stint but that team was a ticking time bomb before half the team got traded.  The 2009 Magic get too disrespected. They were way ahead of their time in play style. They had great 3 point shooting and prime Dwight Howard.   George Hill deserves just as much blame as JR Smith for losing Game 1 of the 2018 Finals. No missed free throw = no JR situation   Lebron being on Kobe’s team will always feel wrong to me. He could be in LA another 4 years and it wouldn’t matter.   The Grizzlies have the most consistently clean jerseys in the league   The NBA needs to relocate the Pelicans. They will forever be a dead in the water franchise as long as they’re in New Orleans with that stupid name"
Derrick Rose should be part of the 75 greatest players list and a future hall of fame inductee. We never really got to see his prime but Rose achieved the pinnacle of individual awards by being an MVP at such a young age. MVP’s should be a lock when it comes to these types of recognition
I think Deron was better than CP3 for at least the first 2-3 years of their careers. Not saying Deron was the ever best in the league. But Steve Nash won 2 MVPs when CP3 was in the league. Tony Parker and the Spurs were winning championships so he had a case for a year or two. Then Derrick Rose and Westbrook started heating up with Rose winning an MVP. Also Rondo had a case for a year or so. So my point is CP3 was never the clear cut best PG in the league when others were excelling pass him in their careers.
Add Derrick Rose to that list
The 2011-2012 Bulls team with a healthy Derrick Rose in the playoffs.
"Derrick Rose for the Bulls.  I think there will still be bad blood after doctors cleared him to play but [he sat out the 2013 Playoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/sports/basketball/decision-by-the-bulls-derrick-rose-to-sit-out-was-prudent-if-not-popular.html)  Also how have the Hornets not retired [Larry Johnson's number yet?](https://swarmandsting.com/2020/05/04/charlotte-hornets-larry-johnson-jersey-retired/) For us old-timers, his Grandmama character was as big in the '90s as Uncle Drew is today."
"Former Utah Jazz player, Derrick Rose?"
Derrick Rose Stans are a strange breed.
yeah that third Derrick Rose year was a Joakim Noah year if we're being honest lol
Was Derrick Rose his generations AI?
He is more like Derrick Rose
"He's more MVP Derrick Rose. Same size, explosive quickness, explosive hops, incredible athleticism, good passing, can finish on anyone, but not as physically strong as Rose was."
I get more Derrick Rose
I mean the Derrick Rose years were really like only two years or so. Not like he had a lot of chances in his MVP form to start 4-0
Find that hard to believe. The Derrick Rose years were pretty good
Hard to dislike Stacey King. He had some goat calls during the Derrick Rose era
The similarities to Derrick Rose are just freaky.
The derrick rose flop incident was lebron's finest performance
&gt; He’s like Derrick Rose lite  I don't see what's lite about him. He's a better passer than Rose ever was
That comment from PG comparing him to Derrick Rose looks even better now.  What an acrobatic and skilled finish...
"He’s like Derrick Rose lite, some of the acrobatic maneuvers he was finishing was just crazy. I said he made the jump after the play ins and short series against the Jazz And was downvoted. We’ll see how he continues to progress as the season goes along. So far so good."
"Derrick Rose said it himself, at least 85% of the league is on gear"
So derrick rose like?
I need glasses. I swear thats prime Derrick rose out there.
"He has confidence in it which is all I really care about at this point. I just watched Derrick Rose go 9/14 from 3 over two games. If you work hard and your shot isn't broken, the shooting will come."
33yo derrick rose is better than kemba wild….
Like Derrick Rose with a slightly worse handle and doesn’t have that stepback middie that was near impossible to guard
"I know it sounds weird but prime Derrick Rose would be insane with a team tailored to him. Looking back now those Bulls teams were pretty clunky with Noah, Deng, Boozer and then Bogans or Rip. Imagine him with shooters and an athletic big man."
I guess you were one of those morons who thought Derrick Rose would be the greatest point guard ever?
"Body comp wise I see more Dwayne Wade than Derrick Rose, but that's splitting hairs. They're only 1-2 inches within each other height wise and both Wade and Rose are two of the most explosive players in recent memory. Rose certainly looks the most explosive because he was shortest of the 3, the way he could just blitz to the basket and finish was incredible."
"&gt; but I’ve been watching Derrick Rose highlights for like two years  that's a really long time man, you should probably take like a week off."
"Stop it! Stop it!! What are you doing, Dragic!? Did you not get the memo?! Derrick Rose can GO  UP  STAIRS"
I know this sounds crazy...but I believe this team can be just as good or even better than the Derrick Rose bulls.  Only time will tell.
Does anybody know how to post videos to Facebook? 🤣🤣  Derrick Rose era commentary but still funny! 😁
"I’m not a Bulls fan, but I’ve been watching Derrick Rose highlights for like two years so I know who Stacey King is"
"Those were the 2000s team tho  90s we’re centered around Mark Jackson, Rik Smits, Dale and Antonio Davis, Derrick McKey.  Chris Mullin and Jalen Rose for the later 90s runs."
"I like how Bill Simmons put it on his pod,  The players were voted in based on how impactful they were for their time, not based on their actual skill level/peak. Otherwise guys like Derrick Rose and Luka would have been voted off sheer talent alone. The base list came from the 1996 NBA 50 list, with an additional 25 added to it now.   In an ideal world, they could have done a total re-do so (obviously) better players like Dwight and even Jokic could have made it, but it'd be pretty disrespectful to remove people who were previously listed"
Derrick Rose by Tom Thibadeau
Derrick Rose was failed the Bulls medical staff
"Chicago Bulls. New York Knicks a close second. When Derrick Rose plays, I watch"
"Derrick rose, and how the bulls handled him coming back from ACL surgery"
"Billups wasn't on my radar as far as 75 goes. There were definitely other Pistons ahead of him in line going into this, and that's not even including Pistons' legends like AI, TMac, and Rose.   He'll likely get into the HoF next year though. Not the most exciting class, especially compared to 2023.  EDIT: Random fun fact as I was just looking this up: TMac played and started more games for the Pistons than Derrick Rose did. He also played more games than AI did, but AI started more games."
Randle and RJ in their first ever playoff series and Derrick Rose can’t carry a team by himself anymore. Knicks were proud just to make the playoffs and rightfully so. I am excited to see how they play in the playoffs this year.
"&gt; Westbrook  This dude is the major problem in my opinion. Literally take him out of the roster and your roster is so much better and that's a problem. Whenever Russ touches the ball, I get the chills and pray nothing bad happens. You don't get that feeling with any other elite point guard in the league. Heck I don't get that feeling when Caruso, Cam Payne, Rubio or 2021 Derrick Rose handles the ball. He's the most detrimental piece to the team and by a large margin. As one Laker fan puts it *""Its not fair that I pay this man $40M for my butthole to be buckered.""*  And here's the reality, the regular season matters much more now to this Lakers squad than any other season. If they had the privilege to coast some games during 2020, Im not confident that they could coast this year as they have to fix some of their problems on-court. And lets say Westbrook and the team somehow fix their playstyle, at what cost? How many games will the Lakers drop until Westbrook tightens the fuck up? The scary part is, there is a possibility that they might end up in the playin bracket its literally a 50/50 from there. Warriors had the better superstar on top vs the Grizzlies but we got knocked out of the playoffs last year. Heck the game for the 7th was literally close and the game could've gone either way. I don't think the Lakers want to be in that situation because they know they too good for that."
Did Derrick Rose win the last MVP award? No? Ok.
"Derrick Rose best player in the league, Ross the worst of all time."
its a new season there is no mvp  are we still calling derrick rose the mvp when he makes a play? no.
Derrick Rose did nothing for you? Wtf
"I remember watching these two play in the summer league together when they were rookies. Now they playing for my favorite team, and they genuinely seem happy about it? Somethings going on here. Last time I was this excited about a Bulls team Derrick Rose still hadn't gotten injured."
"Agreed. And these type of lists are all about a good balance between a high peak and sustained peak. Which is why a guy like Derrick Rose who was a top player for a short time (unfortunately due to injuries) isn't on the list, but a guy like Reggie Miller who was never a top 5 player at any time in his career, but had a very long, sustained peak did make it."
Am I the only one who thinks Pierce should be taken off this list?  I'd argue Derrick Rose was a better player than Pierce. KG and Allen are legitimate goats.
"I mean, the only way he has a career that comes out looking super favorable for him is if he had a Grant Hill or Derrick Rose situation where he was completely derailed by a massive injury. So he'd just have become a ""What If""  He was derailed somewhat by his back injury, but his attitude in LA with Kobe and then in Houston hurt him more than ""staying around too long""  If anyones career was ""hurt"" by Vongevity it's John Stockton.  The man had 10k assists in 11 years in the league, but people think he only holds the Assist record because he played a long time."
Derrick Rose &gt; than THJ first off.  KP is an injured bum not worth the money and we invested it in Marcus Morris who was traded for the pick that became Immanuel quickley. We signed Randle and became one of the deepest teams in the league meanwhile the Mavs are struggling to build around Luka. We traded the Mavs pick to go to 25 and draft Quentin Grimes who was torching summer league and got a game winner 3 in preseason with one of the picks and it also got us a conditional first rounder in the next 3 years if Charlotte makes the playoffs and we still have another pick in 2023. We have flexibility to trade for a superstar if this group isn't working and the Mavs are stuck with trying to flip KP which is their best available asset. No one wants that contract and they are on a Luka time bomb  PS. Sexton is a bum why is he even being brought up.
"Provided that Jokic doesn't have his career derailed by any catastrophic injuries like what happened to Derrick Rose, he's almost certainly a lock for the next anniversary team. He and Rose were the only MVP winners left off the list."
"WE got DSJ who we traded for Derrick Rose. Plus the cap space that let us sign good vets that turned the franchise around. Was it perfect, certainly not but the one thing with the KP trade was it was a kind of a ""tag, you're it"" for maxing him. We didn't want to have to do it - which was a big part of why he was traded."
"We didn't waive DSJ, we traded him for Derrick Rose. We got cap space to maintain flexibility to sign guys like Burks, Noel, and Randle. Plus 2 firsts. No way we would have the team we have now if we were tied up to 158 million for Porzingis. Good trade for the Knicks period."

"Definitely too early. He's is on a trajectory of being an all-time great, but it's not an absolute certainty at this point. Back in 2011, Derrick Rose looked like a future superstar, but that ended up not happening. Jokic probably needs a couple more seasons of high level play to show that he's not just a flash in the pan."
a spec-TAC-ular move by Derrick Rose
imagine if y’all just went after derrick rose and kept caruso
So funny to see legendary Bulls duo Derrick Rose and James Johnson on the floor
"Reggie miller: ""Former mvp james harden""  ""Former mvp kevin durant""  "" *Former* M V P derrick rose""  Derrick rose is a good player why does he always sound so surprised"
Prime Derrick Rose &gt; prime harden or KD
That's youngest MVP of all time Derrick Rose for you
"Just got out of a Thai prison, is Derrick Rose still MVP and this Cam Thomas kid the new future MVP ?"
"""I don't think I've ever seen that from Derrick Rose"" Reggie says, about Rose's signature move"
They are just a Derrick Rose away from being the new super team
"He’s been good with the Clippers, but he was sooo bad with Cavs. Remember when Derrick Rose and Jordan Clarkson were garbage under him and then immediately turned it around after leaving."
"I’m pretty sure every decent team in the east qualifies except for the Hornets and Hawks.   - Nets have Kyrie and Joe Harris - Bulls have Ball and Caruso - Heat have UD - Wizards have Harrell, Kuzma, and KCP - Bucks have George Hill and Rodney Hood - Knicks have Derrick Rose - Sixers have Drummond and Danny green - Cavs have Love - Celtics have Schroeder   So yeah I agree I think the streak most likely stays alive this year one way or another."
Derrick rose injury
"He needs to learn to not rely too much on that lightning-quick frst step and his athleticism. We've all seen how high motor guards fall off the cliff the moment they lose those abilities. John Wall, Derrick Rose, now Kemba. If Ja can learn how to be a lot more creative with not using too much athleticism on his drives, he'd be set.   It's also the reason why guards who rely more on finesse and shooting are still out there playing and prodcing. CP3, Kyle, Steph all have incredibly deep bags. It's also the reason why I think Luka can play for  two decades and not lose too much."
It’s not as outrageous as it sounds. I would still say Randle is the best individual player. But Derrick Rose is the most impactful player a lot of nights
"Ja has better biomechanics but not better landing mechanics. I can’t think of many more players who consistently land off balance, rotating, or on one leg.  I wouldn’t go so far as to compare him to Derrick Rose but with his current play style, Ja is certainly an ongoing injury risk."
The stories of freak athletes who weren’t durable because of poor nutrition are plenty. Derrick Rose and John Wall are notable examples. Just because his kids are tall and can play a game well enough to get noticed as teenagers doesn’t mean they’re actually built to last as professional athletes.
Sad Derrick Rose noises….
"First of all, Derrick Rose is a Chicago Bull. He is Chicago. Always will be. He is by far my favorite player of all time, but that doesn’t mean he’s beyond criticism. DRose has quite literally admitted to preserving his body in past interviews for his post-retirement life.   So, given his past comments it would not surprise me at all if DRose was simply accepting a reduced (but important) role on a team. I’ve seen what Rose can do, and I’ve seen how capable he still is today. There’s no doubt in my mind he could be seeing even more success today if he wanted a larger role."
Have you watched the Knicks or are you basing this on old performances?  Derrick Rose is not a bad defender.
"He reminds me a little of early Derrick Rose with all his slashing, spins, and off-balance moves to the rim."
It's funny because Kemba needs to take a page out of the Derrick rose playbook. Go get your body right. Come back with the attitude of being a sixth man scorer off the bench
"Derrick Rose won an MVP and made 170 mil and still counting throughout his career while getting to compete in the ECF and his story is maybe the biggest what if in NBA history  Kemba was never on that MVP level, rather a fringe all nba talent at best, but 2017-19 Kemba was a great player whos years were wasted on trash teams. Had a great career already but he had more talent that the career showed"
"If you told me 3 years ago that Derrick Rose would be a way better point guard than Kemba Walker, I’d laugh."
off the bench over who? Derrick Rose and Immanuel Quickley? Absolutely not
"Well Derrick Rose is the fastest player I’ve ever seen play, and he shot &gt;100 3s in 2010-2011. Thus, I decided to try to spoof one of the curry posts by looking at his physical/athletic speed, rather than the rate by which he shoots 3s (the focus of the other post). Perhaps the wording makes it look like I was having a stroke while typing though lmao"
He's saying is there a player who is faster than Derrick Rose in his MVP year. That also hit 100 3s in a season.
Is Derrick rose literally the fastest (foot speed) player to hit 100 3s?
I mean we never had too between screwing Scottie over with his contract and what our best since then was Derrick rose era so maybe a max on rose and Noah?
Yeah if Steph went absolutely nuclear and played normal minutes for 3 quarters they'd be up by 90. And as fun as it would be we all remember what happened to Derrick Rose playing full speed when the game was over
"Just a weird way of phrasing that his athleticism won’t be enough to stay in front NBA point guards. At the time, point guard was arguably the most athletic position in the league, with prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Deron Williams, among others.   Curry definitely ended up being faster than anyone expected him to be, especially after putting a lot of work into his body. And the point guard position slowed down, with less of an emphasis on relentless slashing."
"Not even close to his prime, late or otherwise. That's like saying Derrick Rose is in his late prime now."
Derrick rose Iverson or Malone never had a rep for high ball iq
"That’s Derrick Rose though man, he’s a fucking icon to a lot of the young ballers."
It’ll be good to have a good vet pg to show the younger players how it’s done. Our rookies last year appreciated Derrick Rose while we had him
"Kyrie Irving, Scottie Pippen, Derrick Rose, Karl Malone, Allen Iverson  I’m not saying basketball players can’t be smart, or that basketball players are inherently dumb. I’m saying that because they’re very good at basketball doesn’t mean in the slightest they’re smart in real life too.   Why the fuck would knowing where the defensive rotation is coming from equate to real life intelligence?"
We are ROBBING Alec Burks at $10 million a year. He could have a case for 6MOY if he’s on a  team without Derrick Rose (rightfully) providing most of the offense off the bench
Just as we all thought - Derrick Rose was holding us back
"Yeah lol, Derrick Rose won an MVP but a doctor should you prescribe Thorazine if you think he was better than Dwayne Wade or Kawhi Leonard"
Derrick Rose would be lucky to be a top ten player today lmao.
"Allan Iverson and Tim Hardaway Sr had a pretty mean handle, I'm not sure Curry has them both beat in that respect. Prime Derrick Rose was also pretty good at handling the ball, it was basically his primary ability, given that he couldn't shoot early on."
Derrick Rose
"Considering it could’ve been Derrick rose bad, this is excellent news"
Immediately thought this would be Derrick Rose 2.0. happy it’s not serious
for clarification: would lebron + AD + derrick rose also be a superteam?
The knicks dealt with their fair share of covid and injury issues too. derrick rose and alec burks missed time with covid. Mitchell Robinson their starting center missed the majority of the season.
Nooooooo... I pray this is not another Derrick Rose scenario
Is this Derrick Rose?
Who would they trade and who would they want to get? They're just kind of stuck with this unless they wanted to give up young talents who are their best performers. Nobody is giving up value for Derrick Rose.
"Look at Dwayne Wade early in his career. Or Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose. Anthony Davis.   Hell, even Kevin Durant. They all came into the league firing, and none except *maybe* Kevin Durant are considered top 10 players, and Durant was far better in his first few years than Luka was."
"If this is a new Derrick Rose situation imma be so sad. Ja lands pretty poorly too, even if it's better than Rose. I just hope he'll come back healthy soon."
Hell nah we didn't mean THOSE young Derrick Rose comparisons
He plays like one day he will have a horrible injury. Very Derrick Rose in that way. No surprises.
Maybe not a Kobe level farewell tour but I could see a Dirk level one for Derrick Rose.
People forget how he carried that Magic team to the finals. He had a legit argument for MVP the year Derrick Rose won it in my opinion. That was before the trades and injuries and several years of not doing very much.
Didn't Heat Lebron shut down Derrick Rose?
"I mean I guess you're right but like greatness is understood by everyone. I don't need to know the intricacies of the game to see how good Dwight was. He was yamming on folks left and right lol.  Also, it could be because I'm from Chicago, but mostly everyone ik who watches basketball started around the same time as me, well before 2014. Derrick Rose introduced the game to a lot of us"

A Steph size Lebron is just Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose dunking in transition on a 6-3 not athletic Dragic is mostly overrated because of the Stacey King's call.
"I have nothing against Kevin Love but if he makes it in , but Derrick Rose doesn’t I think that’s complete horse shit.  Especially considering how the recent years of their careers have gone.  If Rose incorrectly was the first MVP to not make it, Especially after his comeback to how solid he’s actually been compared to what Love is,  then the line to making it or not making it gotta be better than Kevin"
"Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls have an excellent relationship, we love him here. last time the knicks played the bulls at the United Center, D. Rose got a standing ovation and chants"
"It will take a few weeks but I think he'll be Allright.  We often see good players focus on defense when getting old (Kidd, Carter, Griffin and many others), that let us think that the loss of quickness and explosivity has more impact on their offensive game.   Especially in a really good defensive system like the Warriors' he'll have the time to to rebuild some quickness and re-become a solid on-Ball Defender again, maybe not elite, but solid. He's still a big guard / swingman with good body frame. He's only 31 years old with the NBA minutes of a 29 years old Guy.   Maybe his offensive off-ball game will be affected at first in his runs and cuts but, if Il remember correctly, he didn't exactly play like young Derrick Rose. The coaching staff is probably thinking of using him in a quite different way to let him recover quietly. I mean, PJ Tucker needs defensive attention when standing in a corner, so think about Klay.  An underrated difficulty in my opinion will simply be the ability to make his brain and body remember how to play the game in a NBA rhythm : reflexes, instinctive moves, natural intégration to a new system in a great machine so far : I'm pretty sure he'll seem lost at the beginning, sometimes."
"Although the break-up itself seemed to be a sad surprise for him, Derrick Rose still seems to get so much love from Chicago."
DERRICK ROSE
"Nah its just the modern era fucking with y'all's heads. Derrick Rose was money from the midrange, and by your measure prime Dwyane Wade and Tony Parker didn't have reliable jumpers"
"Derrick Rose both has spent a ton of his career as a role player plus we’re talking about AD, not Rose. If I were a Spurs fan or something and my team always made the playoffs would that make my point magically more valid?"
Derrick Rose pre injury
I don't know you'd have to go through all the winners. But just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it's a rule.  It's like when people say Derrick Rose has to make the HoF cause every MVP is in the hall of fame. Okay...well he's actually the only MVP that doesn't have a HOF worthy career. So that's the point.
He absolutely tormented Derrick Rose in the playoffs in D during a time when nobody could stay in front of Rose.
Not always. Derrick Rose and Jalen Brunson are 9th and 10th in WAR and neither of them are great rebounders.
"&gt; “He lit up our model,” said Morey. “Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft.” The objective measurement of Jeremy Lin didn’t square with what the experts saw when they watched him play; a not terribly athletic Asian kid. Morey hadn’t completely trusted his model – and so had chickened out and not drafted Lin. A year after the Houston Rockets failed to draft Jeremy Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps: Jeremy Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured. He was explosive and was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. “He’s incredibly athletic,” said Morey. “But the reality is that every **** person, including me, thought he was unathletic. And I can’t think of any reason for it other than he was Asian.”  Also, https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jj7nzj/jeremy_lin_at_one_point_had_the_highest_average/  Lin was faster than both Derrick Rose and John Wall in average and start speed."
"Then, Thibs told Derrick to rise. So, Derrick Rose."
"Derrick ""Lockdown"" Rose!?  Also the fact that Lavine isn't on the ineffective defenders list, I think is justification for upgrading him from ""horrible defender"" to not bad - average"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose 2.0
official: derrick rose cloned
Cavs would've won if Derrick Rose was in play.
I hope Ja Morant continues to play at a high level. He is exciting to watch and delivers competitive aura every game. Reminds me of young Derrick Rose. Hopefully no injuries!
"I believe there is a scenario where Roy is the MVP award's proto-Derrick Rose.   If they have a impressive ‘90s Seattle-like record, he is a legitimate candidate."
The day I pick up THT in fantasy and he does this shit. Should I take back Derrick Rose or no?
538 also has Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin as top 5 defenders in the league. Oubre has been a huge negative in on/off stats almost every season of his career of many different situations.
"To your edit - I'm still not sold an eastbay is all that difficult on an open lane.  Guys like Vince, Richardson, Lavine all used eastbay variations in their dunk contests, yet none ever did one in-game.  I think it's just taboo as its use started in the dunk contest rather than in live play.  It's incredibly unlikely anyone would ever need to eastbay in order to avoid a shotblock whereas a lot of the other maneuvers have some practical use so those have become fair game. ex. Bridges uses a windmill to avoid Thybulle from blocking a regular dunk from behind.  Ignoring tomahawks, you have other stuff like Blake Griffin's windmills, Derrick Rose reverse/reverse windmill, Gerald Green windmills, Paul George reverse 360 windmill, Jason Richardson 360s.  All very excellent dunks considering a number of attributes.  I think of ranking dunks like they do in diving/gymnastics/etc - you are awarded more points for choosing a higher degree of difficulty maneuver, but execution makes up a large portion of your score as well."
that derrick rose one over dragic and the Blake griffin one over whoever that is.. (literally almost murdered him). Stoudamire and Vince carter ones as well
What type of rose? Derrick?
Nah Derrick Rose is better
Derrick Rose looks like what would happen if Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman had a baby.
Leon from Five Heartbeats + Derrick Rose = Leon Rose?
Derrick rose
"Off-hand, I'd say the 2011 Bulls.   They had just hired the COY-to-be in Thibodeau, who inherited a solid assemblage of draftees entering their prime years—including the eventual MVP in Derrick Rose. They vaulted into title contention chiefly because the FO made the right moves, not because they had any free-agency windfalls (like The Decision, as the Bulls fans were hoping for that prior offseason).  I think they would've won it all that year if they made the Finals; they just didn't because they had the misfortune of facing the best iteration of the Miami Heatles. They had even more misfortune the following years because of injuries, and they never looked that dominant again before the FO's ill-aged decision to fire Thibs.  Are they one of the best to never win it all? Not necessarily. But they're rarely mentioned in that conversation, which leads me to believe they're underappreciated."
I really hope Derrick Rose makes it but if he doesn't it has to be him.
Current Derrick Rose
"His game will age well because of his ability to constantly change speeds. It's not necessarily his leaping ability, moreso his touch around the rim. He can go up and under, he has all sorts of floaters and teardrops in his game, and he's damn near as good as Derrick Rose, Rod Strickland et all at finishing using the glass. His ball handling and movement are very Tony Parker but he is very much Derrick Rose around the rim."
derrick rose
"Does you mean who had the best career that won’t go into the hall of fame, or do you mean the best player who, for whatever reason their trajectory was derailed. Because Penny Hardaway and Derrick Rose are two surefire hall of famers who were had injuries that took away what made them respectively special."
Derrick Rose… might go down as the only MVP to never make it since injuries destroyed his career
Co-sign Derrick Rose
"Let’s see  DJ- sucked and walked for nothing   Wes- was waived   Dennis Smith Jr- flipped for Derrick Rose. While this did have a good outcome, dennis’s value was dirt cheap. A couple of second rounders and/or Knox could’ve done the same thing   2021 1st- traded again for a future protected pick  2023 1st- hasn’t conveyed   The only aspect of the trade you’re reaping the rewards from is Rose who could’ve been acquired regardless of the trade"
Derrick Rose
"It took people about a year and a half to start saying Luka was top 5. But it’s hard to say someone is the best player in the league without a top notch resume. So much of being the best player in the league is about consistency. 82 games, plus playoffs. &amp; that’s not even talking about the team accolades that are needed to be considered “the best in the league.” Wes Unseld and Wilt I’m pretty sure both won an MVP their rookie year so that has to count for something. Derrick Rose was the “youngest MVP,” but it wasn’t as a rookie.  The main question though, who are you wanting to recognize them as the best player? The teams fan base? The media? Other players? Or just everyone as a collective whole?"
"It was really Derrick Rose who broke Sloan. I was there that night and Rose had the most ""unstoppable player"" game I have ever seen in person. The next day, Sloan quits."
"LeBron. But Derrick Rose fans are 2nd. People saying ""free him from the knicks"" when hes averaging 11ppg and also shit like saying he'd be the goat pg if he didn't get injured. I'm also convinced that at least half of them didn't actually watch his 2011 season but caught on later"
probably a more athletic Dwayne Wayne so probably like a bigger derrick rose
"Dude Barkley did not play anything like Zion in the half court. In transition, both are fast and explosive, but in the half-court, Barkley played more like a traditional big. Zion is much more fluid on the ball than Barkley ever was. Zion is more like a Power-guard than a Power-forward. He plays like Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp and Derrick Rose had a baby."
"He plays nothing like Barkley on offense. Zion plays like a power-guard. He looks like an amalgamation of Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp and Derrick Rose."
"That's because the Lakers don't care. They (the Lakers) did the same thing to Butler in the finals and he had to play game 6 with a concussion, guaranteeing the Lakers a win.   Lebron knows that suspending and injuring the other team helps you win.  It also goes back to Vogel, who creates a culture of this. Look at the 2011 playoffs between the Bulls and Pacers. Vogel had his goon Jeff Foster try to injure Derrick Rose on a drive to the basket similar to the Lebron takedown on Embiid.  I am on mobile but this is the post."
"Winning will always be a big part of the MVP race each year. So he can play out of his mind, but as long his team is 15-13 it just doesn't have that much weight. Derrick Rose won an MVP because he was the best player on the team with the best record, not because he had the best stats."
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
"Players league when the player is a superstar. Star players in the NBA are actually underpaid with the amount of value they bring to the league. Majority of the casuals do not give a shit about anything else, but star players like Lebron, Steph, Derrick Rose before the injuries, Westbrook, Luka, Harden (both the good and the bad) etc. It's not like the NFL, where a lot of fans look at the sport as a religion and are very loyal to their team. The star players do not have anywhere close to the same pull apart from superstar QBs and even then, we saw what happened with Tom Brady in New England."
"Randle should be in. It's just stupid that we entertain the idea that fans votes should equally count, when fans often pick the least active players. How Klay get so many votes? Derrick Rose has almost the same number of votes as Randle."
Derrick Rose forgot the definition of consent.
"No, but if you watched the game literally everyone he guarded went around him with 0 resistance. Remember the Derrick Rose post up spin move? He didn't even attempt to get into the picture to contest"
Trae Young literally jumped into Derrick Rose and they called a foul on Rose. Thats wild
Dude had the speed of Prime D Rose but the shiftiness of Deron Williams. Hence Derrick Williams ... come on
dajuan wagner was a poor man's derrick rose
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
"Another case of a shooting guard stuck in a point guards body.  The Bulls have lacked a playmaker at the 1 since.... what, Derrick Rose? Kirk Hinrich? Rajon Rondo?  However, guys like Lou Will, CJ McCollum, etc have carved out some big roles on solid teams.  I think Coby will have a role anywhere in the league as an instant offense type of player, but man him at the 1 is rough."
We tried that with dwayne Casey and Blake griffin/derrick rose. No dice
"This is a little off-tangent but remember when a reporter asked Derrick Rose about steroids in the NBA he straight up was like ""yeah everyone is doing steroids"" and had to later back-off from his previous statements. This is when I knew Derrick Rose was dumb as fuck."
"Thibs is from NYC,  Derrick Rose has spent a large part of his NBA career under Thibs' coaching. A reporter was curious and asked D Rose if he noticed a difference in Thibs when he's coaching in NYC that he may have not noticed when they were in Minnesota and Chicago.   D Rose subsequently answered. Not exactly like there's some deep, mathematical/scientifical purpose to this question."
"What is there not to understand lmao? You dense or something?  Derrick Rose has been wirh Thibs in Minnesota and Chicago, he was asked if he noticed a difference in Thibs when he's in NYC and he answered. I seriously don't understand what you're not understanding. Seems pretty straight forward"
"I disagree. He isn't explosive, but he has ludicrous hand-eye coordination, awesome balance, great hands, great vision, and is super strong too. Just because you're not Dwyane Wade or Derrick Rose with an elite first step and hops, doesn't mean you're not athletic. Athletics go way beyond explosiveness."
"Rose just wasn’t built well enough to withstand it.  Some guys just can’t do it for long.  John Wall in the modern era.    Also some of these guys destroyed their bodies playing on playground courts like Steve Francis so his NBA bulb burned bright for a shorter length than it would had he not played as much when he was younger.  I don’t know Rose’s situation well enough to know if this was his situation too.  Brandon Roy who you mentioned is a great comparison because he also had knees that just couldn’t take it.  Lastly, Iverson was light bodied which may have allowed him to move and cut at Derrick Rose speed without the wear and tear.  Derrick Rose is more muscled."
nice to see DSJ playing great!  Without Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose we are so fun to watch  the ball movement was beautiful
Derrick Rose
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY Too soon to say that. See Rose, Derrick."
"Forgot about a lot of legends. I think some worth mentions are Pistons Isiah Thomas, Oscar Robertson, Jerry west, Gary payton. Tim Hardaway makes top 20. Dame lillard is climbing the ladder, and also malcom brogdon, ben simmons and markelle fultz are currently some of the best young talent capable of being top 30 at least. Also i think AI is SG. I think Derrick Rose and Penny Hardaway could have been better without injury. Derrick rose had potential to be top 5."
"If you argue that, then you'd be wrong.   Derrick Rose. His MVP season was nowhere near Russ'."
"We know, we just don’t care as much.  Nets have KD, Kyrie and harden, 3 of the most polarizing players since...ever. And they are contending right now  Knicks have....Derrick rose? Julius randle? Austin rivers?? And they are just trying to make the playoffs.   Clearly people will care more about a contender with superstars than a rebuilding/lower seed even if it is the Knicks.   Perhaps nobody in NY cares about the Nets, but everybody else does. Knicks should be happy they don’t have this much spotlight on them for once so they can lay under the radar and only get praised for doing well."
"He fits right into the Hall of Very Good. Players their generation will never forget, but just do not have the resume for the real Hall of Fame. Marc Gasol, Derrick Rose, Shawn Kemp, Robert Horry, Manu (based on NBA only, he needs to get in based on international play).  I only want to see the very best role players get into the Hall, like Ben Wallace, Klay Thompson (his resume is actually kinda weak but he needs to be in), Rondo(?). NBA Hall needs to get a little more selective."
Nope just accept it derrick rose is not as good as he once was
"I feel for this guy man, he’s won championships and is getting paid really well but at this point in his or any players career u just want to lace them up and play  I hope he is able to do that to the best of his ability and doesn’t go down like Brandon Roy and Derrick Rose did"
"Draft classes since 1980 w/ multiple MVPs.  1984: Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon  1996: Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant  2008: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook  2009: Steph Curry, James Harden"
If Detroit hadn't already traded away Derrick Rose...
• **”...holding onto his [right] knee...”**  Derrick Rose Vietnam PTSD flashbacks.
combo of the names Derrick and Quickley from our bench backcourt of d rose and quickley
I was told the Knicks gave up too much for Derrick Rose lmao haters
&gt;shoutout to Derrick Rose.  That's that shit I do like
"Obi has looked really good since the arrival of Derrick Rose.   In other words, Dickley is Toppin obi off"
"Bench unit is sick, shoutout to Derrick Rose."
he and derrick rose have some of the worst fanbases
Zion = Shaq + Derrick Rose
Ooo I’m not sure about that. AD can switch onto any big man and PF for sure but LeBron had the speed and quickness to lockdown peak Derrick Rose
"Hot take but Dirk was my pick to win it in '11.  * 23 ppg, 7 rpg, 3 apg on 52/40/89 (most efficient season of his career) * 57-25 record (3rd in the West, but tied with LA for 2nd, just 4 games behind SAS)    * Dirk missed 9 games with an injury, then had a minutes restriction in the 2 games back, Dallas went 2-9 in those 11 games.    * In the games that Dirk played and started, Dallas was on pace for a 64-18 season, which would've easily been the best record in the league. * 6th place already for MVP voting (nearly tied with Durant for 5th, then behind Rose, Howard, LeBron and Kobe) * Better WS/48 than everyone ahead of him but LeBron and Dwight Howard. * Most efficient player in the entire MVP race (13 players) * Was the only player (alongside Derrick Rose) with no all star teammates from a top seeded team.    * LA had Kobe/Pau (Bynum was also a fringe all star), SAS had Duncan/Ginobili (Parker wasn't an all star but easily could've been), OKC had Durant and WB, Boston had KG, Pierce and Allen, Miami had Bosh, Wade and LeBron, Atlanta had Johnson and Horford.  I'm totally fine with Rose winning, or Dwight for that matter, but I feel like Dirk's 2011 regular season is super underrated, and most folks just look at his playoff run (which was absolutely bonkers!) but his regular season from 2011 was arguably a top 5 Dirk season up there with 03, 05, 06 &amp; 07."
"Derrick rose. Lebron should have won but he won 2 years in a row prior. He was a great player,22 and the bulls won 60 games but he wasn't a top 5 player"
Derrick Rose next question
"&gt;I find your points stupid since no one really connects the regular season with the post season when ranking all time players.   Regular season basketball isn't actual basketball, it's just a bunch of teams that barely gameplan for each other and a bunch of fast breaks. So when I guy like Giannis looks great for 82 games and then turns into a pumpkin as soon teams start to gameplan for him and he has no clue how to score in the halfcourt offense, I laugh at those MVP trophies because they're meaningless.   I see the MVP award as the best basketball performer this YEAR, not the best basketball player for this regular season. So when you see guys like him drop 30 a game on high efficiency when ever possession is a fast break and nobody is gameplanning ways to stop him and when the playoffs start and he has no clue how to get the brown ball into the orange circle because the game has slowed down, to me that means that you are not the best basketball performer this year.   I've been watching this league for over 20 years. Regular season ball and playoff ball might as well be two different sports. I would award all awards after the playoffs and use the performance of both in the voting process. It makes no sense for these people to vote and hand out the awards after the entire year is over but only factor in the 82 game season.   Sorry.   Maybe in the old days where they would actually hand out the MVP trophy during the first round but now more than every, you cannot tell me that X player is the MVP when they turn into a pumpkin the minute the game slows down and teams are actually gameplanning to stop you because they have to play you every other night rather than 3 times a year.   People like Giannis and Westbrook and Derrick Rose should never have gotten an MVP trophy, ever."
"MVPs are given to the best performer on one of the best teams in the league. The MVP is inherently a TEAM based trophy, or you wouldn't have instances like Derrick freaking Rose beating out Dwight and LeBron for an MVP.   There are certainly exceptions to this, like when y'all gave it to Westbrook, but for the most part it has always been based on TEAM success because in theory, X team wouldn't be this great without X player's performance this season. So no, the MVP is not about the player, or else crap like Derrick Rose getting an MVP trophy would never happen and Kobe would have had at least one more MVP trophy. So stop it."

"Hot take:  I dont care if NBA players use PED's.  Derrick Rose has come out in the past and implied that its a huge problem in the league and the league only started testing for HGH back in 2015 so I think it is predominant in the league, but I dont see it as an issue."
"Depending on both what you would consider his prime, and what a star is, you could say there were three (not directly related to injury) careers that rose and fell.  - Al Horford - OJ Mayo - LaMarcus Aldridge  For players with injury histories, there are some notable names.  - Brandon Roy - Blake Griffin - Derrick Rose"
Derrick Rose
Dude looking like prime Derrick Rose in prime Lebron James’ body
Yeah and Derrick Rose was the MVP in 2011
Derrick Rose
"So what? We're in playoff contention, Derrick Rose says that he likes being here. Why is it a waste?"
We're now full circle and Derrick Rose is better than Russell Westbrook again.
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE
"&gt;I’ll take one championship and nineteen mediocre seasons over twenty solid seasons  No I agree with that, the Sixers before tanking were that first part just without the championship haha. Just mediocre. I'll take four years being bad (sometimes worst in the league) and four years being good (potential championship team) over eight years of being mediocre. Being mediocre is the worst thing to be in the NBA if you're there longer than a season, no chance at a championship and no good draft picks.  That one season with Jrue and Iggy was fun, but if you're counting on Derrick Rose to blow out his knee to make the second round, that's a bad sign."
"I think it would be interesting to look at average difference in win shares between the 1st and 2nd pick in the draft. You’ve got your Shaq and Alonzo Mourning cases: transcendent player and all star quality but far away in comparison:  Your Duncan/Van Horn in a transcendent player and a quality starter but the gap is bigger  Then the Lebron/Darko case: transcendent player and bust.  Like since 1990, the best number 2 picks have been KD, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Alonzo Mourning.   An MVP all timer, two all time point guards who couldn’t quite be the best player on a championship team and an all star who was never really the best at his position.  Contrast that with the 1st picks with Shaq, Chris Webber, AI, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, and that’s just the 1st team MVP types.  Then you’ve got Kyrie, Ben Simmons, KAT, Larry Johnson, Yao, Blake Griffin, John wall, multiple time all stars who have been the best player on a playoff team (or in the case of Simmons and KAT will obviously get there)   That’s 15 guys in 30 years who can be the best player on a 50 win team. That’s good odds"
"There's actually a strong case for him right now playing better than Derrick Rose was playing in his rookie year.  Better advanced stats across the board, more steals, better rebounder, better passer, a VASTLY better 3 point shooter.    I'm actually struggling to find a stat Derrick Rose was way better than LaMelo at.  He's actually having a better **rookie** year than Durant as crazy as that sounds.  And no, I'm not saying he'll be better than Durant, cmon.  The one rookie whom I'm pretty sure had a better rookie year than LaMelo though is Blake Griffin.  [Derrick Rose](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=rosede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2009)   [Kevin Durant](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;p2yrfrom=2008&amp;player_id3=griffbl01&amp;p3yrfrom=2011)"
"Your favorite part is all good. But ""the best rookie I've ever seen outside of LeBron"" is a different take. Anyway, whatever you say. Couldn`t disagree more, he is not even Derrick Rose level. Bye."
"1. Coming off injury 2. Playing behind Randle who is playing a lot better than what anyone expected.  3. Thibs doesn’t play rookies that often/earn your minutes mentality. Still is a lot better than bearded egghead.  4. I think this was addressed at one point, but Obi sits with KP (I think it was KP) on the bench. They talk about every single play that’s run, and sees if Obi understands the play/what would he have done in the situation/etc. so it’s not like he’s just sitting at the end of the bench and doesn’t learn anything.  5. Needs the ball to be effective. With Derrick Rose we might see him play a bit more in the second unit.  6. He’s a rookie, and rookies will make mistakes, so we’re not expecting too much from him. Compared to when Frank was drafted Obi def gets/got more playtime than Frank ever got"
"Proving your point lmaoo. You have no point. Your point is ""you're projecting"". That's not a point. That's just something people say when they have no counter.   You said Michael Jordan avoids contact and your example was a video where he jumps right in the middle of 2 defenders?? You said Lebron has more touch, dexterity, and finesse than Derrick Rose?? The fact that you still havent mentioned Kyrie Irving is just embarrassing. Steve Nash, hello? You just dont know basketball. You're a typical Warriors bandwagon fan."
"Rose was an amazing player, but boy this man is SUPER fucking stupid  Last season the Lakers were begging Detroit to get Rose for their playoff roster  That's not just an easy ring with low expectations as small minutes role player, it's an easy ring next to LeBron in the nicest NBA city of LA  He turned that deal down saying he didnt want to go to the Lakers (or even the Clippers for that matter - before they went out and got Reggie Jackson off waivers)  Guy could have had a ring and a huge pay day after said ring (see KCP) but instead chose to hold out for another year in Detroit then beg to be traded to the Knicks where the very little mileage left on his legs will be used up in the last half of this season by that mad man Thibs  TLDR: Derrick Rose is about as intelligent as a bag of skittles"
"&gt; Derrick Rose and Melo  I think y'all need a wake up call on what year it is.  The ""kids"" the grew up stanning Melo and Drose are grown ass men now.  Most actually kids think Melo is just a washed old head."
"&gt; ""feeding my family""  deadass thought this was a derrick rose thing for some reason"
"I don't why you're being downvoted it's true. Getting Derrick Rose hurts their chances, too."
True. Also hilarious he had to say team with a shot at the playoffs and not a shot at the title... teams with a title chance wouldn't want Derrick Rose
Poll every player in the NBA and see how many think Paul is a better scorer than Derrick Rose.
"Well the ACL Tear happened in the playoffs, I felt it made sense to use his most recent year before the major injury. But let's use the other season and I'll even drop to Chris Paul's age 22 season.   Derrick Rose at age 22: 25/8 - 55%TS - +2.8 On/Off Splits  Chris Paul at age 22: 21/12 - 58%TS - +9.1 On/Off Splits - All Defensive 2nd"
"Some of the comments in the thread OP linked to in r/lakers are just so dumb. If popularity is all that matters then Klay Thompson, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo should all be starting lol"
Nah he was probably the most well known college player outside of maybe Derrick Rose in 2008. Everyone who watched march madness that year (which is a shit ton of average people) knew who Steph Curry was
Derrick Rose at age 23 before injury: 22/8 - 53%TS - +2 On/Off splits  Chris Paul at age 23 before injury: 23/11 - 60%TS - +19.6 On/Off splits - All Defensive 1st
"Anyone saying Rose if he never got injured doesn't even know that Chris Paul also suffered a big injury that hampered his athleticism. And still he managed to be a 20/10 guy while being All-NBA Defender.  Peak CP3 put up 23/11 with 3 steals per game on 60%TS at age 23. Do those 2 extra point that Derrick Rose scored really mean that much to people? People love Derrick Rose, but 2008-2009 CP3 was something else."
"Because on the voting page players are sorted by PPG so most nephews vote on that and name recognition. Why is Klay, Derrick Rose and Melo on this list? Kids know them that's why. Whole thing is broken haha"
"leon rose, not derrick rose. leon rose is our team president."
"""Even a healthy Derrick Rose was never as good as Chris Paul"" man you Chris Paul stans are really something else."
missing derrick rose? Lol you realise you can’t use that when he was basically traded
DERRICK ROSE I LOVE YOU
"Healthy Derrick Rose  Michael Jordan  Vince Carter  And then... Arguably... Kobe, TMac, M Thompson..."
I’ve also seen Derrick Rose make some incredible midair decisions that magically work.  I don’t know if he’s at the same level as the other guys in that regard.
"I mean you're using arguably the top 2 greatest players to have ever played the game as a measurement of whether or not Zion can live up to his hype? First off - being an all-time NBA great is fucking hard on top of the difficulty of making it to the NBA to begin with.  Lebron has been in the league 18 years, MJ is retired and has been the consensus GOAT for quite some time now. Then you look at the other players who are in their class. Kareem, Magic, Bird, Shaq, Kobe, Duncan. Top 10 caliber players and you're asking if Zion can reach Jordan/Lebron level? That is a preposterous question to even ask.  It's a crazy question because there's far too many variables that goes into what makes a player's career worthy of them being put into that class of player.  Derrick Rose was a fucking phenom in his younger days. Dude was absolutely insane and is the youngest player to ever win MVP. Then injuries happened and now he'll always be a what if. There's so many guys that are like that in the history of the game and so its difficult to answer such an insane projection.  Can Zion be great? Absolutely. Can he be in the conversation as a top 5 player in the league? Sure. He's 20 years old dude - the kid still has a lot to learn.  Crazier still is you suggesting that Zion is worst than his rookie season - which is funny because he barely had a rookie season. This kid has played a grand total of 46 games. This year he's averaging the 23.5 points, with a better FG% from last year, his assists are up, and over the course of the last several games his defense has stepped up as well. His free throw shooting is also on an upward trajectory.  I don't know where you got the idea that he's worst this year. At least try to watch some of the highlight vids that people put out before you get crazy."
"Quickley looking like a stud, time to acquire another person who plays the exact same position as him!  \*Derrick Rose enters the chat"
You never watched prime Derrick Rose huh.
So MAgna Cum at a state college. That derrick rose could not get in too?
"Maybe. But demar derozen was a free agent. So was joakim Noah.  2017 had Blake griffin, Derrick rose, Gordon Hayward, Kyle lowery...  I’m not sure who the best fit would be. None of these guys is KD. But the warriors don’t just sit around and wait for improvement in next years draft."
derrick rose and injuries
"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"
"""They then waited outside the girl's apartment for over an hour ringing her buzzer and calling her but she either somehow didn't notice or was just drunk and passed out.""  ^ Didn't answer the door.  (Then they had sex with her)   ""These aren't the accusations, these are the undisputed facts of the story that Derrick Rose's side admit happened.""  ^ Derrick Rose says she didn't answer the door.  Then:  ""His defense is that after they waited outside her apartment for over an hour ringing the buzzer and calling her, the drunk girl who had repeatedly refused group sex in the past let them in and consented.""  ^ Derrick Rose says she answered the door.  Which is contradictory. Because according to the post Derrick Rose's side both agreed she didn't answer the door and says she did answer the door.   Basic reading comprehension."
"Wade, Vince Carter, Derrick Rose and McGrady too."
"Did you even read the article you linked? What part of that showed that he was just a victim of false accusations? Like you claim to have looked into the case but your big argument is just ""the jury said there wasn't enough evidence!""  That's your proof that the woman was a liar? The fact that a jury deliberated for 3 hours then went out to take smiling photos with Derrick Rose?"
Derrick Rose in his prime hit crazy circus shots
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
I love Derrick Rose
"You have this notion that because her friend-which you have no clue about their relationship-thought she was lying. Also you forget to mention the fact the Derrick Rose’s OWN counsel agreed that she refused group sex multiple times, didn’t answer texts for an hour (hinting at inebriation), Derrick rose repeatedly trying to get into her house for an hour. The fact that he never asked for consent, not once. It’s almost as if you don’t have a very good understanding of the case. That and you have the jury throwing it out for “lack of physical evidence” who then took smiling pictures with Derrick rose after the trial. Dude is a bonafide POS, and even if this trial didn’t happen, he’s horrible for not knowing the notion of consent."
Doubt you’ll read it but here you go. Like I said you obviously haven’t read into the case. And it’s innocent until proven guilty in this country not the other way around. https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-derrick-rose-verdict-20161019-snap-story.html
"it's not even vaguely impossible. for example, I dislike Derrick Rose."
"yes easily. Derrick ""We Men"" Rose"
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE
"Love Derrick Rose, more than most other players hes in tune with his emotions and isnt afraid to hold them back. He is a real one and a true role model."
"D Rose's reaction is understood because he's expressing empathy for a teammate after dealing with so many injuries in his career but some of the comments in this section are acting as if the foot got blown off by an IED or the teammate lost his life.  Yes, Derrick Rose is a class act but some of the comments in this thread are bordering on hilarious if they're serious. Like, chill fellas. He's going to live."
Verno is worse than 90% of r/nba. I still remember when he insisted Derrick Rose was an elite player when he was on the Knicks.
And Derrick Rose
I remember a similar report about Derrick rose years ago.
"Those people laughing are idiots. This guys footwork is very reminiscent of 80s version of Jordan. If you go watch MJ back then, he always made quick moves. Never held the ball too long, killing momentum. He always kept the defense off balance and worked as hard off the ball as he did on it. Even some of Zion's finishes are similar to MJ and Derrick Rose."
I thought Brandon Jennings would have a better career than Derrick Rose
"It’s taken a while but u can have your Steph Curry’s or Kyrie Irving’s this guy is my favourite point guard since Derrick Rose 1st go round in Chicago  D Wade says he’s a bad dude, yeah he is but he’s a real dude and an extremely humble dude  So badly want him to win a Championship or MVP while at Portland coz he deserves it 👍🏽"
"I thought Isaiah Thomas was a pretty good replacement for Kyrie at the time and having Derrick Rose back him up off the bench and with the addition of Wade, the Cavs would give the Warriors a decent crack."
"No doesn’t hurt all the time, just feels unstable doing anything more than walking, and even walking any weird step or bump on the sidewalk it’s noticeable, just in a kinda weird sketchy way. Any time I tweak it there’s definitely a good amount of pain for a week or 2 but I’m always just more worried I re-tore it. The psychological aspect is the hardest part about doing sports, and it gave me a whole new appreciation for someone like Derrick rose. It’s really fucking hard to push yourself after multiple knee injuries even when your doctors say you can."
What a call! Is this the same crew that called the Derrick Rose dunk on Dragic?
It's regular season MVP by a mile. Every MVP except Derrick Rose has either gotten into the HOF or will get into it
"I get what he’s trying to say. As a 31 year old who use to go all out on workouts, and now has pains everywhere it makes sense. Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin show what happens when you go balls to the wall every game. I’m also in awe at the level of play LBJ can play day in day out."
"It's a weird season with a wide open race, so something weird could happen, but Lebron really doesn't have a traditional MVP pedigree.   Since 2009, every MVP has led the league in PER except 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry. Lebron probably should have won MVP over Rose in 2011, and in 2015, Curry was 3rd in PER behind Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook, but those guys both missed double digit games, and Curry was on a 67-win team, while Davis was on the 8th seed, and Westbrook missed the playoffs.  Right now Lebron is 16th in PER.  Similarly, every MVP since 2009 except 2011 Rose and 2017 Westbrook have led the league in WS/48. Lebron is currently ranked 21st in this.  Not saying these stats are the end all, be all, but not being on a top seed, while being nowhere close to the top of some stats that the MVP is usually the leader in isn't a good sign for Lebron's MVP case.  With that said, Embiid is injured right now. No one in the media wants to give it to Giannis, Harden has the Houston situation and also his stats are less glamarous than usual (although he has a weird media thrust behind him), and Jokic/Butler/Curry/Lillard all have team record problems that will hurt their case, although for Jokic an Butler that might not be the case at the end of the season (don't think it's as likely for the Blazers/Warriors to make a run towards the top of the standings in the second half)."
"There is actually a video of why DWade's basketball career was shorter than he wanted it to be. Compare how he runs and lands with Lebron, Westbrook, and even Tim Duncan. This problem also occurred with Derrick Rose."
"Right now, I think Obi Toppin's not being used properly for the Knicks.      For someone athletic as Obi Toppin is, he's not really rolling to the rim that often. Instead, you'll see Thibs put Taj Gibson and Obi Toppin in a double ball screen at the top of the key, where Gibson rolls to the rim and Toppin spaces to the top of the key. This is in direct contrast with his advertised college skills, where he was an athletic lob finisher and often played as the big making the handoff to a sprinting guard and slipping in for athletic finishes.      Either you see him running that play with some random guard, or you'll see Obi Toppin spacing in the corner, where he's been absolutely horrid this season. Pretty much at all times, he's riding around the 3 point line. In my opinion, this makes him absolutely useless, as Obi Toppin wasn't advertised as a capable 3 point shooter coming out of college. In fact, it was his most questionable skill(outside of his lateral agility/perimeter defense). He shot well from 3 for Dayton, but on limited opportunities.      Yeah he's been bad this season, but I honestly think that Toppin's being used insanely poorly right now. He's never near the rim, neutralizing his athletic gifts. He can't finish without a good ball handler/passer feeding him(surprise, we don't have any great ball handlers/passers this season; maybe Derrick Rose, but IQ and RJ and Payton aren't great), and not being near the rim removes any ability for him to get putback dunks with his athleticism. If Thibs drew up some plays for Toppin where we just run the 2 man game at the top of the key, with a spaced floor, I bet Toppin would be better. But right now, nah he really sucks."
I love Derrick Rose. MVP FOREVER
"I can also provide examples of players who peak younger than that. Kevin Love, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Rajon Rondo.  You can say guys get injured but that doesn't allow you to dismiss them from the data set, that's a big part of why they fall off."
"I look at it similarly, but I like some of them for their personality. Like Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler seem like genuinly good dudes - not that all the rest aren't, but I really like them and few others"
Derrick Rose babyyyyy
For a fake MVP? Like Derrick Rose? No. A real MVP? Yes.
He must have studied for his SATs with Derrick Rose.
meant derrick rose 😂
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"yeah, Deandre Jordan and Derrick Rose are hardly who I would want to be a gauge of team excellence"
"It's mostly always changing for me, but I'll always support Derrick Rose. Get that man a championship, please. And maybe a Chicago return too."
In 2014-2015 Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler sometimes had that nickname! haha
"I can confirm, I saw some of him in 08, but derrick rose really got me into basketball. Paul wasn't Paul anymore by then."
Derrick Rose and Marc Gasol are the last straw for me!
Good gawd this man is a mix of Derrick rose and Dwayne wade but bigger than Donovan Mitchell.  https://twitter.com/danemoorenba/status/1371286801902604301?s=21  He was chirping Melo hard tonight. This kids confidence is astronomical.  Verbatim what I said lol.

"Derrick Rose because even though of his injuries while on the bulls, he didn’t give up. He kept coming back (not all the way) but still came back to the best of his ability to, and that’s not easy to do. He has heart for the game and is very loyal. When he learned he was getting traded from the bulls, he started crying."
I mean Derrick Rose got hurt (cut his knee) because he had a knife he used to slice apples I think in his bed???  So weirder shit has happened lmao.
"When you crossed me, you lost me  Now if I was guardin' Derrick Rose  I would be more understandin' but you ain't Derrick Rose  You was my number one, but uuuhmm, you ain't Derrick Rose  You try to make a point again, you ain’t Derrick Rose  You just on some bullshit, bitch, you ain’t Derrick Rose"
"LeVert has fully joined Derrick Rose in the “fuck yeah, look at him go” category."
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
2010 Derrick rose
"What lol , Derrick Rose never deserved it that year . In every statistical category , lebron was better . He averaged 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds and seven assists, yet he finished third in the MVP race. LeBron was better than Derrick Rose in nearly every single statistical category except assists, which he missed out on by .7. He was first in the league in PER with a 27.3 rating—Rose finished ninth in that category."
"I’m not sure why you’re making this weird distinction where a player can ONLY either be a high seed/great stats guy OR have a good narrative around them, but not both.... that’s a bit of a false dichotomy  it doesn’t have to be one or the other, and often the leading high seed/great stats guys have narratives begin to develop around them *because* of the incredible numbers and awesome team performances, not in spite of them.   You don’t think there was a narrative for Westbrook staying in OKC post KD with the loyalty angle and triple double stuff? For Steph leading his team to the greatest record in nba history and changing the way the game is played? For Derrick rose being the hometown kid and the next young super star we couldn’t wait to crown? Or the narrative that *prevented* Lebron from winning for being the villain his first year in Miami?  Almost every MVP winner has some degree of narrative arc surrounding them. No one would ever make the argument for that being the ONLY reason they won, obviously it has to go hand in hand with the stats to bolster the case. These two things aren’t as mutually exclusive as you are implying here"

Literally one of the main reasons Derrick Rose had such a injury prone career. He would land on one foot with all the momentum of a dunk. Killed his joints for the highlight reels
"That's ok, not that bad. 76s should be relieved. He has to work on his landing, that's very similar to Derrick Rose landing on one leg."
"He's having a nice two year stretch, yes. For his entire career he's as much of a ""playmaker"" as Derrick Rose was."
derrick rose...?
"Oh please people are not supposed to play defense anymore? He barely even touched him.   His knee buckled cause he pulled a Derrick Rose straight-knee landing at 280 lbs, not because he got hit"
Derrick Rose. This man was literally destined to bring Chicago it’s first championship since MJ. The story almost wrote itself. Youngest MVP. Unseen athleticism in a guard. From Chicago. In a timeline where Rose has Westbrook’s durability....he would’ve been one of the best stories in NBA history.
Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah?  Or were those seperate years?
Derrick rose at 12% is heart breaking :(
Chicago:  1- Isiah Thomas  2- Derrick Rose  3- Dwayne Wade  4- Juan Howard  5- AD
"The Bulls - when they traded away Derrick Rose to New York, I lost all respect for the organization.   Sure, D. Rose was plagued by injuries, but he had major loyalty for the organization and city, and trading him doesn’t sit right with me even in the context of a rebuild."
"All time?  Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan  *(I started watching basketball in the 2000s)*  Current: Damian Lillard, Zach Lavine, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid"
"Derrick Rose for sure,"
"Here's a better D-centric squad with a little spacing for the Nets:  * PG: Derrick Rose (Bulls), Lonzo Ball (Lakers), Raymond Felton (Thunder)  * SG: DeMar Derozan (Spurs), Pat Beverly (Clippers), Tony Allen (Grizzlies),  * SF: Bruce Bowen (Spurs), Andre Roberson (Thunder), Kyle Korver (Bucks)  * PF: Dennis Rodman (Pistons), Shawn Marion (Mavericks), Nicolas Batum (Hornets)  * C: Joakim Noah (Bulls), Kevon Looney (Warriors), Larry Sanders (Bucks)  Outside of Derozan the above team is utterly lockdown on defense."
Either Kobe Bryant or Derrick Rose
Jazz legends Andre Kirilenko in 2012 and Derrick Rose in 2017 both signed with the Timberwolves.
"We are in similar boats, Canadian who cheers for the Raptors, although ive always felt like that was just by default, have been a massive warriors fan since the 2015 season(jumped right on the curry bandwagon and haven’t gotten off since), to the point where I think Golden State is where my heart truly lies.  Also, maybe more so in Canada than in the USA, I feel like there are way more player fans than team fans. Could be just me thinking the world revolves around the way I think, but ive always found myself just being a big fan of certain players. When I was just wee I was a big AI, Reggie Miller and Peja fan so I found myself cheering on the 76ers, Pacers and Kings(and raptors ofc). Then once they were both out of the league I was cheering for Derrick Rose and the Bulls(+ Raptors).  Now as a far more involved NBA fan, my favourite players are easily, Steph, the Ball brothers and DRose still. So right now im a fan of the Warriors, Raptors, Hornets, Pelicans, Knicks, in that order."
Don't forget Derrick Rose
"The times very a lot. Derrick Rose tore his in 2013 11 games in and missed the rest of the year, in 2015 he tore it again and missed like 2-3 weeks and went right into playing in the playoffs   I think it depends on whether they try to repair it or just remove it"
What if Derrick Rose had not torn his ACL?
What if Thibs didn’t play Derrick Rose in that fateful 4th quarter
"Congrats to Nash on his 2011 Derrick Rose Narrative MVP, wouldn't take it away from him, he seems like a nice guy"
Nah the pistons are cool they gave us Derrick rose
"I have a question. If the purpose of this is to determine if tanking is worth it, why include players such as Derrick rose? Bulls didn’t tank to get him, they got lucky to draw the first pick in that draft"
"Not even close  Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Derrick Rose are some of the biggest ones in the last decade"
“Why can’t I be MVP of the league?” -Derrick Rose Then he won it.
Derrick Rose and who?
"I remember the term from the same class, which I actually took with with Derrick Rose as a freshman.  He was almost never there though."
"&gt;proven false  What?? He literally admitted to it. Reddit really loves to act like “not convicted in a court of law” equals “proven false” . In that case, OJ was proven innocent   source:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation"
"probably, but then again, I do also remember him shutting down both prime tony parker and derrick rose once upon a time."
"Two reasons. One, they have better shooters to put in the corners than draymond.         Two, that would mess up his value and how they use him by sticking him in the corner. That happened with Derrick rose in Cleveland and CP3 in Houston"
Derrick Rose was never convicted
Why didn't Derrick Rose ever get any punishment?
I felt the same way about Derrick Rose but at least Dame took his SATs
"On the flip side, I would say Derrick Rose is beloved everywhere he goes and he’s been switching teams every 1-2 seasons."
I mean Derrick Rose was a superstar and we all know he doesn't get nearly enough calls as he should. It's about reputation and flopping. Refs are just encouraging flopping at this point. I also don't know what other teams have had multiple wins taken away from them due to blown calls in a half season.
What if Derrick Rose never tore his ACL?
"Derrick Rose, NYK"
And to think Lavine tore his ACL in his third year. You would never know watching him now with how quick he is and how high he elevates. Wish that had been the case for someone like Derrick Rose.
"&gt;He pleaded for Rose to offer long-term deals to free agents such as Gordon Hayward, Marcus Morris and Bogdan Bogdanovic. He wanted to trade for Derrick Rose, a longtime favorite of his.  Ok not that bad but I can see the reasoning  &gt;He thought RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson could potentially be flipped for seasoned veterans. Initially, he was hardly sold on Julius Randle, according to a colleague.  Alright Thibs relax..."
If Derrick Rose doesn’t get injured do the Bulls win a title?
"Sometimes i am baffled by the comments i see lol  Your title is ""Derrick Rose in his MVP season"". He gave you a huge reasoning behind his MVP. Rose didn't win MVP because of his stats, he won it *despite* his stats. One of the biggest reasons being Bulls record."
My three favorites:  \-The Kobe/MJ baseline turnaround fadeaway   \-The AI/Derrick Rose really wide crossover   \-A perfect eurostep that completely fools the defender
"Trade Kyrie for Depth? Kyrie for Derrick Rose, Sekou Demboya, And Killian Hayes ?"
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
DERRICK ROSE CAN GO UPSTAIRS!
Don't disrespect European Derrick rose like that
We need the Hornets guy that called Zach LaVine and SGA’s game winners vs Charlotte to be paired with the depressed Pelicans commentator who called the Derrick Rose game-winner last year
"Derrick Rose, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert,"
"So was Anthony Bennett, and Michael olowokandi, and Derrick rose, etc.  Oh and our favorite guy Joe Smith"
"Pistons choked so hard. Horrible shot selection in the last 3 mins and overtime. This teams half court offense consists of errant Jeremi Grant shots, Blake griffin attempting to post someone up and flailing, and Derrick rose trying to be Derrick rose of 2010 and failing horribly. Add in mason plumlee being a complete bonehead and these are your 2021 pistons. Sad."
It's still Derrick Rose.
"I still stand by that this team is not a true contender. Having Tatum back healthy doesn't solve our issues. We still need a big. Danny needs to try and find a way to use the TPE to get Drummond or Vucevic, if Orlando is looking for a fresh start since they just can't stay healthy.  Teague sucks. We need to cut Carsen and relegate Teague to 15th man and only plays in emergencies. Danny should try and bring Derrick Rose or someone like him in to take Teague's spot. D Rose's contract is cheap."
[Derrick Rose](https://youtu.be/x1UYPLLotY4)
I guess we're just leaving Derrick Rose out? Youngest mvp in history deserves to at least be mentioned.
MVP Derrick Rose was unquestionably better than Dwayne Wade or Anthony David have ever been in their entire careers
"I just need to give a shout out to Derrick Rose.  He gave his all to the Chicago, just those damn injuries."
Derrick Rose?
Pistons got Derrick rose and Blake griffin 😔
Come to the Pistons. We’ll give you Derrick Rose and Svi for Ball and a FRP.
lol ok cool https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation
Not if he lands like Derrick rose
"I mean Derrick Rose has definitely revived his career as a role player, but he looked pretty done for a few years. He's only 32 and nowhere close to his peak. Let's hope Blake can at least be a good role player."
Yup. It has to be something like what Derrick Rose did in year 3. That's our only route to a championship.
"The absolute disrespect to Derrick Rose, Svi Matthagayabdja, and Blake Griffins corpse"
"George Karl on PEDs:  &gt; ""More likely it’s for the newest, hard-to-detect blood boosters and PEDs they have in Europe. Unfortunately, drug testing always seems to be a couple steps behind drug hiding. Lance Armstrong never failed a drug test. I think we want the best athletes to succeed, not the biggest, richest cheaters employing the best scientists. But I don’t know what to do about it.""  Derrick Rose on PEDs:  &gt;It’s huge, and I think we need a level playing field, where nobody has that advantage over the next person."
"Derrick Rose just never showed up to his team's game one evening, never informed them, and then disappeared for about a month before returning."
"You really seem to be projecting here and I'm not even the other guy.  Yes you are not Kyrie Irving, and yes its a personal issue that you don't seem to be able to rectify that.  The media are like clients to the NBA, Kyrie doesn't necessarily owe them (or us) a full explanation. The team is fine with it, he obviously is back, so what is the issue?  The only people saying ""Kyrie went off the rails"" here are conveniently fans of other teams lol.  Does nobody remember when Derrick Rose was supposed to start and literally just left the arena before tipoff and left his team to dry for a month after that? Everybody just went ""GET WELL SOON DERRICK!!!!"". Look at the reaction to Kyrie compared to that."
"Yeah, Derrick Rose did the same thing and it was a big deal too"
Maybe a deal for Blake Griffin + Derrick Rose? The salaries are close and the Warriors do have some picks to throw in.
"Are we talking about that Cleveland Cavs team that had LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Derrick Rose all on the same team? Yeah that was crazy unfair. Glad the league broke them up. /s"
Derrick Rose in shambles? Huh?
What does this have to do with Derrick Rose?
More than Derrick Rose? Or even Kobe over CP3?
Then you watch Derrick Rose landings and cry.
"&gt;	How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are.  I mean, it absolutely affects their ability to take advantage of their quickness/vertical lol. You’re not making the same plays against AD that you would’ve made against Boston College Power Forward Jimmy Smith.   &gt;	He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college.  This is kind of a weird thing to point out. One-foot-jumps usually come in transition when there’s momentum. Zion gets less transition looks because he has less transition opportunities against NBA players. Watch his highlights, he goes off 2 feet 90% of the time, and that 10% is when he’s completely wide open.   &gt;	If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.  He’s barely gotten *any* fast break dunk opportunities. Most of his fast break dunks come from full court passes from Lonzo. He doesn’t have the same opportunity he had in college to leak out and cherry pick.   &gt;	I don’t understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test.  The eye test is almost *always* going to prove that a player isn’t as dominant in the NBA as they were in college. That’s kinda the point...  &gt;	Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA? No; because they were just as athletic (or more) in the nba. Zion simply is not...  You just named a few explosive *guards* who can still play exactly how they played in HS/college regardless of what kind of defense they face. PFs and Cs notoriously have it harder at the next level, because facing a 7’0 brick wall in the NBA is a much bigger step-up from college than facing a 6’5 guard instead of a 6’2 guard.   Zion averaged 22/9 in college. He’s currently averaging 22/7 in the NBA. He’s adjusting fine, and the “eye-test” bullshit only works if you don’t account for literally every difference between college and the NBA."
They lack the assets. But a Derrick Rose or George Hill  would make them complete.
"This is such a lazy take. How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are. He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college. Sure, he will look less athletic in comparison to NBA players and won’t be able to get away with as much, but he also has been noticeably heavier and stiffer. If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.   I don’t understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test. Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA? No; because they were just as athletic (or more) in the nba. Zion simply is not..."
"Just like Derrick Rose, her knees just couldn't handle his offense"
"Detroit Pistons are certainly your team. They’re the closest team to Canada, as you can see Detroit from Canada. They have two all-NBA players in Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, which there are teams out there that have never had a guy make all-NBA.  Mason Plumpee is in his 7th season, which is a known notorious time for players to really make a jump in skill, so it’s possible they have another all-NBA guy soon. Jahlil Okafor is a former top 3 pick, and he might explode into an all-star soon as well. Between Griffin, Plumlee, and Okafor they average a whopping 28 points per game! Not only that, all 3 combine for 0.8 blocks a game, so they have some real dominant rim protection!  They have a rookie named Killian Hayes, who has exploded onto the scene and is the top rookie out there right now, potentially their 4th all-NBA guy. He’s already averaging 4.6 points per game, so by the time he hits Plumlee’s experience he’ll probably be averaging 9 points per game! He shoots a blistering 28% from the field and 25% from 3 point land. This means that he hits roughly one out of every four shots he takes. Now that’s not quite Steph Curry level yet, it’s hard to envision him not getting to that level as a shooter going off of his promising start to his rookie campaign.  The fans are amazing and passionate fans. Ron Artest loved the fans in Detroit so much that he actually got a game stopped because he wanted to go socialize with the average Detroitian. They ended up fist bumping and having a great relationship even though it messed with the game.  So all in all, I don’t see a reason why not to go with the Pistons. The two already all-NBA guys are a great base, seeing Plumlee develop into one will be a treat, and I already explained how Killian Hayes may be the second coming of Steph Curry. I wouldn’t expect that much this year from them, but next year they are real candidates to break the all time wins record of 73-9, so you can hop on the bandwagon early and then when they take the league over you’ll be one proud papa peacock."
"The NBA organises this annual popularity contest - fan vote for the All Star game.

"Summer before 2010-2011 season: Lebron, Kobe, Wade, CP3, Dirk, Dwight, KD, Nash, Duncan, Melo, D-Will, KG, Bosh - so they had 1, 3, and 13  But you have to throw in Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, and Amare before Bosh with their improvements in the 2010-2011 season."
"if Derrick Rose was seeing consistent minutes on a contender instead of in Detroit, he’d see a whole lot more front page love around here."
"11-16-9 bro Is this Fox News here. He isn’t a scorer Do you also think Jason Kidd and radon rondo were a waste?  Simmons handling it well and he’s right  Mj said it himself when he wanted to come back from an ankle injury Jerry Krause told him your our property you don’t decide.  And all these fans demand these dudes don’t live or can’t move their families and aren’t loyal, hogwash.  Hakeem won the rocket stow titles, was a model legend and loved in hositon. When he wanted to play two more years rockets told em to go do it in Toronto.  The players realize once there shots stop falling or can’t okay. Doesn’t matter if your the beloved home town Derrick rose, the loyalty is one way"
"Dennis Rodman, Dwayne Wade, Derrick Rose, Dominic Wilkins, Dikembe Mutombo."
"haha, running on that high until the next 4 point game, huh  a derrick rose fan lol"
"Career numbers make no difference when we are talking about who is the best player right now. Otherwise Derrick Rose, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook would be ranked better than Kyrie too.  He is solidly in the 15-20 range with those other guys I mentioned. There's nothing wrong with that."
Not liking derrick rose is a bannable offense in at least 5 team subs
I don’t like Derrick Rose
Depends if Derrick rose is part of the deal
People don’t want him to end up like Derrick Rose
"Pisons: I got Jerami Grant, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Delon Wright, and Sekou. Outside of that I don't know anyone on that team lol."
Is he the guy yelling in every Derrick rose highlight? If he is I like him
My brother claims Mahomes is the Steph Curry of football while Lamar not Giannis or Westbrook but Derrick Rose without the injuries.

"derrick rose's main bit is scoring.  jimmy main bit is being a facilitator and defender.  rose is neither.  haha  when your only thing is scoring, and you dont do it efficiently   lol  is this what living as a derrick rose fan is like? lol"
lol jimmy butler isn’t efficient.  derrick rose isnt efficient.  idk how i can make it simpler for you.  do you understand?  idk why jimmy matters at all in this convo  not even a huge fan
"nice round down there buddy. imagine thinking 14pts/5.5asts is bad for a bench player lol.    yeah, i’m sure Rose was the reason the Triangle running in 2016 failed. not like he put up 18pts/4asts/4rbs as their third option. of course he was the one that came up short.    and yeah, Rose starting 13 games for Minnesota under the shittiest coach in the entire league is exactly why they failed. not like there’s a fake star spearheading that team or anything like that.    i still haven’t heard any justification for Jimmy’s TS being the same as Derricks. i haven’t heard you say anything bad about Jimmy, only Derrick. what, you don’t wanna talk about reality? you just wanna stick with “tOoK tHeM tO tHe pLaYOfFs” and disregard the rest of the teams contributions and having a top 3 coach?    lmao i love morons. they’re always straight to the point and show you immediately that they don’t know what their talking about. pay more attention in school, Kevin 🤡"
Derrick Rose will be in the HOF
are you trying to say Boogie will be the best player to never make the HOF? because I think Derrick Rose will be.
Derrick Rose and rip hamilton
LeBron and Derrick Rose
"A- Lebron delivered a championship to every city he’s played in. That matters. He left in free agency not by demanding a trade that matters. He left if he was unhappy with the roster moves a team made.  B- The trade you are referring sent out Dwayne wade, Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas Iman shumpert Derrick rose and Jae crowder. They received Jordan Clarkson, Larry nance jr, George Hill, Rodney Hood and the draft rights for an overseas player. This trade made them both younger and healthier.  C- the trade was for 3 picks and two swaps. If it continues to work out and the lakers are better than New Orleans, those swap can be nothing Every trade you referenced is factually incorrect.  And to reiterate, it does matter if it worked out. Ask the fan bases involved. It probably feels a lot better to have made whatever trade(and lebron trades were focused and on what actually makes the team better not who he didn’t like in the locker room.) and won a chip than make several trades and have harden kick you in the nuts with his trade demands out the door."
detroit. watch some derrick rose and blake griffin highlights
This is giving Derrick Rose Knicks super team vibes
"If Sean Marks has balls, he should trade him to Detroit for Derrick Rose and Blake. Let him rot there so he can sing Kumbaya with Doumbouya for the whole year"
"&gt; Remember that. If this was 2017 and I told you John wall, Oladipo , and a 20 and 10 player were on a team you’d say ok that’s a 4/5 seed.  If this was 2012 and I told you that Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, and a 25/6 player were on the same team you'd say ok thats a championship team   Critical detail there is that its not, in fact, 2012"
"Here's all the info you need.  2011 was right smack dab in the middle of potentially the greatest 5 year stretch of any basketball player in history.  Your telling me that Derrick Rose had a season where he was better than that?  Lebrons numbers were lower that year because he wanted to fit in with his teammates and not takeover, even though he was the best player on the team.  This is all you need to know about the 2011 MVP race."
"He def will. Fans are reactionary. Remember bulls fans booed derrick fuckin rose once lmao. Whenever a franchise legend leaves in their prime, they always get booed even if they don't deserve it"
&gt;Every super team has won a ring in recent history  smh forgetting about the Derrick Rose Knicks
Oh like he did in the playoffs? giannis is amazing but prime LeBron knew every play that the opponent had and would get his teammates set up perfectly. He was an amazing help defender because no matter who he switched onto it wouldn’t be a mismatch and every 4th quarter that was close he would guard the opponents player who had it going and absolutely shut him down. Derrick rose even said after like game 2 of the series against the heat his MVP year “When he is that big and can guard you that easily; what can you do?”
Bron in his prime was locking down Pau Gasol and Derrick Rose in the same season
I wasn't a fan if the nba till I watched some Derrick Rose highlights and iv been obsessed ever since
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
Derrick Rose
"Derrick rose 50 point game, I did not pay much attention to basketball till that point."
"IIRC Derrick Rose disappeared once unexpectedly because of family issues. Not very professional to just dip without warning, but he did seem to have some urgent (and private) reason. It's possible Kyrie has some things going on that are to be kept private, as its none of our business. If this is the case, he shouldve informed someone. Anyone. But instead, hes like partying and shit.   I feel like he just doesnt feel like playing."
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose.. Chauncey Billups?
"And yet the numbers say Lebron, the 2nd best player of all time in his absolute prime, but your right derrick rose was an even better player than that."
"i dunno about that.. it's a combination of voter fatigue and them looking for someone new to give the MVP award to.  Luka's like the famous up and coming sensation.. and they're going to make a huge story out of it to inject some excitement into it... like ""youngest player to receive the mvp award since derrick rose"" or something like that."
"If the Blazers have a major injury and are missing the playoffs maybe Carmelo. JJ Reddick if the Pelicans are still in the cellar, but realistically he would command a trade. Derrick Rose same."
Ooooh trade Eric Gordon for Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose   Sick squad
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"Yeah, he plays like a less athletic and shorter Derrick Rose. Good defender too."
"Man I remember watching this season and he pretty much carried that Miami team.  If I remember correctly, this was the peak "" slasher "" Wade, he could pretty much score at will, and was hitting these crazy running layups akin to the MVP Derrick Rose year. This was prime flash.  Secondly I think he was super clutch I want to say this one of the year that he hit that crazy running three against the bulls  Also this is probably the peak of his blocking powers he was one of the greatest defensive guards ever, at least when it came to blocks."
Derrick Rose has also entered the chat.
Derrick rose injured before reaching in his prime. So pre prime drose &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pre prime curry
"Derrick Rose. He pretty clearly had some left in the tank, and you could watch him play and tell he was above average still. The media portrayed him as finished until he had that 50 point game."
"Kyrie Irving is the second best player on his team and one of its leaders and he went out and partied *during a pandemic*. It's much, much, worse than what Derrick Rose did."
Derrick Roses career. He had a solid start for being greatest PG of all time. Imagine having the greatest backcourt of all time: MJ and Rose on one franchise. That alone would put Bulls in Lakers tier of legacy
Derrick Rose was one of the most explosive players I've ever seen.   Think Ja Morant on steroids.
"Do you cry yourself to sleep at night? Lol just jk, nice my guy i was like 3 years old so the best ive ever seen the bulls do is the ECF with Derrick Rose."
The LaBron Murray Hong Kong issue really showed Media Bias in favor of LaBron. I would like to add Derrick Rose. How until his 40 point game in Minnesota he was disliked and left for dead by the media
Bro MVP rose was something special even as a warriors fan I have to say Derrick was amazing also I don't believe Steph to be out of his prime yet
Derrick Rose as well
"Honest question, for how ""good"" everyone said he was.. his teams were complete ass until lebron got there. Like Derrick Rose was only 1 year older and was taking that chicago team to the playoffs every year.   I understand he has individual talent but i always saw him as a selfish scorer that doesnt help a team win.   Was I missing something? (Genuinely want to know)"
Lebron only played against one first all-nba team guy in the entire decade. That war Derrick Rose lmao
"Bro if he just arbitrarily bailed on his team to go party it up in a different country *in the middle of the season* without telling anyone it's not just going to be a fine of a few thousand dollars.  Derrick Rose did this and missed one game because a close family member died and the sports world turned upside down.  Kyrie is going to miss several games because he wanted to get fucked up in Canada with pop stars for awhile, without wearing a mask and without getting any permission from the team. Left his franchise and his teammates and his coaches in the dust. And the owner of the team is signing his checks?  They won't get this extreme but this could be grounds for voiding his contract and suspending him for the rest of the season. This is unprecedented in the modern NBA. Realistically I think they'll fine him a hundred thousand dollars at least and suspend him from basketball for two weeks, requiring he be in isolation that whole time. If he doesn't do that, well... idk man."
Derrick Rose got so much shit when he did this in 2017.
 I think he'd be great in Chicago. You guys would be a more natural fit for what he does best than what we need. I think people look at box score stats and discount how certain players fit with certain teams. Lonzo won't have anywhere near the same transition opportunities playing for us. In Chicago they can run lineups with White and get in transition for Lavine. We need a PG more on the mold of Lowry. A guy who can really create in the halfcourt. I mean look at how good we've been with 30 minutes of Derrick Rose.
"Happy for Derrick Rose.   That tagline they've got on their jerseys (New York Never Sleeps) fits Thibodeau's coaching style to a T, lol."
"As a Canadian Derrick Rose fan, I fucking love the Knicks"

Why would Derrick Rose pull a move like this in 2021?     *Why not?*
"Derrick Rose man.... he's  this cherry on top, like this deadly secret dagger in the back pocket for New York Knicks. He's been playing so well. So damn happy for him."
"Tbh I don't know if it's intentional, I just don't think he has the explosiveness to make playing like prime Derrick Rose an effective style for him."
I think knicks are lowkey but highkey. They don’t have deep depth and only go 7 maybe 8 man deep usually which is what all teams do. Randle and Barret will continues do their thing while shooters surround them.   Plus I believe Derrick Rose will explode and take over starting duties to elevate the team. Other than the Knicks I think Celtics. Good enough players to compete with probably every team it just depends how they play
I was referring more to putting Derrick Rose in the starting line up.
"I used to hate on Thibs and blamed him for the complete breakdown of MVP Rose. What turned me around is the revelation that Derrick never blamed Thibs for riding him hard. If Derrick never blamed Thibs for his injuries and continues to love to play for him, who am I to say his method is wrong? I'm a random Redditor. Those two are a former MVP and former Coach of the Year."
"You guys may not have gotten the memo [from 2018](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2018/02/08/former-bulls-superstar-derrick-roses-career-may-be-coming-to-an-end-but-dont-cry-for-him):  &gt; Poor Derrick Rose's NBA career may have just ended today  &gt; Rose's skills have dried up and blown away like tumbleweed. He's a dreadful shooter, shaky defender   &gt; Rose leaves a mixed legacy  &gt;  Rose is washed-up.   &gt; he's been a basket case."
Nothing would please me more than Derrick Rose going MVP mode through the playoffs. I might actually nut.  Can you guys imagine how amazing it would be to have the youngest MVP in league history who had his career destroyed thanks to injuries come back and fucking dominate?  I know it wont happen... but if it does. :D
"""multiple sweeps"" they got swept once....without Simmons which is the equivalent of the Sixers bragging about beating the 1st seed Bulls when Derrick Rose tore his ACL. Anyway they took the best team in basketball to 7 games and lost on a miracle shot. The Celtics never at any point beat the best team in the NBA or came close to it in a 7 game series.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: with Embiid and Simmons both playing the Celtics are 1-8 in their last 9 games. Seems bad. Idk.  &amp;#x200B;  you would legit lose to the knicks if you played in the first round."
"I’m telling you! Derrick Rose 🌹 is a name I envy. Alongside that, I love Kelly Oubre Jr as a name too"
"Dwane Casey needs to reevaluate his “Derrick, you may have a chance here just as much as they do in New York.” comment about Rose wanting to make the playoffs. Pistons are worst team in the East while Knicks are fourth with 9 game winning streak."
Yeah I think Len Bias and Derrick Rose are the biggest what if’s
Shoutout to Derrick Rose
"&gt; Reality says they traded second rounders and role players for Rose because that's all they really had in terms of assets to trade. If you think logically and not with emotion and narrative (how 99% of this sub thinks)  Reality says we traded a single 2023 second rounder - which was from Philly and one of the three 2023 seconds we owned at the time - and a G-Leaguer for Derrick Rose. You’re intentionally misrepresenting the facts.  Also we have the most cap room in the league and the second most owned picks behind OKC. Acting like we have nowhere to go is hilarious, considering we’re still in a position to absorb contracts for picks without even giving anything up ourselves"
Jimmy Butler to the finals last year. Derrick Rose to the finals this year.
Derrick Rose was an MVP my dude.
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE
The shade.  Derrick rose was always awesome.  People just slept on him bc he wasn’t a high flier anymore
"The cherry on top is Derrick Rose. He's playing for the best team since his mvp season, AND he's a major contributor. I just wanna see him succeed man."
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Derrick Rose.  The team just looks completely different with him. He makes everyone's job so much easier.  And his handles are absolutely ridicoulus.
"Nah he's just saving Derrick Rose for the playoffs where he's gonna average 28/8 in 36 mpg as the starter. Thibs finally discovered load management, hes unstoppable, leagues fucked.   Of course that's not actually what's happening, but its fun to pretend"
"Vintage Derrick ""We men"" Rose"
Derrick Rose makes a free throw: “He’s playing like prime drose”  “Vintage drose“ “D-rose is back” “What could’ve been” “I miss prime d rose” “D Rose would’ve been the goat” “If the drose didn’t get injured he’d be better than curry”
Im only watching Knicks because of Derrick Rose. He’s the greatest
The next Derrick Rose
Love seeing Derrick rose thrive
"I mean, Shout out to Derrick Rose! That fella nice"
Steve Nash and Derrick Rose the modern ones
"Derrick Rose I guess, he was still a beast though don't get me wrong. Just in comparison to others, his numbers don't stand out as much."
"In the last 20 years prolly Derrick Rose, though he did deserve it (could def make an argument he didn’t)"
Love to see people sure that Ja 100% won’t become a superstar when his second year stats are literally a carbon copy of Derrick Rose
"Prime Steph, Prime Melo, Prime Derrick Rose, Vince Carter, White Chocolate, Prime Jason Kidd  That’s a good startb"
"Steph, Prime Melo, White Chocolate, prime Vince Carter, unironically LaMelo Ball, prime Derrick Rose"
"Fred Hoiberg was such a bad coach. He came in and instantly lost the team’s trust by backstabbing Joakim Noah. Then he backstabbed Derrick Rose. Then he wouldn’t coach the team, so Jimmy had to take over as coach."
Derrick Rose and Allen Iverson.
Didnt Derrick rose say they do?
Peak Derrick Rose
Healthy Derrick Rose
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
Derrick Rose when he had overpowered quickness
"Derrick Rose was so entertaining to watch. His fluidity and finishes around the rim were some of the best. He still is fun to watch, but young D. Rose was entertaining as fuck."
MVP: Julius Randle   DPOY: Nerlens Noel  MIP: Julius Randle  COTY: Thibs   ROY: Quickley  6MOY: Derrick Rose
He’s like a mix of Derrick Rose and Charles Barkley.
Idk if you worded the title correctly but what I do know is:  Derrick Rose - On court: +10.4 Off court: -0.5  Immanuel Quickley - On court: +6.9 Off court: -1.0  Elfrid Payton - On court: -2.0 Off court: +5.1  Come playoffs Derrick Rose should be starting and Payton should probably be out of the rotation with Frank getting 15ish mins. Putting Quckley with Frank allows Frank to cover Quickley's defensive flaws and gives us another shooter to put in the corner rather than Payton who can't shoot at all.  Quickley/Payton - On court: -15.4  Quickley/Ntilikina - On court: +1.9
"I dont think so, he is like a relatively poor mans Derrick rose. Which is still pretty good tbh"
"Stop Stop it, do not do him like that. What are you doing Dragic? Did you not get the memo? Derrick Rose can go upstairs! WOoOooo. Oh my goodness....I wanna go **hiiiigher**"
"Other than LeBron, which IMO is head-and-shoulders above any other potential story. . .  Derrick Rose returns to Chicago and leads the team to a title"
"Derrick Rose grew up in Chicago during the Michael Jordan era grew up idolising him. Got drafted by his home team, the bulls and becomes the youngest league MVP. In this timeline, he doesn't get injured and win the villains of the league, the Miami Heat superteam that just formed that offseason."
"Stacey King for the Bulls. Here are some of many:  * ""Big-time players make big-time plays!"" When a player makes a clutch shot.  * ""Let me step back and kiss myself!"" When a player makes a big shot.  * ""Bang, bang, bang!"" Whenever a player makes a 3.  * ""Give me the hot sauce! Sriracha"" When a player makes a big shot.  * ""I didn't come for the massage, I came for the facial"" When a player posterizes another player.  * ""Thadgic Johnson"" Whenever Thad Young makes an assist.  * ""Brought to you by the law offices of Young and Satoransky"" Whenever Thad and Sato assist each other  * ""Jimmy G Buckets, and the G stands for gets."" When Jimmy Butler would hit a clutch shot when he was on the Bulls.  * ""Windy City Assassin"" Would say that about Derrick Rose.  * ""Theis, Theis baby"" When Daniel Theis scores.  * ""Stop it"" When a player makes a big shot/tough shot/dunk  * ""I'm hype Neil Funk"" When a player makes a big play. Neil Funk was his old announcer partner.   I couldn't find a recent video, but here are some highlights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_LQmvFpwbU    Bonus: Here's him and fellow announcer Adam Amin roasting a Bulls fan for his jersey. Stacey and the Bulls ended up reaching out to him and giving him a Jersey and Bulls gear. The fan took it in stride: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZtfAnV3mrw"
Crazy they never tried before it's a no brainer.  You can get guys like KAT and Wiggins at #1 or even a Derrick Rose.  And if the lottery ball doesn't bounce your way with 25% odds you can get a #2 pick like DLo.
"I hope Seattle can bring in more help for this rookie KD, he needs a point guard in the upcoming draft like this PG rookie like Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook if we fail to get Derrick Rose"
"Fuck the process baby. Results are all that matter. Reality is that trades are always graded with hindsight. Go look at the reaction to the Nets getting Garnett/Pierce/Terry. People thought that was a good trade for them at the time and it is now considered the worst trade in NBA history.   The Knicks signed Randle, Bullock, and Marcus Morris with the cap space created by trading KP + THJ and Courtney Lee. Morris was flipped for the Clippers pick  which turned into Quickely who will make 1st team all rookie if the voters have a clue. Knicks also got Detroit’s 2nd rounder this year in that trade which will be a very early 2nd rounder. DSJ and Charlotte’s 2nd rounder (which will be in the mid 40s) was flipped for Derrick Rose who has improved the team substantially.  Gave up: KP + THJ contract + Courtney Lee contract + Trey Burke + 2021 2nd via Charlotte   Received: Julius Randle + Reggie Bullock + Immanuel Quickley + Derrick Rose + unprotected 2021 Dallas 1st + top 10 protected 2023 Dallas 1st + 2021 2nd via Detroit.  That’s what the trade ended up being for the Knicks. Massive, massive, W.  Fuck KP and more importantly fuck Mavs fans. Luka deserves better than KP but those shitheads don’t. Getting exactly what they deserved after how absurdly arrogant, condescending, and obnoxious they were about that trade."
"No one knows. The only person that has actually talked about it that was there was Jimmy. KAT, Wiggins, Thibs, and everyone haven't released any details about it. The only person that did say something was Derrick Rose that said Jimmy only scored one basket during the practice"
"He is a mediocre player asking for 20m per year.  He is a PG that can't attack the rim, he doesn't score enough points, he doesn't have enough assists, and even his decent 3pt numbers comes from the fact he is not respected as a great shooter, so he got a lot of open attempts per game, and barely scores any point in clutch time.  The final 2 minutes in last game against Knicks sums up Lonzo as a player: while Derrick Rose was making smart decisions, scoring 3, attacking the rim, giving decisive assists and decisive defensive display, Lonzo was making turn overs, predictable offensive moves and silly defensive mistakes.      Clutch time is usually the time for PG to shine, and Lonzo always disappear. Despite most Pels fans using Bledsoe as a scapegoat, the true is Lonzo is not really much better than Bledsoe."
"Derrick Rose one of the best to ever do it, was a complete MVP level force before the injury but adapted his game and transitioned to an efficient scoring and improved playmaking PG.  His defense is his weakest point but he is still a really damn good player. Could start as PG on many teams or a strong impact 6th man (which he's also performed as)."
Derrick Rose.
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
"Derrick Rose after his second knee injury: ""DRAGOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"""
XD guys I just thought of a funky joke. Tom Thidoebeaiboe be like it’s black out day. Derrick rose be like Black Lives Matter. CRINGEEE no not like that- Thidibaioa
Don't forget Derrick Rose :)
Derrick Rose is probably my favorite player all time. Seeing him get that game winning block on Bledsoe was awesome. I forgot who I was rooting for for a second. I CANT WAIT to see him back in the playoffs.
"Murray going down ruined our hopes for not just this year but next too, since he'll probably play it slow coming back like other stars have to ensure they don't Derrick Rose themselves.  I feel so bad man, I was hoping this would be our year..."
"I feel like it all depends on what you love about basketball. For me it would be the 2010s. You have Lebron reaching his peak and finally overcoming adversity and win multiple rings while making the finals 8 straight years. You also have Stephen Curry making his mark on the leauge and leaving the biggest imprint in basketbalm history in the way people play basketball now and even look at basketball now as in terms of what are ""good shots"" or ""bad shots"". Then you have KD, the EASILY most unstoppable scorer of all time. You also have Russ breaking the triple double record for the first time since the 60s i believe. Lob City, Heatles, 73-9 Warriors, Prime Derrick Rose Bulls, Toronto wins their first ring ever. A young PG13 pushing the Miami Heat to 6 and 7 games. The 2012-2013 OKC Thunder who has 3 MVPs on it in hindsight. The 2016 NBA Finals that weren't really close when it came to game by game results but it was special because the story it told. The 2016 Christmas game between Cavs and Golden State where KD just joined the warriors and Kyrie hitting the game winner. Klay and Steph hitting MULTIPLE 3 point and scoring records. Kobe's retirement going out with 60pts. Even the 2016 dunk contest and TNT's Inside the NBA which really became a thing in the 2010s once Shaq became a permanent member."
yup. derrick rose called me for advice ;)
Shoutout to Derrick Rose!
"If you include his time in Detroit this season Derrick Rose is averaging 4 APG, if you go by only his stats since being traded to the Knicks he is averaging 3.9APG. In Derrick Rose's first run with the Knicks he averaged 4.4APG.   Since his injury, that is the 4th highest APG season he only broke 5APG once it was the 19-20 season in Detroit.   You are painfully incorrect.  [Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html)"
"Derrick Rose had a great team around him with a great coach as well, it was all set up beautifully for him to just dominate an entire decade. Sucks ass that we missed out on the Rose vs Lebron rivalry."
Pretty much. If Thibs isn't actively working to get Derrick Rose those minutes and do literally everything in his power to get the gang back together..... Joakim Noah out of retirement and back into a Knicks jersey then humanity is pretty much doomed.
Hopefully not a Derrick Rose type outcome.
"The world healing itself under Thibs only happens when Derrick Rose is clocking 48 minutes a game, everyone knows this. These are in fact the end times."
"We've straight up won it already. Randle is better than Porzingis, the cap space cleared also allowed us to sign and then trade Marcus Morris which got us Immanuel Quickley and the Detroit 2nd this year, which will be 31/32, we traded Dennis Smith Jr for Derrick Rose and we still have two incoming first round picks from them."
&gt;Derrick Rose!  This is how I feel about the Suns + Monty Williams reunion. Nice to see star player + coach reunite and win down the road.
Guys. Guys. He's making them rest so he can play Derrick Rose 48 minutes for old time's sake.
Nba Reddit swarms so hard when you invoke Derrick rose (and a few others) in any light other than swooning adoration lmfao
hardly dynastic i agree cuz the team wasnt that good. Lebron had to put a lot of work to win those years. One thing was for sure tho even at his worst he was gon make the finals lmao. Keep thinking in your fantasy that derrick rose was going to beat that version of lebron tho.
For reference THT is shooting 62.9% from 0-3ft. Kyrie didn’t have a higher percentage for a season until he played for the Celtics. Curry didn’t do that until 13/14 and he was 25 years old.   Edit: to add to that Derrick Rose didn’t do that until he was on the 17/18. MVP Westbrook wasn’t finishing at that percentage.
"Lebron could've easily said   ""There are a lot of good candidates this season, a lot of players playing at an MVP level. It's going to be a tight race"" Done.  Hell even Bosh said Rose when he could've said Lebron.  *""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""*"
"Fucking Derrick Rose stans.    They are mostly people who don't watch basketball, who don't understand what ""defense"" is, and who only count stats."
Shoutout Luol Deng for making me feel sad about Derrick rose again
"/u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show *(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)*.   MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose *(the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06)*.  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT *(14-25)* on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's *(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)*. That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers *(and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots)*.  **26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%** Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  **17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG%** Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  **19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG%** Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. [Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.](https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0)  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales *that* heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas **37 times that season.**  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  &gt;*""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""*  **Jason Kidd**  &gt;*""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.*  **Steve Nash**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""*  **Tyson Chandler**  &gt;*""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""*  **Magic Johnson**  &gt;*""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""*  **Michael Jordan**  &gt;*""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""*  **Scottie Pippen**  &gt;*""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""*  **Kevin Love**  &gt;*""MVP. He's my MVP.""*  **Z-Bo** after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  &gt;*""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""*  **Mike D'Antoni**  &gt;*""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""*  **Frank Vogel**  &gt;*""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""*  **Charles Barkley**  &gt;*""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""*  **Mike Breen**  &gt;*""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""*  **Jeff Van Gundy**  *""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""*  **Scott Skiles**  &gt;*""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""*  **Stan Van Gundy**  &gt;*""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""*  **Doc Rivers**  &gt;*""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""*  **Phil Jackson**  &gt;*""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""*  **Gregg Popovich**  &gt;*""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""*  **Juwan Howard**  &gt;*""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""*  **Chris Bosh**  &gt;*""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""*  **Lebron** when asked to weigh in on MVP race  &gt;*""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""*  **Brian Scalabrine**  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"The Bulls won't be anywhere close to the best record in the league without Rose and that's just a fact. Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.      Jason Kidd, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Dantoni, Tyson Chandler, KLove, Pop, Phil Jackson, Chris Bosh and even Lebron himself all said during the season that Rose should win the MVP and yet people here still aren't convinced.... smh"
2021 knicks are 17-6 when Derrick Rose plays
"Even Lebron said the MVP deserved to go to Rose but his fan boys won't let this die.  ""I think [it's] Derrick Rose,"" James said before the Heat's game Wednesday night against the Washington Wizards. ""What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and them being first in the Eastern Conference -- they're playing some really good basketball."""
17-6 when Derrick Rose plays. 3-0 when he started 3 games for the knicks. Says alot
"Derrick Rose put up 20.8/3.8/6.0 on 53.2% TS  in 2010. Going by people just looking at stats, you'd think that Rose vs Sexton would be a valid discussion - it's not Derrick Rose had a much better season. Not saying Ja had as good of a season as Derrick Rose did in 2010, but stats could be very misleading.  For example, Kevin Martin put ip 23.7/4.5/2.1 on 61.8% TS in 2008.  Is anyone gonna tell me Kevin Martin had nearly as good as a season in 2008 as Derrick Rose did in 2010? You'd get laughed out of the building if you said that a decade ago, and still would right now.  Take another example, Kyrie in his third year put up 20/4/6 on 53% TS in his third year. Can you honestly say that Sexton is having nearly as good of a season as Kyrie did? No way."
"They weren’t a top offense, they had the 11th best offense in the league. And things like speed and handles are only as valuable as what they allow you to do on the court. Derrick Rose was a really good player, but he benefited from the “best offensive player on the best team” MVP narrative as much as anybody in history ever has."
"you’re using FGA instead of things like speed and handles. watch that Derrick Rose against a defense, he was a “crafty” playmaker and damn near impossible to stay in front of, he was so explosive and lead that offense when he got shut down, you don’t operate a league best offense yourself and not be incredibly talented, he wasn’t just pulling up until things went in"
"It’s like, sure, Derrick Rose, but in 2012-13 LeBron was basically a god."
"Umm, how do I put this lightly?..  Derrick Martell Rose is literally the greatest basketball player of all time. If Jesus came back to earth and laced’em up.. he would be Derrick Martell Rose.   Derrick Martell Rose — is basketball.  I’m naming all of my children Derrick Martell Rose. Even the girls."
My argument is just fine. Derrick Rose was basically a league average scorer who took a high volume of shots. Comparing him to Curry this season just makes you look silly.
"Probably Nerlens Noel, Reggie Bullock, and Derrick Rose. KEEP THIS SQUAD"
"Significantly better? Bulls were deeper and Derrick Rose was 23! He was still getting better each year. We never saw his ceiling. Plus, go look at the W-L record. That team was so good.  It is likely the Bulls could have peaked and unseated the Miami Heat the next year in the 2013 playoffs. The heat was only a bounce away from not winning the finals after all. They were not unbeatable."
Big dick Thibs😎  Fat Cock randle😈  R “The J is for Juicy Johnson” Barret😫  Taj Horse Cock Gibson😳  Derrick the Heavy Hog Rose😱  Dicking down the league again color me suprised😏
"But that Bulls team overperformed a lot thanks to Rose and that Heat team underperformed expectations. Sure, LeBron could go 100% in the playoffs, but the guy who was the most valuable player in the regular season night in and night out was Derrick Rose."
Heading into the playoffs Bulls were considered a team who could and would knock Miami off.  People forget how good Derrick Rose was and how good that 2011-2012 squad was.

Derrick rose is playing out of his mind
"Julius Randle and Derrick Rose presents: “The 2021 NBA Champions, The New York Knicks”"
Derrick Rose can apparently hit a floater from literally anywhere on the court now so that's pretty cool.
SHOUT OUT DERRICK ROSE
SHOUT OUT DERRICK ROSE
Derrick rose wow
Derrick Rose man...brings a tear to my eye
Derrick rose mid range masta
Derrick Rose is made to be a spark plug scorer off the bench. Doesn’t make sense for him to start and just take away touches from Randle and Barrett.
Also Derrick Rose. Just play him more minutes and stagger with the other starters
I love me some Derrick rose
Well I know one thing that almost every sports accomplishment that seems amazing or extraordinary has been eventually linked to some sort of cheating. History is on my side on this. Derrick Rose can attest...Steph is a great shooter give him a little. Some thing extra to keep his legs stronger longer than normal. Something that helps him stay mentally focused a little longer or stay/get in the zone a little longer and that makes him almost unstoppable like he is now.  Think Barry Bonds before roids he was already elite then he got on the juice and he became godly.  Think Lance before PED's he was great then add PED's to his blood stream an you have a god.   Sports are tainted.
"Don't know of any yet but I'm wondering if Derrick Rose will despite being the youngest MVP ever.. Just terrible, terrible injury luck in that case though."
"this is exactly how derrick rose got injured, steve kerr is 100% in the right not playing his stars in 4th quarter blowouts"
Derrick rose?
Ask Derrick Rose.  Steroids are different from PED's. Think Lance Armstrong.
"&gt;Yet it's annoying when people praise LeBron or call him the GOAT for carrying scrubs to the finals or during the season?  People praising LeBron, save very few exceptions when he says something obviously stupid, is virtually *all we do here*.  You could rename this place r/lebronthebest and it would be topical like 90 percent of the time.  &gt;Y'all bulls fans scream praises at Derrick Rose for coming off the bench lol, or salivate at Jokic carrying the Nuggets.  Yeah, because we're using the same logic that drives 99 percent of the ""Lebron is the most amazing, but super victimized because he just has no teammates who are all injured or suck, the poor thing, also pay no attention to those multiple future hall of famers over there on his squad"" narrative that we see.  And yet what happens then?  Some LeBronstans tell us that ACL tears that happen to *other teams*, well, those, hey, those aren't injuries.  Only if it happens to a LeBron teammate - then it counts, and is super tragic and stuff."
Everyone with no real understanding of body mechanics blames Thibs for what happened with Derrick Rose.  Ironic given that the man himself still swears by Thibodeau.
I kinda agree especially if Washington ends up being a long term spot for him and he continues to be #2. I really think he's more durable than we thought if he can come back from two quad tears and look 85% like mvp Russ.  I think only way he gets less than 250 is if he willingly stops and gets tired of the media hoopla or if he goes into a Derrick Rose or Melo off-the-bench role.
"I mean it's true tho. LeBron was carrying the Lakers to the 2nd best record in the entire league without AD before the ankle injury. Whiners are annoying regardless, but there's nothing wrong with praising LeBron for carrying the team. Y'all bulls fans scream praises at Derrick Rose for coming off the bench lol, or salivate at Jokic carrying the Nuggets. Yet it's annoying when people praise LeBron or call him the GOAT for carrying scrubs to the finals or during the season? That's some pretty blatant LeBron hate to me lol, too obvious. We praise players who do praiseworthy things, get the hate outta your heart."

"Small sample size.  Only Bill Walton and Derrick Rose have suffered catastrophic injuries shortly after winning MVP.  Walton had an all-time great college career, a Finals MVP, 6MoY near the end of his career, and 2 championships to go with his MVP.  I would say that adds up to more than two MVPs.  We don’t yet know about Derrick Rose, but he’s not a 100% first round lock."
Why would he play Derrick Rose in garbage time?
Derrick Rose got put in.
I remember seeing everyone on the 2011 Bulls had a positive D-PIPM except Derrick Rose who isn't too bad himself. I believe the 2001 Sixers were similar also.
"&gt; Derrick Rose would never return  I read this and my immediate thought was ""well no, they just meant he wouldn't be as good"" and then the memories hit me like a fuckin' wave lol. THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT HE'D LITERALLY NEVER COME BACK. What the fuck. I had wiped all of those dumbass conversations from my head. Lord."
"&gt;A PG lines up at the 1 position and primarily guards the opposing team's PG. That is the criteria. While LeBron does line up at the 1 from time to time, this is not his nateral position and he often does not guard the opposing team's PG, especially against younger quicker guards.  Defensive assignment does not determine your position. Tons of teams cross match players constantly to avoid a mismatch. The Warriors literally used to hide Steph so Klay could defend the better backcourt player. Bam was assigned with guarding Kemba for possessions at a time in the Celtics series last playoffs. Hell, even Lebron was guarding Tony Parker and Derrick Rose in those series."
Youre really gonna call him the greatest Cav or all time when the Cavs had an MVP player on their roster? (Derrick Rose)
"Hey hey hey, we got Derrick Rose for DSJ, the prized asset from the Porzingis trade"
"Same crowd that said Kobe would never win a championship, LeBron will never get close to Jordan, Derrick Rose would never return, Steph Curry was a bust etc etc  It’s the same old tale. It’s always a bunch of 17 to 20-year-olds making the most noise"
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
Draymond is gonna get no respect from so many people in 20 years or so. He already gets less respect than he deserves for his still amazing defense. Talked with some dude a few weeks ago saying Derrick Rose is as important to the current Knicks as Draymond is to the Warriors. You kidding me?
"lmao this guy can't be serious. off the top of my head these PGs are all better than Lowry:   Kidd, Magic,  Nash, Steph, Parker, Zeke, Stockton, Oscar, Cousy, West, Westbrook, Paul, Irving, Billups, Frazier, Archibald, Johnson, Lillard.   That's 18 off the bat and that doesn't even include guys like Deron Williams, Derrick Rose, Rajon Rondo whom are all debatable imo. Lowry is at best top 20, but top 30 is more like it."
Derrick Rose
Lmao what. It's probably Derrick Rose if I had to guess off the top of my head. I've only been watching since like 95 though  Edit: Probably AI
"Steve Nash, Derrick Rose"
"Chris Paul with the Ultimate comeback comes to a young NYK team and he unlocks RJ’s potential. Randle and the rest continue to improve and CP3 doesn’t actually age, CP3 is top 5 as well as Derrick Rose is one of the best role players ever."
"I would put Jordan, Kobe and lebron mixtape over their. Also Steph, Derrick rose and Westbrook"
"&gt;What determines a player to be the best on the planet? I think that's a subjective thing isn't it? In 1981 Bird certainly had a case to be. So did Magic, and Moses Malone. Bird was definitely a top 3 player in the league at the time.   Most people considered it to be Kareem or Malone.   &gt;Lebron didn't even win MVP that year - that was Derrick Rose, who Lebron beat in the playoffs. Nobody says that Rose choked even though he was the MVP that year? KD had a great season as well. It's debatable that Lebron was the best player on the planet that year.  MVP doesn't mean best player. And KD just wasn't as good as LeBron then.  &gt;So that means he deserves to be hated for this for the rest of his career??   Of course not. But he will(and rightfully should) be criticized about this series.  &gt;It's literally the Finals I see brought up over and over and over again ad nauseum. He played in 9 other Finals and everyone just wants to talk about this one, probably because he failed to meet expectations in this Finals.  People bring it up a lot because it's a huge thing in the MJ vs LeBron debate.  &gt;In 2007 he was far too young and inexperienced and nobody expected him to even be there  Not many people blame him for that loss(although that series could've definitely gone 6 games if LeBron played better).  &gt;and post 2011 all of Lebron's Finals he performed well in so you can't criticized those  Yes we know  &gt;so the only one people can latch on to is 2011 so they keep bringing it up.   People bring it up because it's valuable when it comes to the MJ vs LBJ debate.  &gt;I've never seen this for any other great player, it would be like if people kept bringing up the fact that Magic choked in 1984 Finals and that's the only Finals they remember for him.  People bring up Tragic Johnson a lot when talking about magic's career.   &gt;And I scratch my head at this. This bad?? 18/7/7 on 48% shooting how's it THAT bad?   Because he was extremely passive, played 0 defense, and averaged like 2 points in the 4th quarter.  &gt;Kobe in 2004 Finals when he had 22 PPG on 38% shooting and lost to the massive underdog Pistons  This is another choke that's brought up lot. But it's not as bad as LeBron's since Kobe played better defense.  &gt;Kareem in 1983 Finals when he got massively outplayed by Moses Malone  The sixers were favorites to win the title that year.  &gt;Wilt in the 1968 playoffs had a huge choke against Russell's Celtics when he was the favorite to win having the better team as well as the regular season MVP  I agree that this should be brought up more. But the sixers did also have injuries.  &gt;Magic in the 1984 Finals choked pretty bad and was nicknamed 'Tragic Johnson'  Again, it's brought up a lot. But it's not as bad since the celtics and lakers were seen as equals.  &gt;Steph Curry in the 2016 Finals when he performed significantly below his 'unanimous' MVP levels choked when his team was up 3-1  Probably the 2nd biggest choke ever. But it's not as bad since Curry wasn't 100% healthy.  &gt;Dirk who before 2011 was actually a perennial choker like in 2006 Finals and notably in the 2007 first round when he lost to the 8 seeded Warriors,  The finals in 2006 was bad for Dirk, but it wasn't as bad as LeBron. And while Dirk did have a trash series against the Warriors, the Warriors were a team designed to beat Dallas.  &gt;KD don't forget he was up 3-1 versus the Warriors in 2016 and choked hard  Big choke but okc were the under dogs and KD actually had a good game 7.  &gt;even Jordan like I said had that 1995 series against the Magic where he turned over the ball more than usual and wasn't playing like his normal self - rusty or not you can't say that he didn't perform below his standards.  Again, he was rusty. That counts. Also Jordan still played great in that series.  Also I'm gonna go to bed rn. So don't expect a reply until tomorrow."
Derrick Rose as well
"&gt;Bird at 1981 wasn't the best player on the planet. Kobe in 2000 was injured and wasn't the best player on the planet.  What determines a player to be the best on the planet? I think that's a subjective thing isn't it? In 1981 Bird certainly had a case to be. So did Magic, and Moses Malone. Bird was definitely a top 3 player in the league at the time. Lebron didn't even win MVP that year - that was Derrick Rose, who Lebron beat in the playoffs. Nobody says that Rose choked even though he was the MVP that year? KD had a great season as well. It's debatable that Lebron was the best player on the planet that year.  &gt;Maybe because he choked against an inferior dallas team after claiming that the heat were going to win many rings.  So that means he deserves to be hated for this for the rest of his career?? It's literally the Finals I see brought up over and over and over again ad nauseum. He played in 9 other Finals and everyone just wants to talk about this one, probably because he failed to meet expectations in this Finals. In 2007 he was far too young and inexperienced and nobody expected him to even be there and post 2011 all of Lebron's Finals he performed well in so you can't criticized those, so the only one people can latch on to is 2011 so they keep bringing it up. I've never seen this for any other great player, it would be like if people kept bringing up the fact that Magic choked in 1984 Finals and that's the only Finals they remember for him.  &gt;No superstar has had a series this bad though. And most superstars get criticized for their chokes.  And I scratch my head at this. This bad?? 18/7/7 on 48% shooting how's it THAT bad? Let me list a few performances by superstars who's had subjectively (and objectively) worse chokes than this: Kobe in 2004 Finals when he had 22 PPG on 38% shooting and lost to the massive underdog Pistons, Kareem in 1983 Finals when he got massively outplayed by Moses Malone, Wilt in the 1968 playoffs had a huge choke against Russell's Celtics when he was the favorite to win having the better team as well as the regular season MVP, Magic in the 1984 Finals choked pretty bad and was nicknamed 'Tragic Johnson', Steph Curry in the 2016 Finals when he performed significantly below his 'unanimous' MVP levels choked when his team was up 3-1, Dirk who before 2011 was actually a perennial choker like in 2006 Finals and notably in the 2007 first round when he lost to the 8 seeded Warriors, KD don't forget he was up 3-1 versus the Warriors in 2016 and choked hard, even Jordan like I said had that 1995 series against the Magic where he turned over the ball more than usual and wasn't playing like his normal self - rusty or not you can't say that he didn't perform below his standards.  There's lots of superstars who choked like Lebron had, sometimes even worse. They don't get half the amount of hate that Lebron does though."
Steve Francis and Derrick Rose
Prime Derrick Rose. He was so quick and athletic
Julius Randle  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Steph Curry  Carmelo Anthony (forever)
Derrick Rose
"People have said that about Derrick Rose too, but I don't think so.  They've both just had rough backgrounds and are introverted.  Not everyone can avoid being awkward with public speaking."
"Yep, 11-14. Team FG% of .449, 3PT% of .355, and allowing 104.1pts vs. scoring 102.7 per game.   In the 40 games since Rose was traded and started playing for the Knicks, y'all have gone 26-14, with team FG% of .464, 3PT% of .411, and are now scoring 110.4pts per game vs. your opponent's 104.9. So defense has slipped slightly (7 of your top 10 highest opposition scores this season have come during the past 40 games), but offense, particularly on the perimeter, has opened up immensely.   Obviously it's not just Derrick; it took some time for Thibs and his system to really click, and guys have been getting more and more comfortable with their individual roles as the season has gone on. But Rose is clearly a positive influence, with his +/- of 7.2, 3PT% of .400, and his near-career best true shooting percentage of .555.   In summary; he's balling, and it's good for the Knicks."
He’s Charles Barkley x Derrick Rose
Thicc long Derrick Rose
Fun fact - Jrue has said his toughest cover was Derrick Rose
TIL Derrick Rose is still in the NBA
Idk who I'm happier for  Derrick Rose or Knicks fans
I don't know why they clowned he want to go back to the coach who has trust for him he wanted to get back in the system that made him great and he likes tibbs and tibbs likes Rose and Derrick is comfortable in that system he can play without learning
Former MVP Derrick Rose 😞😤
"God told the greatest player to rise, so Derrick Rose."
only one team was screaming at the refs  and it was also the same team that was +11 on fts at this point and getting all the calls.  just couldnt deal with the knicks popping off from 3 and derrick rose going nuts.  ja having a shit game and couldnt control his emotions  fuck off salty bitch
"Derrick Rose is my favorite and least favorite player at the same time.   I feel like an abused spouse looking for his redeeming qualities.  *See he did something good,  he's not all bad!*  -signed former cynical Bulls fan."
Well-deserved. Randle has such a motor and his work ethic combined with self-awareness of how to practically improve his three-point shot and play style as him and his team flourishing. Derrick Rose having a huge impact for the Knicks under Thibbs as well. Wholesome for not just a single team’s fan base.
"First, the other poster asked a question and I'm responding about what the narrative is. There are many young people on this site.  E.g.: 2020: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/5/28/21273402/tom-thibodeau-knicks-coaching-rumors  2018: https://dunkingwithwolves.com/2018/02/26/does-timberwolves-coach-tom-thibodeau-have-an-injury-problem/  2012: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1164720-derrick-rose-injury-blame-for-knee-must-fall-on-tom-thibodeau  Second, it's more about how many of his players acquire injuries (not even talking about D. Rose). Miami is suffering from the low turnaround time frame (same for Lakers) after the Finals to having to come back and you can see by our dismal record (relatively), everyone is exhausted or quickly injured. NYK are doing well, as Thibs always does in the first or second year but it's not sustainable for the next point.  Third, Thibs is a good defensive coach. However, because he, like Vogel and Spo, preach defense, those players are more than usually exhausted by having to work both sides of the court. So when those players play deep into the playoffs and then have to come back, those teams will be exhausted and fall further in the playoffs."
Everyone loves Derrick Rose.
"I hate the Knicks, but Derrick and Thibs are basketball soul mates he always got the best out of him here in Chi. Comeback home Rose and retire here!"
Derozan :’(  Derrick Rose :’(  Tony Parker  ??!!
"I remember when the usual talking heads said we were wrong for giving up DSJ and a second round pick for an aged Derrick Rose. Saying ""we gave up too much"" lmao"
Dennis Smith Jr has now been traded for Kristnaps Porzingis and Derrick Rose.
"I’m convinced Derrick Rose is a below average player without Thibs, I’m not knocking D rose, it’s just that they were made for each other"
Derrick Rose winning a ring would be the ultimate character arc.   I just feel for him so much. Especially if you see all the crazy shit written about him in the media.
"A part of the problem was the importance of landing mechanics weren't as understood at the time. His injury really shed light on the importance of it. If he would of came up in today's NBA it very likely would have been coached out of him (his landing mechanics are much improved today due to coaching).  Not to mention although it's only been like 10-11 years acl surgery/rehab has improved significantly.  I don't buy the argument that Derrick Rose couldn't have maintained his style of play, he just needed to land better and rest more."
For the last 2-3 years i've been adamantly arguing that Derrick Rose is still a great player and not washed. He's adapted and matured his game to the point where you wouldn't even think he had sustained a potential career ending injury early on.
"More importantly, has Derrick Rose learned what the word consent means yet?"
derrick rose GOAT?
"&gt; I mean, it seems the only arguments people have are ""He's old and he's still top of his game, so he clearly must be using roids""  ...yeah that's not the argument at all.  You want to know the argument for Lebron(or any other NBA player) using PEDs?    * They're playing a professional sport that that barely makes a token effort to test for PEDs * The NBA has no real reason to give a shit about PEDs.  You think they want to crack down on something that can help keep Lebron/Kobe/etc keep playing longer?  * Less than 20 NBA players have been suspended for PEDs in over 4 decades since their ""testing"" program started  * Derrick Rose once said the NBA PED problem was a ""7 out of 10"" * George Carl on PEDs: ""  It’s obvious some of our players are doping. How are some guys getting older—yet thinner and fitter? How are they recovering from injuries so fast? Why the hell are they going to Germany in the off-season?""   Do I think Lebron uses/used PEDs?  Yeah.  Do I think that's any different from hundreds of other players in the league? No."
"About to drop some knowledge on you from a different thread, please hold:  I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.""  Juwan Howard  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"Derrick Rose, Quickley, RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, and I guess I’d go Embiid over Jokic. But close"
"Look, even as good as he's been Derrick Rose is a free agent this offseason and will be 33 years old before the start of next season - I think a first round pick was a bit much to expect...   I might have held out for your own 2nd round pick back instead of Charlotte's though."
Derrick Rose completely turned his season around on the Knicks
"&gt;One could argue Derrick Rose may be a top 3 point guard in the league, when you ignore his post-injury seasons.  And if his stats suggest that, he/she wouldn't be wrong."
"&gt;Derrick Rose is still as good as he's always been  C'mon now, the dude has an MVP. He's still a very good player under the right circumstances, let's stick to that."
KD still probably has that title though. And Derrick rose has a solid case over both of them as well
Derrick Rose is such a talent that he's doing this at 32 after all the injuries. Imagine how insane he really would have been. He's still much faster than most people 12 years younger than him.
You can't tell the story of Basketball without Derrick Rose
"yeah he's lost his athleticism but that was what made prime Derrick rose insane. he's still a solid role player, but comparing him to his peak is nahhhh"
"&gt; Luka's kind of market corrected LeBron--he's shown that he can outplay young LeBron at an even higher level of competition than he ever faced. He's the best chance out of anybody in the last thirty years to competing with Jordan for GOAT.  He hasn't even won a playoff series yet lets relax  While sure the East besides the Pacers and Going-To-Work Pistons wasn't that deep when Lebron entered the league he still has faced competition that Luka has yet to or may never face  The Big 3 Celtics  MVP Derrick Rose Bulls  'Beautiful Game' Spurs   11 Mavs  OKC Trio  GSW 73-9  GSW 73-9 + KD  Like shit, Luka is amazing but he's beating up on a poor chemistry Clips team that's all theoretically brilliant with no evidence of actual success (as a team) and you're throwing out some hard takes about comparing him to someone like Lebron who came back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals against a 73-9 team"
"I mean he has his numbers down. But picking the peak seasons for each player is not doing his hypothesis a favour.   One could argue Derrick Rose may be a top 3 point guard in the league, when you ignore his post-injury seasons."
I have no connection to Chicago sports but when i first started watching basketball I remember hearing about Derrick rose and how his injuries ended his career. Watching him struggle to find his place was right around when I first started watching. To see him fight hard for his place and to be rewarded by leading an underdog playoff team to their first postseason win in years is… man that’s poetry. That’s beautiful. I love D. Rose.
"I mean, I personally can’t find many ways to hate Klay even if you hated the Warriors during their dynasty run. I remember most of the sub agreeing to Bob Myers (Warriors GM) when he said Derrick Rose and Klay Thompson are ‘universally beloved’.  Correct me if I’m wrong tho."
"I dunno man. It’s hit and miss in both eras. Plus that’s really just recency bias. I go down the list and know most of them cause I watched basketball then.  3s in 2000s - Harden, Horford, Derron Williams, Ben Gordon, Melo, Pau Gasol  There were a lot of misses at # 2 tho. Gotta give you that. Besides Durant it’s a lot of nothing. Same up until 2015 really. That 2 pick is fucking rough.  And some of the 1 picks flamed out. Kwame Brown, Greg Oden, Bargnani.   But the good 1 picks you still had Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Yao Ming, Lebron and Kenyon Martin wasn’t bad.   A few of the ones we think are good now from the late 2010s will inevitably get injured in the next 3-4 years and flame out too. Happens to a lot of players. Then we’ll have the same “who was that guy” posts in 2030 because they only had 3-5 decent seasons."

"13 years ago, you were No.1 pick.   12 years ago, you were rookie of the year.   10 years ago, you were the youngest MVP.   You were windy city assassin, son of Chicago.    9 years ago, the injuries, the suffering, the pain, the sorrow.   You were the brightest star who has fallen too soon.   We never left, we were there.   Because I know, one day, “the Rose” will bloom once again.   New York, Cleveland, Minnesota.   We were there, waiting for the day,   One day...   Tonight, is the night.   the sweat, the tear, the thrill, the roar.   No more brutal dunks, no more flashy crossovers.   Instead, you have steel-forged faith, and ever-unyielding soul.   You are the fiercest wolf, preying on victory.   You shouted out what you have been through all these years.   You have once again awakened, like a phoenix nirvana.   This is a glimpse of your prime promised by god, but never had a chance to shine.   This is the night will be carved into history forever.   This is the proof that Derrick Rose has always been a fighter.   This is the moment, we both cried, perhaps too god damn hard.   Dream back to New York City, dream back to MVP.   Thank you, Derrick Rose.   Thank you all along the way, and we will always be there for you."
"God said rise, so Derrick Rose."
Did you see the Derrick rose quote. Lol there's your source pal.
"It will be hard to top Zion, but I kind of agree. I don’t think Zion could’ve done what he did tonight or in the playin game against Warriors.. The basketball gods giving us another Derrick Rose, let’s just al pray he stays healthy. Already one of the best career mixtapes out there and he’s just getting started....."
Also here’s some context:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/antoine-griezmann-derrick-rose-fan-history-knicks-wolves-tweets-interview-world-cup-france
Derrick rose. Obi toppin. Spencer dinwiddie
He loves Derrick Rose
"Ja is one of only ten active players to ever attempt at least 20 free throws in a playoff game. He’s tied Harden’s and Melo’s playoff highs and is 4 behind Lebron’s career high, 3 behind Jimmy’s, 2 behind Giannis’ and Dwight Howard’s and 1 behind AD and Derrick Rose.   I didn’t watch the game so it might have been him attacking the basket just that much but it was a crazy number to see especially since they didn’t seem to be end of game type fouls."
Bulls Fans🤝Knicks Fans  Loving Derrick Rose
it’s obviously hurting him. he was hobbling after the half. i know what my flair says but i really do not want derrick rose injured anymore. thibs plays him way too much.
"Between this, Randles kid, and Derrick Rose tearing up during postgame interviews, this Knicks teams the SOAT (Sweetest Of All Time)"
PGs who have shown that kind of explosive ability:  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Ja Morant  Who am I missing?
After reading the title I questioned why anyone would make this post. But then as soon as I saw Derrick rose was on the list I knew why this post was made and I knew it was a Knicks fan
Ok so why is Derrick Rose dancing
Reminds me of Derrick Rose with that smooth floater in the lane and also the ability to spring up and yak on people.

"https://fansided.com/2021/05/21/derrick-rose-vintage-social-media-post/   I just googled derrick rose chess fanatic and clicked and gave you the first one.   it has all the info neccessary tho.   “I love chess so I would put it this way… I lost my Queen early in the game but I fought my f—– way back to get one of my pawns down the board to get her back. If you know chess… that’s a very hard process to achieve and if you really know how to play you know even the master games are won with few pieces on the board and it’s about strategy, heart and skill.”"

That's youngest ever MVP Derrick Rose to you
"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
"Derrick Rose is a legend. First ballot he better be. I know he’s old now but I saw him at staples when he was on the mvp campaign with the Bulls, holy shit I’ve never seen a quicker human being.   Great game Knicks! Keep it rollin"

Less MVP votes than derrick rose
Lord no lol. If that were the case we’d have a KZ Okpala vote instead of a Derrick Rose vote.
"If you think there's not a possibility of his fans going so crazy that they managed to genuinely vote him in as a show of love, you don't know Derrick Rose fans, haha.  My point is that unanymous is a very context dependant award. It may speak as much of the field as it speaks of the player getting the award. They give 100 votes so that the award actually outweights dumb votes. Fans having one doesn't harm it, it actually encapsulates apart of nba history worth revisiting (like Derrick's rebirth and his ""comitted"" fanbase).  If we as fans are so mad about it we just can take it as the fan award and consider MVP a 99 votes award"
"By that logic we  can start looking at other teams though. Julius Randall on the Knicks, Trae Young on the Hawks, Luka on the Mavs. All of these teams win half as many games without just the one piece. If anything Derrick Rose probably deserves MVP cause without him the Knicks were on their way to another early vacation at the end of the season.  The issue is that MVP is the wrong name for the award. It needs to be changed to something like Player of the Year or something."
Would Steph’s MVP be less meaningful had that happened? No. He’d still be an MVP.   I understand the fan voting system is flawed. But the league is for entertainment. Fans find the ability to vote entertaining. Who cares if Derrick Rose gets a vote? That doesn’t diminish the MVP in the slightest. It’s still an MVP.
"not rly, derrick rose was fucking insane in 2011, very well deserved MVP in my opinion."
"Dude you can’t rank players basing on their primes, if so I could say Derrick Rose still is a superstar. I’m talking about their status right now. PG in OKC and in LA hasn’t been anywhere even near superstardom. He’s never been to the conference finals and he was never even the first offensive option, he had Russ and Leonard."
"Are there more fans or media?  Fans if course.  And if the fans voted Rose but the media is telling us that Jokic won MVP because be got more votes, then the only obvious conclusion is....  The media is helping Jokic steal the MVP.   This is obviously a conspiracy somehow involving pedofiles and the military will come in and restore Derrick Rose's rightful place as MVP before inauguration day..  STOP THE STEAL!"
"I'm fine with it if it's legit, I guess. But obviously some troll had bots voting a billion times for Derrick Rose, and the league didn't throw them out. That's idiotic."
I'll always be a Derrick Rose fan but this is stupid.
Wild to me that because of Twitter Derrick Rose got more points than the best player on the team with the best record
Demarcus Cousins is just as big as a “What If” player as Derrick Rose. Idc
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the mind of your average r/nba fan. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rose's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his game, to realize that its not just basketball - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Derrick Rose are truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Roses existencial catchphrase ""We men. You can assume"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Derrick Roses genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Derrick Rose tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

Lmaooo Derrick Rose got a first place MVP vote
Derrick rose has hella fans in China
I’m a huge Knicks fan with a Derrick Rose jersey lmao. It just makes absolutely no sense
So there's just a secret pocket of Derrick Rose fans that knew about this and no one else?
Someone voted Derrick Rose first…. That’s not even justifiable that writer should lose their vote lol
Somebody gave Derrick Rose a first place mvp vote. Which is the same number of votes Embiid got.
Derrick Rose got as many first place votes as embiid. That's so fucked up
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE!
How is the fan part voted on?  They can’t publicize it very much if most people didn’t know it existed and Derrick rose won it
Derrick Rose and inflated mvp vote count. Name a more iconic duo
 Derrick Rose got a first place vote and no other votes. Guesses for the voter for that?
Okay who gave Derrick Rose a vote...
"Flair makes sense, because the only way Rose should win the fan vote for MVP is if only New York fans know about it.   Like, I am legit happy for Derrick Rose -- but the fact that both Rose and Randle placed higher in MVP voting than Rudy Gobert or James Harden or Kawhi says... something."
"Probably gave Barkley an MVP vote and had to cover for him.  ""With the number 1 pick in the All Time Player Draft....Charles Barkley selects ~~Allen Iverson~~ Derrick Rose."""
DERRICK  ROSE?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I absolutely do not mind.
Lmao Derrick Rose got 1
Derrick Rose wasn't even the MVP of his own team. Why vote for Rose instead of Randle if you're going to be a homer?
Derrick Rose wasn't even the MVP of his own team. Why vote for Rose instead of Randle if you're going to be a homer?

"Whoever voted Derrick Rose first place should absolutely be stripped of their voting privileges - and that’s exactly what it is, a privilege to be able to vote for these awards, some media members need to be reminded of that"
The Derrick Rose vote was just fans being dumb apparently  I want to know how two voters thought Chris Paul was the MVP lmao
"Whoever voted for Derrick rose needs to be banned from voting, fucking idiot"
Who the fuck voted for Derrick Rose?
Derrick Rose had more first-place votes than he Nets big3 COMBINED.
Who voted for Derrick Rose?
It's really offensive that Embiid gets less first place votes than Curry and CP3 and same as Giannis and DERRICK ROSE  It really is Philly vs Everybody and you think we exaggerate lol
I had to look it up. Holy shit.  Joel Embiid and Derrick Rose are tied for 1st place votes this year (1).
Nice Derrick Rose 1st place vote. Shame that journalist
DERRICK ROSE GOT A 1ST PLACE VOTE????
Who the fuck gave Derrick Rose a first place vote lmao
derrick rose got a 1st place vote for mvp??!???
https://twitter.com/BlakeMurphyODC/status/1402410652812120068?s=20  Full results. Someone gave Derrick Rose a first place vote.
Bruh Derrick Rose got a 1st place vote
"I mean, it wasn't that long ago that Derrick Rose straight up admitted to not knowing what consent meant and assuming he had it when he likely didn't, and he's still always brought up as one of the top players ""everybody loves"""
Yeah.... we'd take Derrick Rose over Randle.
&gt; Ben Gordon  The Bulls have cornered the market in unsuccessful franchise players since the MJ era:  Elton Brand  Tyson Chandler  Eddy Curry  Derrick Rose (no fault of his own)  Jimmy Butler  Zach LaVine
"&gt;he’s worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
"I mean we turned DSJ into derrick rose, I'd rather have the 22nd overall pick and cap space than kristaps porzingis.     Julius is on a one year team option next year for 20 million dollars, if the mavericks could trade KP for julius they would do it immediately without question.   Nah we aren't gonna help fix your mistakes though   you seem pretty fixated on that word 'incompetent', is that what happens when your team chokes so hard?  every single comment includes the word incompetence with you.   it's all you can think about"
Damian Lillard  Carmelo Anthony  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook   James Harden  Mike Conley  J.J. Redick  Derrick Rose  Paul George  Lou Williams   Paul Milsap  Demarcus Cousins
"Don't be dramatic, why the hell would Knicks GM get it? If anything it's Nets GM for bringing in Harden and signing Blake. And getting CP3 was way more impactful for the Suns franchise than bringing in.. Derrick Rose. Hawks have a shot too with how they played with all their roster and personnel moves."
"Lebron showed last year in the Bubble that he can still turn it on and dominate on defense. I don't think 22 year old Luka even giving his best effort can ever dominate a game on defense. Lebron was a legit DPOY candidate in his prime, that is a game changing defender. Go watch how he defended Derrick Rose down the stretch in a lot of the ECFs games in 2011. And that was Derrick Rose who was one of the quickest and most explosive guards to ever play the game. Lebron was a freak on defense in his prime."
Only thing stopping the Nets is health.   I just hope they can pick up Derrick Rose and get him one as well
"reminder that the knicks shipped out porzingis for dennis smith, who then turned into derrick rose, not even mentioning the cap space to sign randle, morris, ~~payton.~~  knicks won the trade"
"&gt;I can't think of a player this young since LeBron James who deserves this kind of payout  Derrick Rose was MVP in his third season, no ?"
"Ahh yes, downvotes in a thread about someone within one of the 3 largest franchises winning an award... a historically accurate way of judging general opinion.  Derrick Rose was on substantially worse teams than CP3 has been on. He was y’all’s best player in the first round, CP3 was horrible for us (because of injury). One of those two teams won. We clearly showed in our first round appearance that we were not a 17-20 team without CP3, but y’all literally were without DRose.   Precedent sets the rules, and when precedent isn’t followed, normally there are contextual reasons to why. Those contextual reasons are clearly the fact that Thibs did this for the Knicks, while a significant amount of the credit was given to CP3 and not Monty for our success. The first round showed that CP3 narrative was inaccurate, that he was important but not overwhelmingly the reason.   I’m not even in the minority of first place votes, nor in the minority of coaches opinions. Glad downvotes for a take against the Knicks in a pro-Knicks thread is enough to confirm your opinion though."
"Lol yeah you’ve made it very clear that you think they made the wrong decision. But I think the fact that many of your comments in this thread have been downvoted a lot suggests that a lot of other people disagree - and not just Knicks fans.   Derrick Rose has been on losing teams. He’s not like CP3 who has always made every team he goes to improve significantly. One could argue that the *synergy* of Rose and Thibs was the reason for their success.  This isn’t a legal case. Precedent doesn’t determine who wins. It’s a year-by-year kind of thing. Clearly, given the decision to award him COTY, and given how many of your comments got downvoted, I think it’s fair to say that you’re in the minority thinking this was a bad choice."
"People expected us to be a play-in team. That’s after adding CP3. Y’all were 17-20 without Derrick Rose and were 24-11 with him, that’s as big of an impact as CP3’s. Y’all can pretend people expected the Suns to be contenders, but that’s just simply not true.  Going off the precedent set by the last 20 years of coty, Monty was robbed. You can argue against that precedent, but it’s also clear that Thibs was an abnormal winner being the worst win% since 2000. And he won it over a coach that wins it more years than not over the last 10 years. Those two things combined makes it a clearly wrong decision, imo. Coaches voting agrees with me, as well as first place votes for this award."
"Statistically, Derrick Rose. But when you look at the requirements and standards needed for MVP, he definitely deserved his MVP, it just wasnt a “He’s guaranteed” pick like Jokic or Curry in 2016"
probably derrick Rose
"Your 2014-15 team added Lebron and Love, Knicks added Derrick Rose..."
"to counter your point though on starting PG, Derrick Rose was basically our true PG (coming in at the 3-4 min of the 1st quarter and basically playing the rest of game alternating with IQ) but because of technicality of who is in the starting lineup, D Rose is categorized as a 6th Man"
"Suns were better than the Knicks last year by 13 wins and they got Chris Paul, Knicks biggest addition was Derrick Rose (and we lost Mitch Robinson to injury/Marcus Morris to trade from last year)   I get the argument for Monty but for me it's Thibs"
"KP needs to accept he's not the player he once was.  Injuries happen, it sucks.  Learn from Derrick Rose - adjust your game. Learn what you can and can't do. Find a way to be a positive impact on your team."
You mean the same DSJ we flipped to the Pistons for Derrick Rose ? Him getting DNPs AFTER this trade doesnt strengthen your case but hey dont let that stop you lol. Not having to max this bum and getting 2 FRPs on top is a complete win.
"Reminds me of Derrick Rose who hadn't had a truly healthy off season since his first knee injury.   When he finally did, I think it was during his time on the Wolves, he played really well and was a great piece to that team.  And he has been healthy for a few off seasons now and looks great!"
"1. Lebron it I’m speaking honestly, but if you ask me I’ll say Kobe  2. Lebron as far being an all around player, Kobe as far having the takeover mentality, and Steph because he shoots from everywhere   3. Newer fans may not have realized how good John Wall was, he was always the faster player on the court and was a top PG before 3 point shooting became as important as it is today.  With that being said, Derrick Rose was faster and more athletic and was leading a top team in the league as the youngest MVP ever, and one random jump stop took that all away.  The fact that after all the surgeries he’s still in the league and was arguably the Knicks best player in the playoffs speaks to how great his talent was despite his injury history and him losing the explosiveness that made him so hard to guard  4. 1 and 2 the next five to seven are Luka and Giannis  5. Luka and Emoni Bates.  I think he’s gonna take the league by storm"
Let's not overreact here. Luka had to go up against Kawhi and PG. Trae went against a bum in Randle and Derrick Rose. Lol one is harder than the other
"This sounds like too much but blow up the whole roster except a few players, like absolutely flip it because we seen what happened with LeBron in cleveland, they cant do slow moves with players that score less points than Air Bud cough\* KP cough\*   1. I think Lonzo actually would be a good fit here  2. trade KP  3. Derrick Rose would be a great 6th man and mentor to Luka 4. Andre Drummond if he leaves the Lakers and get him cheap, otherwise he is not worth it 5. Any center, please."
"I think the backup Point Guard role is something far more replaceable for our team. Rick Carlisle has generally been the 6'1 guard whisperer throughout his time here. Meanwhile, DFS is our only wing and Dwight Powell is by far the most hustle on our team and is the only smart rim rolling center we have.   I also feel like Brunson's value is high in a way where it could be very beneficial to include him in a trade. One possibility would be to move Brunson in a trade and then maybe be able to sign Derrick Rose (I feel like he's in the stage of his career where he isnt looking to just chase the bag but find a good fit on a competitive team)"
"Yes it was Dennis smith, who got us Derrick rose this year. It’s a wash for both teams at this point. We ended up benefitting in the long run, the mavs are still a solid team despite the trade/contract."
"&gt; Hey Mavs welcome to the ""our entire team outside of our superstar shat the bed in an elimination game"" club  Knicks in this club with Derrick Rose?"
Me too.  My favorite DSJ moment was when the Knicks traded him for Derrick Rose.
Yeah but it's not a steal which is what the original poster was saying. Knicks also ended up getting Derrick Rose out of it who has been a valuable mentor to their younger guys.
trade KP back to Knicks for Derrick Rose lol
"and that's exactly why I think derrick rose should be a no brainer hall of famer, I dont care about no accolades or stats, when discussing the hall of fame I care about his impact in the basketball world  and its much easier to have this vision when you're outside of the US, that's when you can clearly see who has the biggest impact in basketball culture and fame"
"Kevin Love will get in and Blake will definitely get in he was the ROY and an allstar in his first year. Not sure if he will win a ring this year, but he can still make the HOF without it. Love was a perennial Allstar and won a title was a great stretch four big and rebounder. Derrick Rose will probably went make the HOF with 1 MVP, ROY, and Sixth man awards and storyline."
Derrick Rose reunites with Chicago
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
"Griffin ""NYK's Derrick Rose"" Griffin"
Derrick Rose would have a cult of ligament donors and he’d go down as a Top 5 PG all-time.
Derrick Rose
"On another note, Kareem's fellow MVP winners were the likes of Cowens, Walton, and McAdoo. This was incredibly easy competition for MVPs and not at all comparable to future MVP competition like Magic, Bird, Moses, Jordan, Isiah, Kevin Johnson, Hakeem, Karl Malone, Barkley, Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, LeBron, Nash, Wade, Durant, Curry, and many more.  Bob McAdoo in 1975 was the only pre-1996 MVP to not make the 50 Greatest List. Since 1996, Derrick Rose is likely the only other MVP who would not make the 50 Greatest.   In 1976, Kareem became the only MVP to miss the playoffs. When the best player in the league can't make the playoffs - tells a lot about the league's quality. Likewise, when the best player of that decade in Kareem missed the playoffs twice in his prime something no other consensus top 10 player has done, that further confirms the weakness of the league's quality"
"Id like to see the stats of the Bulls without Jordan or Derrick Rose, Rose isnt Jordan by any means but Rose carried that team to playoff runs and havent really had any runs since"
"Exactly.  Same as Magic, Michael and Kobe.   Lesser stars like Pau Gasol and one of my favorites Kyle Lowry. Derrick Rose for a hot minute. Many others.   You respect the guys who show up in that place and deliver. That’s what makes it fun.   For me Lebron is at the top of the list of guys I saw bring it in Boston."
Tbf the jazz also had Derrick Rose for a hot minute. It was literally about one minute
"That's a half empty perspective. If Derrick Rose stayed healthy, the Bulls would be one of the best franchises in the NBA."
Do not forget when Derrick Rose was there. They were pretty good franchises during that time. Not the best but up there yes
"Please.. Trae has played in 5 playoff games and beat a Knicks team that struggled to score 100 points a game. Trae wasn’t the one locking up Julius Randle and forcing him to shoot below 30%. Luka is averaging 34/8/10 against the Clippers and is possibly also heading to the second round.   They’re both playing great in the playoffs, but it’s a small sample size thus far and Luka blows him out of the water in their first three regular seasons.  5 games of Trae doesn’t automatically jump him up to Luka’s level just because Luka had 1 bad game this series.  Trae is going to go from being guarded by Derrick Rose to being guarded by Ben Simmons this next series."
Derrick Rose on Prime Dwight.
I would pay money to see him as a GM and to see him construct a team. I think he’d probably give Lou Williams a 4 year / 85 Million contract and would try to max out Derrick Rose
"Sorry, I just searched “Derrick Rose innocent” and the first result said the not guilty thing. I guess the correct wording is “not liable”?"
"The Derrick Rose case is one of those where defenders like to say ""actually if you read the details of the case, you'd know he's innocent"" and then you read the details of the case and it looks *extremely bad.* I know people hate it being brought up here but the Kobe case is that way too."
"Same exact issue with the Bulls, our owner Reinsdorf has his guys and doesn’t care about the results. Had Garpax for nearly 20 years with no success outside of the Derrick Rose blip in the middle, which they lucked into   He also owns the white Sox and does the same things, hired Tony La Russa to be manager for our stacked roster when everyone else in the org was against it. Would be like if the Pelicans or Mavs hired Larry Brown right now   Billionaires bro, they have one big break and think they know better than everyone else in every situation for the rest of eternity. In Reinsdorf’s case, his big break was buying the team the year they drafted Michael Jordan and coasting off that"
"https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/7962/heats-defense-zeroing-in-on-derrick-rose  Here is a link from when the series was going on. They barely mention LeBron and talk way more about the team philosophy  against Rose. Here are a few highlights   ""When Rose got into the lane there were two Heat defenders already waiting""  ""Rose can beat double-teams, but triple-teams in his scoring zone are proving quite hard. Then there are those quadruple-teams, which the Heat are pulling off regularly as well""  ""The Heat are getting away with this because they clearly do not fear any of the other Bulls’ offensive options""  Again it was far far more about Heat team defense than LeBron. When LeBron didn't have the help of every teammate on his team against Terry he was exposed.   Man you kids should actually try watching games"
"Derrick rose, Jason Kidd, chancy billups, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone, Marv Albert. All have raped someone. We give them a pass. It’s gross."
"Derrick Rose literally admitted to not knowing what consent means, admitted to having sex with her while she was intoxicated, and that he went to her place to have sex knowing that she didn’t want to   The girl is a Roomate and coworker- I can think of so so many reasons why she would have something against the Jane Doe.

So what about the rings hakeem won with the rockets? He didnt get to face the chicago bulls because Michael took a hiatus on his own. Is that a fake chip then? How about when Derrick Rose got injured in 2012? Shouldn’t the Heat have question mark on their title run because they werent able to face the number one seed bulls and MVP at that time?
''Yes. I'll even bet Trae wins MVP before Luka for all you Luka apologists out there.''  this is you op in a thread about derrick rose and trae lol
"She just wanted money, there’s plenty of real sexual assault stories out there but the derrick rose one is ridiculous"
Derrick Rose was too
Derrick Rose 2012. Man i miss old d-rose
"Derrick Rose. If people are saying Russell Westbrook is a Top 10 PG of all time, then a prime Derrick Rose would surpass him in my opinion.  Also Len Bias, I’ve never seen him play lol"
"&gt; “We had a lot of fun in Las Vegas. During the trip to Vegas, the plaintiff told me that she had not heard from Derrick Rose for a while, and she had recently had sex with Derrick and two of his friends — Randall and Allen. She told me she had sex with all three of them, and that she was upset that Derrick was okay with it. At no time did she ever state or claim that Derrick Rose (or his friends) had raped her or done anything non-consensual. Just the opposite: she informed me in her own words that she had partied with them and been with all of them, but all indications were that it was consensual.”  &gt;“I bluntly asked her is she was raped. She said “no” but that she did sleep with all three men. A month or so later, she told me she was going to sue and that she expected an out of court settlement.”    This is literally straight from a close friend of the woman who accused Drose. **They also found texts corroborating this story.**"

Derrick Rose was an MVP. Do you think Trae is MVP level right now?
Do you want Derrick Rose off the Knicks and out of the league?
"You’re right. Hey, how’s ‘we men’ Derrick Rose been for ya? Organizing some big apple gang rapes?"
"Dude I swear I used to hate that shit lol. Imo he was a obviously great point guard but to me he was never the best one. He wasn’t better then CP3, Prime Deron Williams, Derrick Rose or Westbrook. He was a great fit with the Spurs though."
"""Why the hell would anybody take Derrick Rose no 1 when you could have Michael Beasley instead"""
[Didnt know about DRose](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation). Very upsetting.
And Derrick Rose. It's uncomfortable the amount of praise and love he gets.
No because you can't make the case that he had a dominant season like Rose did.  Trae also uses a lot of trickery that Derrick didn't have to do
"Probably the ultimate example is Derrick Rose. Multiple ankles and knee issues and then BAM a torn ACL that caused a spiral for his career that was so promising after he became the youngest MVP in league history. Sure, his career came back on track in recent years, but he, along with guys like Penny, Grant Hill, and others, became another “what if” story."
"I mean the question is about Derrick Rose though, who also did not carry like 18 Bron. That bulls team was stacked."
"In hindsight, my answer is closer to “No, but Trae’s well on his way to getting there.”  It’s Year 3 and he has a ton of time to expand on his legacy in the future.     Derrick Rose was a legitimate Superstar whose career was derailed by injuries.  There will always be a powerful “What If” appeal to his legacy because he was on the rise when The Big 3 Heat were viewed as the villains of the League.  “If DRose never got hurt, he would’ve given LeBron and DWade fits!  He had them crying in the locker room!  Nobody could stop that dude!”  With the way people talk about him, you’d think that Rose was playing 1 v 5.  I’d need a second or third run from Trae to really make it clear that he’s not to be messed with.  Hell, let the Hawks beat KD’s Nets next year and we’ll be having this same discussion again."
"No.  Trae will have his own legacy.  But Trae hasn't won ROTY and MVP, had 14 consecutive knee injuries, then come back almost a decade later to score a career high 50 points and finish the game with a game winning block for the Minneatota Timberwolves in a game then brought literally every basketball fan on earth to tears in his post game interview when asked ""A huge victory for this team, and it comes from you, and your career high fifty points, what does it mean to you derrick?"" And his response is ""man, everything man, I work my ass off bro...""  Ain't nobody go through what Derrick went through, and try so hard to come back, and for what? To play for the worst team in the league for the minimum? To then sign with the pistons? Then get traded to a contender, to lead a team into the playoffs, after what? years of being told it's over? Man's literally completely reinvented his game, for that.   Fans should be happy to have had the privilege of watching Rose play.  [you tell me this isn't a legacy](https://youtu.be/6BgJKC1vAV4)"
Trae is already better the Derrick Rose ever was tbh.
"Am I underestimating Derrick Rose's legacy? I know he was great his first few seasons, but my view of his legacy is more about unrealized potential and ""what-ifs"" than about greatness. Rose only had 3.5 seasons under his belt before the injury and after that he was never the same.  Young willing his team to a championship, especially a team which wasn't even really in the conversation at the beginning of the season, would be a historic feat that easily surpasses a single MVP-season."
"Absolutely.   Whenever we talk about Derrick Rose, there’s this “what if” factor driving the conversation. It’s never rooted in reality. Because the harsh reality is, he had 3 great seasons and that’s it because of his injuries. That’s not much of a legacy. It’s entirely bolstered by the MVP award which 1) when somebody does eventually beat the age record it’ll lessen that impact and 2) there was discourse even then if he should have won it.   If Trae Young wins a ring, his legacy is already better than Derrick Rose because the legacy he has is not the legacy people WANT him to have."
"you even just made my point. its Atlanta’s first championship vs Rose’s MVP. Trae Young is impressive, i love him, but hes not derrick rose yet"
"I…think so.  Derrick Rose was a monster before his injuries hit, but a lot of his legacy is tied to his cultural impact.  The Hometown Hero doing amazing things and playing exciting basketball!  The Youngest MVP ever!  The sky is the limit!  Buy his shoes! Fast Don’t Lie!  That being said, what Trae is doing now is absurd.  Assuming he pulls it all off, he has all of the qualities to explode into the mainstream and enjoy a Derrick Rose-esque media boom after the fact."
IIRC Derrick Rose alluded to it being a massive problem a few years ago but had to backtrack a few days later
"I definitely considered that possibility, but I believe I very clearly remember reading the transcript where Derrick Rose responded ""no"" when asked if he could define consent, and then stuck to it when the lawyer kinda disbelievingly asked again.  I definitely don't remember Rose saying something like pleading the fifth or declining to answer."
"Derrick rose, Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Giannis, Dwight"
"True, but, I mean, I never understood the hype for Ben Simmons, Derrick Rose, or Andrew Wiggins in college. Ingram seemed like the obvious #1 choice, and as a Kansas fan, I saw Wiggins and Embiid play together and knew that Embiid was better, and I just watched Michael Beasley just beat every record that Kevin Durant just set. So, I mean, me vs. consensus #1 isn't exactly a winning record. But it's not necessarily a losing record, either. Projecting the future is hard."
Derrick Rose
I mean look at Derrick Rose…
Lolol u literally said that dirk didn’t win against an injury addled heat or lakers.....they did.  Lololol.     Just cause y’all went all in on an injury prone superstar to try to build a super team around ya don’t have to cope so hard now lolol.    Even willing to say a healthy Kobe wouldn’t have helped to cope for this team lololol.    From 2011:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/678656-2011-nba-playoffs-may-be-determined-by-ankles-of-kobe-bryant-and-derrick-rose  Yup.  Neither ankle held up.    But injuries didn’t play into it lolol.    Injuries are a factor every single year.
"but that's my point. that question doesn't have a definitive answer. it has a desired answer, but if i said ""i... don't know the answer to that"" they would hear it and think ""well he could have said yes, but also what the fuck is that question""  there is no correct answer to what doc was asked, but it's also a stupid question. he can't say yes, because ben has to do work, and doc doesn't know if ben will get to that level. he can't say no, because he believes ben is capable and skilled, but he doesn't know how far that skill goes.  how about if i ask you - is steve nash capable of being the point guard on a championship winning team? is derrick rose?"
"Hey now, they got Derrick Rose a first place mvp vote. Credit where credit is due."
"With Derrick Rose Mr Squidward, with Derrick Rose"
Derrick rose?

"Not an in game rule, same as Bird rights or Derrick Rose rule"
"rondo i can see, as he helped the Celtics in 08, and in 20 with the lakers, PG, maybe, it depends if he can shake off last year, and derrick rose I do agree with you."
Derrick Rose would like a word...
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
Bruh derrick rose was a vet min guy before he started caring (again?) and he was totally bagged for not trying.  At least he had an injury to scapegoat it with
Derrick Rose. Without question.   5th in MVP voting and made 7 million this season.  You dont do better than that.
"Tell that to Kobe, Isaiah Thomas or Derrick rose right?"
We need some Derrick Rose Draft Lottery Energy right now
I'm still salty about that year that Lillard was the final cut from the roster because Thibs wanted extra court time for Derrick Rose working his way into game shape after an injury before the season started.
"Similarly, [this call](https://youtu.be/2W6oYPJ1nIk) by the Pels announcers when D-Rose hit a game winner against them is so memorable to me bc of the hope draining out from their voices lol.  “Derrick Rose against Jrue Holiday. Aaand he’s got the little midrange. That’s it. It’s over.”"
Recency Bias at its best  Randle averaged 24/10/6 and won MIP  RJ Barrett took big strides and averaged 18  Derrick Rose looked great for them   Thibs won Coach of the Year
I agree with much of what you’ve said but some of it is a bit off. Derrick Rose was obviously the best prospect on his Memphis squad but Chris Douglas Roberts balled out that tournament. He averaged like 25 ppg so Rose hardly carried them.   Kyries team won 30 games but he only played 11 of them. Those Kentucky teams were stacked as well.
"Bismack Biyombo with the hands of literally any other NBA player.  LaMelo Ball with Ben Simmons defense.  Also, non Hornets player: Derrick Rose with prime Derrick Rose athleticism"
"I don't doubt he was good but saying he was top 3 is certainly debatable.   Definitely behind Deron and CP3. From 2008-2010 I might take Steve Nash or Chauncey Billups over him, and 2010-2012 I definitely take Derrick Rose over him."
"I'm not sure why people thought we'd expose trae. We literally have no one to do it. Knicks really didnt either. I mean Derrick rose had quite a season so theres that, but hes not a star anymore.       Will be interesting to see how jrue does this series offensively. If he is aggressive, he should be able to go to town. But he really just hasnt been.      Hawks might not have to worry about trees defense til  a potential finals matchup against Phoenix...in which case it's become a gigantic problem against those guards"
And he probably would have lost it if Derrick Rose were not injured.
"&gt; Team USA needs more than one MVP to win  Derrick Rose, come on down"
Even Derrick Rose averaged 20 PPG on 47% FG and 47% 3PT in the Knicks first round series against Atlanta.   You'll notice a pattern that opposing PGs almost always go off against Atlanta. It's not a coincidence.
"hear me out -  ben simmons strength? defending. the knicks coach? 2008 championship winning boston celtics' defensive coach tom thibodeau!  are there other misfits who have gone to the knicks and/or thibodeau and magically become skillful? yes! julius randle and derrick rose have both improved since returning to the embrace of thibodeau.  i thought it was dumb at first too, but maybe simmons to the knicks works. and if it doesn't, we still get to lolknicks"
The change was Derrick Rose. Rose deserves more credit for the turnaround than Thibs. Without the Rose trade you wouldn't have made the playoffs or even been close.
Derrick Rose would’ve reverse dunk that
"The big knock on Trae Young is that he's an abysmal defender and in the playoffs teams will be able to gameplan and hunt him.   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, he's gotten lucky, going against the Knicks, who don't really have a great point guard to go at Trae with, and the 76ers have...Ben Simmons. That being said, Derrick Rose and Seth Curry each both had really great series against the Hawks.   The Bucks are going to go at Trae hard with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, and I think the Hawks, especially without DeAndre Hunter, are going to have a really hard time defending the Bucks in this series.   tldr -- Trae's biggest weakness, his defense, hasn't really gotten exposed yet this playoffs, but probably will against the Bucks."
"shit is pristine bro. after all the shit they got into stemming from Jokic-Embiid MVP race, having Embiid get as many first place votes as Derrick Rose and then choke again (yes Simmons was a bigger problem, Joel also fucked up a lot) could not be sweeter. And exactly in the way we said it would happen all year"
"Our best player was Derrick Rose at 32 years old, what the hell is your excuse lol?  That 26 point lead will haunt you for years."
That's derrick rose
"Yeah by contrast, we have Derrick Rose who got derailed by injuries because his landing sucks."
"That’s the thing about Westbrook though. Yeah, Westbrook was developed as a 1 guard due to his slightly shorter stature, maybe, but you look at the man, dude’s a unit. Russell Westbrook is a fucking tank at 6’3” 200Lbs.   Westbrook isn’t built like a Derrick Rose or a Ja Morant, not even a John Wall. Westbrook is more so built like a wing that’s missing a few inches."
Derrick rose straight up cheated on his SATs and was a shit student.   Nobody gave a fuck and he was taken 1st overall and is one of the hardest working players in the NBA.   It has 0 correlation lol  North Carolina straight up had their players in no show classes for decades under multiple coaches and the University got in zero trouble. The NCAA even gives 0 fucks about these guys going to class
Lonzo is probably the worst archetype of PG we need on the roster. We had a ton of success in the second half of the season because Derrick Rose was able to drive and get into the paint. We don't play at a ridiculous fast pace either. Lonzo is more of a 3&amp; D player than a shot creator in the half court.
"Funny thing is a lot of guys from that shit squad have had career resurgences since then. Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, even Larry Nance are all at least above average rotation players now"
Y’all needed a tried and true superstar in Derrick rose. During the season he won’t give you the minutes and even consistent points these lower level all stars give you but in the playoffs that man has true superstar mentality which the bucks needs.
Im sorry I really cant answer this question if you have prime Zach Lavine starting in front of prime Derrick Rose haha
That's a funny way to spell Derrick Rose
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-york-knicks/derrick-rose-6095/cash-earnings/  Nope.
All time rankings for a player in their third year is pure guesswork since the league is so volatile sometimes. Luka could very well have the career of someone like Lebron or he might be the next Derrick Rose. All we know is that his potential like many other great players before him is possible to crack the top 10.
Is that Derrick rose in the article?
Derrick Rose and #thereturn  I remember watching those Adidas videos in full groupie mode only to be left waiting for him after doctors cleared him
"&gt; ACL's aren't a career changer for athletes anymore, especially young ones.  Since when?  Because Bdiddy isn't that old, and we have no idea who Danilo could have been without his injury but likely would have had a substantially better career than he has.  Derrick Rose?  Did he ever look the same after?  Roy?  Yao?"
derrick rose win his second mvp after 13 years

At least on steroids we have Derrick Rose saying that PED use was rampant in the NBA.
Took an injured team to 62 wins Derrick Rose ?
Derrick Rose???
DAE Derrick rose is the most likable and humble player in the NBA?
"Agreed. He can say things that make you scratch your head, but TBH we all have. He didn't go to a high powered school at any level, was never taught how manage his image, etc. That's not an excuse, but the dude never said anything offensive as far as I know, just comes off as egotistical at times. I can forgive that. Part of being a better person is saying or thinking something, realizing how you were wrong, and using that to learn. It's a part of life.   As a Pacers fan I've never had hard feelings against him for leaving. It sucked because I knew how good he would be the first Summer League game he played (with Lance Stephenson, btw, who looked like fucking magic johnson in SL). It was so dope watching him go from DNP, to defending MVP Derrick Rose as best you could in the playoffs, to dunking Birdman into the shadow realm and high fiving LeBron in the ECFs. But those teams around him at the time were not going to get it done.   People love to meme about PG being a choker in the playoffs, and he deserves it at some level, but with the Pacers he was money when playoff time came around."
"Derrick Rose finished what, 7th in MVP voting?  Beyond the winner ignore it."
I’m having Derrick Rose flashbacks. Enjoy him while he’s hopefully healthy for a long career.   *cries in my Italian beef*
"In a pretty random order and from the top of my head I’d say:  Derrick Rose   Luka  Brad Beal  Kelly Oubre  Gordon Hayward  Kevin Love  Steven Adams  Zach LaVine  D’lo  Kemba Walker  Russ (despite my flare this isn’t biased I swear, I’m just attracted to that man, his body and overall intensity is 🔥👌🏻)"
He wasn’t saying this when Andrew Bogut missed the finals. Or when He slid past Chicago because Derrick Rose got hurt. The clarity seems to come only when he loses.
"Ok but did you make the same uproar when Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Stephen Curry, David Lee etc all got hurt and didn’t get the chance to play? Is it only because your team and your players don’t have a chance to win? The players union agreed to it and they all wanted to play, this is what happens. Half the all stars are already injury prone and have problems before the bubble. This is just another excuse."
"I noticed this when he got lit up by Derrick Rose on the Pistons two years ago, he just couldn't cope with his deceleration. We generally struggle with that guard profile more than most, I feel. From Jamal Murray to Spencer Dinwiddie. I'm not sure it's a new problem for him or it's always been the case. We used to have Avery Bradley then Rozier as the primary on those match ups, maybe it's always been the case."
Derrick Rose
"Scal wouldn’t even have to bully ball you either with his size. All out on the perimeter, 2 or 3 dribbles, open layups/dunks, pull ups, turnarounds, fade always etc… You’d have no answer. You’re too slow and/or have all of the tells for which he has the professional experience to exploit on either end no matter your height/size.   He’s playing chess drawing from high level experience playing with Kevin Garnett and Derrick Rose. You’re learning tiddlywinks for the first time and throwing things at a cup"
Derrick Rose
"So because he was better earlier a decade ago, that means he has the better legacy and is the better player? I think longevity is a weak argument personally. Derrick rose isn't worse than Robert Horry due to longevity. That's an extreme example but my point is that doing less for longer doesn't come off to me as a positive. I definitely think they are both top 15 players of all time.  I appreciate your response, unironically, you added much more specifics and you are making some good points. Your original comment came across to me as discounting championships when I would say the majority of modern era chips have gone through at least one advantageous major injury on the platoff trail"
"The argument people make with Bron winning MVP in 2011 was that he had better stats. But both Rose and Lebron both averaged 25 and 7, the latter just averaged more rebounds and played more efficient.  Rose absolutely deserved his MVP. First, Lebron joined a superteam in 2011, so most people were not going to vote for him. Second, Lebron had won 2 MVPs before and voter fatigue kicked in. And lastly, Lebron didn’t even lead his conference despite having the best team in the league and everyone expecting him to.  Now this is why Derrick Rose won. First, he wildly exceeded expectations that year. No one believed the Bulls would be a Top 5 team in the East, let alone best in the league with a 62-20 record. Second, he beat Lebron’s Heat every game that season, so people saw him as the one to dethrone Lebron. And narratively, D Rose HARD carried his team to Eastern Conference Finals being the only scoring option which is even more impressive.  It is a weak MVP if you compare it, 2016 Curry, 2014 Durant and 2013 Lebron, but it was a great MVP season that showed his superstar potential"
"Because Rose’s individual performance was superstar-level, but his advanced stats don’t line up with every other MVP winner in the last decade and change. If you didn’t watch Derrick Rose and just looked at basketball reference, you’d see that Rose’s BPM that year was only 6.8. Outside of Rose, the lowest BPM an MVP winner has had since LeBron’s first MVP is a two-way tie between 2015 Curry and 2018 Harden at 9.9 (this is very atypical tbh. For the years we have BPM, you normally only had to hang around a BPM of 7.0-8.0 to win MVP).  My own personal opinion is that Rose’s MVP season does get disrespected a bit, but it is a lower-tier MVP. As a straight up basketball player, 2011 Rose is the worst of the bunch. The impressive thing about that season was his age and the hope that he’d get even better. Injuries stopped Rose from further improving after that season."
"He had an impressive season. I think people say that because when you look back in history, people generally don't view Derrick Rose to be an MVP-level player. But if the injuries didn't happen, there's a chance Rose could have been a multi-time MVP winner.   The reason people feel a certain way about it is, for example, if the Jazz won the equivalent of 62 wins this year (Jazz pretty much won 59 games in an 82 game pace this year, similar amount of wins), it would still feel weird giving the MVP to Donavan Mitchell. It does feel odd, I don't think we can deny that."
"No he wasn't. A candidate means you have an actual realistic chance of winning it. Coming 10th while getting 4 third place votes doesn't make you an actual candidate. Saying Brook Lopez was a DPOY candidate last year is like saying Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle and Derrick Rose were MVP candidates this year (all of whom received votes)"
"Can't let you get away here. The locker room was toxic and they did well to cleanse it. But I watched every cavs game that season and those traded players soon fell off quite a bit after some early hype wins against the celtics and the thunder   Clarkson was not the same that he is right now. Hill was solid enough and hood was very inconsistent. Those oladipo pacers were good. Oladipo was a speed demon that season , before he fell into the injury hole and those celtics gave a really tough time to the league all throughout the regular season with their defense bult on Jalen , Jayson , horford, smart and Morris   Fact is LeBron was All time All time that season. He is partly to blame because maybe if he kept the locker room under control , the original Cavs squad with Dwayne wade , derrick rose , jae crowder could have given him better support in the playoffs with their experience"
Derrick Rose.
"To further illustrate your point about the Triangle’s learning curve, Phil Jackson tried installing the Triangle in New York with players less suited to it. He thought the Triangle would elevate Melo into a super-duper-star, but the supporting cast was a carousel of players: Jose Calderon, Samuel Dalembert, Derrick Rose, Robin Lopez, Courtney Lee, Arron Afflalo, Brandon Jennings, the withered husk of Joakim Noah, etc."
Derrick Rose has entered the chat.
Or perhaps it's strange selective narratives. You can't mention Derrick Rose and then just ignore Porzingis like it never happened.
This case was especially peculiar because Derrick Rose was seen taking pictures with the jurors in his case immediately after they ruled in his favor.  [Link for those curious](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/derrick-rose-trial-jurors-snap-pics-knicks-guard-attorney-article-1.2837133)
There was also that thing while Derrick Rose back in like 2018
"No they just again, pick and choose who they wanna dislike. Doin gangbangs already shows you have odd sexual tendencies.. but Kobe and Derrick rose were fun to watch!! So ppl here don’t mind supporting them."
First Team All-“Get This Man A Ring”:  PG - Chris Paul  SG - Derrick Rose  SF - Paul George  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Giannis  Second Team:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - James Harden  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Blake Griffin  C - Lamarcus Aldridge
"this is the hawks peak. they won against the fucking julius randle/derrick rose knicks (lol) and the ben simmons 1 knee embiid 76ers. this hawks team is last years heat, expect no playoffs next year"
Derrick Rose? The MVP?
Derrick Rose was a pretty decent player. I’m pretty sure he even won an MVP award but I’m not really sure.
Derrick rose injured himself while jump stopping to pass the ball.   There’s no evidence at all that it had anything to do with any of his Dunks or layups. These boys are tryna play doctor
"Prime Dwight Howard for bigs, prime LeBron James for wings, prime Derrick rose for guards."
I wouldnt agree with that at all.  Derrick Rose made 7 million and came in 5th in MVP voting.  There is no way Dort is a better value than that.
"2014 one could argue that the Heat had a cakewalk to the Finals, no Derrick rose, and the Pacers were only team capable of giving them a fight - and even they got blown out in game 6. Clippers were one of the best teams on paper - but overshadowed by the Sterling issues.  Ibaka injury early in the conference finals vs the Spurs made it less of a series. LeBron went out injured in game one of the finals - and immediately allowed an 18-2 run - putting them in a hole.  I don't think any of these are fair criticisms, just an example that you can nitpick little things here and there. Biggest one would be the Heat path to the Finals.    There were a ridiculous amount of injuries in 2013. Rose, Garnett and Rondo, the entire Lakers roster, Blake Griffin injury + the CP3 suspension vs the grizzlies, Westbrook torn Meniscus, etc."
Young Derrick Rose
Everyone doubted Derrick Rose when he said the famous quote (he ended up becoming the youngest MVP) https://bleacherreport.com/articles/476999-derrick-rose-mvp-why-not
"Right now it's Lavine and Donovan.  All time would be Jordan, for that unparalleled hangtime. Also Gerald Green and Vince Carter.  Also shout-out to Derrick Rose for amazing double clutch reverse dunks."
"Not the exact comparison I wanted to make. Nor do I think MVP race is a good measure of how good players are as it’s mostly an award based on team success (not always and definitely not as of late).   Dwight Howard was in the top 5 four years in a row and finished 2nd to Derrick Rose in 2011. Neither of them were better than Lebron…nor Embiid talent wise.  Blake Griffin was 3rd in 2014 but doesn’t come close to Yao’s level of skills despite his absence in the top 10 in any year.  I don’t know if The MVP race (not talking about the actual award/winner) is a good measure of skills…….which is my original point — Yao had all the intangibles, although I’d still give Embiid the edge for his dribbling and overall defense. I was simply trying to point out the level of talent but the lack of availability of both players."
Derrick Rose
And I was referencing a Derrick Rose quote…
Derrick Rose got an MVP vote.
"Yea I was watching Derrick Rose AAU games back in highschool and he was getting called for palming voilation like 3 times.  He never gets called for palming in the NBA,"
"Derrick Rose reached his peak, but it wasn’t sustainable.  I don’t think Rose ever becomes a 30+ PPG scorer.  I feel like people really believe this idea."
Derrick Rose is MVP too.
"I think its fine for both. Bill Walton was a basketball god for a short time before feet injuries limited him. MVPs are obviously heavily weighted, nobody with one has not made it. Derrick Rose will test that as he only has 3 all stars to go with it, but it may be enough to carry him.  Ben Wallace just got in and he only had 4 All Stars, but he had 4 DPOY and a ring where he made a mark on the series."
"People have tried to discredit the 2006 Miami Heat ring and all of the rings won by the big 3 in Miami too.  The term always used is ""asterisk."" ""Oh theres an asterisk on this ring because Derrick Rose got injured or cuz the refs were on your side"" etc etc etc"
9th in voting. thats like saying derrick rose (9th in voting this year) was an mvp candidate
It is one of the factors tho. It’s the reason why Stockton is ranked ahead of Derrick Rose
"If Mitch Richmond is in, Derrick Rose should be in. Richmond has three more All Star appearances, but Rose has the MVP and the First Team All NBA nod, whereas Richmond has a handful of second and third team."
"So its okay for people's heroes - athletes - to have a preponderance of evidence, settle out of court to settle civil lawsuit and then have the fans say what they did was okay cause it wasn't criminal.  The moral relativity because they are celebrity is amazing and part of our culture.  Its okay he did shitty things he is an athlete - its all okay he's Derrick Rose, he is Kobe, he is Chauncey, he is Bill Cosby, as along as he is not criminally guilty, people are okay with it.  Stunning."
I’d rather be giannis with no ring vs Derrick rose with no ring
Why would any contender want a diminutive point guard that can’t play defense and is less efficient than Derrick Rose???  He can’t even pass for crying out loud. He belongs in OKC.
Derrick rose probably
I remember thinking that Michael Beasley was going to be a lot better than Derrick Rose.   Damn how things change.
Derrick rose does imo.
"but Paul basically cut out all the explosive aerial plays, he stayed grounded and became MUCH MORE methodical in his attacks  Derrick Rose should've taken notes before he did all that extra damage to himself"
"Knicks haven’t been a destination for players for over 20 years now. Meanwhile their owner has been revealed to be a shit head and there have been countless examples of the franchise being mismanaged and poorly run. They are led by a inflexible, old school coach with a rigid system.  Their best player in the playoffs was a 35 year old Derrick Rose. Yet here we are again. Every year we have to talk about them as if none of these things are true because New York has a large population."
Derrick Rose is on top of my list.
"He's going to be outside of the clippers price range unless he really loves the team and takes considerably less money to stay. lakers can't afford him either unless they dump some salary. someone's going to offer him like 4/80 or something. Honestly think he's a good fit with the knicks. Adds a veteran presence and some shooting from the point guard spot, would be a great pg duo with derrick rose."
Derrick Rose!
derrick rose paid someone to take the SATs for him
2009 Chicago bulls vs Celtics first round series.  Defending champion Celtics Vs the up and coming bulls. Derrick rose coming out party and just a GREAT series to watch. As a die hard bulls fan it was INTENSE.
"I mean he made a ton of money playing ball, and from ESPN, and even if he gets fired and if he still wants to talk basketball he just has to wait until Derrick Rose retires and they unite to form Rose &amp; Rose- Brought to you to by The Ringer Podcast Network."
"As a native Clevelander, it’s LeBron. The Bulls will always have Jordan casting a huge shadow over anyone, Derrick Rose included. He’ll get love because it’s his hometown and what not but LeBron led a 3 game comeback to win a title for a city that hadn’t had one in like 50 plus years."
"Derrick Rose. Where else can you go back home, have a lead on your old team and the fans chant MVP while you're at the ft line"
Uh we all saw it live dude.  No conspiracy lol.  He planted while Ingles bumped him.  Knee buckled like Derrick Rose kinda injury.  That's a definite ACL tear of some kind.
I think Derrick Rose has exceeded expectations like no other.   I can’t really think of a player that aged badly atm.
"i just got out of coma, derrick rose got long hair now huh"
Damn I really thought giannis was gonna be the next Derrick rose after that one maybe worse considering he doesn’t shoot well. Super glad to see he’s alright 😁
"Sit him until next year, I'd rather lose a championship chance than have Giannis to the way of Derrick Rose."
Yeah it’s probably unfair to speculate too hard in either direction without knowing the details behind the case. Kobe’s not with us anymore so there’s nothing more to be done. Plenty of cases of rich/famous people getting off scott free and other cases of rich/famous people getting wrung out in the press for cash.  Like Bill Cosby’s walking free today because a DA threw out prosecution in 2005 thinking the case wasn’t winnable. Derrick rose went to civil court and got exonerated from paying anything out by a jury. Kobe could be either of those things or something in between
Donate them to Derrick rose
"with marv, since he's not even good at his job like derrick rose is, i HAVE TO ASSUME HE just had blackmail material on people in charge of his network."
"derrick rose will probably never be able to be a coach, because if and when he wants to be a coach it will be in the future when the world is even woker"
"Yeah, exactly I find it really odd to see people saying he’s a good ambassador for women because he’s a good father. It’s not like people can be decent to their family and then view other women as below them. I recently saw someone mention the Derrick rose thing as a ‘fake reason to hate on him’ and I was surprised I never heard of it. Both the cases are disturbing at the very least and I find it weird in the era of me too how little people care."
"Yes, the Knicks have been poorly run for a long time. But last season, Fiz started 4-18, was fired, and then the Knicks' G-League coach took over and posted a 17-27 record the rest of the season, with the same roster. If the blame was all on the Knicks and their roster construction, then there's no way Fiz has an 18% winning percentage and his replacement a 39% winning percentage.    Fiz says all the right things about coaching defense when talking to the press. But, like you, I also have no idea what his X's and O's are, because I didn't see any. The Knicks were the 26th-ranked defense in the NBA his one full season in NY. Tom Thibodeau took mostly the same roster from Fiz's last season and made them a top 3 NBA defense -- there was no drastic roster shakeup. The big additions were Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, Derrick Rose, and Immanuel Quickley.  I just think Fiz has some serious work ahead of him to rebuild his reputation."
"I’m sure it won’t be career-ending, but Giannis’ game is so entirely based on athleticism that even a 10% drop off in that would be really impactful. Derrick Rose never got back to the same level after his injuries. I don’t think Paul George has ever gotten back to how athletic he was in Indiana, but unlike Giannis and Rose, George had a really good jumpshot to fall back on and compensate with.   Sorry, it’s just hard to not be thinking of the worst-case scenario right now."
So you have Derrick Rose in your top 50? He's got that MVP so obviously he passes Ray Allen?  High level over a long period &gt; Top of the mountain for a couple years.
im a bit confused why this is getting so much publicity but nobody seems to care about the derrick rose thing that was basically the same
"along the same lines, derrick rose admitted to having group sex with a blackout drunk woman who had earlier said ""no"", and he's one of the most beloved players on this subreddit. if anything people here will bend over backwards to discount victims."
As a Chicago bulls fan this feels like Derrick rose all over again…
"2013, Derrick Rose hurt, Westbrook hurt, Kobe hurt, David Lee hurt, etc, for Memphis making the WCF. That's my best comparison"
derrick rose deserves a 100m lol
Where would the Bulls be if Derrick Rose didnt have knees that disappeared like my dad?  Edit: dad instead of fldad.
"The same joakim Noah who missed almost half the season? Same with boozer missing 20+ games? The bulls had absolutely no business having the best record in the NBA and being as dominant as they were with two starters missing damn near 50% and 25% of the season. A 22 year old D rose leading that team to 60+ wins and the best record in the NBA over the newly formed heat superteam is fucking remarkable.  I feel like anybody who thinks Derrick rose shouldn't have won that MVP is simply like 14-16 years old, weren't watching it live and are simply box score watching. Absolutely nobody thought LeBron was mvp that year at the time. Hell, he came in 3rd behind Dwight."
"That’s interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don’t think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win 🤷‍♂️ but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it’ll be an interesting free agency!"
"This is some bullshit news for the Giannis + Holiday + Middleton core  generally you have like, at best, a 5-6 year window where you can do anything as a contender due to a fuckton of factors but there are exceptions.  When it comes to the last decades champions  Warriors 2014-2019 (Trio + Durant)  Cavs 2014-2018  Heat 2011-2014  Thunder 2010-2016  **Spurs 2011-2018** Split into two eras  Spurs 2011-2014 Vestiges of the original championship trio  Spurs 2015-2018 (All star duo of Kawhi and Aldridge)  LeBron + AD duo has 2 years so far and they've had 3 of LeBron who had a nice 20-14 record before his first Laker year injury  When it comes to non champions but playoff threats (except the Raptors)  Houston 2013-2018 (Harden made the jump from all nba 3rd team to 1st team giving Houston a top 10 player)  Clippers had Chris Paul for 6 years  The Mavericks are morons who broke the core  The Grizzlies quartet of Zach Randolph, Tony Allen, Mike Conley, and Marc Gasol lasted 7 years but they only had an all star level duo for 6 of those years  The Derrick Rose bulls only had 3 all star caliber seasons from him  The Indiana Pacers had 2 all star seasons of Paul George + the Granger, Hibbert, Stephenson core before everything went to shit  The Brooklyn Nets gamble of Garnett, Pierce, + Williams lasted like a year before Pierce was gone (I know I'm stretching here)  The original all star Raptos duo of DeMar + Lowry lasted 2013-2018 before they won a massive gamble trade  The Celtics are pretty weird tbh  The Sixers are at 3 years so far of their all star duo"
"You’re missing the point. You are saying that medical evidence of athletes at other levels isn’t applicable to athletes at a higher level. That’s asinine. And to use Derrick Rose who was an MVP to almost out of the league to back your original comment of ACLs not being a big deal anymore is stupid. You were wrong to say it isn’t a big deal anymore man, if it wasn’t there wouldn’t be a whole fucking thread on the subject."
"One played Division 1 basketball in the Missouri Valley. If you want NBA comps Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Rose all markedly diminished after ACL tears. ~25% of athletes tear their ACL again and 55% never return to their same level of play.  Also don’t shit on athletes when you’re spending your time on a fan page for athletes, blog boy."
"Holy shit, that would be like a Derrick Rose situation. Fuck dude."
Ask Derrick Rose
I thought that Derrick rose story ended up being bogus?? Or am I misremembering
"We say that, but look at Derrick Rose"
Derrick rose flashbacks. Plz be good dude
Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose would like a word... if he's not 100% you don't jeopardize a man like that.
"Derrick Rose would be a champion if he had the same kind of luck as the 2015 Warriors. Instead, the Bulls got curbstomped by a full-strength Heatles while the Warriors faced a team down two all-stars."
Derrick rose took his civil suit to trial and won.  💁‍♂️
Derrick Rose is a fucking scumbag and he deserves all the injuries he’s had
&gt; Derrick rose stayed healthy he very well could have been the greatest point guard of all  No chance.   &gt; Part of being a champion is luck in terms of injuries. It is every year.  When is the last year you had so many top players out due to injury
"Part of being a champion is luck in terms of injuries. It is every year. Every championship should have equal weight. If Derrick rose stayed healthy he very well could have been the greatest point guard of all. He didn’t and he isn’t. And I notice you said if the suns win lol if anyone else wins they didn’t have to go up against the nets full strength. You guys need to chill with making up excuses for why your teams didn’t win. Notice players never do this? They know how hard it is to stay healthy and win a chip, and staying healthy is a big part of winning.  Here is a fun experiment; give me an example of the last championship you think should count as championship without an asterisk."
Derrick Rose did not deserve his MVP. That was rightfully Dwight or Lebron's.
"What? For the knicks maybe, but hes not beating out names like Curry, Magic, Steve nash, John Stockton, Oscar Robertson, Russel westbrook, Chris Paul, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, or Isiah Thomas for top 10 point guard of all time."
Guess Derrick Rose should be in jail then too
"And an entire party saw her so drunk that she could barely stand, she was picking up rocks from a lit firepit, and her friends sent her home. Then, knowing all of this, Derrick Rose and his friends went to her house to have sex with her (which he admitted), despite her texting him not to come over. Even if she was emotionally fine after the incident and only brought the case against him to get a payday, that doesn't change the fact that Rose is a piece of shit."
Derrick Rose MVP is probably the most overrated season ever
MVP Derrick Rose with 2021 shooting
Derrick Rose  Vince Carter  Jason Kidd  Blake Griffin
"OP repost: NBA mods enjoy  1.) Allen Iverson: outside of volume scoring the dude added little else. He had an all time low shooting efficiency at 42% with pathetic rebounding and ast numbers. Dude was extremely overhyped and was a defensive liability at best and added a ton of TO's. (2001) Great handles, very fast and knew how to draw fouls.      2.) Derrick Rose: 25 ppg is 4 reb, and 44% are greatly below average for an nba MVP. With those numbers he should've averaged at least 10 ast per game to justify an NBA MVP but he averaged 7 ast per game. Very athletic (2011)      3.) James Harden: Slow as dog shi t, unathletic, uses the refs and knowledge of the rules to make his points, worst starting defender in the NBA, below average shooting percentage at 44% FG% 5 reb 8 ast. His MVP came right after the Westbrook MVP but was didn't come close to a triple double average and included less points 20 ppg and no defense. Dude is a fraud. Great at creating contact to get to the line. (2018)      4.) Russell Westbroke: 42.5%, 10 reb and 10 ast with 31 ppg. Volume shooter stat padder. Stats were made with him just dribbling around waiting until someone was finally open to get a good look. Rebounds were mostly due to teamates clearing out the lane for him to get the rebounds. Volume scorerer that took low IQ shots at a low which = low shooting percentage. Explosive athlete (2017).      5.) Steph Curry: The 48% FG% is great efficiency as well from the line. However, his mediocre defense combined with low ppg at 23 ppg didn't help. What makes it worse is he didn't average a double double. Normally if you do not average a double double you have to average at least 30 ppg to win the MVP but he neither averaged a double double or 30 ppg. He averaged 7 ast and 4 reb (2015), At the very least you should average high 20's and 6 or above for rebounds and ast.            Just missed the top 5 worst MVP's for the 2000's .      1.) Kobe: 28 ppg, 6 reb 5 ast and 45% FG%. His good defense saved him but overall his numbers were average (MVP comparison). His defense keeps him out of the top 5.      2.) Dirk, 28 9 and 3 at 50% FG%: Didn't get the double double and adds very little to play making. However he was very close to the double double and his scoring efficiency keeps him off the top 5.                  Best MVP's of the 2000's:            1.) Nikola: The combination of good defense, near triple double with 26.5 ppg combined with the insane shooting efficiency of 56% makes him #1 on this list. Prevented Giannis from becoming the first player in this millennium to win 3 MVP's in a row (2021)      2.) Giannis: It's difficult to pick a year but the second MVP is the best choice since he was also the D MVP as well as having a high efficiency at 55%, damn near 30 ppg, 13.6 reb and 5.6 ast. I would say his playmaking should improve but when I look at the roster for that year all I seen was an inconsistent #2 guy aging Center, dumb PG and no SG at all. (2020)      3.) LBJ: Excellent efecency at 56%, nearly 27 ppg, with 8 reb and 7ast. Didn't get a triple or even a double double or the 30 ppg mark but an all nba first team defense combined with very high effeciency and above average MVP numbers across the board is why it's a top 3 season (2013)      4 and 5 are either Giannis or LBJ for different years."
"Yeah, LeBron stands out pretty heavily in this one.   But definitely can't discount the likes of Giannis, Westbrook, John Wall.   There was always those lighting quick guards who could get out and run as well, Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash and even Leandro Barbosa used to cause their fair share of damage.   There's always the dagger three type of guys as well, who could dribbling out in space, pull up from deep and kill you that way like Curry, Lillard or even Reggie Miller would occasionally hit that fast break triple.   Probably not really the question but the elite passing bigmen who can hit those amazing outlet passes would also be an interesting answer to this question, Kevin Love and Nikola Jokic specifically."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"in the 8 straight years Lebron made the Finals in the East, he played a total of ONE 1st Team All-NBA player  that's 24 playoff series and the best player he faced was a 22 year old Derrick Rose while Lebron had prime Wade+Bosh"
This article reminds me of the article that came out in 2011 free agency of Derrick Rose saying he wasn't going to try to recruit anyone. Bad timing.
"Of course, of course. The fundamental difference I’m pointing to though is that Kawhi’s injury is just the latest development in a documented line of problems. He’s pretty much the Derrick Rose of this end of 2015, he’s got the worst pair of legs as far as top tier stars in the league goes right now. They’re already cooked and it isn’t getting any better."
Derrick Rose?
"In no particular order:  1.	⁠Giannis  Arguably the best player in the world today and he’s only 26. Unless he becomes riddled with injuries, it’s very unlikely we see him drop off in the next 5 years  2. Luka Doncic  Luka will be 27 and in the prime of his career. He’s already found his way into some MVP conversations at 22 and it’s not hard to imagine he’ll win the award sometime in the next 5 years.  3. Zion Williamson  The man is already averaging 27ppg in his first full season. I can easily see him improving over the next few years to become a top 5 player in the league  4. Donovan Mitchell  At 24 years old, Donovan Mitchell is already among the best guards in the league. When you look at Dame and Curry, and you compare their games from when they were 30yrs old to when they 24/25yrs old, you can see they improved a ton and really took their game to the next level. Who’s to say Donovan Mitchell won’t do the same.  5. Deandre Ayton  This ones a reach, I know, but it’s kind of boring if I make my list too safe. Don’t really have a good reason for why this would happen lol, but here’s my hot take: Booker and Ayton will start to get Kobe &amp; Shaq comparisons 5 years from now  Additional notes:  I could’ve put “someone who hasn’t been drafted yet” because there’s a great chance another Derrick rose or Luka doncic comes into the league (especially in this 2021 draft class), but I wanted to keep it to players in the league rn."
"The 2011-2012 Chicago Bulls, If Derrick Rose doesn’t get injured I believe they win the championship.  They made it to the conference finals the year prior with Keith Bogans as their starting SG, and upgraded by adding Rip Hamilton."
"How are the Lakers gonna be able to spread the minutes  with Oladipo,DeRozan,Kawhi,Dwight Howard,Carmelo,Lowry  and Derrick Rose al signedl on mid level exceptions or 1 year minimum's"
"Wonder if they could do a double sign and trade Schroder for Tim Hardaway Jr   I think once free agency opens and Lonzo and Conley sign Schroder will have to accept his fate and take 15-20m instead of 25-30M like he was hoping for   At that point Lakers can make a deal  The guard market is pretty light this year besides Lowry, Conley and Lonzo the only other real point guard free agent is Derrick Rose"
"Not yet. This is if he stopped playing today. That would basically make him international Derrick Rose. A couple more years of this, maybe another Euro title, yeah he'll be in."
Derrick Rose
Melo and Dame has made it just as far as D-Rose in the playoffs and outside of his one mvp year dame and melo has mor all nba appearances and dame specifically has been better than rose for the entire 2010s decade overall (injuries suck but its true)   Melo also has a great college career and Derrick Rose college career doesnt exist anymore

I remember somebody posted if you would rather have Derrick Rose or Tyreke on your team. A lot said Tyreke but then of course Rose went on to win the MVP the very next year and Tyreke just kept going downhill.
"Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, Tim Duncan, Luka, Giannis , Kawhi"
"You guys are also trying to shore up the playmaking department, which I think is smart. Bulls want to grab Derrick Rose too.   It won't be all on Lonzo/Lavine's shoulders."
Forbes looks a lot like Derrick Rose.
Utah Jazz legend Derrick Rose
"I keep hearing this Derrick rose can’t play starting minutes, the dude was playing over 30 minutes each game in the playoffs and going hard. He was one of the only dudes with gas in the tank"
"just modern era, Chicago 1st all time. Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, Mark Aguirre, LaRue Martin."
"Even more than the lack of big it was the lack of capable guards that did the team in.  Derrick Rose can't play the number of minutes required for a starting point guard in the playoffs. Quickly looks promising, but is much more a scorer than a playmaker at this point. RJ isn't really a guard at all. Elfrid Payton is simply not good enough.   If Mitchell Robinson can stay healthy (unfortunately a big if), that's one problem solved, but the Knicks haven't had competent guard play for a decade now. That'll be the difference maker next season."
"Not trying to justify the decision, but at that time size was seen as way more important than now, in 2010 the Lakers kind of proved it by destroying the Celtics at game 7 in rebounding when Kobe and Gasol grabbed more than 30 rebounds together after Perkins went down (Garnett got 3). Even in 2014 the Bulls where very succesful with Noah and Boozer, with Derrick Rose as their star."
Lakers remind me of the 2018 Cavs at this point when they signed Derrick Rose and Wade.
BRING DERRICK ROSE HOME!
Why does every rumour reported by this guy have a picture of Derrick rose as the thumbnail?
Why is the photo Derrick Rose
&gt; Just without a former MVP  The disrespect to Derrick Rose
Why is there a picture of Derrick rose
"Please don’t compared Derrick Rose to Jeremy Lin. Rose was an all star, all nba first team and mvp"
"And the 5 guys in the league in 2017 that were considered better than him were infinitely more efficient players, while derrick rose wasnt in his mvp season."
"Kawhi will definitely make it.   Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Derrick Rose, and Klay Thompason might show up on the list as some 2010s players that aren't on there, but they will be more fringe cases. I'd put the order in terms of likelihood as being Kyrie, Klay, Butler, George, then Rose.   Rodman, Vince, Grant Hill, Carmelo, and Ben Wallace would be the guys most vulnerable to being replaced."
Why is every nba Reddit post got Derrick rose as the lhoto
That’s Derrick Rose silly
Ouch.   -Derrick Rose (probably)
Why does every post have a picture of Derrick Rose?
Question regarding the thumbnail: does derrick rose like this contract or something?
We need Derrick Rose :(
JJ Reddick or JR Smith will probably get a call Derrick Rose is also a free agent Avery Bradley
Why is the picture of derrick rose
"lol that's not a conservative guess that's a ridiculous highball guess.  Derrick Rose was once the face of the league and signed a $250m shoe deal, and got hurt and is worth $90m.  Durant's been in the league 13 years, won an MVP and multiple Finals, and he's at $170m.  Even assuming salaries jump 30% over the next few years with the next tv deal and Cade's in the league 15 years at an All-Star level he'd be around $225, less than half of $500m.  You can't just say ""Oh Bron got a bil so Cade's half a bill EASY!""  Lebron and Jordan are the exceptions and the rule-breakers, not the norm."
"Celtics will probably sign a starting PG for the MLE. Currently the only PGs on the roster are Smart, Pritchard, and Dunn, none of which I think are suitable starting PGs. Possible candidates are   - Patty Mills  - Reggie Jackson   - T.J. McConnell  - Derrick Rose  - Cam Payne  - Lonzo Ball in a S&amp;T  I don't really know what the FA market is gonna be like for any of these dudes tho so idk if the MLE is enough for them."
Isn’t Derrick Rose a free agent? Why not make it 3 former MVPs.
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
Derrick Rose played to pretty much 100% of what his body is capable of in the Knicks series against the Hawks and by Game 5 he was clearly cooked.
"Bruh you're a couple years late on the Derrick Rose is always hurt train, he's been the best backup point in the league and stayed mostly healthy for a few seasons now  Smh"
"Lol come on man.   Danny Green can get more than the vet and he would be wanted by almost any playoff contender.   Tucker wants the bag, he's not coming for the vet min and he has a solid role on the Bucks.   Derrick Rose isn't taking the min come on now.   JaMychel Green didn't just turn like 5 million on a championship contender just to take the vet min   You seriously can't want Ener Kanter can you? You already went through one season with 2 no defence centres and it was horrid.  Plus he probably wants more than the min."
"Just off the top of my head, guys who are vets and would ring chase for vet min (regardless of how likely). Lots of guys out there, its just about finding the handful needed to play alongside 3 hall of famers.  danny green  james johnson  reddick  millsap  Tucker  derrick rose  jamychal green  avery bradley  mike scott  enes kanter  javale  dwight  stan johnson"
Such is the story of Derrick Rose
One of my most surreal experiences as a Cavs fan was watching a Derrick Rose assist to a Dwyane Wade layup during the 2018 season.
"Derrick Rose got injured, guys was set for a legendary career if not for that.  Westbrook is very near to his peak performance, merely he is not an #1 type of guy. Even as a #2 was not very succesful. As a #3 he may find success indeed. A weird selection all around (just big numbers, no winning basketball, team only a few wins above 50%)"
"Iverson, Derrick Rose, Isaiah Thomas"
Derrick rose would like a word
Like Derrick rose in Cleveland? Or deron Williams? Lebrons track record with old washed up point guards who can’t shoot is bad
Derrick Rose made me a bulls fan. Was shattered when he was traded and have a soft spot for any team he’s on
Derrick rose played on lebrons cavs teams for a hot second right?
"Off the top of my head:  Locks: Lebron, Kobe, Wade, Duncan, KG, KD, Dirk, Steph, Harden, Giannis, CP3, Nash, Kidd, AI, Westbrook  Likely?: Dwight, Melo, TMac, Ray Allen, Vince Carter, Reggie Miller, Dominique, Gary Payton, Pierce  Has a shot?: Chris Webber, Derrick Rose, Ginobili, Tony Parker, Dennis Rodman, Grant Hill, Pau Gasol, AD, Luka"
Derrick rose trade got us a second from Detroit
"Yeah man.. to me this trade makes no sense for the Lakers. What's their gameplan with Russ? He brings the ball up the court 50% of the time, then LeBron the other half?  Who's the spot-up shooter? One of the two will dominate the ball over the other, and do what... kick it out to Caruso?  Why not go for Duncan Robinson, Reggie Jackson, maybe Derrick Rose as coming off the bench (please resign this man Leon!)? How does Russ move the needle? Yeah he's going to be a HoF player, but he doesn't fit with the Lakers at all, unless he, or LeBron start shooting 40% from 3.  Wizards won this trade hands down. Got rid of Russ' contract, got Kuzma (who might be able to develop into a good player if he puts in the effort), KCP who they can keep or trade, Montrez who can be a good player in the right situation, and pick 22. That's amazing, just for Russ. If Wizards draft well, and build the team right for the next 4-5 years, they can end up with a very good young core that'll just need a nudge from a veteran star or superstar from FA."
Derrick Rose?
"2008: Derrick Rose &lt; Kevin Love, Brandon Rush, Serge Ibaka  not really, a franchise guy like DRose &gt; role players."
"The Jazz also technically had Derrick Rose, but waived him immediately, so he didn't actually join them to play."
This was like bringing Derrick Rose to the Cavs a couple years ago.   What do they need a ball dominant player like Russ for?
"Not true. They had Dwyane Wade, Isaiah Thomas, and Derrick Rose at a certain point. Things didn't work out but it was ultimately Lebron's decision to trade the entire team at the trade deadline"
"For a #1 pick, I might put that line around where Derrick Rose is on the chart.  He's someone that didn't really pan out, because of all the injuries (though he likely would've without injuries)."
Because their GM understood it wasn’t worth trying to win a championship when your best player is Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose was also traded
Derrick Rose anyone?
Derrick Rose will be the 5th one for the 2023 Chicago Bulls
"If Derrick Rose tearing his ACL didn't make cry, I'm not sure anything will. Sorry for my heart of stone."
i was. Derrick Rose gotta be the most overrated player ever
"The 2012 team was way better than the 2021 team, but it def wasn't 100% full strength for the time. No Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Rajon Rondo. Blake Griffen was coming off of a great year too, but the put AD on the team instead even though he hadn't even played in the NBA yet"
[Derrick Rose 50 point game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLHtKHqQMiE).
Derrick Rose all the way. He was the change in PG’s that we have never seen since.
Are we putting Derrick Rose over Dame too?
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
If you’re derrick rose... probably not. Anyone else? Yes.
Why ask a question if you don't want people giving you answers you don't like? Lmfao.   Derrick Rose came from nowhere to win the MVP
I would hope so but it’s so much money I find it hard to believe Tillman will actually do it. I think Wall comes off the bench even if he’s still on the team. Maybe he could be what Derrick Rose was to the knicks last year? I’m just spitballing tho.
"Point guard is #1.  Lowry makes a lot of sense, but he’s gonna be coveted by a lot of teams.    I wouldn’t even rule out a Dennis Schroeder return, but that seems very unlikely since there’s been reports of locker room tension with him.    I’m curious to see if Derrick Rose will re-sign in New York.  I also wanna know how much Spencer Dinwiddie will earn.  Similar for Goran Dragic.    Ish Smith and Bruce Brown are also good.  Bruce Brown is an RFA though.  Ish Smith could be a backup PG target."
This is known as the Derrick Rose question.
"No, see Derrick Rose."
Derrick Rose isn’t that bad......
"Usually no. But Derrick Rose is an exception because he got it so young and his injuries hindered his future superstar performance. Also, this is the Basketball Hall of Fame, I can think of people who got in with less. He’ll make it eventually but not as a first ballot. Also, he won a 6th man of the year award, he’s kind of a lock."
Yes exactly Kevin Porter Jr is our point guard of the future. My hope is that Porter jr and Green is our starting backcourt with JWall off the bench as 6th man. think he’d be much better in that role where he doesn’t have to play 30+ minutes ago but instead can function in sort of that Derrick rose role he played for the knicks last year.
Derrick Rose. Makes everything look so smooth
"Derrick Rose. If the Heat strike out on Lowry, I would love Rose on our roster for the right price."
"They had back to back .750 win percentage seasons with a conference finals appearance. Derrick Rose was MVP, Noah, Deng and Boozer were good starters.  Stop being disrespectful."
To be fair at least I understood why Gordon was upset. He got traded to a team that was moving into a harder rebuild and he immediately had a career altering injury with us. He went from being a prime Derrick Rose lite potential guy into a role player bascially overnight (which would make anyone have bad feelings towards the situation they are in)  Not saying I excuse his behavior because he handled a lot of things badly.  But I can see why he became salty in NOLA and have a little bit of sympathy.   Bledsoe was given the starting role in a high upside team (who would have probably had a legit chance at the playoffs if he tried) and promptly decided to not care at all
We should put an asterisk on every championship after this because Derrick Rose never became the player he was supposed to become because of the injuries lol
"From 1990-2019 * Shaq * Chris Webber * AI * Tim Duncan * LeBron * Dwight Howard * Derrick Rose * Blake Griffin * Kyrie Irving * AD * 2 of KAT, Simmons, Edwards, Zion will get there  So about 12/30 = 40% chance. If you want to be more conservative and count out Kyrie and say only 1 of Zion, KAT, Simmons, Edwards will get there still 33%. Thing is though Cade is much more hyped than your average 1st overall pick. The only players that I think match the hype in the last 10 or so years are Zion, Simmons, and AD. I’d give him a 2/3 shot of being top 10 at some point in his career."
"The Bulls use a territorial pick to add Dwyane Wade, then use another territorial pick to pair him with Andre Iguodala, then use a territorial pick to add Derrick Rose, then draft Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the draft, before drafting Anthony Davis with a territorial pick the next season."
Just grabbed this from basketball-reference and filtered in Excel. Asterisk is Hall of Fame:  Dino Radja*  Don Ray  Davon Reed  Don Rehfeldt  Don Reid  Dick Ricketts  David Rivers  Doc Rivers  David Robinson*  Devin Robinson  Duncan Robinson  Dave Robisch  Dennis Rodman*  Derrick Rose  Dick Rosenthal  Doug Roth  Dan Roundfield  Derrick Rowland  Donald Royal  Delaney Rudd  Damjan Rudez  D'Angelo Russell
dont make me relive this scenario   derrick rose got all his boys paid shout out omer asik
"To all the people below this comment that say ""he brought it on himself"" or ""even if his is (insert scathing criticism)"" or ""I just don't care"", that's an absolutely terrible way of looking at it. That is precisely the paradigm of thought that has undermined mental illness to this point. No one would say the same thing if someone had a physical injury. Technically Derrick Rose brought his injury upon himself because he jumped, but even just typing and reading that, I'm sure people can see how awful a statement that is.  &amp;#x200B;  Now that being said, also diagnosing the possibility that someone is having a nervous breakdown, usually symptomatic of an underlying mental illness hitting an extreme, is not a productive thing to do. We just have no fucking clue. This similarly undermines mental illness as a real illness that requires medical attention and proper engagement. We are not medical practitioners here, so let's not act like it. And even for the few that are,  I'm certain they would be the first to say, ""I can't make any clinical judgement unless I speak to him."" The best thing I think we could do is consider that possibility if we had someone with that intel sharing it and then engaging with that information sympathetically once posed with it. But this pre-emptive sympathy can be similarly insidious, even if it doesn't come from a bad place. It is emblematic of that same belief that we ""understand feelings and mental health"" which we don't at all."
Derrick rose was en route to becoming the goat at one time
"There's no way anyone can be a shoo-in when they're just 22 and have only played 5 or 6 full professional seasons. One of the common threads in hall of fame players is not just how well they played, but also for how long the player has an impact on the sport. If Luka has a career-ending injury or leaves the sport for some other reason, it would be a huge long shot.  Consider Derrick Rose: he had an NBA MVP, a FIBA gold medal in 2010, NBA Rookie of the Year, 3 NBA all-star selections, and an all-NBA first team selection, all by the time he was 23.  Then he tore his ACL and became irrelevant for several years.  He's now sitting at a 12% chance to make the HOF, and that's after putting together some halfway-decent seasons as a role player in the last few years with Minnesota/Detroit/New York."
"Two corrections:   1) you can only sign 1 designated rookie extension on the team, but you can have 2 total. The Celtics signed Tatum and traded for Kyrie which is why they couldn’t trade for AD until the off-season when Kyrie’s extension expired.  2) this applies to any 5 year rookie extension, not just the ones eligible for the Derrick Rose rule.  Otherwise you were correct. Just wanted to clear things up a little."
"Not everyone recovers the same way. Also, he got two major injuries in two years. It kind of reminds me of when Derrick Rose tore his ACL then his meniscus the next year. He hasn't played basketball for 2 years too. He's a great player. I wish him the best."
"Derrick Rose, Bradley Beal (unless he makes some very strong playoff runs), KAT, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown.  And totally agree, Carmelo reminiscent of Dantley and Alex English, albeit with slightly larger fanbase."
Looks like you've already forgotten Derrick Rose...  I'm kidding! The rest of your points are very solid

Damian Lillard is better than Derrick rose ever was
"Derrick Rose type of fast guys blow out their legs, harden/Luka type of fast guys can do it all day, every day"
Derrick Rose is gonna be the first MVP of the modern era to be forgotten.
"A lot of MVPs are debatable. That year Shaq or Kobe could have easily won it. Just like the year Derrick rose won Lebron could have. If you are speaking directly to about this sub, then that’s fair. Then I would say his recognition might be understated because we don’t know if it was the system or him. Dantoni system seems to make every point guard look awesome. Bad PGs become good and good PGs become great."
Derrick rose is coming back but MVP to his injuries hurt
"Derrick rose bulls, big 3 celtics, paul george indiana pacers, brooklyn old 3, carmelo knicks, spurs lite hawks, lebronto raptors.  MJ got Ewing knicks which bulls almost defeated without MJ, Price cavs, Wilkins Hawks, Mourning miami, Shaq orlando, reggie pacers"
Wow. I'm super late to this and no one mentioned Derrick Rose. He was so good that the east would have been competitive instead of the 1 team conference it became.  He's also the youngest MVP ever.
Derrick Rose
Michael Beasley had flashes of being a superstar but just never put it together.   Jabari Parker looked like an offensive Dynamo pre injuries.   Derrick Rose same as Parker but at an even higher level.  Rondo was seen as one of the best up and coming point guards and eventually became a role player
"Yeah, if we look at it like who would be but for the injuries it's basically Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Derrick Rose. But I agree, we should look at it as whose skills just weren't as dominant or who couldn't develop enough. Jahlil Okafor would be a recent pick for me. And Deron Williams a decade or so ago had an absolutely baffling dropoff."
Derrick rose
"The late 2000s/early 2010s was around the time when I was really hung up on the idea that it was extremely rare for a PG to be the top guy on a championship winning team, so teams should instead go for SGs or forwards with extremely high ceilings.  I supported Michael Beasley over Derrick Rose, Evan Turner over John Wall and Derrick Williams over Kyrie Irving. I am not a smart man."

"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don’t count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
Aaron Brooks fell off a cliff. So did IT. Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose for a while there but he's turning it around.
Derrick rose?
Derrick Rose.
Shout out to Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose and its not even close. Rest of this chat is crazy. Youngest league MVP
I mean Derrick rose but due to injury and was a top 5 player at a point
"Facts just like Trae Young, Steph Curry, and Derrick Rose"
Derrick rose
How long was Derrick rose a top pg?? Sigh then how many years did he have injuries

"MVP: Curry  I can't see the Mavs having a top 3 seed this season unfortunately. I think Warriors have a good shot at it with Murray/Kawhi expected to miss a significant amount of time. Lakers may take a bit to gel and Lebron should be on full coast imo. We say how brilliant Curry was at the end of last season and he could get it this season. Embiid, Giannis, and Brooklyn are the biggest competitors imo. Luka, Jokic, and Trae have an outside shot.  DPOY: Anthony Davis  I'm not the biggest fan of AD, but his defense in 2020 was amazing. Draymond talked about one guy whose never out of shape that was - and we all think it was Davis. He's one of the most switchable players in the league. And a clear top 5 defender.He had an off year last year that i think will help build a narrative for voters. Draymond is polarizing, Gobert won too much, and Simmons is the go-to hate guy for the media. As much as i believe Dray may deserve it, this award is going to come down to AD vs. Giannis.  6MOY: Derrick Rose  Thibs trusts his guy. D Rose is gonna have his role in the offense, and I dont see Kemba being a huge threat to his minutes. Rose is going to keep his 25 minutes, and he's trusted with the ball in his hands. I dont think Clarkson will have the same season as last as his efficiency started to return to the old clarkson at the end. People aren't huge on impact guys like Ingles for 6MOY so I think Rose will take it.   ROY: Jalen Green  He's going to score more than any other rookie, and from everything we have seen, Green already has a level of efficiency to his game. I think Cade is less of a go get his and neither guy will be on a good team. Green's stats are going to jump out a bit more imo. Playing next to Hayes, Cade won't have a high enough assist total to make up for it.   MIP: Rui Hachimura  You never really know who is going to win MIP before the season. MPJ already had great counting stats and most of the improvement he needs to make is outside the stat sheet (defense, shot selection, smarter basketball). Hachimura will have much more of a scoring role without Westbrook there, and he showed some insane potential in the olympics. His outside shot is developing well, and I see a breakout year for him.  COTY: Erik Spoelstra  Exec: Bulls"
"&gt; The Cavs didn’t have any future HOFs like Dwight/Melo come on vet mins  Ignoring the fact that both Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose signed 1 year, $2mil contracts with Cleveland, the premise of this statement is very obviously dumb. What matters is whether a player *currently* contributes to a team, not whether they were elite 5-10 years ago. So that was just a terrible response altogether.  &gt; The Cavs didn’t have 2 proven young players come on their team on cheaper deals  Not sure who you're referring to.  &gt; Russ wanted to play and compete in his hometown. Cleveland isn’t his hometown  And? You specifically asked about players outside of Lebron/AD/Russ and now you're scrambling lmfao"
Derrick Rose was 10th in the MVP voting this year.    You Bull fans should be proud of that team.

"If you are talking truly underrated, then Derrick Rose without a fucking doubt.  I like your pic, but I don't know if Fox is underrated, per say.  He's a promising young player and I think is treated as such."
Blake Griffin's dunk contest was 100% fixed for the Kia marketing campaign  The NBA gave Chicago the #1 Pick for Derrick Rose
"Derrick Rose for the past 3 years.  Stats don’t fully show it.  He’s so in control of the offense.  Everytime he’s brought up it seems like people think he’s just a 1 dimensional scorer, or that he’s good but not good enough to start, but he cooks great defenses.  He closes and does it against starters too.  I understand why he doesn’t have a full green light and play starter minutes (you don’t want to put too many eggs into an old injury prone basket), but if he did, I think he’s still an all star.  I think the only people who really know are timberwolves, pistons, and knicks fans."
"And that was when the NBA was still super defensive and physical and he was the only superstar on his team. That 2003 performance is one of the most impressive offensive displays in NBA history. I think he was also just 23 at that point. The injuries really fucked him up. Just as big a what if as Brandon Roy, Derrick Rose, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill (who was meant to actually provide help for T-mac), Greg Oden, Bill Walton etc."
Big time miss on Derrick Rose by me.
Ja kind of feels similar to Derrick rose to me..similar verticality and leadership even though I think he is a bit overhyped
"Yeah if you're slipping DeRozan in, Derrick Rose is in clean"
Possibly add Derrick White and Derrick Rose

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"That's not true at all. I went and saw Jalen Brunson play in HS twice and he's from even further away than Chicago. I watched Jahlil play at Whitney Young and Jabari at Simeon. Plenty of people from my area did the same. That's a further drive than Chino to Compton.   What does social status have to do with anything? I'm about as far removed from Derrick Rose's high school social status possible, and I still was a huge fan of his while he was at Simeon because of the proximity.   Again, Chino Hills is less than an hour away from Compton on a day with lighter traffic. Lonzo didn't they're from the same block, he said Derozan is a legend back home. Every single basketball fan from Rockford, where I'm from, loves Derrick Rose, AD, D-Wade, even Tyler Ulis because of proximity. Not as much as they stan Fred, but still the point remains. Lonzo didn't say he Derozan is the only legend from the SoCal area. Just that he's a legend."
For a comparison people say Derrick Rose is a borderline case and probably unlikely to get in. If Derrick Rose isn't getting in then Jeremy Lin has no chance in hell.

"Sorry, but Derrick rose, grant Hill, and guys of that ilk never showed themselves to be on Giannis’s level (i.e. best player on championship team)"
"But one of the primary reasons why you consider those players to be ""at that level"" is *because* they continued to do it in their 30s.  Mention guys who didn't remain elite into their 30s (Derrick Rose, Grant Hill) and the counterargument will be that they aren't on ""that level"" because they weren't elite long enough."
*Derrick Rose left the chat*
"Unpopular Knicks Opinion - I’m a huge Knicks fan and I hated this past season for them. They spent years amassing picks and after Thibs arrived, they played their way to a 1-and-done playoff appearance on the knees of the oft-injured Derrick Rose and NBA journeymen. Their young players didn’t get much game experience and their picks in this year’s strong draft ended up being middling picks. Their success may have shifted perception of the Knicks but that didn’t help in FA this summer. I would have preferred that the Knicks had tried to develop Toppin, Knox, and even DSJ or Frank N even if just for trade value. The trade for Kemba and re-signing of Randle makes them better, but not a championship contender IMO."
"Giannis, although a stellar person and clearly athletic as fuck, is boring as hell to watch as a player. Give me Michael Jordan, prime Derrick Rose, or Steph Curry any day."
"They started with a record of 17-20 and after the Derrick Rose trade went 24-11 which is equivalent to 56 wins over an 82 game season. Their final record of 41-31 is equivalent to 47-35, the swapping of Elfrid Payton (who I cannot stress enough as a complete negative on the court) and Reggie Bullock for Kemba and Fournier as well as the improvement in the young players and hopefully healthy Mitchell Robinson means 50 wins is a realistic expectation. Kemba may not perform like he used to but is a GINORMOUS upgrade over Elfrid Payton"
"Derrick Rose isn't a great player, there is no what if scenario with him. Arguably a horrible person and should have been out of the league after his case. Fuck D Rose"
"The 2020 Lakers are a historically weak title team. My any measure their competition on the way to the title was the worst since the merger, and almost any other way the bracket shook out would have pitted them against much harder opponents and probably led to them losing.  Pascal Siakam is an above average starter at best and his contract is gonna fuck us if we don't move him before other teams catch on.  Iverson winning MVP over Duncan is completely indefensible. Duncan was a better leading a better team.  Prime Terrell Brandon was about as good as prime Derrick Rose."
"Suggs is just playing with more fluidity.  Honestly, he’s reminding me of Derrick Rose.  He had a really aggressive play yesterday against Cleveland, where he just attacked and dunk the basketball with ferocity."
"Zion's speed, strength and leaping ability are insane for 280 pounds. When he's in IDGAF mode, not thinking about protecting his legs, he plays like Allen Iverson or Derrick Rose."
"Ok East--  Who is he beating out, Paul Pierce, Rondo, Iso Joe, Derrick Rose, Kyrie, PG13, DeMar, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Lowry..."
"Is the basketball hall of fame easy to get in compared to the standards of the NFL or MLB? I don't think you can argue it's not. Just by their very nature the basketball HoF is happy to let in guys just off their college resume while others lean so much more heavily on professional acumen. That alone is huge to your point.  That being said, where I'm departing from others on the matter is to say: so what? I doubt any of the players you listed are just bums, even the ones I hadn't heard of before. And while I acknowledge there is some importance in having some credential or statistical basis behind a players case, the way some of these arguments end up going (ESPECIALLY in baseball) seem to me like it's somewhat missing the point.  The basketball hall of fame, the hall of fame of any sport really, is a celebration of that sport and the people who made us love it. Manu Ginobili is not just an edge case for HoF based off the combination of Spurs titles+Olympic gold, he should in because he's Manu Fucking Ginobili. Do, for instance, Derrick Rose or Blake Griffin have a weaker case for HoF based on their body or work? Probably. Is there a reason to actively dislike their being there, hypothetically? I say no.  So to me the question isn't ""is the basketball hall too easy to get into"", it's ""are the other halls too hard to get into"""
Derrick Rose?
"Man, I was such a big Carney fan. That Memphis team was something special, and built up into the Derrick Rose/CDR team that made the finals. Shout out Jeremy Hunt too."
"He's more of a What If guy, ""What if China hadn't ground his knees to dust?""  He's a great, but his legacy is ultimately going to be more in line with Derrick Rose and Grant Hill as ""What If"""
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DRAGIC?? DID YOU NOT GET THE MEMO? DERRICK ROSE CAN **GO UPSTAIRS!**
Yes and she always reminded me that Brandon Jennings was considerably worse than Derrick Rose. I've never been the same since.
Derrick Rose makes me want to go higher
Derrick Rose as a fellow Chicago guy kinda makes sense. Cedi seems like a nice dude. I’m ok with it.
Only if Cavs icon Dwyane Wade is introduced by teammates Cedi Osman and Derrick Rose
"Rudy Gobert averaged 14.3 ppg while leading the league in FG%, total blocks, total rebounds, plus minus, won DPOY and was top 2 in multiple advanced stats while playing for the best team in the league and only missing one game. He finished 10th in MVP voting behind Derrick Rose. So almost definitely not"
"That’s not how trades work lol. We obviously have to send salary back in the form of probably Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Noel plus 3+ years worth of 1sts. Those guys are great culture fits for us. We’re not ready for this trade right now until either RJ is an all star and Kemba is healthy and balling."
"While I agree that versatility is the #1 most important thing, the bench is a smaller part of that. You have to be able to rebound, pass or dribble out, drive to the hoop or shoot 3 (for 2 points ) or find a killer path. While also having enough length and man on man defense skills you don't get bullied off the court.     In the woman's they had Italian Muggsy who was an absolute talisman, but in general the more streetball players are the ones you want. Derrick Rose and Carmelo (whose help defense is ATROCIOUS but not a problem in 3x3) come to mind as the USA best historical options (without just saying Lebron or MJ)"
How'd did he get in? Well that means someone like Derrick Rose can get in.
"&gt;that was with paying Boozer, who they likely wouldn’t have re-signed in this scenario (was a 2010 free agent)  Technically they didn't ""re-sign"" Boozer, they signed him. He wasn't on their team before that.  &gt;The big 3 all made 14 million in Miami that year  I remember being surprised that all three ended up on the same team. I thought they would've tried to make more money individually and therefore no team would be able to afford all three. The feeling in Chicago at the time was that we could afford two but not all three. Having Derrick Rose still on the contract that he signed his rookie year helped keep the cost of the roster down. No one knew Rose would be that good that year. He improved a lot between his 2nd and 3rd season (when he won MVP).  &gt; CJ Watson or maybe either LeBron and D-Wade to give Deng more minutes  Lebron and DWade were stars, they probably would not be happy coming off the bench no matter what :D"
"I can’t even imagine. I used to play at the park almost every day until my body just gave out on me. Then it became doing it every now and again until my knees, hips, ankles or back would give out. Now I bike and it doesn’t fill that same competitive hole I have. I’d do anything to compete with anyone. I can’t imagine actually being at the peak of the sport and then being unable to find a roster spot among 30 teams in the span of a couple years. I’m not going to say it is impossible as Derrick Rose made a resurgence nobody would have predicted three years ago, but it is unlikely."
They also had Derrick Rose on that team
I’ve heard Hollinger say that the general feeling in the league is that most bigs don’t care about basketball.   Then again guys like Derrick Rose have said they don’t even watch the playoffs so maybe there’s a lot less guys in the league who actually love playing than you’d think.
Derrick Rose before his injuries had no fear in the paint
"I mean, if you're talking about isolating one single position, then it's way, way more rare for the best player to be the *second* pick.    KD, and maybe LaMarcus Aldridge are the only two examples in the last 20 years.    Meanwhile you've got Yao Ming, LeBron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, AD, and arguably John Wall and Zion who are #1 picks who turned out to be best in the draft."
10 years?      MVP Derrick Rose vs Big 3 Heat.
"Nah. Even from the eye test, LeBron’s perimeter defense would not even be considered better than James Posey, Tayshaun Prince, and Shawn Marion along with the 4 I mentioned above. He wasn’t considered a stopper. No reputation whatsoever before that he was the best perimeter defender in the league for even a season.   He guarded Derrick Rose and did well which his fans bring up but even at Rose’s best, he wasn’t a scorer where you have to worry about his shooting prowess. LeBron preserves himself on defense so that he has enough energy on offense and for career longevity. He’s erratic that he’ll have a chase down block every now and then but it will also be mixed with meltdowns and Kuzma pushing him to rotate correctly on defense."
"Jimmy Butler’s story is actually insane, he deserves all the credit in the world. Same with Derrick Rose."
"I love how everyone responding to your comment is just completely ignoring the actual question you asked and simply replying with random examples of very popular injury-prone star players or guys that unexpectedly missed a year or two in their primes. As if Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Derrick Rose, Bill Walton, IT etc arent discussed ad nauseam on this subreddit any time an injury related/retirement topic comes up and like 97% of this sub isnt intimately familiar with all of those stories lol  That's not the question that was being asked. this isnt that hard lol. people just love to flex their factiods I gues lmao"
Derrick Rose: couldn’t rub two pennies together as a kid to college star to youngest mvp to disappearing for days to being a starting point guard on a playoff team
I don't know if it's just me but it looks like his left leg isn't taking much weight at all. You can see as he lands after jump shots that his heel pops up relieving any pressure that's going through that leg as he lands.   As someone that's recovered from lower extremity injuries before it's a pretty typical thing to overload weight onto the opposite side. I really hope they pay close attention to that as Derrick Rose dealt with similar problems on opposite legs after returning from serious injuries.
Hey it’s not everyday you get the chance to be dunked on by Derrick Rose!
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"I agree with 2011, he should have won instead of Derrick Rose.   I disagree with 2018.  He has an argument but it is a stretch to say he got screwed.   Injuries are part of the game.  So you can't really say he got screwed in 2021.   The Bucks were actually much worse in the bubble than they were before the season stopped and Giannis won anyway so idk how you say Lebron got screwed there either."
Derrick Rose can go upstairs!!!
Derrick Rose and KD
He had a few moves in the game too.   [Move #1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=70&amp;v=IjyIch_QgN0&amp;feature=youtu.be)  [Move #2](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=107&amp;v=IjyIch_QgN0&amp;feature=youtu.be)  *Is that Derrick Rose?*
"Lebron, Luka, Tim Duncan(Although David Robinson was just injured. Drafting Tim extended their success into the next 20 years.), Derrick Rose"
"NBA was still locked in on the big man being the most important player to get. In fact from 1990-2009 a big man was taken with the first pick all but 4 times. 1994 Glenn Robinson, 1996 Allen Iverson, 2003 LeBron, &amp; 2008 Derrick Rose were the only non C/PF drafted 1st overall. Looking back i count only 5 bigs that should have been the no brainer number 1 pick. Shaq, Webber, Duncan, Yao Ming, &amp; Dwight Howard were the obvious choices. I didn't look at every draft but i guess you could argue Kenyon Martin in 2000 was the best bet at the time. The 2000 draft was absolutely awful. Martin was certainly better than the next 3 selections of Stromile Swift, Darius Miles, &amp; Marcus Fizer (no clue who this even is). But looking back at other drafts is stunning to think who they thought was the best player in the draft."
Prime  Derrick Rose is up there
"Using The Wizards to say Michael didn’t adapt is just really dumb.  Michael got old, you can’t adapt out of that.  It would be like saying that Derrick Rose was never that good based on his recent performance when at one time Derrick Rose was the best in the league.  Did Derrick Rose not adapt like you suggest of this scenario?  Or did Derrick Rose’s body not let him perform at his peak level?    This is your argument."
"Derrick Rose is the obvious answer. I'd say his playstyle was very susceptible to injuries from early on, so there's not too much of a point in playing the what-if game with him. Grant Hill was the obvious one before Rose, although maybe he got in for his college career?  In terms of guys just not panning out and not so much because of injuries, but more so because they never reached that higher level - Ricky Rubio and Andrew Wiggins."
"Upon successful buyout negotiations, Shaquille O'Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Mugsy Bogues, Jeremy Lin, Derrick Rose, Andre Iguadala, Yao Ming, Carmelo Anthony, Joakim Noah, John Wall, and the entire 2013 Memphis Grizzlies roster have signed two way contracts with the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets--whichever team makes it to the finals."
Derrick Rose.   Where he at?  But yeah let’s talk about Kobe.   Bunch of disingenuous fucks.
"How about Derrick Rose? Matt Barnes? Kristaps Porzingis? Luke Walton? LeBron James?     But Nah, y’all just want to talk shit about the dead dude who made amends and raised four daughters. Bunch of hateful shitty motherfuckers."
Tbh I don't really care about this story about AD playing only with LeBron. That is just player empowerment and I'm all for it cause realistically if AD plays another year and gets a career altering injury the team wouldn't hesitate to low ball him offers I mean look at how Derrick Rose and Boogie Cousins career turned out. So this specific thing I don't really mind  What I do mind is what Rich Paul did to Nerlens Noel. Noel was close to signing Generational wealth. And this motherfucker Rich Paul tempts him with a $100 mil offer and then basically ghosts him. When it looked like teams were trying to get Noel for his services Paul wouldn't bother returning calls.   In the Noel situation I hope Rich Paul loses his Player Agent license. Dude fucked over Noel.
The 2008 nba draft was rigged in order for the Chicago market to be revived as the Bulls took derrick rose #1 overall
"&gt;Derrick Rose.  Imo Rose's is def getting into the HoF, he has an MVP that's all he needs.    Heck even Grant Hill got inducted, and he didn't even win an MVP."
"Giannis is first-ballot no question, AD's a lock as well. Jokic has an MVP, but that's no guarantee— if he retired today, he'd probably be seen like Derrick Rose."
I don’t think Jokic is a lock  He has an MVP but only 3 all stars and all nbas. Derrick Rose has a very similar resume but I don’t think a lot of people say he makes it either
Imagine a Messi with the strength of prime bale. That's R9. In basketball terms imagine the deep bag and shooting of Kyrie/Steph combined with  the physical dominance of LeBron and the longevity of prime Derrick rose.
1. The Decision  2. KD joining Warriors  3. 73-9 Warriors  4. James Harden trade  5. Derrick Rose injury
Not the only one Derrick Rose rubbed off on.
"you must be like 15 years old, he won two back to back NCAA titles and in his rookie year, with Derrick Rose and Ben Gordon took the defending champion Celtics to 7 games"
"He signed July 2006 (4 year $60m) and was there for like 2 years. I am next to positive he didn’t play a minute with Derrick Rose, as Ben wasn’t on the team that went against the Celtics in his rookie year.   Our centers were Joakim, Brad Miller (post trade) and Aaron Gray, I think, and maybe Tim Thomas or Kurt Thomas I can’t remember, they’re the same person."
Derrick Rose must’ve rubbed off on him back then
I get what you're saying too. Obviously getting into the HOF has many criteria and longevity is just one of them that derrick rose lacks. He also doesn't have other aspects to make up for it in which Walton does.
I mean derrick rose career is pretty unprecedented considering he's the only MVP to have 1 superstar calibre season. Literally every non-active MVP has a bare minimum of playing like a superstar for 5-7 years.
Can't tell if you're being serious.  Derrick Rose is famously the MVP who probably hasn't had an overall career that would be worthy of the HoF
Derrick Rose?
"I was born in 1990 and have experienced every feeling a sports fan can experience, below is from memory, and I won’t be held to accuracy.   1990s: Inherited exceptional greatness. I won’t go into it, but, I believed this was just the way the world was supposed to be. I was terribly wrong.   1999: The bottom falls out. We are the worst team in the league. I still listened to every game on AM radio. As much as Krause wanted it, Toni couldn’t do it by himself.   99: We land the first pick with Elton brand and Ron artest (16). At least the rebuild is efficient, going from a 3 peat to #1 pick? Eh? Not bad (kill me now).  2000: Were once again the worst - I do my best to help AM radio ratings. We draft #4/#7 and pick up the all time great Marcus fizer (!) and Jamal Crawford (traded for Chris mihm, thank you lord). We miss on “free agents” whether it be Tmac, Duncan, and grant hill. No1 wants to come. The rebuild is going fine, or something.   2001: once again the worst, and we decide our former #1 pick is trash after putting up 20-10 for 3 years, trading him for the #2 pick (tyson chandler), and using #4 (eddy curry). Who needs Garnett and Tim Duncan when we can just draft em? Baby bulls baby, let’s go. Also, we sign Eddie freaking Robinson to a 4 or 5 year deal at $32m (fml)   2002: we still suck but land the #2 pick (jay Williams), and things start to turn around with our youth. Some flashes with our young guys, but there’s just too much youth and we’re terrible again.   2003: a week before the draft jay crashes his motorcycle and we are once again fucked. Luckily it happened before the draft and we get Kirk. Pretty sure we signed jalen rose here or last year and Eddie Robinson fucking sucks.   2004: draft luol Ben Gordon and duhon. Excellent draft. Team starts to click the last couple weeks and we finally win 30 games!!!!!   2005: I believe we sign Ben Wallace which was our first big free agent in a long time, I’m not counting jalen or Scottie. We have no pick.   2006: I have been drinking and this is getting exhausting. Just know we fuck up by trading for tyrus Thomas, landing Derrick rose, joakim, and jimmy butler. Everything after that was a tragedy but we’re finally on the precipice of MAYBE a nice rebuild here.   In Short, outside of 4 years from like 2006-2011, we have sucked."
"Nah Steph isn't top 5 all-time. Isiah Thomas, Jamal Crawford, Kyrie, Rod Strickland, Iverson, Derrick Rose, Steve Nash, Pistol Pete and Mark Price are guys I believe all had better ball skills than Steph."
"In most discussions you just need to take the terms ""athleticism"" and ""skill"" at their popular definitions i.e. jumping high and running fast, and then ball skills.   Changing direction/wild finishes are a bit more difficult to categorize because 1)changing direction is often associated with beating a man off the dribble, meaning the ability to head fake or body fake is correlated strongly (which is a ball skill) and 2)wild finishes are also associated with the ability to control the ball and know how to use the backboard/angles to not get blocked (which is also a ball skill).   I think ""athleticism"" in regards to changing direction really becomes more apparent when we're talking about guys like Derrick Rose (in his youth), where it's abundantly clear that his agility takes a lot of responsibility for him beating his guy with the dribble (though that's not to say he wasn't amazing at the head/body deception). You can easily say he's more athletic in terms of agility/change of pace than a guy like Curry.  You also can't really improve your ability to use a variety of spins to get the ball correctly off the glass by lifting weights and doing speed drills beyond those things improving your ability to take contact. To finish at the rim like Kyrie or Steph requires you to pick up a basketball and learn until you have mastered the movements at an intuitive level to where you can then start improvising.  It's probably better to discuss both these things as skills but in terms of ""physical skills"" and ""ball skills"". Jumping high and running fast are certainly things you can improve on and build, just like amazing handles and finishes around the basket. They have carry over where they can aid each other and blur the lines a bit i.e. being strong (a physical skill) helps you finish around the defense, and that's where the interesting discussion takes place in terms of parsing what skill (physical vs ball) is dominant in a particular play."
He looks like Derrick Rose the way I look like Rich Evans
He looks like Derrick Rose the way I look like Chris Evans
I hear Griezmann wants to play next to [Derrick Rose](https://youtu.be/cxJeY24tikc) though.
How the fuck is Derrick Rose not even mentioned for Chicago
Derrick Rose not in the Chicago Team??
"Chicago was a hotbed of talent, so I split them up into a couple more teams. Wade leads the South Side Sky, who play in Wintrust Arena, along with Anthony Davis &amp; Derrick Rose!"
"At first I thought maybe **Wade** because his return to Miami was a happy ending, but he was traded from the Cavs.  I think this was the season **Tony Allen** retired, but he was a defensive force, not an offensive one, and it would be really questionable to call him a star  I'm gonna go with **Derrick Rose**, because his career went on an upward trajectory after being waived by the Jazz"
Jazz legend Derrick Rose?  Edit: wait his career isn't over yet my bad
Derrick rose got waived in that time but he still has an nba career so idk
That Memphis team was amazing. As a life long Derrick rose fan and kid from Chicago the first time I had my heart broke by sports was the KU MEM championship game.
Derrick Rose would be more of a comparison career wise to Walton.
**Derrick Rose - Fetty Wap**  Both had one of the greatest years of all time but became irrelevant afterwards
"&gt; So if you didn’t play with a player when they won their MVP you never played with that MVP player?   I mean if they didn't win MVPs the year they played together, they were not MVPs, were they?  They would have been former MVPs at best which doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot (Derrick Rose is a former MVP but a sixth man right now, as a more extreme example) and in KDs case, he wasn't anything related to an MVP because he won MVP after Harden left."
He was as much a rookie as Derrick Rose
Derrick rose might have my fave highlight tape of all time... so him for me
Derrick Rose getting hurt the second time.  We didn't even feel like watching
Beasley had so much potential man I was so excited for him and Derrick rose coming into the league. I thought Beasley/Durant could’ve been the next big stars like how Kobe/Lebron were getting all those puppet commercials. I still think he could’ve been that
" 1. Bulls 01-03 2. Jim Boylan  I’m from Chicago and around 1st-2nd grade got really into the NBA  This was around 2001-2002  I remember Marcus Fizer was supposed to be a promising rebounder, ron arrest a great defender and Jamal Crawford a great scorer, Elton brand had a lot of upside,  Then came in the new hope of the 2 towers of Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry, and hype for acquiring Jalen Rose and finally getting a 20ppg scorer on the team   Was hyped for the 2003 draft, team was pretty high on Kirk hinrich, must of watched 50+ games that year rooting for dudes like Jannero Pargo, heard incredible things about Scottie pippen and did t really understand why he was not very good.  3rd pick in the draft in 2004 taking an SG Ben Gordon supposedly had some esoteric link to taking another SG 3rd in the draft 20 years prior.  I remember Johnny Red Kerr call games and would listen to games on the radio   Slowly the hype of the baby bulls began to build with Kirk, Ben Gordon, Loul Deng a year later and with Andres Nocioni and others finally made the playoffs one year with Scott Skyles as the coach,  I remember Joakim being drafted in that goofy ass suit and being kinda disappointed but Florida had been winning well, was stoked about signing Ben Wallace and remember joakim kept clowning as a rookie and Ben and the team gave him some sort of suspension or something.  I legitimately thought they should have drafted Beasley because I thought they already had a decent PG, the rise of the post Vinny Del Negro Derrick Rose/Thibs bulls was incredible and tragic, the rise of Jimmy was dope, Pau gasol and D Rose part 2 was dope, even y’all nephews know the rest and the Jim Boylan times were pretty dark although an unexpected Lavine dunk here and there was always a bright spot post Jimmy."
"That’s fair. I don’t disagree with the explosive playmaking assessment, and perhaps I’m putting a little too much weight into all of the head-scratching shots and plays I’ve seen from Russ over the years. Although, there are factors that the statistical gaps can be looked at to partially account for, like prime Russ basically having the whole team and ball to himself to do what he’s best at, as well as the pace of the game having changed.   I tend to value intangibles like how the player will perform in clutch moments (playoffs, tight/high-pressure moments, etc.) Having a truly deadly scorer like prime D-Rose not only gives you the option to just get a bucket late in close games, but puts pressure on defenses which leads to more quality looks teammates (like Lebron).     I may have to alter my take a bit on “prime” D-Rose vs prime Russ, but i think the intangible effects (on winning) of being the elite scorer that young D Rose was, giving defenses fits, to some degree make up for the statistical gaps.  The worst part of this all IMO is that if he could have somehow stayed healthy, prime D-Rose very possibly would have taken another step as so many other stars do, as the mid-late 20s is widely accepted as when athletes hit their prime.  The prime D-Rose that we get to go off of was only Derrick in his early-20’s. The fact that he was able to reinvent himself into being such a quality PG again after everything he’s gone through tells me that he would have made some of those jumps.  Not saying that hypothetical 28 year old prime D-Rose would simply be better than prime Russ, and Russ absolutely deserves credit for being able to bounce back from his knee injuries the way he has that D Rose sadly couldn’t. I just hate that we didnt get the chance to see prime D-Rose pick up where he left off and continue to develop."
Derrick Rose will forever have my respect.
"I didn't mention efficiency at all. Why does r/NBA make every comment about efficiency.  I said Rose could jump higher, like Jesus christ dude.    Derrick Rose combine no step vert - 35 inches (max vert -40) Dwayne Wade Combine MAX vert(running) 35 inches.   Derrick rose had another level he could get to, even before Wade started getting hurt."
Also the same aau with Derrick Rose.
"No, he won because he had a much more impressive season than LeBron had (so did Dwight for that matter). He led his team - without any star players like LeBron had multiple of - to the best record in the East. A better record than LeBron had on a team that was favored to win it all from the get-go. Rose's Bulls even beat LeBron's Heat in 3/3 games that season.      Thibs' defensive schemes were great for a few years, but he had absolutely no idea what he was doing on offense. He barely even called plays at times. Rose was the offense of that team. Noah was still not the player he would become and only played 48 games due to surgery and lingering injuries. Boozer broke his hand just days before the start of the season. 38-year-old Kurt Thomas had to start and finish their games. Starting shooting guard Keith Bogans averaged 4 points per game (and might have been the worst starter of all time lol). His best teammate that year was Luol Deng - who played with a wrist injury all season. When on the floor, Rose was responsible for more than 70% of Chicago's offense per PTS/AST even though he was the sole ball handler of that team, clogged by defenders all the time. Still, he lead his team to the best record in the league.      Rose totaled more than 2,000 points and 600 assists that season. At the time, something only MJ (1988-89) and LeBron (2009-10) had been able to do during the modern era. While doing so he received 113 of 120 possible 1st place votes that year, totaling more points than 2nd placed Dwight Howard and 3rd placed LeBron combined. He totally earned it. Even his rivals on the Heat thought so:      *Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing well, like he’s the best point guard in the league and the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.*   \- Chris Bosh      *I think it's Derrick Rose, definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being first in the Eastern Conference - they're playing some really good basketball.*   \- LeBron James"
"Nah not just peaks. 2000-2011 is not just a peak, that’s sustained excellence.   The point guard on those teams was **derek fisher**. There was no one else on the team capable of solid primary playmaking besides maybe a couple prime years of Odom and a year of Gary Payton. Gasol and Shaq were good passers out of the post but not primary playmakers. Saying that guys like MJ or Iverson are better playmakers in any capacity is just not true and you know it. Even dudes like Kyrie or Derrick Rose may have put up better assist numbers but they weren’t better playmakers."
"Derrick Rose moves up a lot, KG too. Tmac for sure. Durant. Carmelo. AI.  But the guys who are already regarded as unstoppable like Shaq Kobe LeBron and MJ don't get unseated just because you take away accolades and longevity, they had incredible primes."
"Penny, Derrick Rose, Vince Carter, TMac, Russ, Grant Hill, Amare Stoudemire"
"Hey I was there for the MVP season, just saying ""Derrick Rose"" is a valid response 😂"
Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose
I'm a jackass because I think Derrick Rose was overrated? Haha.They never beat LeBron in the playoffs.Never even took him to 7 games. I agree with everything you said abut his game. He was an awesome player. I just don't think he was a once in a generation player. That's not a wild statement lol
"&gt;2011 D. Rose doesn’t have a place in today’s league, 3 is better than 2, score first point guards are more valuable than a slashing playmaker.     Demonstrably false as he is literally still an NBA player at this point.   3 is better than 2, that's true. No argument there.   Disagree on the last part, because then that means assists and hockey assists are not valuable as a counting skill or scoring statistic, which point guards genuinely do.     &gt;Besides, everyone is talking about peak D. Rose in 2011 yet everybody fails to mention the fact that Dame at his best is just as good if not even better, dude doesn’t miss, drops 50 bombs every week and is the clutchest shooter we have ever seen, to say you will take D. Rose over someone like that imo is crazy.     For all of the hype that Dame gets with his shooting (well deserved, btw), I'd argue that his individual and team defense really knocks his rating down a lot for this argument. I'm not saying Rose is a lockdown defender, but defense does mean sticking with your assignment on and off ball. That makes the argument closer on that alone.   MVP D-Rose was something else for real. I think you need to check this out:   [Derrick Rose MVP SZN Ultimate Highlights 2010-2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSQ8yZ4haHc)"
Derrick Rose was not on track to be the GOAT. Wtf?
"Seems like to win today, you need 3 point shooting from that position. Look at Russell Westbrook. The year that he wanted MVP, and the years that he was impactful in OKC post-KD, his ability (and willingness) to take threes affected the other teams' ability to sag off him in the paint. Not that he's ever been a feared three-point sniper, but he makes enough of them when it counts to keep teams honest (which is what we wish Ben Simmons could do). I'm not sure Derrick Rose has ever gotten to that point, of even being as ""feared""/respected as Westbrook from 3 (and I'm saying that lightly). It seems like that matters a lot more now than it did in 2011."
"There's not such thing as ""Peak Derrick Rose"""
"I take Rose, he was one of those “once in generation athlete”.  Derrick Rose was impossible to stay in front of in 2011."
"Derrick Rose never was and never could be on the same level as Lebron, Durant, or Curry"
Peak Derrick Rose is better than Peak Dame any day of the week.
"Be respectful of what this dude has given to us before you start shit-talking a man who was a pivotal piece in the best basketball years of our lives. A dude who stuck around when Bron left, didn't that feel good when you felt like everything was falling apart? This is not the person with whom your ire belongs.  Blame the dude who signed him to an absurd deal and didn't have a plan for him after 6 games. Four coaches in four years. Four picks for KPJ. Couldn't trade Drummond. Couldn't trade JR's contract. Kyrie for Isaiah Thomas. Derrick Rose for Rodney Hood. Larry for Lauri. No incoming firsts, no cap flexibility, no hope this season. He's the guy who plainly sucks.  We've got to move on from Love, but not nearly as much as we've got to move on from Altman."
BJ Armstrong fucked up Derrick Rose. Change my mind.
Derrick Rose would of been the GOAT if not for injuries
“We men. You can assume”  - Derrick Rose on trial of sexual assault allegation
Derrick Rose.
He had one of the worst statistical MVP seasons ever. is 25/7 on 45/33 generational to you? Lol people definitely overrate Derrick Rose
"Bulls fan, so Derrick Rose. Guys never on the Bulls though, Giannis, Steph, and Dame."
"He was the youngest MVP of all time, questions of whether Lebron should’ve won it that year notwithstanding. Until injuries took away his ability to play at that level, Derrick Rose was absolutely a generational talent."
I will die on the hill that Dwight deserved MVP over Derrick Rose
In what world was Derrick Rose generational? Really good player but come on lol
"Basically, Pax was fine while expectations were low and it didn't really matter if Ben Gordon or Tyrus Thomas didn't pan out long term because they weren't playing for anything.  After lucking in to a generational player in Derrick Rose, their faults as general managers became a lot more glaring with the rising expectations."
We actually liked them for a while. Paxson turned the ship around from some terrible Krause years post dynasty and got us to the playoffs. Then Derrick Rose came around the same time Gar did so it was an in GarPsx we trust type situation for a while. It was around the mid 2010s when people started to slowly sour on them.
"The obvious is MJ but everyone said that so besides him I’m gonna say Derrick rose.   This dude had a season ending injury like 3 or 4 years straight, the fact that he’s carved out a solid role for himself in the league is incredible to me, especially a guard with his play style"
"I think Walton would be a no-brainer for this list of he had been healthy and had sustained success for his career, but back-to-back seasons of 18 and 13 isn’t enough for me to personally having on my list. Clint Capela just put up 15 &amp; 14 last season, and he’s certainly nowhere near a top 10 all time list.   For me, my view on putting Bill Walton on a top 10 center list is like it is for putting Derrick Rose on a top 10 point guard list. Could he have been on it, if his career hadn’t been derailed by injuries? Absolutely. But there’s so many good players for me that it’s hard for me to account for “what if”’s.   And no worries… I love hearing other perspectives on basketball."
Derrick Rose
Ricky Rubio -&gt; Rajon Rondo -&gt; Gary Payton  John Wall -&gt; Derrick Rose -&gt; Russell Westbrook
"Ja Morant Zach Lavigne Russell Westbrook.  Ja maront is ahead of his time Lavine plays like young Westbrook, without the shooting. Current Westbrook is absolute shite but his playmaking is elite, he is transitioning into moredern Derrick Rose Territory."
"There’s two different types of athletes. There’s graceful speedy lankiness that has an almost  and then there’s just raw power driven by pure quick twitch kinetic energy. You can usually tell by how they dunk.   Ja Morant comes to mind as one of the former, you can add Derrick Rose to that category too. Then somebody like Russell Westbrook or John Wall is just pure power when it comes to dunking.   But the rarest thing is when you have that ability to almost glide in a big man. You usually only see it in guards or wings, but by god Jonathan Bender had that as a legitimate 7-footer."
Derrick Rose
"No, it is correct. After this season starts, Dwight Howard will have played in more seasons post back injury in Orlando than Yao Ming played period. Derrick Rose is entering his 9th season since tearing his ACL, Yao Ming only played in 9 seasons total."
Hall of Fame teammates?  I guess Butler did have Derrick Rose.
"Derrick Rose has undergone physical and role changes. He's gone from MVP slashing point guard, to backup point guard who can knock down 3's."
Derrick Rose had as big a career in 4 years as most NBA players have in 20. Not a bust to me future hall of famer
Playoff Derrick Rose is a scary sight. Saw the games in person
Derrick Rose?
derrick rose really a bust though?
Derrick Rose didn’t deserve his MVP
Derrick Rose  Zach Lavine  Andrew Wiggins  Jimmy Butler  Kevin Love.    Nice little small ball lineup with 4 all stars and Wiggins
Totally incomparable seeing as how Parker didn't take jumpshots and Derrick Rose blew his knees because of bad dunk landings
you really think I’m bullshitting the benefits of falling in basketball? See how long Tony Parker lasted compared to Derrick Rose
Don’t like three point shooting. I like really athletic players who dunk a lot. Prime Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose was two of my favorite players to watch.
Is me and my freshman year dorm roommate watching Derrick Rose wreck his knee really any better though?

"I don’t think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added.

"Landing mechanics are something you can practice, it's a type of body control that I think absolutely falls under the umbrella of athleticism.  Derrick Rose tore his ACL more than anything because he had a terrible habit of landing on one foot.  If you watch the tape of his really bad injury, you can see all of the force of his landing went into a single leg."
Somewhere between Derrick Rose and Chauncey Billups. Heh.
"Oh, great!  Someone from the Philly front office didn't read your whole post and are now demanding:  Prime Michael Jordan, Prime Scottie Pippen, Prime Dennis Rodman, Prime Ron Harper, Prime Tony Kukoc, Phil Jackson the coach, Phil Jackson the player, Future Prime Derrick Rose, 4,173 draft picks and the Sears Tower for Ben Simmons."
"Derrick Rose will look way, way, way worse in hindsight."
"His decision making is really bad.  My favorite was the one I dubbed the “Goddamnit, Emmanuel” - so named because those were the first words out of my mouth every time it happened.  So E-man - being big, strong, and fast as he is - takes his dude off the dribble effortlessly. The first few times this happens, you think “yes, this is the tantalizing promise that had us select him 7th overall.” After getting by his man, he rumbles downhill, next…wait, there’s a next step? That was about as far as his planning went. Routinely, he would be driving into traffic, or even decide to elevate in traffic and try to figure out what he wanted to do once he was in the air. And I’m pretty sure the only person in history who was able to get away with that was Derrick Rose. So mudiay would find himself either swarmed by defenders, or airborne and swarmed by defenders. This would lead to him thinking “well, guess I gotta shoot or pass.” This led to either really poor shot attempts, horrific rim attempts where he goes flying past the stanchion, or really bad turnovers going the other way. In basically all of these scenarios it started a fast break for the other team with him out of the play.  Thus… “god*damnit* Emmanuel. Not again…”"
Derrick rose
"But he doesn’t make up for his size with his other intangibles because the way his finished in the paint is too physical for him to sustain and the way he was as a defender is even worse.   Being 5th in MVP voting doesn’t equate to being a top 10 player. For example, Julius Randle this season was 8th in MVP voting, Derrick Rose was 9th.   Do you think Derrick Rose being the 9th is the most objective assessment of Rose’s season where he was top 10?  And injuries is a part of his size. The dude is getting smashed by players way bigger than him."

"I think this one is personally hilarious but probably not the best to say in court.  “We men, you can assume”. - Derrick Rose"
"People are downvoting but whether it's true or not, it's enough for people to not like Derrick Rose and remove him from contention for least hated."
"We made one trade with Dallas — KP + THJ + Courtney Lee + Trey Burke…for…DSJ + Wesley Matthews + Deandre Jordan + Picks. DSJ is the only guy who stuck with the Knicks(Matthews and Jordan played a combined 22 games for the Knicks), though DSJ was traded for Derrick Rose last year.    Other than that trade…what is this “constantly swapping players” narrative? This off-season the Mavs signed Bullock and apparently plan to sign Ntilikina, so I understand the “Mavericks are Knicks-south” narrative…with these two moves, and the 3 remaining players from the KP trade, the Mavs might have 5 players on their active roster this season who played for the Knicks within the past few years. But the Knicks will have 0 former Mavs on their roster."
Derrick Rose. The only player I'd be happy for as he's shitting on my team.
"It very well could be. Dude has talent. He literally just turned 31, and he hit his injury streak in 2018 but that year he was putting up numbers.   This isn’t like a Derrick Rose situation. He had a really bad injury but COVID pretty much fucked up the regular season the last two seasons.   His minutes / game management also seem hella weird in Houston.   He could come back as a starter level player. But it’s a gamble and I don’t think he’s really changed his game much. His outside shooting was never reliable and his speed is obviously not the same as 20yead old version."
I know people like to shit on frank but he’s actually a nice fit next to Luka I don’t know why you are being down voted..?  He’s alright at playmaking and is good at defense   Who’s the best guard frank has played with? Tim Hardaway? Trey Burke? Courtney Lee? Derrick Rose last year? Luka is going to be all of the offense of this team and a player like frank fits the mavs future better...  the mavs need to punch up the rest of the roster  A 23 year old Ntilikina fits much better skill set and timeline wise with 22 year old Luka than 35 year old Goran Dragic....
Why did I have to scroll so far to see Derrick Rose?!?
"Currently it’s Derrick Rose, guy has gone through so much and could have been one of the greats. His grit to fight through tough times to get back to being a meaningful role player is honestly Inspirational"
https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation
"Derrick Rose, never met someone who doesn't absolutely love him"
"Tim Duncan all time. Among active players, Derrick Rose."
He will be like Derrick rose
"His game was very similar to Hardens, though obviously less efficient.   Good three point shooter who could create his own shot off the dribble. Great at getting to rim and drawing fouls and strong too so he could finish. Had good midrange game, if he was on he was unstoppable. Though he didn't give a shit about defense.   He got injured and like Derrick Rose just lost all of his explosiveness. He couldn't create his own shot off the dribble anymore which is what made him such plus scorer."
Derrick Rose    .....nvm
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose for me
"I don't have to look at it. I have a cap sheet with the whole league. I was only expanding it with an open mind to prove the point. The Kings/Knicks/Timberwolves tier of cap space teams literally are thirty million away, which isn't close or could get close.  It's absurdly far. It's a quarter of the cap. If I looked at it more, I would see the next closest is the Wizards and Rockets -- who are at the cap already. So no, there aren't more that could get close.   No one has gotten rid of $30 million in cap space in a single season and they certainly haven't done it in a cap environment like this one. It's never happened as far as I know. This summer and next aren't any comparison. It's way more limited. The Bulls just had to give up a first to dump Aminu and that's when there was way more cap room in the league.  Next season with no space and all of the cap space teams having a point guard, who in the league is taking on Derrick Rose for $14 million without a real first? And then when whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Nerlens Noel's 10 million for a first. And then whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Alec Burks for 10 million, also probably for a first. These are negative value inflated contracts that the Knicks signed so they could use in a talent for talent trade.  The Knicks are hoping for Zion or Dame, but are going to three first rounders pre-emptively for the right to bid on Zach LaVine?  And please answer why it's in the Bulls best interest to take on $29 million to facilitate a sign and trade and get a bad first when if they let Zach walk, they could have $20 million and sell that space for a first.  Even in the situation where Zach is attempting to force a sign and trade, it'd make more sense to just let him go and use the flexibility for the same type of asset while not spending the same amount of money."
We also made Derrick Rose tear his ACL the first time. You can edit your comment and add that in there.
Prime Derrick rose &gt; everyone
"I have him at 12 but he’s a top 10 talent.  I’d argue only Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are definitely better than him as a talent.  He’s in the same category as Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem as a talent but doesn’t have the legacy those guys do.    As an aside, Russell is super underrated by people claiming he’s only be a Dennis Rodman / Draymond Green type of player but he isn’t the same talent as those guys above.  Russell has the better legacy because he was like Jordan and Kobe in his mentality and played team ball instead of superstar iso ball and was an athletic freak of nature like David Robinson, Magic Johnson, prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Julius Erving, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
DERRICK ROSE CAN GO UPSTAIRS
"Walton the tip in, Bryant with the save. Final seconds, Bryant for the win, bang! https://youtu.be/rMs8bnQTE9A  Sefolosha will throw in. Here is Durant... For the win! Kevin Durant has won it at the buzzer https://youtu.be/u8VmUgJeLVQ  Rose trying to get open, finds a way. Bang! It'sover, the Bulls win at the buzzer. It's still a madhouse at the ??? as Derrick Rose nails three. https://youtu.be/wd3mxCQlve4   Lewis, gets it to LeBron. For three, for the win, yes! LeBron James at the buzzer. https://youtu.be/VkvTLOhm-TQ  Curry from way downtown. https://youtu.be/bhtpppmxf   All give me chills, the first four for over a decade now"
Derrick Rose would run circles around him lol
"I raised the question to point out that black-and-white, accolade-based logic like ""FMVP &gt; no FMVP"" is silly and misguided. I'm not equating the careers of Derrick Rose and Kawhi Leonard, and I thought that was fairly obvious."
"Derrick rose was mvp level for a year and a half   Kawhi has been a superstar only for like 4 or 5 years, but before that he won multiple DPOY awards.   That’s nothing like d rose"
Would you put Derrick Rose over Chris Paul just because he won an MVP?
"Sure he was fast, but not that fast, he was quite quick though. Bet there are guys like Baron Davis, Marbury, Steve Francis, Derrick Rose, Nate Robinson just from the Top of my head. No way was CP more athletic than any of them, maybe slightly quicker than a couple of them, but not overall more athletic."
MVP Derrick Rose  should at least get an honorable mention and young Blake Griffin
"The league in general was more frontcourt oriented in terms of where the stars were playing.  Back then, Devin Harris was the best PG in the East and his competition was not close at all.  He was competing with Chauncy Billups, Nate Robinson, Derrick Rose and Mo Williams for best PG in the East. Was quite a time.  That said, the SG pool in the East that year was strong. Dwayne Wade, Joe Johnson, Vince Carter, Ben Gordon and Ray Allen."
"In my opinion,, If c Webb made the Hall, then no doubt Derrick rose will also..best player to not make tho would be like Amare Stoudemire altho he's had a successful career overseas too so who knows"
Minnesota Timberwolves legend Derrick Rose
"Ja is gonna flame out like Derrick Rose without the same highs, just you wait"
Pretty cool to see Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah at the US Open Final
Not as good as Jordan but young Derrick Rose probably had one of the meanest layup packages I've ever seen.
Derrick Rose and Zion are both pretty great at it
"He couldn't handle that kg was going to make more money than him, as the max salaries affected steph and not kg (since kg was the real for max salaries). The jealousy was real. And, kg had a terrible first round that year (against the spurs? I don't remember exactly). They got their asses handed to them. I'm not sure that steph would have agreed that kg was a superior player; at worst, i think steph would have said that they're equals. He did not want to be on a team where he was not paid like the top player.   I think the locker room cancer stuff was overblown. Seems like his teammates liked him. But he wasn't into the rah rah shit and wouldn't let coaches abuse him verbally. He knew that he had leverage and he used it. He wasn't an angel either. I'd say that he was difficult and reluctant to make close relationships within any organization.   As someone else stated, the guy was electric. His range was limited, so you could under screens. but he had derrick rose-esque strength and driving ability. He was a great passer and knew how to play. If he were within 17 feet and had a screen to operate, you're basically conceding a bucket, one way or another.   He and kg staying together like stocktontomalone would have been great for both players.   If you want to see steph at his finest and perhaps the closest to fulfilling his potential, watch the phx-sa series. He and amare burned the spurs over and over. To me, it looked like he was going to own the position for the next few years. Then it fell apart.   Who knows why? Having hardliners like the coangelos as the owners and front office probably didn't help. Steph being difficult definitely didn't. Regardless, he was shipped to nyk in a salary dump.   Afterwards, it was the isiah mess and how his career played out from there is well documented.   Nevertheless, as kd said, if you don't think that marbury was a great player, then you don't know basketball. It's too bad that it didn't work out."
I tried this exercise. In no particular order I got:  1. Magic 2. Oscar Robertson 3. Isiah Thomas 4. CP3 5. Jason Kidd 6. Steve Nash 7. John Stockton 8. Steph Curry 9. Pistol Pete 10. Bob Cousy 11. Jerry West 12. Dennis Johnson (historically underrated)   But after that it does get hard. I struggle with defensive guys like Gary Payton or guys who had amazing primes but no longevity for their peaks like Penny Hardaway or Derrick Rose. I’m kind of a Russ hater but I’ll concede that he’s probably top 15 all time for PGs.
Derrick rose Carmelo Anthony. No chance Middleton over melo
"I think Rubio definitely is a great player not but yeah, he was overhyped in my mind. In my mind, Rubio was a 16 year old kid that by the time he was 20 would the faces of the league.  At the time, my expectations for him were pretty much what peak Derrick Rose would end up looking like but with Nash/Kidd caliber passing skills."
"1. Derrick Rose   Idk about the rest but Rose is No. 1 by far. His MVP season is like, a middle of the road Chris Paul season yet some people try to act like he had a Steph Curry peak or something."
Yeah completely blew my mind when I discovered this. I think pharmaceutical stimulant use is not really discussed because of how over shadowed it is by the far more damaging opioid crisis.   But a lot of E-Sports have quickly cracked down on it becuase it offers such a massive advantage for player's practicing. But the NBA is so athleticism-based and sports IQ-based that no one would argue an enhanced scrub could ever beat an un-enhanced all-star.   I think that's how it has been able to avoid the PED outrage even when players like Derrick Rose and George Karl have admitted to seeing it firsthand and half the 2011 Orlando Magic finals starting lineup was suspended for being caught guilty using it lol.
Cavs:  Derrick rose/Isaiah Thomas   Baron davis  Dwayne wade  Jae crowder  Shaq
"“There’s Trae Young and OH MY GOODNESS, WHAT’S DERRICK ROSE DOING IN THE IMPACT ZONE!?”"
Like in any game? That seems so low to me. I can remember like 3 Derrick Rose ones off the top of my head.
He was like a mixture of rip Hamilton and Lou Will. Derrick rose low key ruined his career lol. No fault of Rose but he lead to Gordon signing elsewhere and him falling off the face of the earth in Detroit.

"Derrick Rose was unique as hell with the a nice balance of smoothness, ultra athleticism, aggression"
Derrick Rose is probably a comparable athlete. Tbh I didn’t start following basketball until like 2007 so I really didn’t get to see AI in his prime.
Like Derrick Rose as a rookie.
Things got pretty toxic with Derrick Rose post injury.
"Yeah, and the other two MVP candidates that year had all-time seasons, I think he had a better season than some of the recent MVPs (Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook to name a couple.)"
"Absolutely incredible deal. Did it with the Clippers during Blake's rookie year that he played. $300 bucks for 10 games.   Saw the Celtics, Heat, Thunder, Magic, Nuggets, Bulls, the Lakers twice and two teams I can't even remember. Maybe Spurs, Mavs?  Lakers game winner, Big 3 Heat, Big 3 Celtics, Derrick Rose prime, KD and Westbrook, prime Dwight.   Incredible value."
Most impressive part is that’s Malik Rose…not Derrick
Cool.. at least we have something to look forward to at the playoffs.. not sure about you guys.. 4th seed and getting carried by 32 years Derrick rose.. “rebuild”
"I'm glad you asked this , I was shooting the ship the other day with my friends and I was talking about Derrick Rose winning the MVP like it happened five years ago 😭     But honestly I consider recent NBA history past 2 or 3 years, like Kevin Durant joining the Warriors feels like a lifetime ago"
"If he makes HoF, Derrick Rose is definitely gonna make it then. The youngest MVP during the golden age of point guards. Also, the 12 year span OP mentioned, DRose has comparable stats, even when viewed per 36 or per 100 possesions, and a better playoffs stats as well. That's with broken legs, imagine his healthy peak."
Kobe and Iverson surrounded by guys that can shoot? Would be a lot like modern day Luka or prime Derrick Rose.
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
Derrick rose is currently listed by bbref as having a less than 12% chance of making the hall.  That being said I personally think that all MVPs should be HoF. But I value peak over longevity/counting stats etc.  Melo is listed at like 98% and peak melo isn't good enough to be peak rose's towel boy.
"Derrick Rose, T Mac, Penny, Grant Hill"
"Team USA could be a powerhouse in soccer if the top guards in the league opted to play soccer over basketball as their main sport as a kid.  Imagine Derrick Rose, Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox or Anthony Edwards playing soccer."
I’m confused . Isn’t Derrick Rose a thing ?
Doesn’t Derrick roses brother get paid like 100K a year because rose included him as a a consultant or soemthing.
Derrick Rose with average knees
"Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, Derrick Rose, Tracy mcGrady. Like others have said T-Mac injuries were towards the end of his career. We don't know how Penny &amp; D-rose would have developed without the injuries. If both are healthy with good coaching who knows what they could've accomplished."
Tracy McGrady  Penny Hardaway   Grant Hill   Derrick Rose
holy shit this scenario had prime derrick rose too? jesus christ
"Without the 2008 Celtics we may have:  - Allen and KG never traded to the Celtics with the latter maybe directed to LA in summer, rather than Gasol mid season.  - Lebron back to back finals and probably back to back lost (maybe). Plus Kobe vs LBJ happens in the Finals.  - Kobe second three peat without Shaq(?)  - Dwight reaching the finals back to back (2009 - 2010) and been happy in Orlando, or LBJ reaching the finals 3 times in 4 years, maybe never leaving for Miami if manage to go near enough to chip.   - Derrick Rose never picked by the Bulls, but by the Celtics, never played for Tibs and never get injured because a normal minded coach wouldn't overstress him.  - from that point on (2010) the whole last 10 years of the League would be completely different. What about the draft 2009, 2010, maybe Harden to the Celtics? OKC never formed, maybe Westbrook never to OKC in 2008, maybe OKC with more fuctional stars managed to win in 2012, never seen the 73 win GSW and so on..."
"MVP, ROY, Mr Basketball, All Star, All NBA, All American, Gold Medalist. Derrick Rose getting in to the Hall is a matter of when not if. It isn't the Hall of Long Careers, it isn't the Hall of Healthiest Players, it's the Hall of Fame. He qualified when he won the MVP at 22."
"Derrick Rose did made it to the NCAA finals. To me, Grant Hill is a pretty close comp. Hill had more collegiate success, but if Rose can play a key role on a title team in the last few years of his career, that helps close that gap."
"What a lame call for a great move.  Also, Derrick Rose is absurdly clutch. I remember the game where he went like 8/30 against the warriors but it didn't matter because he hit a game winner."
if paul pierce is a hall of famer derrick rose is a hall of famer
"Derrick Rose will make it into the HOF if he stays in the league a few more years.     Even if all his major individual accolades happened his first four years with Chicago, he has averaged close to 17/3/5 over the last 8 years (367 regular season games).      Worst case scenario, he doesn't make the HOF, but he should have his jersey retired in Chicago considering they made it to 5 separate post seasons with them, advanced to the 2nd round at least twice, with one ECF appearance."
"I'm a huge T-Mac fan but I don't think he should have gotten in. It's kind of weird to think of how great Grant Hill, Derrick Rose and T Mac would have been if they didn't get hurt and also argue they had a HOF career. Is the award given for potential?"
Derrick Rose deserves it more than half of current HOFs
Kobe and probably one day Derrick Rose
"Rose is getting in, like there is so many weaker cases than the youngest MVP. there is litterally a derrick rose clause in contracts today. fat chance he is not getting in the HoF."
If your gonna quote stats sort them right   [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP\*G\*30:POSS\_PCT\*G\*30:POSS\*G\*5&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=PPP&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*G*30:POSS_PCT*G*30:POSS*G*5&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)  Hes literally below Derrick Rose
What?  He has a higher frequency than Derrick Rose and higher PPP when it comes to the PnR.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/#!?sort=POSS_PCT&amp;dir=1   Why lie?  Just admit that you have literally never watched him play a game before.
"Guys like Damian Lillard don't contribute very much to the overall basketball story of the 2010s. If the HOF acceptance criteria was actually ""who do we need to tell the story of the NBA?"", he would be left out amongst countless others while guys like Derrick Rose and Jeremy Lin do get in.  Dame won't be left out in reality, and those others like him are already in or will be in the HOF, so we know your criteria for selection isn't accurate."
I am looking at the frequency and he's literally not. He's below even derrick rose.
Lebron would be an insane CB/DM. Think Viera with even crazier physical abilities. A sweeper like Matthaus.   Derrick Rose and Westbrook will be insane strikers/wingers.   If Curry can do lob passes as accurate as his 3s then he would make an insane pivot/CM. Or just a crafty winger or traditional RM/LM that can whip a cross in from deeep.   Kawhi would be a beast of a CB. Absolute beast.   Most top tier NBA athletes would do great at wingback/fullback
"If Linsanity never occurs and Lin never starts an NBA game, the exact same teams win the championship, the same players win MVP, the league undergoes the same systemic shift of offensive style etc. There are no what-ifs to ask about Lin's career changing the landscape of professional basketball (unless the question is ""what if he were an even better player?""). Linsanity is a good story, but it isn't necessary in any way to understand the modern history of basketball. To me, the questionable case of ""basketball history museum"" is someone like Derrick Rose or Mike D'Antoni. Rose was in the discussion for best player in the world for a short time. D'Antoni's Suns teams are a precursor for modern offensive strategy, but neither have the career accomplishments (including non-NBA accomplishments) of other Hall of Famers."
"Um excuse me, but Derrick Rose technically never actually played college basketball.  So in theory you SHOULD be able to tell the story without him, because he has no stats and played no games.  /s kinda"
"""1 ECF run"" they beat a sub-500 Pacers team and the Joe Johnson Hawks.  Derrick Rose was 29/5/8 on 53% TS in those two series.  Whereas TMac was 29/7/6 on 52% TS *for his entire starting career in the playoffs* among much better opponents.  That's like legit the saddest thing to hang an argument on."
"I just don’t see at all how the have similar career trajectory. Like, at all. They were both hurt, they have that in common, but really that’s all.   Derrick Rose as we know him was pretty much done in his fourth season, that’s the season Mac hit his stride and his MIP year. From there he strung together 4 consecutive all-NBA caliber years, something D Rose has never done. I’m not saying this to diminish Derrick Rose’s accomplishments as he did a lot in those 1 1/2-2 great years he had but objectively speaking, that’s still not comparable to T-Mac. T-Mac even despite all his injuries is at least top 75 in points, Rose has little to no chance of even getting there. Stuff like this matters"
"Rose will make it, it'll be quiet, and years after he was eligible. Basically in a year when the NBA headlines are down and it's a super boring dynasty and a bunch of trash teams then it'll make big headlines ""DERRICK ROSE YOUNGEST EVER MVP ADMITTED TO BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME"""
"They’re not comparable, but it’s not that hard to argue that Linsanity had a greater impact than anything about Derrick Rose. People who don’t know shit about the NBA still know about Linsanity.       Regardless, neither of them should really be in the hall to me, but given how easy it is to make it, I’m guessing Rose will."
"I think so, yeah. I’m never going to be talking to my kids about watching Derrick Rose because he wasn’t around long enough."
2004/05. Moved abroad. Cousin had NBA games on his PC. We played together. I didn't know anything. He picked Lakers. And I picked Denver lol.   Watched for awhile. Stopped around 2009.  Then 2010 Derrick rose got me back into the nba with his crazy highlight reeels.   2011 enjoyed Kevin Durant a lot. And been interested since then.
"Derrick Rose, man was absolutely electric"
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
Two easy ones for me. What would have been for Derrick Rose and Paul George if not for their injury. LeBron is no doubt super dominate and one of the best of all time. But I don’t think he’s making 8 straight finals outta the east if neither of these two guys get injured..
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."
Derrick Rose was a great stopper and direction changer. His knees objected though.
For some players similar to him in the future? Possibly.  But they’ll most likely also take into account the Derrick Rose rule or how to appropriately compensate young players via the CBA.
"&gt;Can Derrick Rose make it to HOF?  Yes, it is possible, but if his career ended today, then no. His peak was short with the MVP season also being his only All-NBA selection to go with 3 ASG nods. It would boost his chances tremendously to both transition into something akin to the second half of Vince Carter's career and also end up being a role player on a title team. However, that's a lot that needs to go Rose's way and so he's very unlikely to ever make the HOF."
"Mid-2000s Miami Heat.   We won a title in 2006. Yay! Good, right? Right? No.  In 2007, we got swept by the Bulls in the first round. Ben Gordon decided to play like Kobe Bryant and killed us.   In 2008, we won like 15 games. We were just in the Derrick Rose sweepstakes.  After that, we were first round fodder for a few years until LeBron joined us and saved us lmao"
"Are  you assuming injuries aren't a factor? Because the 2012 Bulls with a Derrick Rose that doesn't get hurt certainly may have interrupted Miami's quest for a title. They made the ECF the previous year with Keith Bogans at SG in 2011, and subbed him out for Rip Hamilton the next year."
Well…  He makes up a good chunk of their winning history.  The main criticism should be the Bulls were never able to reach that level of success until Derrick Rose.  There isn’t really much to show post MJ.  I’m sure before you have the Chicago Packers and Zephyrs.
"(born in 87) MJ, then Kobe. When Kobe was in the twilight of his career, I had to find my next favorite player to root for. It wasn't going to be Derrick Rose, but I did pay attention to Jimmy's defense. For context, I enjoyed seeing the defense and strength from Ron Artest on the Rockets (as well as TMac's offense that rivaled Kobe's). Derrick gets injured, and Jimmy takes over. It was at the moment I came to terms that I was rooting for a basketball player born in 89. Black Bulls jersey, highlighter green Wolves jersey, custom black 76ers all star jersey, and now a Miami vice wave jersey. I'm hoping I don't have to buy anymore jerseys"

Derrick Rose winning MVP over Dwight
"I remember him as the guy who chose to take all those intentional fouls in the national title game, missed a bunch of free throws, and cost Memphis/Derrick Rose that game against Kansas"
- Marc Gasol and DPOY   - Derrick Rose 2011 MVP  - Russ 2017 MVP  - Both of Karl Malone’s MVP’s
Derrick Rose..
Not at all. We got Randle after shipping off Lees &amp; THJ stupid contracts. Best case scenario for you is you got Bullock. We flipped DSJ for Derrick Rose so not even close.
"I can't rank the other 4, but I'm pretty sure Morant has the highest ceiling of the 5. Particularly because he's the closest thing to young Derrick Rose I've seen in a while and Rose's ascension was fast and furious."
"depends entirely on how you weigh how good someone actually is vs their career and accomplishments. god forbid, but if luka went through what derrick rose went through and came back as a role player for the rest of his career, where would we rank him? that's kind of how i view these, where would he be ranked if he retired or was injured tomorrow. but he has had a better season than some players ranked in the top 75 have ever had, probably, so mark isn't wrong in that sense."
Partially due to Derrick Rose having like 50 injuries. And he was on the team until 2016.
"just hope he can keep those knees safe, reminds me of when Derrick Rose was just flying through the air"
"I went over and stood near the tunnel when fans were all funneling out the exits at Barclays Center as Derrick Rose finished his post game on-court interview. I had a card for him to sign, which he did as he walked down the tunnel signing things for people who waited after the game. Have it on display in my house!"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Derrick Rose. His story is the greatest in the league, and even though I am not a Knicks fan, I really hope that team can get a ring."
Steph Curry is half a year older than Derrick Rose
PG: Derrick Rose - 2  SG: Donovan Mitchell - 4  SF: THT - 1  PF: AD - 5  C: Jusuf Nurkic - 3
Steph Curry is older than Derrick Rose
"I wasn't around for Magic save for his 1996 return. I hadn't immigrated to the USA then, even.   Kobe's achilles was rough, but considering he had already a long career it didn't phase me as much as a young athlete getting cut down by injury in their prime like Derrick Rose or Tracy Mcgrady."
"That Bulls Cetlics series is what first came to mind too. This was the defending champion Celtics against the up and coming Bulls. At the time, there were so many historical implications, characters and storylines connecting to the past, and all the while we had a singular talent in Derrick Rose shining so brightly before us in his very first playoffs and we all felt that he would very well be the one connecting us to the future.   That series between the Bulls and the Celtics felt like a promise of many many more to come, but sadly they never came."
Cavs legend Derrick Rose
"Guys like Pippen and Grant weren't shit, and also doesn't change the fact that the list you wrote is pretty disingenuous. You put players like Cavs era Derrick Rose on there, did you even watch him play?"
"If it's Steph curry talk about how his ""gravity"" lets other players get open looks.   Yell ""moving screen"" every jazz pick and roll  Mention that luka doncic has elite deceleration whenever he has the ball  Talk about how sick Rudy Gay, Derrick Rose, DeAndre Jordan used to be  Reminisce about Greg Oden. He would've been bill Russell come again.   Say the officiating is ruining the game.   If randle or siakam drive to the rim, be ready with a beyblade comment Incase they make a spin move.  Go nuts when Caruso does anything  I have passed on all knowledge I have young nephew, it is up to you to carry the flame"
When Derrick Rose was wrapping up with the balls he drove me insane. He kept having his brother do all this double speak in public and I was lost on what was going on.   I don't dislike him or anything but I hated that situation because it was just frustrating. They had a good run going and I know it would be tough to get another one going.

Derrick rose
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
"Yeah but the only good player he played with before that was antoine walker when he got a good squad they were a championship level team for years and that was when he was past his prime Melo although he never played with a team like the 08 Celtics did play with guys like Marcus Camby, Allen Iverson, Tyson Chandler, Amare Stoudamire, Jeremy Lin, JR Smith, Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick Rose, Russel Westbrook and Paul George, Kenyon Martin and Chauncy Billups"
Derrick Rose vs The Cavs in the playoffs
"In his first season with the Bulls, they won 62  games and lost in the ECF to the Heat.   The next season, Derrick Rose tore his ACL in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs (It'd probably be a lot better if not for that). Without Rose for the next two seasons, he lead the Bulls to the 5th and 4th seeds in the East. The first season they lost to the Heat in the 2nd round and the next lost to the 5th seed Wizards in the first round. In 2015, the Bulls lost in the second round to the Cavs (LeBron again)...  Derrick Rose won the MVP when he was 22 in that 2011 ECF season btw. Just to illustrate how important he would have been to any playoff success Thibs would have had in Chicago, but he was injured for nearly half of his tenure.   Thibs took the Timberwolves to the playoffs for the first time in over a decade in just his second season there. They lost in the first round as the 8th seed (surprisingly made the playoffs) to the first seed Rockets.  He took the Knicks to the playoffs for the first time since 2013  Thibs has been a head coach since 2010, and Doc has been a head coach since 1999"
Nobody picked him to be MVP. He was not a first pick. Unless you consider Ben Simmons and Derrick Rose serious contenders for MVP this last season? Getting a tiny amount of non-first or second place votes means absolutely nothing.
"Giannis won the MVP at age 24 and again at age 25.  When Dwight was 24, prime Lebron James won MVP.  I don't think that Giannis would have won his MVP going against that.  At age 25 Dwight finished second in MVP voting to Derrick Rose largely because the Bulls had a better record than the Magic.   Prime Giannis is probably a better player than prime Dwight, but the 2 MVPs isn't the proof for me."
Current Derrick Rose would fit better than Ben. It wont make our team better but it would turn Joel into a monster.
I remember hearing this during the Derrick Rose trial stuff
"Before the 2011 lockout, David Stern straight up threatened the players union. The verbatim quote:  ***I know where the bodies are buried in the NBA, because I put some of them there.***  The players of course went on strike and then proceeded to get bent over the barrel, ceding ground on virtually everything other than the addition of the Derrick Rose Rule which impacts, like, 3 guys a year.  Contrast that with Adam Silver, who is soft and doesn't have the political strength to lay down the law."
My man Derrick rose would like a word
"The Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah led Bulls had a real shot of it wasn’t for injuries. What those teams were able to do WITHOUT their best players was amazing. Thibs really had them grooving on defense, but unfortunately playing that hard every single night seriously shortens your window at a championship."
As a Bulls fan I will always follow Derrick Rose and root him on.
"2021 Jeff Teague?   Perhaps not. But Teague is still playing great.   Mo Williams had a great shooting season with the Cavs when he made the ASG: over .400 from the arc, both seasons he was with LeBron. But he also got a lot more open shots and set up well having played alongside LeBron.   Teague is certainly not shooting that well, but he was 38% this year, which is solid, but he's also usually the one setting the plays up when he's on the court, so he's gotta create his own shots when he's on the court.  Mo had the benefit of playoff off ball with LeBron, so that lead to a lot of open shots, or at least more space.   But it's hard going by stats. The per36 numbers is what you'd need to use given the difference in minutes, and in that case, Mo would have the edge in scoring but Teague would have the edge in playmaking.   Teague's also playing on a team that got another great point guard, which Mo didn't have to compete with.  But numbers don't tell the entire story.  You gotta use the eye test.   So, 2021 Teague, I'll concede that 08/09 was better. It's wrong to compare his whole career as oppose to his current level of play; however, I don't feel like Teague's current level of play is that far off from what he showed he was able to do when he managed an All-Star selection, he just wasn't competing with Jrue for minutes back then.   I don't feel like Teague's decline in minutes is due to a decline in level of play so much as it is getting on to teams that had plans that didn't really take advantage of what he had to offer and playing on teams with other great point guards (Kemba in Boston, Derrick Rose in Minny).   He got a lot of game still.   But I concede that 08/09 was better than 20/21 Teague.   Reddit on my good friend!"
"russell westbrook was a totally different animal in 2016-17, he is not at all that same player and the fact that you think he is just because he’s still putting up triple doubles is laughable. obviously he hasn’t fallen as far as derrick rose but the drop has still been significant."
"Wtf kinda stupid comparison is that? Lol Derrick Rose won MVP in 2011 and had terrible injuries after. Russel Westbrook won in 2017 and one of the key reasons he won was for averaging a triple double. He’s done that in 4 of the last 5 seasons. Good try, though"
by that logic derrick rose an MVP caliber player

Derrick Rose not gonna be in the hall of fame
"He's right.  Honestly, I've felt like the rookie scale contracts and the RFA limitations after have been as unneeded and unfair as the NCAA not paying their athletes but making absurd amounts of money off of them.  The teams have all the leverage.  For a player like Zion, he's clearly worth more than the rookie-scale contract already.  The same is true for Doncic.  Why are they going to be paid probably less than a third of their market value for 4 years just because they're rookies?  Why do they have to be handcuffed for a fifth year at a fraction of their value just to hit the FA market in their sixth year?  Why does the Derrick Rose exception even need to exist?  2 year contracts with modified Gilbert Arenas provisions should just be the norm.  You have a salary cap system for a reason.  The cap and market should be able to determine the value of a player and not some arbitrary rookie-scale value.  For a rebuilding team, that gives you 2 years to convince the player to sign an extension.  But, even if they refuse the extension and you match on an RFA deal, at least they aren't underpaid and can be traded straight up for a lot of returning contract value.  If they really want out, they can also hit the market sooner by taking a third year qualifying offer.  If your team needs more than 3 years to rebuild after drafting a generational talent, then maybe you shouldn't tank so hard that your team can't recover from being so bad.  Maybe then teams will be less incentivized to just be bad and more incentivized to be strategically bad.  It took OKC 2 seasons to turn it around after drafting Durant.  It took Cleveland 2 seasons to turn it around after drafting LeBron.  It took the Hawks 2 seasons seasons to turn it around after drafting Trae Young.  It took Dallas 1 season to turn it around after drafting Doncic.  People need to stop giving poorly managed teams excuses for sucking as they waste the careers of star players.  As viewers, we should want more young and promising teams.  I want to like teams like the Pelicans but the hopelessness is just torture."
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
"Derrick Rose also called the 2016 Knicks the next super team to challenge the Warriors. Sometimes players are right on these things, sometimes not lol"
"He’s had two season-ending injuries in the last three years. Focus up on his rehab, maybe. You don’t see Derrick Rose talking shit when his knees turned to glass."
Yeah he's closer to Dearron Fox than peak Derrick Rose.  Grizz fans seem to draw power point lines to him... just not there IMO.
"Same type of people that clowned Derrick Rose for saying ""why can't I be MVP"" right before his 3rd year.  3 guesses which season that ended up being."
"It’s not a definite that he won’t get in, but Derrick Rose comes to mind since injuries really fucked up his trajectory.  He’s the youngest MVP but because of the injuries coming so soon his career doesn’t necessarily reflect a HOF player.  If he had a ring before the injuries this wouldn’t be a question at all."
"I love how you use 7th in MVP voting as some kind of justification to be considered the best player in the league. You realize LeBron was 9th in MVP voting as a rookie too right? And he was younger and on a worse team. I’m not even going to use that, since it’s pointless to look at backend MVP voting.   7th or 9th in MVP voting doesn’t put you in the conversation for the best player in the league. Dame, Julius Randle, and Derrick Rose were 7-9th last year. You literally get like 10 voters voting for you and that’s how you get 7th. Look at the difference between 1st and 7th and their total points.  Anyways anytime MJ is in his prime, there was no discussion who the best player in the league was."
I'm surprised no one has said Derrick Rose
"I think the only correct answer to this question is Derrick Rose, although his comeback was/is quite beautiful"
"Derrick rose for sure. He was the youngest mvp, imagine the seasons that would follow that without any injuries…"
"I've seen a few players come back to the team when they weren't ready and get seriously injured again. Isaiah Thomas, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose.   I don't blame him for listening to his own body instead of the doctor whos main interest is the team not the patient.    I don't think he wanted out of SA until after pop said that and his teammates didn't stick up for him."
"This is literally the most brain dead argument ever, Siakam was on a team with Kyle Lowry and prime Kawhi where he could pick and choose his spots playing with two other allstar teammates lol. Julius  Randles second and third best players were 32 year old Derrick Rose and 21 year old RJ Barrett   Literally such a brain-dead argument."
"I wish klay the best he is one of my favorite players to watch, but the timeline and setbacks feels unprecedented for a comeback that the warriors need. My hope is he can be a Derrick rose and find a lesser but still impactful role  I dont know what kind of leap Mitchell can make. His playoff performance was about as good as you can ask of him. They were the first seed so where can he go from here? Be an all nba defender?"
"ben stans? We see teams give up on players anytime, its considered a 'business move'. Legends like Olajuwon who delivered titles are told to kick rocks in canada for wnating to play more, The son of chicago Derrick rose is told its just a business and get him boo'd bc he couldnt get his health right.    Loyalty is a one way thing in the nba except a few rare anomolaies. Don't forget MJ himself demanded help, Kobe demanded a trade, timmy was this close to leaving san antonio, Lebron left for help.    I definitley think its troubling that he can't improve his shot.  I also see that hes young and elite at everything else and having a young star committed to defense isn't 'hollywood' that shows hes committed to trying to get W's bc it starts on Defense, but yea his career will never take it where it could be if he doesnt fix his shot.  I just don't get why you belive he doesn't work at it.  his is so obviously mental stunt, which one way or another needs to be worked at, but its just like giannis said, he went and got a sports pscychologist and that helped a guy who choked on free throws a series earlier his 17/18 or something in the highest stakes.  So yea, I'm not writing off a 25 year old kid and at the same time I realize if he doesnt get his shot or show improvement over this mental hunt, that will definitely take him down a noche from a star but still on the right team and coach a guy who does every single thing else well while being athletically elite and will get physical on defense is a hell of an asset.  I'm not going to nail the coffin on a 25 year old ."
"I never saw anything for anyone to make the comparison. Derrick Rose maybe, but not him."
Derrick Rose
"Prime Derrick Rose, when he was on the court, he just went all out, and then he flew too close to the sun."
"I simply can't put a 5-time All-Star above any MVP, except for Derrick Rose and mayyybe Nikola Jokic (but he just needs a couple more elite seasons under his belt). Also, Drexler was flat-out a better two-way player than Miller. He was the Jordan Light and deservingly a much more accomplished player with accolades. Mikan was the OG Center, Cowens was one of the most dominant players in the 70s. Cousy-Havlicek-Pettit are historical legends. Isiah Thomas is ten times the player Reggie is, willing his Bad Boys to the Finals more than twice and winning the damn FMVP. Kidd is more superior two-way player and has simply won more awards - including the title - on all levels."
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren’t “superstars” but everyone I’ve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
"Yeah, Derrick Rose, Dame and AD over Jokic make much more sense. Get your clown a\*\* out of here."
"Derrick Rose is leagues away from all these guys, great peak but even the best peaks need some longevity"
Derrick Rose is the only MVP winner not on the list.
"Old like Iroh, emo like Zuko. Does this make Derrick rose the avatar?"
No dwight?? no derrick rose? man i wish brandon roy would of stayed healthy
"Landing can be changed, Derrick Rose changed his landing"
"That's what makes him great, he's athletic,  explosive , aggressive,  we can't all be smoothe shooters...  &gt;I feel like he may end up like Derrick Rose.  An mvp? A well respected player? A human highlight reel?"
Dame over Derrick Rose and Jokic is a shame. Sure Dame’s had a longer prime but leaving off MVPs is ridiculous.
Derrick Rose is a massive snub. Sure his prime was short but he still won MVP and was the best non Lebron James player on Earth for that season.
"If you’re going to have Dame, then Derrick Rose deserves it too. Youngest MVP. 62 win season."
Dame but no Derrick Rose?
Derrick Rose was Knicks' points leader in their playoff series.
Derrick Rose is not making the Top 75 - I'm pretty confident of that.
"Derrick Rose's MVP level career ended after 3-4 seasons. And so far, Jokic has one more selection in All NBA first team, and one more selection in All NBA second team. MVP titles 1:1, All star selections 3:3, All NBA 1st team 2:1 in favour of Jokic, All NBA 2nd team 1:0 in favour of Jokic. Edit: And it's only because his top level part of career lasted so short that D Rose isn't among top 75."
"Toronto when Durant went down in the finals. Bill Walton, Portland Trail Blazers, 1978 NBA Playoffs. Kyrie Irving/Kevin Love, 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers. Bill Russell, Boston Celtics, 1958. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks, 2003 NBA Playoffs. Derrick Rose, 2012 Chicago Bulls.   Injuries happen. Bucks were still a top team in the league and have arguably been the best team in the league, record wise, the last 3 years. Cry more."
"The only MVP I think won't make it is Derrick Rose but Jokic could I think. When you become an MVP in this talented era, you probably (?) deserve it."
"Love seein Ja fly around like this with more bounce than ever, just hope he takes care of himself and doesnt end up like Derrick Rose"
Derrick rose doing Derrick rose things
My only regret with Derrick Rose is that he didn't come to New York sooner.
"Derrick Rose game-winner against the Lakers, after the lockout"
[i LOVE DERRICK ROSE](https://youtu.be/cxJeY24tikc)
"Lol I just realized, this is prime Derrick Rose"
"Had Derrick Rose played in the fourth quarter, it would've been over so much earlier. Instead, cardiac kemba gave us all heart attacks down the line."
"locks...   Giannis, Durant, Kobe, Wade, Nowitzki, Nash, Lebron, Kidd, Curry, Duncan, KG, AI, CP3, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Bob McAdoo, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard  decent chance but might not make it  Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony, Klay Thompson, Adrien Dantley, Tmac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kyle Lowry, Amare Stoudemire, Dominique Wilkins, Draymond Green   No shot but should get considered  Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Yao Ming, Ron Artest, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Joe Dumars, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, Derrick Rose  Should just fall off the list  Pete Maravich, Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens, Hal Greer, George Gervin, Jerry Lucas, Robert Parrish, Nate Thurmond, Tiny Archibald"
So is Derrick rose
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
"Kyrie gonna make it to the top 5 NBA What if.   (Bill Walton, Derrick Rose, Grant Hill, Yao Ming are my other 4.)  That’s bout it."
Listen to any interview with any Knicks player or coach about Rose. You never hear anything but praise for Derrick in his work ethic as well as mentoring young guys and willingness to play any role for the team whether he starts or sacrifices minutes or touches for someone else
No other team can sub in Derrick Rose for Kemba Walker. Only the Knicks are allowed to do that.
"Man the fucking Knicks just had so much extra that they didn’t have last season.  Kemba ain’t what he used to be, but he’s still an upgrade over Elfrid Payton.  Fournier is definitely a welcomed second ball handler and shot maker.  Obi really growing into his 6th-7th man role  Mitch fucking Robinson  Oh and our old faithfuls Julius Randle and Derrick fucking Rose.   Can I get a Yeerrrrr"
Shout out Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose is built for this
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
"Derrick ""Derrick Rose"" Rose"
DERRICK ROSE EXISTS THIBS
PUT IN DERRICK ROSE HOLY SHIT THIBS
MVP Derrick Rose type season book it
"Ok Derrick rose is a good one too. Somebody else mentioned VC. But Blake has completely changed his role on the team to a screen setting hustle guy and defensive big whereas Derrick rose is still a scoring guard, just not as good as his peak."
&gt; best pivot from star to role player  Is Derrick rose chopped liver to you
"Nikola Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Demar Derozan, Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball  Vs.   Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng, Derrick Rose.   I think it’d be a close game but I’d give the edge to the 11/12 Bulls. They were the first overall seed for a reason."
"Pelicans ad was like that, I think he stopped the more he got injured. A lot of injury prone players end up becoming like that because they can’t play as aggressive every possession or there’s a good chance they’re gonna injure themselves. Think Derrick rose, Paul George, etc."
Derrick Rose
"Refer to Derrick ""Youngest MVP of alltime"" Rose. As well"
"My favourite Tony Parker quote from way back [paraphrasing]  Interviewer: When they talk about best point guards in the league, does it bother you that your name doesn't come up along with Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Chris Paul etc?  Parker: How many rings do they have?"
"Big Westbrook fan, but Jesus, this is not the team for him.  I’m no coach, but I can just tell he’s told to be second option AT BEST. Move him to the second squad like Chuck said.  It’s his scoring and quickness that used to draw doubles, which would leave someone open for an assist.  It’s not just a new team, completely different role, but I think he will settle in…. to leading the bench players. Leaving him out there with Bron and AD was a crime tonight. Let him be Derrick Rose."
"Jordan ""Derrick Rose"" Poole"

"It is the max the people *he got drafted with* are getting. He isn't an all pro so he can't get the Luka, but he can get the Trae.    He isn't trying to keep up with Derrick Rose. He is trying to keep up with the people who entered the league when he did."
"I may be wrong, but isn't the ""Luka"" max just the Derrick Rose max? (that the NBA added around the time he won MVP)"
"Oh God, Derrick Rose was really out there making a lot of unfortunate quotes that summer.  I'm pretty sure what he was actually hearing was people being very critical and saying ""Man, Melo, DRose, Brandon Jennings, Courtney Lee, Joakim Noah? That team might actually compete with the Warriors, if it was 2012 lol wtf are the Knicks doing"" and Rose was just like ""Yeah man, us and the Warriors are the contenders"""
"I get what you mean, and I live Derrick Rose,but he is absolutely not a hall of famer, the fact that people even consider it shows how easy it is to get in."
Reminds me of Derrick Rose saying before the 2016-2017 season that everyone was talking about the Knicks and the Warriors as super teams.
E.g. Derrick Rose pre injury
I’d say Derrick rose is the ultimate barometer for a HOF candidate. The perfect edge case. Whether or not he gets in will set a precedent we haven’t seen yet
is derrick rose a hall of famer?
"I guess that's where we disagree, I don't think I consider Ayton a top 30 or even 40 player.  To start, I see center as less impactful than a guard or wing who can run an offense and have the ball in their hands.  Even among centers I think it's debatable whether if Ayton is a top 6-7 center. Jokic, Embiid and Gobert are clearly better.  AD and Giannis are borderline centers, I'll split the difference and say that's like 1 center there.  KAT, Capela, Bam are probably the closest comps, but I think I'd have all of them above Ayton for now (though Ayton could easily pass any of them this year, to be fair).  You also gotta consider that the top 30 player list has a lot to do with when players signed their last contract (since the salary cap is rising like crazy) and whether they are eligible for the 30% or 35% max (supermax / Derrick Rose rule / 10 years of experience).  The way the system works, a 4th year players entering RFA are underpaid unless they are good enough to be all-NBA / an All Star / an MVP."
"Derrick rose? Youngest MVP in history, and then..."
"He’s the hawks 4th best wing, y’all should send us a few first round picks and Derrick rose for him"
"a max contract is 25%/30%/35% of the cap in the first year of the contract if you've completed 1-6/7-9/10-∞ years of service (when you're starting on the max scale; if you're already above that percentage because your salary growth outpaced cap growth, then you get 105% of your previous year, or maybe 108% if bird rights).  a supermax jumps you into the next higher percentage bracket relative to your years of service if you meet certain conditions and earn certain honors.  before it was presumably just about 30% -&gt; 35%, but derrick rose won mvp so there's 25% -&gt; 30%, too.  on this latter point, it can be between 25% and 30%, too.  ben simmons got jumped up to 28% by earning all-nba 3rd team in the first year of his max extension.  his contract specified that he'd get 29% if he got 2nd team and 30% if he got 1st."
"I'm probably going to hell but ""Shanananananana knees knees"" from Welcome to the Jungle when Derrick Rose shoots a free throw."
"&gt;rosters are built entirely around him, more so than any player probably ever  Those Cleveland teams were not ""built around LeBron"". They were built cheaply/poorly because Dan Snyder is a garbage owner and LeBron is so great and versatile he was able cover how absurdly flawed they were and add over 40 wins worth of value.  When a team is built ""around a player"" that means the team is designed to use that players strengths and hide their weaknesses. You build teams around guys like Dirk, Nash, or Shaq because their best attributes are stellar, but they aren't amazing at everything so you need to design the team to specifically cover their flaws.  Prime LeBron is one of the most versatile players of all time. He can be effective guarding 1 through 5, playmaking, scoring off the ball, scoring in the post, iso scoring, hitting the game winning 3, and just about anything else you could need a basketball player to do.   Prime LeBron doesn't have flaws that need to be covered, he covers flaws in the team because he is so versatile. He has effectively guarded prime Derrick Rose, Giannis, and Marcus Camby. If you need a stop prime LeBron has got you, regardless of who the best opposing player is. He can also play every role offensively.   Those Cleveland teams weren't built around LeBron, they were built cheaply/poorly with LeBron covering their flaws. That first Cleveland team was so washed it was insane that they ever made the playoffs at all. The player who played the second most minutes (after James) on the 17/18 team was JR (what's the score) Smith. To act like these teams were custom built specifically for LeBron to succeed is insane. They didn't fail after LeBron left because they were built for some specific system focused around LeBron, they failed because they were absolute garbage."
"I think it's about the glamor associated with the franchise more than anything else.   Multiple players say New Orleans is their favorite city, but they would play for the Knicks before they would sign with the Pelicans, despite both having histories of recent mismanagement.   Players will often chose the Lakers over Clippers, with some notable exceptions, despite the Clippers being better run the past few years.   So the question becomes why are these glamor franchises? Why do the Knicks still have shine from championships in the 1960s, but the Bulls are relatively overlooked by big names.  I think it in part comes down to how NBA media acts, compared to other places like the NFL. There's no real call in other sports that players should head to franchise XYZ. Even if they say things like, ""the Jets ruin QBs,""  they don't follow it by saying ""Zach Wilson needs to demand a trade to the Saints or Patriots.""  There are some exceptions, like the Cowboys and Jets have a few loud fans in the media world, but it is not as common in NFL coverage and honestly makes the Jets less desirable becausr of how much ESPN hosts shit on their favorite team.  But that is commonNBA where big names in media call for young stars to demand trades to their favorite teams, which are often the Knicks and Lakers.  The teams players chose are, generally speaking, the ones closest to winning or the ones with the most fans in big NBA media jobs.   The pressure is higher on those franchises, but the rewards for success are much greater. Julius Randle got 8th in MVP votes last year, while Derrick Rose got 9th. They don't get that if they have the exact same season on Atlanta, a team with the exact same record.  If the NBA wants change they probably need to put pressure on their league partners in the media to stop covering the NBA so biasedly or as a soap opera, where more time is spent on potential player movement than on the actual games."

Derrick Rose: Gets out of bed every morning
My personal top 5 (excluding Magic and MJ):  1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Derrick Rose  5. Rajon Rondo
"Oh he is definitely on something, but I'm pretty sure the vast majority of the league is too. I'm pretty sure Derrick Rose said it was like an 8 problem on a 10 scale, and that was nearly a decade ago. It can only be more widespread now.  IMO, it's a null issue when comparing the 2. If anything, it's a point in Brons favor since it brings the rest of the competition up as well."
If Derrick Rose isn’t a Hall of Fame player now then there is nothing he’s going to do to change that aside from turning back the clock and getting 25-7 for the next 5 years on a contender.
Derrick Rose nods in approval
"Derrick Rose. Played most of his time with Noah, Bogans/Brewer, Loul Deng, and Carlos Boozer"
"Yes, I understand that. I understood from the start. I'm trying to get it through both of y'all heads that there sadly never was, is or ever will be such a thing as a ***prime Derrick Rose***. That never happened. That is not happening now. That will never happen. That is why you can't argue prime Russ &gt; prime Rose but you can confidently and correctly say prime Russ &gt; peak Rose."
Derrick rose should be a HOF lock and I don’t care what anybody says
"Grant Hill Career: 16.7/6/4.1/1.2/.6 on 48/31/77 shooting with a three year peak of 20.9/8.8/7/1.6/.6 (on worse shooting numbers than his career) while playing much better defense.   Derrick Rose Career: 18.5/3.3/5.5/.8/.3 on 46/31/83 shooting with a three year peak of 22.7/3.8/7.1/.9/.5 on essentially the same shooting numbers.  All of Rose's per game stats are bound to keep dropping, as he's never been the healthiest and is already 32, but his shooting numbers may go up, at least for threes.  Hill also has his college accolades, including two NCAA chips and an ACC player of the year, while being recognized as one of Duke's greatest players of all time, which count towards the HoF."
"My point of view:  Blake Griffin turned in one of the best individual Pistons seasons in team history, sustained a knee injury, then played on that bad knee during a first round playoff series where the team was already clearly overmatched.   Then he underwent knee surgery and returned pre-maturely the following season, at which point he tried to tough his way through before shutting it all down again, leading to a second surgery.   *Then*, following 360 consecutive days on the injured list (five days shy of a calendar year), Griffin returned to a team that'd been hallowed out with the unspoken-but-fully-understood intent of tanking its way through the shortened 2020-21 campaign. He and Derrick Rose were asked to mentor the young guns, they obliged.   Griffin felt good in training camp, but he professed to his legs dying after said camp. Considering he was nearly 32 years old and coming off of two operations and a year off of basketball, I'm inclined to believe him. As such, he played like a guy who was 32 and coming off of two knee surgeries who hadn't played in a year.   The tanking Pistons team, knowing they were tanking, figured it might be time to do something mutually beneficial. Blake wasn't a part of their future and didn't have much trade value even when he was All-NBA Third Team (injury history, massive salary). A buyout was always going to be the most sensible option for these two, so that's what happened.   Griffin then had a month and a half between his last Pistons game and first Nets game to replenish and re-form. He joined Brooklyn in a role that saw him play a fraction of what he was playing in Detroit while shouldering virtually none of the load. His success made pretty great sense.   I've long had a feeling that the folks most upset about Griffin's departure from Detroit are those who know very little about Griffin's time in Detroit."
"Yes but it wasn't popular or accepted the way it is now.  Derrick Rose took it to another level and won MVP doing it. That validated it.  The league was not like it is now with Lillard, Kyrie, Curry, Westbrook and all these guys before 2009. He started the shift.  I'm not saying those guys modeled their games after him necessarily, I'm saying he changed the perception on them."
"But imagine that progression on a 27 year old, never seriously injured, Derrick Rose."
Derrick rose
Derrick Rose leads his team to the finals and finally gets a ring. He then goes back to Chicago and proceeds to do the same thing. Haha jk
"the best team a Derrick Rose squad beat in the playoffs were the 5th seed, 44-38 Hawks in 2011"
Jokic is Giannis's Derrick Rose to Lebron James
Derrick rose never reached his prime and he was great but damn he gets overrated. I love drose wish he never got injured but Westbrook avg a 30 point triple double and lillard can pull up from the logo putting 30. Lillard&gt; Westbrook&gt; rose.
"Why is everyone saying cut Rose?  ""Rules are simple, these players are your number 1 option and you are building a team around their abilities."" .... ""injury concerns are removed.""  Derrick Rose is the only player who's led a team to 60+ wins, not Lillard not Westbrook. His shot was improving every year and the dude had Westbrook-tier athleticism with better range and less usage. And without those ACL/meniscus tears? Skys the limit.  Start Rose, Bench Westbrook, Cut Lillard."
"Derrick rose will be a hall of famer due to that mvp alone.  First ballot no, but will make it eventually as a third.   The hall of fame isn't just for nba, but for outside as well. He has some decent international success and impact to the game. There's alot of people we've never heard of make it lol"
Watching Derrick Rose play against any point guard that was hyped to being better than him were the absolute best games to watch. He destroyed anyone remotely his equal his MVP season.
"In comparison to Marc Gasol, Derrick Rose also has other accolades outside of the NBA. He's a 2x World Championship Gold Medalist.   Rose also was an NCAA Finalist and 2x State Champion in high school."
If Derrick Rose stayed healthy would would’ve been one of the most legendary players ever. I’m not even fronting. Youngest MVP ever and u best believe if he stayed healthy he’s winning more. I’ve never seen a player like him and I don’t think we ever will again
"Ja reminds me of Derrick Rose with his playstyle, so I will always pick him."
King's calls on the classic mvp Derrick rose highlights are legendary.
1966 Cazzie Russell     1972 LaRue Martin     1981 Mark Aguire     2008 Derrick Rose     2012 Anthony Davis
We missed out on the Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler duo too. That would have given the LeBron Cavs a proper rival in the East.

A la Derrick rose. That was painful.
I cannot believe I’m unironically getting Derrick Rose vibes.
man averaged a very efficient 19.4/5/4 in the playoffs and people really think he's just some role player now lol  Derrick Rose is the best 6th man in the league
"Not really. Since the lottery, Ewing took the Knicks to multiple conference finals and 2 finals, David Robinson took the Spurs to a conference finals and won 50 games like every year, Shaq took the Magic to the finals, Iverson took the Sixers to the finals, Duncan got the Spurs 5 rings, Lebron took the Cavs to the finals, Dwight took the Magic to the finals, Rose took the Bulls to multiple conference finals. Those are all franchise altering players. Then you’ve also got great players like Derrick Coleman, Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Glenn Robinson, Elton Brand, Yao Ming, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and KAT.   If you want to be relevant, then getting the number one pick is an easy way to do that. Far easier than trying to develop project players late in the draft like Giannis or getting big time free agents that only 2 franchises can actually get reliably"
When did Derrick Rose turn white?
"Derrick Rose and Ja Morant are the closest comparisons. AI was a once in a generation talent. Pound for pound he's the greatest scorer ever. He was incredibly strong, fast, and athletic. If the NBA didn't work out he would have become a NFL quarterback. He could score on anyone from anywhere on the court and had so many damn moves in his arsenal. He was basically a 6'0 Kobe and even Kobe said he and the whole league were fortunate that AI was not 6'5."
"Derrick Rose was on the trajectory to win multiple MVPs before he got hurt and is a decent comparison. Either of those players in their prime would be MVP contenders today. So yeah, I think so. The only reason we don't see players like that in the league today is because they're an incredibly rare talent. But I'm sure we'll see that again."
"This is probably a troll thread but whatever  LeBron also ""knew what he was doing"" when he signed off on getting Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade.  At this point I feel he's just playing to pass Kareem, he's already brought a championship to LA. Wasn't he one of the stronger voices for the NBA bubble back then? He knows he's almost done, prolonging his stay so he can pass Kareem is the number one goal now. Westbrook and Lillard give him the best chance for that.   Signing Horton-Tucker over Caruso also helps this point"
Curry isnt as skilled as nash cp3 lebron or AI.   I chose derrick rose since his athletecism would be the best in the league. With nobody taller than him to protect the rim hes virtually a free layup or dunk every possesion.
"Cp3, Nash, Derrick rose, AI, Lebron"
&gt; why shouldn’t they keep on playing and scoring?  Ask Derrick Rose
How is this getting downvoted? It's certainly true (not even particularly close) and I'm a Bulls fan who likes Derrick Rose. Aldridge is 60th in win shares and PER all time. Rose isn't even in the top 250 for the former.
Derrick Rose reincarnated
"Break it harder if LeBron wins it.  (The next down the line to break it even harder is Derrick Rose, and he's doing well this season so we'll see.)"
"He's just a really cool player man, no one has ever claimed he is as good as ""kyrie irving, chris paul, or even derrick rose.""    Also you have zero obligation to be a fan of his.  If you aren't, then you aren't.  I think he has some of the sickest highlights in the NBA and seems like a cool dude, and obviously he plays for my fav team (and is my favorite player) so I'm a massive fan.  I've also always been a sucker for players with a high ""highlight-to-production"" ratio.  Dudes like JR Smith who might not score 30 every night but still is obviously an insanely talented player with insane highlights and capable of popping off any night.  Difference between JR and Jamal is that both are that, but Jamal clearly has a bit more of a ""killer instinct,"" leadership and focus on the game.   But if you watch his highlights and his bubble performance and that's not enough to make you a fan, then it's fine just not being a fan.  This is an odd post"
"Derrick Rose would be an above average starting point guard if he could play a few more minutes per game.  Right now, he's getting enough rest to stay completely fresh, and gets to attack bench units as a 6th man.  All that combined means he's absolutely *tearing* it up."

"Others in the top 10 of Raptor War!    Derrick rose, Harrison Barnes, Jalen Bronson, Royce O'Neal, FVF and Jarret Allen."
Derrick Rose has the worst set of accolades out of any MVP lol he is the first one that’s not gonna get in based on his career as it stands
"I doubt it's wild at all, you'd just be used to it. I've played ball my whole life, was never on any official teams but knew a lot of dudes in HS/college and played pickup/scrimmaged with a handful of D1 teams. Obviously nowhere near the skill level of NBA players but size-wise it's similar. No 7 footers or anything but you'd get the typical bigs/wings anywhere from 6'6""-6'11"" (6'11"" being the tallest dude I've ever played with).  I'm Steph's size (6'3"" if I played in the NBA lol), you just come to get used to the fact basketball players are really tall. At least for me the main realization was that I had to be a bit more careful with my shot selection when playing with those guys as opposed to your average pickup crew (definitely got put on my ass a couple times driving to the rim before I realized I wasn't Derrick Rose ). Also IDK if Steph would feel huge out in public, I mean a dude his size is definitely kind of tall but not that uncommon. Walking out in public on average you'd probably see at least a handful of people as tall as him or taller."
Derrick Rose has really pulled off an impressive career transition.
I have to say it. That Derrick rose game winning 3 off the backboard was not on purpose. Dude missed like 3 feet wide and accidently got it in then posed like he was hard as fuck lol.
Not to be that guy but 2011 Derrick Rose has words for you
Nikola “Derrick Rose” Jokic
"who wore it better, derrick rose or mustafa?"
I hated the trade at first  simply because of that 1st stint. I hated that version of Derrick rose  Now I feel silly

Now I'm just imagining Derrick Rose literally floating down the court in his newly attained state of perfect Zen.
That guy loves Derrick Rose is the context.

"People think Derrick Rose won't make the Hall of Fame, and those people don't watch basketball."
"He can easily give 20+/game off the bench. If he just keeps his 3pt % above 40% on 10 or so attempts and doesn't have too many turnovers, I think he's right in the running. Off the top of my head only Clarkson or Jingles (if he's off the bench this season, can't remember) from the Jazz would have that same level of impact. Shit Derrick Rose was a finalist last season, there aren't many top-tier 6th men in the league right now."
Shout out to Derrick Rose man
Honest question…is Derrick Rose better than Westbrook at this point in their careers?
I love Derrick Rose
"The fact that we have Derrick Rose coming off the bench for us is crazy, our bench unit is going to carry us for a lot of the season, it's a great luxury to have"
"He hardly ever makes a bad decision, I was on old Derrick rose fan but I’ve followed him after the bulls and he’s always produced like this."
Derrick rose being this good with this many injury’s is just mind boggling to me
Derrick Rose was +31. Imagine if we still had Dennis Smith.
"Derrick ROSE up. Jeez what a stud, he seems to know exactly what to do at literally every moment of the game what in the world"
"Real talk, Derrick Rose coming back to the knicks has been one of the most important moves they have been in the last 5 years"
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE
"idk this becomes a real theseus' ship discussion.   from what little research i've done, the only human cells that live beyond ten years are skeletal muscle cells, intestinal cells and heart muscle cells  now if all of those cells were brand new ten years ago, the 2021 derrick rose is (i'm totally guessing here) maybe like 30% of the 2011 derrick rose, at most?  now obviously not all of those cells would've been new in 2011, but also some of those cells have a longer lifespan than ten years. heart cells for instance have an average lifespan of around like 40 years. skeletal muscle cells and intestinal cells have a lifespan of around fifteen years  so all in all i'd say he's maybe 13% of the 2011 derrick rose"
The Knicks got Derrick Rose for fucking Dennis Smith Jr lol
2%. I think highly of 2011 Derrick Rose.
"+/- is such a misleading stat in single games. For example, Derrick Rose only has +19"
Holy crap Derrick Rose
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE!
Holy crap Derrick Rose
"Provided Derrick Rose comes off the court at some point, Bucks should be able to hold this lead."
"Last one I remember is Derrick Rose. However,  he came into a team with a bunch of young players who were former lotto picks and were maturing. That 2009 playoff series got me back into nba bball"
"My concern is that with Ja’s build and playing style, his career follows the Derrick Rose path, explosive superstar but gets derailed by injuries."

"i love the idea of a white middle manager sitting through a meeting thinking *jeff's new cornrolls look good. i should tell him.are they called cornrolls? shit what if they're cornrows? rolls, rows, rose? like derrick rose? kiss from a rose? seal is black. but roses don't grow near corn. roads do though. cornroads!* ""hey jeff! nice cornroads!"""
"What about thibs then as a first year coach for 21 year old derrick rose at the time for a team that just made the playoffs the past 2 seasons prior?? I dont think a first year coach is the issue then, based on what youre saying, you just need a coach that can set a tone and a culture and be adapatable."
"yes, i did see that video where derrick rose finds out he’s traded while standing in front of his mansion and next to his luxury car  he’s free to retire in stay in chicago  i also find it funny how D Rose getting treated like this is unconscionable, but somebody like Robert Covington or Jae Crowder just has to deal with it bc they are role players and should just be happy to have a spot"
Ja has more potential and is INFINITELY MORE EFFICIENT and less prone to turning the ball over. Westbrook has Ja beat in athleticism and speed but Ja has a larger bag of tricks up his sleeves. Better all around player. He's in the ball park of CP3 at this point.  I said it before he's literally Steve Nash + Derrick Rose combined.
"I watch like every sixers game, but I pretty much only watch sixers games, and I feel like I have a flawed view on a lot of players because of this haha. Like, based purely on what I've seen live against the Sixers, Demar and Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose are NBA 1st team but Donovan Mitchell and KAT ain't shit lol"
shades of pre-injury Derrick Rose
"Derrick Rose and John Wall are/were big on candy too, IIRC. I seem to remember Rose having a Skittles machine in his house."
"I feel like everyone who says DeMarcus Cousins ""can't help a team, he lost his athleticism, he doesn't fit the modern NBA, he's a liability dwfensively, etc"" are the same people that wrote off Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwight Howard. The notion that it's over for DeMarcus Cousins is just media hype that people buy into. He's still a very talented player that could help a team. Denver is one of them"
"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus’ Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
Derrick Rose also had a candy addiction lol
"Butler is counted as a forward, not a guard (see last years all-star voting). Lowry's counting stats will probably be lower than Herro (impact is super high, but thats not what gets voted in). Holiday has played 2 games, legit 43 minutes.  Derrick rose is playing nowhere close to Herro and is averaging 21 minutes a game.  I think its too early to comment on the rest because it will depend on record and counting stats/we need to see at least 20 games before making real predictions. But based off RIGHT NOW...I dont see why he can't make it. I get thinking he will fall off by the 20 game marker though. But I believe."
"He needs to be a top 4 guard in the East to secure a spot. Although teams can have up to 6 guards total depending on the coach's reserves picks.  Trae, Harden, Kemba, Lowry, Butler, LaVine, Lonzo, Derrick Rose, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, and Bradley Beal all have cases over him."

There are people were legitimately arguing Derrick Rose was better then Russ. Meanwhile Rose isn’t even getting consistent minutes off the bench
With Derrick Rose the Knicks are +66
Yes i literally said it helps  Bad genetics = doesn't matter the weight   Was Derrick Rose heavy? Were all the injury prone players heavy? No
Same age and draft as Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose. It's weird
"100% agreed , why wouldn't he be used as a Lou Williams or Derrick Rose type of guard"
"Derrick Rose should be hof. There are worse players than him that are in it. MVP is a huge accomplishment, and at that age? Also, with his story perseverance it is no question to me."
Not saying that he's anywhere near HOF - but Derrick Rose will surely have *some* legacy and longevity in 10 years
"Yes the hall of fame is getting inducted for your overall impact on the game, not what you did on directly in the nba   Vlade divac,  toni kukoc made it and those names of people we brush off every year cause we never heard of em make it too.   Derrick rose, has been a part of USA basketball, impact in Chicago ball, first revolutionary high flying point guard that we as fan all compare newer guys to. Then his accomplishments he had.  Jokic would make it just for the Meer fact of being the greatest passing big man as a second round pick on top of it. If he just did outside work helping the game grow in Europe then he would too.  Not first ballot but would eventually be voted by the committee"
"Derrick Rose is probably the first, unfortunately"
"Man I always loved sitting down after a hard day of work and watching the Celtics, been watching them for 15 years now since I was a kid.   Now it’s just fucking shit and I have to turn the games off. For fucks sake, I like the KNICKS more than the celtics year. I used to swear at Carmelo Anthony and make fun of fucking Aaron Afflalo and now I wish my team had the guts that randle and Derrick rose show on the court every fucking night.   This celtics team is an embarrassment to all past Celtics teams and what the team is supposed to stand for."
"&gt;!Yep. You’re also missing Joe Smith, Derrick Rose, and Andrew Bogut.!&lt;"
Shaq  Joe Smith  Dwight  Derrick Rose  Kyrie  AD
Answer: LeBron has played with &gt;!8!&lt; number 1 overall picks.  They are:  &gt;!Shaquille O’Neal (1992)!&lt; &gt;!Joe Smith (1995)!&lt; &gt;!Dwight Howard (2004)!&lt; &gt;!Andrew Bogut (2005)!&lt; &gt;!Greg Oden (2007)!&lt; &gt;!Derrick Rose (2008)!&lt; &gt;!Kyrie Irving (2011)!&lt; &gt;!Anthony Davis (2012)!&lt;
"Pistons Isiah Thomas… the champion. He’s clearly better than both.   Celtics Isaiah Thomas never reached close to dame let alone Derrick Rose prime level. That Isiah Thomas never was a serious MVP candidate… he was well behind harden, Westbrook, and kawhi in 2017.   Funny how you have to convince yourself I’m some imbecile for being impressed with Rose instead of agreeing to disagree. Rose was good dude."
Celtics Isaiah Thomas is better than Derrick Rose and Damian Lillard? ok. it's clear your basketball knowledge is severely lacking so i'm gonna dip
We’ll just have to agree to disagree. Isaiah Thomas is clearly better than both so idk where that point is going.   Derrick Rose 2 year prime doesn’t make him untouchable… but it does make him better than dame.   Dame and Rose have the same amount of 1st team all NBAs and conference finals appearances… rose also has an MVP. Dame didn’t really use his longevity to accomplish more than rose
"ok, so? that level of play wasn't sustained. Isaiah Thomas was an MVP candidate for one year. He didn't keep that excellence up for 8. Derrick Rose's 2 year prime doesn't make him untouchable. He got hurt and he fell off. It happens.     Dame has sustained excellence for 6+ years straight already, picking up more accolades, while doing it with better numbers. Rose's prime was like 2 years. Dame's been going strong for 6+. There's no comparison about who the better player is lol it's clearly Lillard. You can have all the nostalgia you want to, but the numbers do not lie. Only thing that Rose had over Lillard is athleticism and a better team and neither of those lasted too long. You can only talk about Rose's 2 year ""prime"" because that's all he has in his favor. Careers are more than the peak. It's the whole thing."
"Derrick rose’s 2 prime years were amazing though. Damian Lillard has never reached that height. Dame has never rivaled lebron as best player in the game or had his team as a serious contender.   Just cause rose got hurt, I’m not just gonna forget that I witnessed his incredible talent.   Some human beings get hurt, some get sick, some die early etc… that’s life.   Jimi Hendrix died within 3 years of his first album. Doesn’t mean a guitarist who was active for 40 years was better than him."
"Derrick Rose’s “prime” was 2 years lol that doesn’t make a career. Dame has been a top player in this league for plenty of years now. His collective accolades and level of play have long surpassed the 3 years of good play from Derrick Rose. It’s not 2012 anymore, it’s time to take the tinted lenses off and be honest.     Dame is better than Rose in every major statistical category. I don’t know why you said “just” longevity because longevity matters lol the best ability is availability"
DLO reminds me of old Derrick Rose on the Wolves... but doesn't have as many scoring streaks.
"MVPs isn't really a great measure of how good a specific player was. Steve Nash won two MVPs, he wasn't better than Dwyane Wade, same goes for Derrick Rose not being better than Anthony Davis.  KD has played with Harden, Westbrook, Curry, Klay and Draymond while LeBron played with Wade, Bosh, AD, Kyrie, Love and Westbrook, hardly a big difference."

[I think they’re referring to this](https://www.espn.com/espnw/voices/story/_/id/17877518/the-unacceptable-glee-followed-derrick-rose-verdict)
"Not my favorite team, but as a Bulls fans, seeing Derrick Rose drop 50 points as a Timberwolf like a year or two removed from contemplating retirement warned the cockles of my heart."
"Yeah no disrespect but that’s just too much of a narrow-minded view of athleticism. The draft combine data from MJ’s era isn’t even available, but that’s besides the point. Saying I can’t prove that MJ had better coordination, explosiveness/power or second jump ability than Pat Connaughton because it’s not measured doesn’t make sense to me. It’s not that it’s unmeasurable, there’s just no need to measure everything in basketball like they do in track and field.  When Zion was coming into the league, scouts &amp; analysts raved about his elite second jump ability. Were these claims baseless because Zion didn’t complete a test to measure it?  Derrick Rose never did any of the draft combine tests (sprint, lane agility, vert), so we can’t say he was faster or more explosive than Pat Connaughton? Because it wasn’t measured?"
The first overall picks from 2003 to 2009 actually have a higher participation rate this season (4 out of 7 or 57% have played):  PLAYING:  Lebron '03  Dwight Howard '04  Derrick Rose '08  Black Griffin '09   NOT PLAYING:  Andrew Bogut '05  Andrea Bargnani '06  Greg Oden '07
Derrick Rose. The mythos around him and the way he'll be talked about in the future is gonna make him sound better than he actually was
"Because his career has been much more valuable than Derrick rose's, rose doesn't belong anywhere near that list"
I wonder why he is in top 75 but not derrick rose.
Derrick “Manu Ginobili” Rose
"At the very least, can I convince anyone that Gobert had a top 10 regular season last year? I'd have personally put his season in the #6-8 range. A number of the league's best players missed 15+ games in an already shortened season, including Harden, KD, LeBron, AD, Embiid, and Kawhi.  It's pretty safe to say that Jokic, Curry, and Giannis had incredible seasons. Embiid finished second in MVP voting despite missing 21 games, but he was tremendous when he was active so I can understand it. Then MVP voting had Doncic, Lillard, and CP3, followed by Julius Randle, Derrick Rose, then finally Gobert in tenth.  Most all-in-one metrics last year had Gobert as a top 10 player, and in numerous cases, as the #2 player behind Jokic. WS, LEBRON, EPM, RAPTOR all suggest he was one of the best in the league, thanks in part to a league-leading +/-."
Incorrect.  That's not how facts work. Giannis just takes more shots at the rim. He is the most relentless player at attacking the rim since prime Derrick Rose so he's going to get more fouls called.
"This post manages to massively undervalue all 3 players somehow. . .  Melo is currently a 6th man that could get minutes on any NBA team, and Derrick Rose is one of the 3 best players on the Knicks. Neither of those guys are anywhere close to being out of the league, and that would be a good end of a career for a guard like Westbrook. No human being is putting up 25/10/10 for eternity."
Is Derrick Rose the Knicks best player?
"Draymond suspension, Bogut injury, and hobbled Curry in 2016.  2013 was an inside job where Popovich conceded the championship for the good of the league by benching Tim Duncan on the most important play of the series when all they needed to do was grab a rebound.  2012, Derrick Rose tore his ACL in the first game of the playoffs when the Bulls were the best team in the league. Then LeBron got to play a college team in the finals."
"Once a friend won some bulls tickets giveaway on the radio. So he invited me to come with him to the game. Tip off was 7:30 local, the arena opens to the public at 6, we were allowed in at 5pm (to do some meet and greets with Benny the bull and other photo ops). When we got there two things were happening. One - the cheerleaders were wrapping up a practice session of some sort. Second derrick rose was working on his jumper.  We were given explicit directions to not talk or bother rose or any other player that came out to warm up. Noah came out briefly to practice some hook shots as well. But yea this is happening in that 5 o'clock hour, before the arena opens to the public. The cheerleaders were done early in the hour, and opposing players started coming out near the bottom of the hour.  So star players do put in time... They just do it at different times.... Likely due to other priorities including team meetings and treatment"
Derrick Rose is a starting-caliber point guard. Pretty sure the only reason he’s been coming off the bench the last few years is durability
Lol Derrick Rose is better than Westbrook right now
Derrick Rose is legitimately the best player on the Knicks. Watch them and tell me otherwise.
"I think his [Powerade ad](https://youtu.be/2HKlKT4ui0Q) (one of my all-time favorites) was prophetic after all.  It has Tupac narrating *The Rose That Grew from Concrete*.  It ends with the line *Don’t ask me why. Ask me how.*  I’d love for Derrick to share his how one day, because he ended up having to face a lot more adversity than one would expect, and he came out on top of it triumphantly."
Derrick Rose is actually effective and could have a bigger role if he wanted though
I love Derrick Rose
"That is very bold, even top 15 is a stretch.  I would say that Derrick Rose is the best backup PG in the league right now, but his 12/3/3 over 15 games is not enough to put him above any of Steph, Dame, Luka, Trae, CP3, Jrue, Lowry, Conley, Ja, Ball, other Ball, or Fox.  No top 10 PG, or top 10 in any role for that matter, is coming off the bench."
"That’s a good thread. Some of my favourites:  &gt;Or we can just play the waiting game instead of throwing 20 mil a year at a recently injured guard whose ceiling is what, fourth best player on a championship team, maybe?   &gt;I would much rather have Smart than Lavine.  Not even close.  &gt;DO NOT MATCH THAT OFFER, CHICAGO. You can find another damned one-dimensional shooting guard for less money than that. I like watching Zach play, he's fast and can jump really high. He also can't defend, or pass, or otherwise show any kind of on-court awareness. Let him go.  &gt;For the love of god please do not match this Garpax  &gt;Why the fuck would you offer that and how fucking stupid do you have to be to match it? Zach is a decent player but a $20 mil a year player? That's one of those classic awful contracts.  &gt;Bulls match this and you no longer have to worry about them. Lavine isn't good and there isn't a single metric that says otherwise.  &gt;I'd let him walk. He's not that good and chances are slim he suddenly becomes a much smarter player... or his knees magically get better. Dude is 23 and seems to have issues with his knees and he's a guy living of his athleticism. Worst case scenario he's a less talented Derrick Rose who will be hampered by injuries. He hasn't played 82 games in two seasons combined lately… Also, his numbers just aren't outstanding in any way. I don't know what you expect to win with him being paid 20 mil on your roster. To me, he's a 10 mil SG, getting you athleticism off the bench for some 20 minutes or so. Could hype guys up with some nasty dunk and shit, but 20 mil? No way, not if you wanna win."
"Huge mistake trading Derrick Rose and Wade. They would have been way better than Clarkson, Hill, Hood in the playoffs."
"all I'm gonna say is that if we lose this game, everyone on the Knicks (minus Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson) will need to require more than just security to leave the arena safely, it'll become more than a bloodbath here 🤣"
"The answer will always be Derrick Rose, unless the league goes through some very bad period devoid of talent."
Derrick Rose really changed his reputation quickly after that trade. Super impressive. I love watching him and the Knicks’ bench unit turn games until the starters fuck it up
"The fact he returned heavier, I think that breaks your argument because it seems Davis is not trying to reach a better conditioning. If Derrick Rose and Grant Hill could somehow find a way to balance their bodies to not get injured all the time, then anyone can really, there's no excuses. I am no expert, but I think Davis should attempt the complete inverse, to cut off all the extra weight and reach that Giannis/KAJ threshold of a 7 footer who has no weight on his legs, if it worked before with similar body types, why not attempt that?"
Fun fact: Derrick Rose has the 2nd best (behind Trae) PER of all PGs in the East.   I’m going to be bold and say DRose is a Top 10 PG in the league right now.
what about Derrick Rose? or did he not ever make all nba 1st team.
"I just don't get how WB keeps tricking people into playing with him. He single-handedly wrecks teams, both from a statistical perspective but also from a locker-room perspective. Like, how do the other players not give him shit for playing like a dumbass? I kinda get the impression that everyone that plays with him is scared to talk shit about him.      [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Russell%20Westbrook&amp;season=2022](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Russell%20Westbrook&amp;season=2022)     I will say that he is improving. He's been at Rank #247 of 250, this past week he moved up to #231.      Also, how is there not more talk about the resurgence of Derrick Rose. He is legit a top 5 NBA player right now"
"Russ needs to retire and just do his fucken fashion and activism philanthropy. Been feelin for a while like he has zero basketball passion anymore, otherwise he’d have figured out how to change his game/be more accommodating. Look at what a former mvp can be with a team in someone like Derrick Rose. Look how he has changed his game and found new ways to succeed and lead. Russ is still on his same old shit. Running out of tears to shed for this man"

"Man, after 2 years of flirting with the idea of trading for Derrick Rose I was really hoping the Lakers made an attempt for him this off-season. That “injury prone/age” narrative is lazy and it would’ve cost them far less to acquire him while getting a ton of production that they aren’t getting outside of LeBron right now."
Derrick Rose never went to Memphis
"Jordan ""Derrick Rose"" Poole"
Derrick Rose was the first name I thought of.
Prime Derrick Rose for sure.
John Wall and Eric Bledsoe started a movement.   You can also credit Derrick Rose at Memphis
Derrick Rose on the bulls
Bill Walton. Derrick Rose. Grant Hill. Tracy Mcgrady. Yao Ming. Greg Oden.
Derrick Rose one hurts a lot for me because as a kid he was one my favorite players and I was watching that game were he got hurt and I was so sad and disappointed
"Derrick Rose is the main player that comes to mind, he still did a lot and won an mvp award and is still a pretty good player but I think he would of definitely won championships"
"It was something like:  OUT:  Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert  IN:  Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr,  Rodney Hood, George Hill,"
Lebron first game wearing a heat jersey in Cleveland..  Kevin durant with the warriors verse okc. Kyrie verse the Celtics.  Ray Allen verse the Celtics in a heat jersey.    Dwight with the lakers verse the magic.   DeAndre Jordan verse the mavericks after that one year in free agency.   Oh and derrick rose like lst week verse the bulls getting mvp chants. And fans happy every time he got fouls

"People have been calling out the flaws with PER for a long time. Jokic is also leading the NBA most defensive advanced stats like RAPTOR and EPM. You can argue Jokic is a much improved defender and not a liability anymore. However, Jokic and Derrick Rose are dominating defensive advanced stats which says more the stats."
He's bad at landing and he gives me Derrick Rose flashbacks. I feel like there have been a lot of close calls and awkward landings and he's only been in the league for two years and some change.
Derrick Rose esque
"You didn't deserve downvotes (hate that about this sub), but Kemba and Russell are just TURRIBLE analytically.  They suck, they're team killers.    Derrick Rose, VanVleet, and Dejounte Murray are better candidates than those two."
"He blew his ACL I think the same day as Derrick Rose that's what happened. He was never the same defensively after that. Earlier that month during the regular season, Shumpert [did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgdr2xr2qVM) to the MVP, who shot 31% from the field on 26 attempts with 8 turnovers.  He had so much promise on the defensive end. Shame about what happened."
The guy who initially replied to me's answer was Derrick Rose. This thread got bombarded with pretty mindless anti-Harden rhetoric very early on.
I love how the Knicks want to consider themselves a good team then play Alec burks and Derrick rose more than kemba and fournier
"Fun fact, THT went to the same high school as Derrick Rose"

"I assume his mental health concerns are convenient excuse for him to not play while still getting a paycheck, and that they'll alleviate once he gets traded. I think it is a fair assumption to make seeing how he only declared he had them after his holdout failed.   Derrick Rose was traded for a 2nd rounder last year. If if the Sixers need a point guard, they can get one at the deadline without giving Simmons."
Where's the love for Derrick Rose. His on/off splits are absurdly good
"You know, you shouldn't get extra points for MVP because of your age. Seems like if Derrick Rose was 27 at the time, you don't think he'd deserve MVP."
"That's what Hawks fans thought. The team has fixed Bradley Beal, Clint Capela and made Derrick Rose the best player on the Knicks. Westbrook is going to go 4-6 from 3 just watch it."
Derrick Rose
"&gt; I feel like him nearly flunking out of college was a red flag before he even got into the nba. Wasn’t he disqualified from the Wooden award because of his low GPA?  Eh, Derrick Rose cheated on the ACTs and he was fine in the NBA, work ethic-wise. Trevor Ariza left UCLA because he was flunking out, and there's been no issues with his NBA work ethic either.   It's more of a Simmons-specific thing than an ""Anyone who gets bad grades in freshman year must be a lazy slacker"" thing.   Not everyone wants to go to college, and anytime you're basically forced to do something it takes all the fun out of it. Every week on reddit there's a post about ""I had to read (insert book) in school and I hated it, but now that I re-read it on my own, I love it."""
Just take it at face value - not like a god stat thats all or nothing (“if it doesn’t accurately predict the best players in order it’s trash.”)  It’s not crazy to think that Derrick Rose is the most valuable bench player against what he’s facing (opposing benches)
Wait you actually think Derrick Rose is making the HoF ?
Derrick Rose in 2012 when he was in Washington
"It happens within the fans too. Totally understandable to shit on Karl Malone as a person, but many can\`t get past that and can't recognize what a great player he was. I've seen in on this sub constantly with players like Derrick Rose, Terrance Davis, Malik Beasley and more recently Enes Kanter."
"We should look at it differently tbh. I read into the case last year and it was bad. The transcript where he got caught in a lie by detectives was bad. So was her blood on his clothes. And her injury report. And the fact that she didn't need money because her family was rich. And Phil Jackson saying the accusation wasn't all that surprising. And the implication of Kobe's ""apology"". It was way less ambiguous than I thought. There's no way to know for sure but it very likely happened. Problem is Kobe was an all time great whereas she was just some clout chasing slut who exposed herself to months of a smear campaign and death threats all so that she could turn down a chance at settlement money and ask for a public apology instead.   But it's not just Kobe. Derrick Rose basically admitting what he did in court gets overshadowed by the fact that the girl waited two years to sue. Fans don't care."
Pre injury Derrick Rose was good but not amazing.
Below Derrick Rose
Knicks for Derrick Rose.
"AD, Lillard &amp; to a lesser degree Paul Pierce should not have been on that list over Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard were major snubs.  Parker, Ginobili, Pau and maybe even Derrick Rose deserved a spot. Rose obviously had major injury issued but he and Jokic are the only MVPs not on the list. Injuries didn't keep Walton off; same should have been said about Rose.  As for OPs question: AD is and will always be a second option. Everyone knows who he is at this point and do not expect more out of him...because they're not going to get it."
We all love Derrick Rose.
"AD is a 10 year veteran (and only 28!) with ridiculous career statistics and an NBA championship and people keep circlejerking that he should not be in t75 all time. He's a career 24-10 and nearly 4 stocks. There are not many in that company, he's in the company of guys like David Robinson...  It's the stupidest circlejerk on reddit, with the exception of the ones asking if derrick rose or jeremy lin are better than westbrook."
"Good question. Some that come to mind are: James Harden @ Houston, Blake Griffin @ Clippers, Mike Conley @ Grizz, Derrick Rose @ Bulls, Kevin Love @ Twolves"
"I have a genuine question, my opinion was that AD hasn't done enough to be considered a Hall of Famer, outside of College he has just won 1 championship but the top 75 list seems he is guaranteed HOFr.   If that's the case why do question Derrick Rose HoF status?   Considering he led the bulls to the Eastern Conference Finals and made the playoffs for his first 4 seasons straight, won MVP and Rookie and of the year. I understand lack of all nba and all stars appearances hurt him but he was going against the best guards to have played. AD has benefited from the lack of great big men"
Derrick Rose and Jokic were the only two.  Both I can understand but I also agree with the argument of Jokic over AD for career trajectory reasons.
I love Giannis.  Giannis loves Derrick Rose.  I even more love Giannis.
"Derrick Rose is tied with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant for 3rd most WAR at 2.5 lol.        But if you watch the Knicks, you know why. His [on-off](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01/on-off/2022) is bananas. +34 net rating for the Knicks when he's on the court vs off."

"I know it's not exactly what you're asking, but God I wish we could have seen the 2011 Bulls in a timeline where Derrick Rose stayed healthy."
Derrick rose is the goat
Two words: DERRICK ROSE
Am I worried that 33yo Derrick Rose is our best player? yes  Am I hyped that 33yo Derrick Rose is our best player? Also yes
"Ah yeah, I was reading it wrong, that was division position, not conference :) Figured I'd go look for real  2019 2 vs 7 won in 7 2019 2 vs 3 lost in 7  2020 3 vs 6 won in 7 2020 3 vs 2 won in 7 2020 3 vs 1 lost in 5  2021 3 vs 6 won in 6 2021 3 vs 2 lost in 4  I didn't even realize before the research that that he actually has a losing career playoff record, though I would assume that's true of just about everyone who doesn't have a couple titles.  That 2020 win vs the Clips was impressive,  but I had forgotten losing the 3-2 lead vs Portland. I do remember a lot of chatter about the Nuggets not being ""real"", but I still only see that one win that was really unexpected and getting spanked twice.  I dunno why I keep going with this stuff because I don't actually think you're wrong. I just feel so weird about enshrining people in the Hall after three good seasons, no matter how good. Remember Joekim Noah was all NBA first team center one year! I guess the question comes down to though...if he did have a horrid injury and tailed off...say Demarcus Cousins...do we put him in? Is Boogie going? How about Derrick Rose? I would day no, but you may disagree. And there's the chance that he just doesn't keep it up of course.   I do kind of wonder about one thing though-the playmaker argument is strong. But I do wonder if that's actually a plus? The man is virtually the worst defensive Center in the league. He's helped by the fact that there is exactly one competent lost scorer lol...but if you're getting playmaking at center...you can't really get that defensive anchor from another position, while clearly playmaking can come from multiple positions. I suppose we shall see how it works out, hopefully they are fully healthy this year and get a shot to really out it together."
There's also Derrick Rose who we both love so kind of hard to stoke a rivalry.
"You are so concerned with how the players look, instead of how they play. We can blame Zion’s injuries on his weight, but only to a certain extent. Derrick Rose also had lower body injuries and he is the furthest thing from fat. The common thread between Zion and Rose is their explosiveness. Try to imagine skinny Zion. He would be a much less effective player. I fear that Zion will always be criticized for being fat even when he is back to his normal weight. The NBA needs a big body like Zion to make other teams pay for trotting out a lineup of 5 skinny dudes who can’t play post defense against a thick boy. Zion should be celebrated, not mocked, for being sturdy."
"It was a genuinely weird cheer/boo hybrid noise I don't know if I've ever heard before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0ZyqXe6siQ  The dumbasses who booed likely did it because of some comments he made while injured that lead some to question his commitment to basketball (of course, assholes in local media don't help this) and that whole 2015-16 season was just a tumultuous disaster all around.  Anyways, I think it's fair grounds to demand the banned for life from the stadium Dolan treatment to anyone caught booing Derrick Rose."
"It’s not okay to boo Derrick Rose the basketball player but I have no qualms with people booing Derrick Rose the person. After all, we men. You can assume."
&gt; Derrick Rose  Not surprising given how the Knicks' bench unit has the best net rating of any 5-man group in the league while their starters have one of the worst.
Wait what? Chicago boo’d Derrick fkin Rose? Lame
"It's stupid, but at the time they weren't sure it would go up, and ownership was afraid of getting the repeater tax.  They also kind of got screwed by KD getting the Derrick Rose rule applied to his contract even though the contract was signed before the rule existed, so they were much closer to the luxury line than they had planned on being.  Of course, they could also have used their amnesty on Perkins and not worried about it. The whole Harden trade really comes down to OKC over thinking things."
"1. Post the stats dude. Simply saying he’s blowing them out of the water doesn’t tell me anything. You’re also straight up wrong with some of them. For example Steph is slightly ahead of Jokic in [Offensive RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/). That was literally the first one I looked up. I’m sure some of the other ones are wrong too.   2. The fact that Derrick Rose is second in RAPTOR should tell you all you need to know about using advanced stats as the be all end all when evaluating players.  Genuinely asking - do you even know what half of the stats you listed mean? As in, do you know the goal that each stat is trying to accomplish? Or do you just see that your player leads in a few of them and use it as a talking point?"
Chicago did the same to Derrick Rose and that shit really bothered me. How tf are you going to boo Derrick.
"You used them to argue that Jokic is the best in the nba, should be expected that you have a basic understanding of each right? I can say ""did you know that Jokic is only one spot ahead of Derrick Rose in Total RAPTOR?""   By listing stats without context you can really bring down/up a player so yeah you should probably show somewhere that you understand why these stats make him great"
"Since nobody answered, it’s 538’s all encompassing metric. It’s basically part box score numbers (ala PER) and part on/off splits. According to RAPTOR, the best players in the league so far this year are Jokic, Derrick Rose, Giannis, Curry, Butler, Iguodala, Brunson, PG13, Bjelica, and John Collins."
"check out [this article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21540075/derrick-rose-away-cleveland-cavaliers-evaluating-future-nba) which essentially says that he was considering stepping away from the game. this was also the same season he was traded to the jazz and then immediately waived, which doesn't really happen to players not on the bubble  i never said he was washed (and he wasn't, really; injuries played a big part) but there was definitely a time where his future in the nba was in doubt"
You don't get points for what could have been if you didn't get injured  That's like saying Derrick Rose is the GOAT PG
The idea that 2011 Derrick Rose was as good as the Damian Lillard of the last season or two is comical. One of the most overrated players of all time.
"Jordan isn't even one of the top 5 Bulls let alone top top 2 players in NBA history.Maybe he is at best a top 10 bull  Derrick Rose is 1,Alex Caruso is 2,Jimmy Butler is 3,White Mamba is 4 and Reggie""Coach Fuller"" Theus is 5"
"&gt; Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook  Oh I missed when Luka won the MVP"
"There is no way in hell Luka is better than MVP Derrick Rose. This is a dude that could go 1 v 5 and score in clutch time. Youngest player ever to win MVP at 22 years old. Its funny that Rose was always considered a bad 3 pt shooter but when the game on on the line and the Bulls needed points Rose would consistently get buckets, even 3s. Its sad the amount of disrespect Rose gets on this place, clearly most are too young and never saw him play at his prime."
And Derrick Rose is hooping.
"2nd best by RAPTOR, T-4th using WAR.        He's shooting lights out, plays good defense, and runs the offense extremely well and makes good decisions. I think it's pretty accurate. If WAR is like it is in baseball, e.g. ""How many wins is Derrick Rose worth vs a replacement-level player?"" then 2.2 honestly seems about right. Every time he comes in w the bench the Knicks outscore their opponents like crazy. Then the starters come in and stink it up."
"[RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) thinks Derrick Rose is the 4th-best player in the league so far because of this, LOL"
"This also led to one of my favorite teams of all time: the D Wade, Derrick Rose, IT Cavs. Truly one of LeBron's masterpieces as LeGM. Kick rocks, Isaiah."
derrick rose has one too lol
"The fact that we have four semi-star ballhogs and mitchell robinson who flub the fucking game every time and have to be saved by Derrick Rose and his merry men is fucking annoying.  Ofc Drose gets hurt and we lost all momentum, randle comes in and I don't even want to talk about what happened."
"Can someone, not a timberwolves fan, dislike Derrick Rose?"
"Derrick Rose is a former MVP. Lou will is washed. He couldn’t help a clippers team that desperately needs playmaking help, now he goes to a deeper Sixers team who similarly need a reliable playmaker. Dudes a waste in the playoffs, those salaries can be much better used to match for another PG who can actually play defense against the Nets, Bucks, etc. along the lines of Lowry, Hill or Bledsoe."
Is it even possible for someone to dislike Derrick Rose?
I love Derrick Rose.
Why did the warriors not try to trade for derrick rose? He could've solved some of the apparent problems of their lineups
"Absolutely. If he can develop a consistent fade away or 3pt shot now, he can keep a usable percentage of his athletic ability by the time he's Blake's age. Losing some weight would help too. Derrick Rose has obviously dimished alot from his original athletic ability and has knee problems, but he's much smaller than blake, he can still conceivably dunk in a game because he's not massive and he's very quick and a great handler."
"Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick rose have combined for 2 dunks this season. Melo has 1 and Westbrook has 1."
He has Derrick Rose now I think he's fine
"First off, Wilson Chandler wasn’t on the Nets when they made their 2019 playoff run. He signed the next season. And DeMarre Carroll was acquired by trade, not FA signing. But I’m sure that Carroll’s playing 25 minutes a night and putting up 11 and 5 was the key to the Nets making the playoffs. Good to see you doing your own research.  You’re the type of Knicks fan that will eagerly lap up whatever bullshit song-and-dance that MSG will feed you and beg for seconds. You think Wally is cool because he has nice suits and “tells it like it is.” Keep dreaming.  You don’t have the independent thought capability to consider why Quickley has to “earn” all his minutes but Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock get a clean slate every night. You puff out your chest like you’re a Real Fan Who Watches All the Games but if you paid attention to the latest MSG postgame show, you’d have heard Alan Hahn say that the Knicks were only mathematically 6th for a few hours because there were still two evening games left to play in the East. And you have the temerity to tell me this team is a real 6 seed.  Derrick Rose is averaging 4.2 assists a game and has a 2:1 AST:TO. His facilitation won’t add much. And he’s a career 30.5% free throw shooter so he won’t help the spacing that makes the offense 30th in the league. But maybe if you actually rubbed together a brain cell or two and looked up basketball reference once in a while you’d know that.  Now give me my medal, kid."
Derrick The Alchemist Rose
"“prime derrick rose was overrated” first they didn’t even say why, and we don’t know what prime derrick rose was anyway since injuries"
How did the clippers not go after Derrick Rose?
derrick rose &amp; taj gibson
&gt; **Pooh**   Breaking news: NBA player Derrick Rose banned from entering China
"&gt;Also better physical training is a part of athleticism. Like I was way more athletic when I was working out and playing regular pickup pre-pandemic than I am now sitting on my ass all day. It's not just an intrinsic quality; it can be developed.  Sometimes the top guys are just freaks though.  There have been plenty of NBA players with terrible diets and poor work ethics who played with crazy athleticism when they were young.  I believe Derrick Rose subsisted mostly on candy in his early years.  Bo Jackson said he never lifted weights but he was insanely strong and fast.       I agree that athletes are probably marginally better now because of the expanded talent pool and training options, but I think the effects of that are enormously exaggerated.  The biggest difference in today's game is what athletes are selected based on how it's played.  Ben Wallace is a freak athlete, but he probably could not be effective in today's game.  His best skill is interior defense and it matters less and less.  He has less top tier post players to match up against.  Joe Ingles is not a freak athlete, but he is extremely effective in today's game with the spacing and freedom of movement that didn't exist in the past."
Shout out to Derrick Rose.....
Derrick rose still plays?
Thibs really wants to either marry Derrick Rose or kill him
Yeah people are forgetting all the shit Derrick rose has done because they feel bad that he got injured.  He hasn’t exactly shown himself to be a leader.  He literally did what Kyrie did a few years ago and people clowned kyrie (deservedly so).
Lmao who Derrick Rose? If you’re a PG and Derrick Rose is your vet that’d be a good thing.
"Westbrook was lightning bolt of energy on both ends for UCLA. His defense was considered better than his offense, since he was an off-guard who didn't have much shooting range.  It was amazing watching him evolve from a non-rotation player as a freshman to a lottery prospect as a sophomore, culminating in him [going toe to toe with Derrick Rose in the Final 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H89XIF_MjDY)."

"I’d argue Derrick Rose was a worse choice. Granted, I’m an okc fan and watched all thunder games. Westbrook was the whole team that year. You can call it stat padding (not you, just the general population) when he litterally had to do EVERYTHING. He was also the most clutch player I have ever seen in live person, jokic,lebron and curry are close behind."
God if Lebrun played against bigs in the 90s he’d get Derrick rose type injuries. Jesus. It wasn’t even that hard. Barely even looked like he actually connected.
"yo   A. none of that makes any sense. i’m saying simply if he were a Knick, this would be a gigantic story. we heard more about the Derrick Rose saga than we have about this Kyrie shit   B. if he indeed is taking days off because of the attack on the capitol, that’s absurd. he’s protesting nothing, he’s just skipping work."
"If you are looking at it from a worst career perspective I think it is undoubtably Derrick Rose. Walton had a short career but he still won two rings, a DPOY, a 6MOTY, and led the league in blocks and rebounds one year."
Derrick Rose - MVP
"MVP is hard, because there haven’t been any bad players who won it and everyone who is eligible is (or will be) in the HOF.  That being said, I think it’s a toss up between Derrick Rose and Bill Walton.  Not that they are bad players, they just didn’t have quite the careers some of the other MVPs have had due to injuries"
A consistently healthy Chris Paul would have a better career than a consistently healthy Derrick Rose
His game reminds me of Derrick Rose and we all know about his injuries
Sounds like the Derrick Rose era Bulls.
lockout year fucked derrick rose  I will always hate that season for that
"Yeah, I’m from ny and I thought he was going to be Derrick rose."
"Derrick Rose suffered a freak injury and there is no proof that it wouldn't have happened if he played 15, 32 or 46 minutes per game.  Argue that Thibs litterally destroyed the body of guys like Noah or Deng if you want, the Rose case isn't the same at all"
Oh my god 2015-2018 Steph would shoot my anxiety through the roof I still remember that game when Derrick Rose hit the game winner over Klay in Oakland. I thought I was going to pass out.
You know what I’d love to see? A good team that needs a solid backup pg to make a trade for Derrick Rose. You can tell how much effort he still gives and he’s still got something left in the tank. Love to see him get a ring. Just my two cents
Derrick Rose had similar athletic abilities weighing 70 lbs less. Let’s watch and see.
"Derrick Rose  Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler  Bill Cartwright, Tyson Chandler  Kyle Korver, 2017-2018 Robin Lopez, Jamal Crawford   No Bias"
Let’s reserve judgement until we hear the full story. Remember what happened with Derrick Rose? Dude was going through it and everybody shit on him.
Derrick Rose did this a couple of times iirc. Once famously on the Knicks.
Pulling the old Derrick Rose but taking it one step further
Derrick Rose got flamed for doing it and the Knicks got clowned for losing control of their players lol
Derrick rose did it
"Comparing professional athletes to average Joe workers is one of my biggest pet peeves, shit has almost no grounds for comparison the positions are so different. And yes each team has different policies on communication that are specified in contracts. I believe Derrick Rose had a similar situation a couple years ago where he missed a couple of games and didn't state why right away."
Didn’t Derrick Rose do something like this and get in trouble?
Breaking News: Derrick Rose demands a trade to Knicks
Zero chance anyone would have a trade involving Levert and Blake griffin and Derrick rose
"Derrick Rose had the same situation in Cleveland but the man was going through the dark times, what is Kyrie doing idk"
This is some Derrick Rose shit.
Derrick Rose?
People really still suck this dude off somehow even more than Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose going back to the Knicks too?
"Tank hard for the most stacked draft class in years, there’s no expectations of playoffs whatsoever. Our GM is the one who made us start a rookie with 0 summer camp or training with the team over Derrick Rose. Teams that are trying to win don’t trade their best SG for multiple first round picks that they then give heavy minutes to. Teams trying to win don’t rest their best vets every 3 games (Rose/Griffin). So far it’s worked great seeing that we’re 1-7 and were ranked by literally every major analyst as a bottom 5 team heading into the season. Our coach said the goal for this season first and foremost is to get the rookies playing time, not to make the playoffs. Whether he’s the right coach to lead the team and actually stick to his word is a different matter (he’s not).   Also all of the Plumlee, Grant, and Jackson signings are looking like complete bargains so far."
"To be fair, as young as Giannis is. He has back to back MVPs &amp; a DPOY.  That’s hall of fame worthy in itself. Tracy McGrady is in the hall of fame, Giannis is atleast on par with him on resume wise.   Derrick Rose just got injured when he was so early in his career."
"Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook are ahead of him in my book as far as deserving and honestly there’s probably more that i’m not thinking of or am on the fence about. Beal is a stud though and he deserves more success"
"I'm surprised this isn't more common with how many players are doing the euro step nowadays. It's an extremely harsh landing, torquing maneuver on one leg. Something is going to tear eventually after enough repetitions.  Look at Derrick Rose and his ""stopping and popping"" movements and landings. Just one view of his highlight videos makes me want to go buy a knee brace and adidas ultraboosts."
Don’t you trash talk Minnesota Timberwolves Great Derrick Rose like that!
"Derrick Rose was a Top 3 player for one season, so was Jermaine O'Neal"
"Yeah in order to protect his health he's had to be far more conservative. The best way to see what he is when he's healthy and doesn't give a f\*\*\* is to look at his games from the 2019 preseason. 30 points, blowing by people like a giant-sized Derrick Rose, bulldozing centers and power forwards, 360 dunks etc..."
This is like the Bulls winning that game against the Sixers but then Derrick Rose got injured
"When Derrick Rose entered the NBA he was not demonstrative at all.  Over time he admitted that he became more demonstrative because it seemed like he wasn't getting calls.  Similarly, I don't think Tim Duncan was naturally demonstrative, but decided he needed to complain or he wouldn't get calls.  Dennis Rodman was considered a hothead, and he did get suspended regularly.  But he usually got suspended in the middle of the season when he could use a rest.  He rarely got suspended in the playoffs.  And often he provoked other players into technicals, or just got into their heads so they weren't thinking about the game.  So even as a well-known hot head, Rodman used his tactics strategically.  Rodman learned that from Bill Laimbeer, who complained strategically for the Pistons, often after clearly violating the rules himself. I think Rodman was a little crazy, but often crazy like a fox.  So yes, some players do complain strategically, either because they are not natural complainers or because they weaponize complaining.  That said, there are other players who just can't control themselves, like Ron Artest / Metta World Peace / Metta Sandiford-Artest.  Sometimes it served him well because he truly was big and strong and crazy and not a person to mess with.  Other times it got him and his team into big, big trouble, as with the Malice in the Palace brawl with fans."
"It would be inaccurate to say Derrick Rose is one of the greatest guards of all time because he would have been one if he hadn’t gotten injured.   Same logic applies here. Andrew Bpgut was a first round pick with a career average of 10/9/2. Call it what you want, I call it mediocre."
so 2 future hall of famers and Derrick Rose
So Derrick Rose?
one all-nba first team rival through a decade on the east. it’s derrick rose. that’s literally it.
This Derrick Rose mentorship has gone too far
"this is super revisionist history. Derrick Rose led the Bulls to the best record in the NBA with 25/4/7. The only other candidates were Dwight Howard, who was only the 6th seed, and Lebron, who had less wins despite Wade scoring 25PPG and Bosh scoring 19 PPG."
giving Derrick Rose the MVP was a mistake
"That's not how I defend Derrick Rose, not nearly as many bitter tears."
Curry double bang  LeBron buzzer beater over Buttler vs Minnesota   Derrick rose 50 vs jazz
I guess that means Derrick Rose is stuck on the Pistons all year.
"Bucks depth? Last year for sure, but a lot has changed. Are their first 3 off the bench in the playoffs going to be Augustin, Forbes, and Portis? Nets look good on paper in that regard, but they really need another PG to run their second unit.   Miami and Indiana look like the deepest teams in the East to me. I agree that Morey will need to make a move for another ball handler by the deadline Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose, Patty Mills, George Hill, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon come to mind as potential fits if they become available."
"Derrick Rose is my favourite player, don’t mean he’s the best to ever live. Trae rlly out here thinking what he wants is what will be."
"Derrick Rose dropping 50 on Halloween of 2018, ending with a game-winning block. Wolves spooky 👀"
"And Derrick Rose... and Isaiah Thomas... and Jae Crowder... what an absolute disaster of a team. Ty Lue had horrible rotations that year... Crowder at the 4 was absolutely horrible.  The de facto lineup was Crowder at the 4 and Love at the 5... Jae at 6'6"" would just get punished by bigger players like LaMarcus Aldridge. Love/Thompson was much better."
"Curry is great because of the gravity he creates that allows for others to be playmakers on the team.   &gt;It's not like this is the first season he's actually had a decent to good PG.   Tbf here his best playmaking PG was Rubio who still can't shoot so its harder for him to create then a playmaking guard who can.   And, best overall guard was probably Jeff Teague, or Derrick Rose? So too say he's had a anything above slightly below average players consistently in his career at PG would be IMO a slight stretch.   &gt;I'm not saying he can't be a good player. But people still seem to be expecting a jump from him when he hasn't made a jump after year 3.  Here I won't lie as a Canadian who just wants him to succeed I might over compensate with him a bit. That being said Ik at this point he's a rich mans Jeff Green it is just exciting when you see someone with promise at least add something to his game we have not consistently seen, and hope it continues."
Derrick Rose situation wasn’t really about ball. He was going through personal shit and was on the brink of retiring in Cleveland.
"OK pump the brakes.  Thibs took over the Bulls, and guided them to the playoffs five consecutive years in a row. His first year was his only year with a healthy Derrick Rose, and the Bulls went all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. His second year, Rose went down in the first round with his knee injury and the Bulls never recovered. Without Rose, the Bulls make the playoffs again, win their first round series, and lose the next against Lebron. The next season, Rose's other knee goes out, and frickin' Joakim Noah has an MVP season under Thibs, he comes in fourth in votes behind Durant, Lebron, and then Blake. The next year the Bulls win their first series, and lose again to Lebron.  Dude, as much as I hate to admit it, Lebron was the roadblock, even a healthy Bulls team probably wasn't going to overcome Lebron's Heat or Cavs. I mean, we know what's like having had MJ an entire generation of superstars a ring, and...yeah, it was our turn. Thibs certainly had his flaws, but dude does a hell of a job getting the most out of his players.   Is he going to run RJ Barrett into the ground? Absolutely."
"I was so excited when he and Derrick Rose came here, but they were so obviously unhappy it became difficult to watch quickly."

"He is absolutely not going to be the top guy on a playoff contender. But he is proving day in and day out that he is more than a role player. Could he grow into becoming the 3rd best guy on a playoff contender? Stranger things have happened. He is only 26 and Casey is one hell of a development coach.  I love Derrick Rose but his carrying days are behind him. At this point, he is a strong veteran presence in a young locker room.  That team is a few years from being a playoff contender. But betting on, and continuing to develop, guys like Grant, whilst also raising their trade value in the process, is the right thing to be doing."
"That team is absolutely atrocious. Not much you can do with a broken Blake Griffin, a rookie PG, and a Derrick Rose at the tail end of his career. It's very much a development season for them. They did absolutely the right thing by betting on Grant and I hope the basketball gods reward them."
Derrick Rose would smack you for saying that.

I think Derrick rose could be in the hall of fame depending on how he does for the rest of his career with the pistons
Making the way for Derrick Rose.
"Derrick Rose IS MAKING THE HALL OF FAME, If someone like Grant Hill can do it so can Rose."
"Another knock against him is that he did have a stand out college career (which the basketball hof takes into consideration), but much of that has been erased from history because of a scandal related to Rose.   Derrick is in my top 5 of favorite basketball players ever, but unfortunately I don't think he makes it in unless he has a big second act up his sleeve."
Derrick Rose always
If Karl Malone can be inducted after his disgusting allegations I doubt what Derrick Rose did would disqualify him.  Though you’re not wrong to suggest that ones ethics outside of basketball should be considered before an induction.

"Honest question, because I’m from around Chicago and so haven’t followed basketball since Derrick Rose injured his leg while signing autographs or something:  With a score like this, do NBA teams even bother playing defense anymore, beyond maybe the occasional rebound?"
Nobody cares but I'll never forget i beat a dude on 2k11 like 65-58 with Derrick Rose having 61.
That landing though...same way Derrick Rose used to land
Better playmaker better operating out of the pick and roll. Jerami Grant also isn’t someone long term you want on wings defensively even if he’s ok at it he really should be a 4 defensively over the long run.   I’m not even a Caris LeVert fan but once Grant regresses offensively and once Derrick Rose is dealt or gone from the team I would rather have LeVerts playmaking and ability to operate out of a pick and roll than Grants for a rebuilding team
How is it weird for OKC fans to defend their former franchise player? That's like giving Bulls fans shit for defending Derrick Rose.
"&gt; Did injuries not play a factor?  But a lot of that was injuries to Chris Paul himself, and while that's not his ""fault"", shouldn't that take away from his all time status if we're comparing him to the best PG's of all time? Derrick Rose had his career submarined by injuries and you don't see people talking about him like he's a winner who's disrespected, and unlike Chris Paul, Rose at least led a team to the league's best record and won himself an MVP award.   A big part of why Chris Paul hasn't won is because of his limited durability. He'd frequently miss a month or two in those years with the Clippers, and that year they blew the 3-1 lead to Houston was partially because Paul was dealing with injuries. And then of course there's always this: why exactly do most people think the 2018 Rockets didn't beat the Warriors? Oh yeah, cause Chris Paul got hurt.   Injuries are a part of the game, and a part of how we evaluate players. You can't just elide that like it hasn't been a big part of Chris Paul's career."
"The 2011 Bulls squad is my favorite team of all time. Derrick Rose talked very highly of Thibs in his book, saying Thibs is all about tough love, which is what Rose craved. Jimmy loved it too. Even when things were happening in Minnesota, he repeated his love for Thibs.  Thibs works great for people who are tough and have a need to win. Rose, Joakim, Jimmy, Taj, Lu, Kirk. They loved it.  I love Thibs because of that mentality.  I used to hate when people talked about Thibs negatively. But now I'm starting to think he just doesn't fit in the NBA anymore. Like others said here, he used to be ahead of the curve, but now it seems like he's behind and won't catch up."
PG- Derrick Rose SG- Ginobili SF- Larry Bird PF- Tim Duncan C- David Robinson
"Could you give me another example how his players got injured cause of him other than Derrick Rose? I agree that derrick rose should be on the bench in that game but other than him there is no other player that he has really ""ruined"".   And rose himself has only good things to say about Thibs, he said he believes that Thibs is the only person in his life that loved him unconditionaly. Jimmy has praised Thibs, kobe has praised Thibs, so who are the players that hated him?"
I remember thibs was always a really good defensive minded coach. It seems like he really prefers defense over offense. A lot of players got really upset with him because he “runs players into the ground” he did have jimmy butler playing over 40 minutes a game consistently (it seems like this I haven’t confirmed with actual stats) and a lot of people blamed him for Derrick Rose suffering his initial injury because he had Derrick Rose playing heavy minutes as well. Basically he likes to utilize his best players to the maximum on every given night. He definitely makes good adjustments late game and will prefer a defensive line up in late game situations. He is a good coach overall. I just think it was kind of like the Lovie smith situation. He was a great coach but his time just ran out teams watched all of the film basically our offense became very stagnant/we really just didn’t have a second weapon and that wasn’t really thibs fault at all and we lost Derrick Rose so we basically had to blow our team up at that point.   He’s a good coach overall and I like how he’s been coaching these Knicks so far.
"Without inside information, I don’t think anybody can accurately answer that.  Now, if I were to guess: I think because he’s had some knee problems and initially came in the league too heavy, they’ve probably discussed not jumping out of the gym all day everyday, in order to reduce impact on his legs.  If you notice, frequently guys with explosive leaping ability have burned out quickly in the league. It’s too much for their legs to handle.  Amare Stoudamire, Derrick Rose, Antonio McDyess.... lower body injuries took a toll on them.   Lebron doesn’t jump through the roof anymore either. But I’d bet it’s intentional from him to preserve his body."
"Plumlee isn't meant to be the draw for picks, more so that we have some sort of competent C. You mentioned how Bey looked nice, who is a late 1st rounder, so obviously late firsts do help? And you mention we need vets around our rooks, we have Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Plumlee, and Grant who are all starting quality vets, is that not exactly what OKC did? Weaver literally came from OKC and learned from Presti, I'm sure his goal is to replicate something similar."
I also don't like the random shortening of player's names. There's also something weird like Rick for Derrick Rose or Mack for Bismack Biyombo.
"Most of my complaints have to do with his GM skills, which isn't relevant to the Knicks.   But as a coach he just lets the guys go out and shoot around, he has no offensive game plan.  Thats why he liked a guy like Derrick Rose who you just give the ball to and let him get to work"
"Spencer Dinwiddie - 11M  Jusuf Nurkic - 12M  Tj Warren - 12M  Malik Beasley - 13M  Serge Ibaka - 9M  Derrick Rose - 7M  I’m not saying all of these are better value, but some of them are (I’d say Rose/Ibaka for sure)"
One problem is he doesn’t change speeds enough. Point guards have to be able to change speed quickly on a dime to get separation. Killian seems to always be going the same speed. Hopefully Derrick rose will be a good mentor because he is very good at that.
"&gt; less reliance on athleticism,  Less than Derrick Rose, but it’s not like he’s Andre Miller. Kyle needs his speed and quickness and neither have abandoned him."
Derrick Rose had that too. Love to see it
"You forgot the ""superteam;"" Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and ... Stephon Marbury or some shit, I honestly can't remember"
who has he run into the ground?  don’t say Derrick Rose because thats been debunked 100 times over
"this  also,   NO TEAM IS TRADING DOWN FROM 1  Cade is right there with Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving as far as 1st overall prospects go."
"Cade is an elite 1st overall prospect, think Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard  no team is trading that pick"
"Seriously, when I was a kid ACL tears felt like a 50/50 proposition. Like if a running back tore his ACL, it was basically a coinflip whether or not his career was over. Sometime in the 2000s, though, it felt like ACL repairs became borderline routine, to the point that when a guy struggles to recover from it like Derrick Rose did *that* becomes the noteworthy exception.  I really hope achilles tears are following the same evolution, albeit with a longer rehab/recovery timeline."
"If we compare LeBron was in that admittedly pretty good Heat team. Rose was basically the offensive identity of that Bulls team. Yeah, sure, the supporting cast was decent enough to lead us to a top seed but this is just revisionist history. LeBron wasn't seen as someone who was robbed that season and Dwight was the only one that realistically could've taken the MVP award from Derrick Rose, at least according to people in 2011."
"Technique, too.  LeBron’s landing mechanics are likely a major reason he hasn’t had the same injury problems Derrick Rose has had, despite moving just as fast and weighing substantially more."
"Derrick rose said most of the league is juicing.  Lebron might be part of that or not, who knows?"
Draymond is still much more important to the Warriors success than Derrick Rose is to the Knicks. I smell disrespect. He does so many little things even if his stats don't show it
That's like saying the Knicks should be leading the East because they have MVP Derrick Rose on the roster
"#somebodygottascore   Only casual fans get excited over stuff like this. I still remember fans thinking Tony Wroten was the next Derrick rose when he was putting up numbers for the peak level tanking Sixers.   These dudes may turn out to be good but it’s not bc of these numbers. That roster is terrible, somebody’s gotta fill up 100 points a night"
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
"In person: Derrick Rose and LeBron trading back-to-back game winners in 2015, performance-wise they were kind of whatever but obviously that just really sticks out to me         On TV live: I don't know there's quite a few, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going back and forth in the bubble was crazy, Kevin Durant game 3 in 2018, Klay Thompson game 6 in 2016, LeBron's performance in the Cavaliers come back in 2016 and so on, it's tough to just pick one of those live, but if I absolutely positively had to pick a game that I saw live I guess I will go with LeBron's game 6 against the Celtics in 2012, I think it's still the greatest game he's ever played, he just looked.... different that night, like the motherfuker was possessed or something lol"
"he said he didn’t foul Derrick Rose yesterday while we were up 3 despite being told to by SVG because he wasn’t paying attention, so yeah he’s definitely not trying"
GOD TOLD DERRICK TO RISE AND DERRICK ROSE
Watched it live. RJ wasn't having a great game. Derrick Rose lit it up. Also Bledsoe randomly got off in the third.
"Which is weird because other than KAT, every player swears by him. Hell even Derrick Rose, a guy he supposedly ran into the ground, keeps following him wherever he coaches. Wiggins talks fondly of him. Joakim Noah. Taj Gibson. Jimmy Butler loves Thibs the coach, but wanted out of Minny over getting paid and butting heads with guys like KAT.   Again, it’s all about narratives. One star didn’t like playing for him and suddenly that means all players don’t. The guy that KAT did want as coach because he was was more “player friendly” got fired earlier this season because he sucked. By all accounts, the Knicks players love him because they’re all gym rats."
"&gt;  D-rose in his prime was one of the most Unstoppable forces the basketball court has ever seen  &gt; I don't think there's any question that if he would have kept that up, he would have owned the number one spot at his position   I love Derrick Rose, but these are just flat out wild exaggerations. Curry, Stockton, and Magic's numbers and impact on the floor was way higher, even when compared to Rose's prime, it's not even very close.    Rose was very good, but we don't have to exaggerate how great he was."
"Up 3, Lonzo left his man for a corner 3 to guard a driving Derrick rose. Terrible defensive play."
"He can lose some baby fat for sure. But I think Zion is just a genetic freak. We really have never seen a guy that size with his level of acceleration, speed and explosiveness. He is just too explosive, he reminds me of a forward version of Derrick Rose around 2009-2011 version. Almost too athletic for the human body."
"&gt; Eric Bledsoe admits in postgame that he was supposed to foul Derrick Rose on Knicks final offensive possession in regulation -- before Lonzo Ball whiffed on his assignment in staying adhered to Reggie Bullock.  This probably implies that Bledsoe was told by SVG to foul, so they didn’t foul and they closed out on a layup to let up an open 3 to the Knicks best shooter"
"Derrick Rose is such a solid bench player/sixth man, don’t know how no one picked him up."
"Over the final 2 minutes of regulation, Derrick Rose scored five quick points, made the dish to Bullock for the game-tying 3 and  had the big block on Bledsoe to send it to OT. In OT, he added a couple of buckets and had a steal off of Ingram. His fingerprints were all over this win."
Ur wrong.  They should’ve fouled right when Derrick rose put the ball on the floor
"Man to me Derrick Rose, and Brandon Roy are my biggest what if.  I love that we get to see Derrick Rose be a star on the Knicks but man those injuries really robbed him from a great career."
Derrick Rose got his hand on it. Killer move by a pro
What a beast and the handle was the most impressive part . Basically a 300lbs guard who jumps like Jordan and accelerates like Derrick Rose
Bron Luka and even kawhi might not be the quickest but they the best at body contact. This is much more valuable than quickness over a 18 year career. Ask one of the fastest first steps ever Derrick rose
Alright let me rephrase. Derrick Rose led his team to 62 wins vs Lebron who just made a superteam. Sound better?
Because Derrick Rose was a 21 year old who lead his team to 62 wins vs Lebron who created a superteam.
Yes Derrick rose himself said it was a super team
Derrick Rose resurgence arc who says no
"We got cap space that we used to sign 3/5 of our starting lineup (Randle, Bullock, Payton) and Derrick Rose."
"&gt; On May 3, 2011, Derrick Rose became the youngest MVP in NBA history (22 years, 211 days)  2011 will be 10 years ago in about 2 weeks. It feels just like yesterday when he won MVP..."
"Love watching Derrick Rose play and always will, good for them"
"Here's the answer you're looking for:  You can't regularly order the jersey of every/any player in the NBA. Every team designates 1 or 2 players to make jerseys for to have sent to the big box stores (department stores, footlocker, dicks sporting goods, etc.). So for OKC, the jersey that's available to buy right this second is a SGA jersey. For LAL it would be Lebron and Davis. you get the idea.  Unfortunately for you, because CP3 was traded so late in the season, they had already allocated those premade jerseys to SGA and CP3. You'll have to order any other player's jersey from the manufacturer on the official thunder NBA shop at a slightly higher price (139.99). It's technically custom made and takes a little bit longer.  At least you're not a Detroit fan who never had interest in a Blake Griffin or Derrick Rose jersey."
"I know, I was making the point that he would have received a record setting contract coinciding with the cap spike. The question asked for:  &gt;player who lost the most in potential earnings due to injuries given modern salaries  I answered that Derrick Rose likely lost the most in potential earnings due to injuries."
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"Grant Hills averages had been going down as his pig went up his best year he put up 21/10/7, the year before his injuries he put up 25/6/5. Not world breaking by any means. He also only made the playoffs 4x his first 8 seasons never made the 2nd round and only 1x did his playoff numbers match his regular season numbers.   Tmacs back we'll ya i said it started really giving him problems at 26 thats all I said he was always somewhat hurt. I'm not debating him 09 is a big what if although I don't think he moves up all time in the rankings too much.   Petrovic ""dominated"" for 2 years where he has any Euroleague accolades 85 and 86. But him coming into the league late and him only having 2 seasons where he averaged 20 ppg isn't a what if. His teams weren't winning, honestly how great would he have been when he'd have 4-5 years at a high level where his only elite skills were finishing and shooting    The big what ifs to me are Bill Walton who was never healthy since his roomie year and the 1 year he played more than 60 games he won an MVP and championship. All before 25,  Derrick Rose youngest MVP ever came off a year of 22/4/8 the bulls looking better than the previous year and then Injuries   Len bias for 0bvious reasons    Greg Oden didn't play his rookie year due to injuries, was forced to play limited minutes and retired at 22    Those are what ifs due to injuries"
"https://fansided.com/2017/12/06/derrick-rose-2011-mvp-award-absurd/  &gt; Of course, the fact that The Decision had sullied LeBron’s public reputation was clearly an issue with voters."
"You are flat out tripping saying Kyrie and Steph are way better. Rose had his MVP season of 25ppg 7.7apg when he was 22 years old. That was his third season in the league.  It took Curry 5 years before he hit 24ppg and 8apg. He would win MVP the next year with 23.8ppg and 7.7apg And the warriors won their first championship. The following year he won MVP again on 30ppg and 6.7apg. His 30ppg is his highest season average with the next best being 27 and the rest all below 25ppg.   Kyrie has never averaged 7apg, 6.9apg being his best year but all the rest at or below 6apg. His best scoring season was last year with 27.4 and before that it was 25.2ppg in the 2016-17 season his 6th season in the league.   Now if we are talking about uninjured Derrick Rose we only have those first 4 seasons to go on with his 3rd season being the MVP year. If we look at performance trajectory DRose hit those 25 &amp; 7 numbers in his 3rd year. It took Curry 5 years to hit those numbers and to be fair Kyrie hasn't hit those assist numbers and his high scoring seasons have been outliers.   I would also argue DRose had less support around him but that's neither here nor there.  This is taking nothing away from Kyrie and Steph, both are phenomenal ballers but who's to say what might have been with Rose if he remained healthy."
Isaiah Thomas’s career has basically ended. Derrick Rose was in line for a Max then probably a supermax. Amare Staudamire also comes to mind. Then there are high draft picks who got injured like Bynum and Jabari Parker.
Derrick Rose. Without the injuries he would have been able to resign with CHI at the max right when the 2016 cap spike hit. He likely would've gotten the Mike Conley $150M treatment.
maybe Derrick Rose? i know he stills gets paid a decent amount but i’d imagine he’d be making more than what Steph and Russ make now
"Embiid's case would have to rest on defense and team record. Defense has not moved the needle in past MVP races (say, 2017 Kawhi), but team record has (e.g. Derrick Rose). So we'll see."
Disappointing in the same way Derrick Rose has been disappointing.
"I wonder if an MVP will ever be younger than the ROY. Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin came close on 2011.  It happened in baseball In 2015 Bryce Harper won the NL MVP, the NL ROY was Kris Bryant who is 9 months older than Harper.   An Even more extreme one is Luke Kuechly, who won DPOY in 2013, is a month younger than Khalil Mack, who was drafted in 2014 and went on to win Defensive ROY."
"Derrick Rose is 32 (October 1988), Steph Curry is 33 (March 1988)"
"You really can’t easily and will never get a for sure answer. I’d use stats to start and then talk about the context. Much like how you brought up the stats and I carried on the discussion with the context. But you’re really not going to get anywhere because nobody that argues here will ever admit they’re wrong and people will just upvote/downvote whichever person is arguing for their favorite player.  So it’s kinda pointless to argue here about that. Derrick Rose was MVP and beat prime Dwight and Miami LeBron. Luka probably won’t win MVP even though so many of the candidates have had injuries and other issues. So comparing them amongst their peers I’d put Rose ahead for now. Is it fair? No, but Luka will have plenty of other opportunities to win MVP, be on a 60 win team and make some deep playoff runs."
So the Bulls weren’t relevant when they had young Derrick Rose? The Jazz weren’t relevant when they had Stockton and Malone?
"And Russell Westbrook and prime Derrick Rose.   Your point is understood here, but players (especially ones with physical styles of play) don’t need to be elite shooters to be elite scorers. The way that the Wolves are constructed, they have shooters around Ant who can space the floor."
Derrick rose what if is that he would’ve been destroyed by the cavs when lebron went there and also the warriors
Dwight won 3 straight DPOY awards and was top-5 MVP voting in those seasons. 2011 he was second in MVP voting to Derrick Rose.
Russell Westbrook  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony   Derrick Rose  Michael Jordan  Tracy McGrady  Tim Duncan  Dirk Nowitzki  Manu Ginobili  Shaq
I remember when Derrick Rose dropped 50. He would have had 42 on Gobert directly if he wasn't playing Gobert off the floor that night
Impressive list for him and Tatum to show up on. The only guy who isn’t in the hall of fame or well on their way (aside from them obviously) is Derrick Rose who for sure would be if he hadn’t gotten hurt.
Derrick Rose
"""The key here ... is patience.""  See Derrick Rose.  He went down with an ACL injury in his left knee in the 2012 playoffs.  He was heavily criticized for refusing to come back after nine months when the team doctors cleared him.    But despite taking a cautious approach and sitting out an entire season, in November of 2013, the season he did return, he tore the meniscus in his *right* knee.  While that seems like a horrible coincidence, when returning from an injury there's a danger of overcompensation leading to other seemingly-unrelated injuries.  Surgeons tried to repair the meniscus tear instead of removing it, meaning he took another season off recovering and rehabbing.  But then in February of 2015, he tore his meniscus again, and this time it had to be removed.  During that time between his initial ACL tear and his second meniscus tear, he also suffered a series of brief injuries such as sprained ankles, sore knees, and sore or strained hamstrings.  Each soreness was treated cautiously because of his injury history, and yet he was unable to avoid further serious knee injuries.  It may be that Rose, whose game depended a lot on his athleticism, just never learned how to land properly, and didn't have or couldn't develop a fallback game when he became cautious about putting pressure on his knees.    Chris Paul had his meniscus removed in 2010 and admits that he did not take rehab seriously enough.  But he's been able to compensate for whatever athleticism he lost.    Zach LaVine tore his ACL in February 2017 and seems to have recovered nicely, even retaining his athleticism.  However, the injury, rehab, and recovery doubtless delayed his development and accounts for some of the surprise at the player he's become this season, three and a half years after his injury.  I don't think it's fair to expect Murray to return to form the first year he returns.  It may be two years before he returns to form, and three years before he takes another leap -- and that may be optimistic.  I wish him the best, but I wouldn't count on him being a factor for the Nuggets for quite a while.  And yes, injuries suck."
Derrick rose career high with the bulls
"Derrick Rose basically broke his body by being too athletic, it's a hell of a balancing act"
"All I could get out of it was ""Bruh bro brah bro bro bruh"". Apparently they would like to be next of kin or seem to share the same speech impediment as Derrick Rose."
People who never reach their potential due to stupidity are forgotten but guys like Derrick rose and Brandon Roy who don’t reach their potential due to injuries are remembered
11. LaMelo Ball 12. Mike Conley 13. Fred VanVleet 14. Malcolm Brogdon 15. Lonzo Ball 16. Kyle Lowry 17. D'Angelo Russell 18. Spencer Dinwiddie 19. Kemba Walker 20. Terry Rozier 21. Derrick Rose 22. Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
Coby White and Derrick Rose seem like the best value picks. Especially if their teams continue to improve and they can build that narrative. Wouldn't be surprised to see Clarkson put up similar numbers again to last season in his role as a microwave scorer but I'm not sure if he'll have the same storyline to drive voters his way.
"All time Bulls have a pretty bad offensive fit lol, insane defense though. Could switch Noah for Artis Gilmore. Arguably could switch Rodman for Horace Grant if we are just comparing their Bulls careers as well.  Derrick Rose  Michael Jordan  Scottie Pippen  Dennis Rodman  Joakim Noah"
"Hard to beat the Bulls now that they’ve added prime, fantastically uninjurable Derrick Rose to the mix."
(more recently)I forget which placed vote it was but someone voted for Derrick Rose to be MVP last season
Derrick Rose is up there
Derrick Rose has more career points than Kahwhi
Derrick rose was on track to be the goat?
"Lebron   Derrick Rose  Joakim Noah  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul  Kemba Walker  Paul Pierce  Z Ilgauskas, the Cavs guy   Horace Grant  Vlade Divac  Jason Richardson  Dwight Howard  Please no one ask why I came up with these, I totally have no idea"
"This is an interesting post, but I think going back 20 years is a BIT too far since the criteria in the 2000s was entirely different than the criteria in the 2010s. In the 2000s, the award generally favored guys that were drafted mid-late first round or in the 2nd round. Basically they were given to guys who weren't really expected to be good coming into the league but ended up breaking out. Players like Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, Boris Diaw, etc all fit that bold - guys who were drafted outside of the lottery who had an amazing season for their standards.   If we're looking at the past 10 seasons, every winner for the award was either a first time all star/all NBA or played a very key role on a playoff team. The only winners that didn't make an all star team/all NBA the team were Ryan Anderson, CJ and Pascal Siakam.   Ryan Anderson was a typical 2000s MIP, 21st pick who reached a career high in scoring (at that time) and played a critical role in his team's success. However, if we were to pick the award based on today's criteria I'd wager that Andrew Bynum most likely would've gotten the nod over him. CJ despite being a lottery pick increased his PPG from 6 to 20, and Siakam went from a stiff to a 2nd option on a championship level team despite not making an all star team that year.   If I'm a betting man looking at next year's potential winner based on the pattern for the past decade, it's going to be someone that either makes their first all star/all NBA team or someone that plays a huge role on a playoff level team whose numbers improved tremendously.   Zion/Zach - I'm going to write these guys off because they're already too good, and have already made an all star team. I don't think we've ever had an all star level player get the MIP even if they made a jump to a MVP worthy season. Steph Curry didn't get it, Derrick Rose didn't get it, I don't see the case for Zion or Zach Lavine.   Shai - He's already putting up 24/5/6 on great efficiency, basically numbers that Brandon Ingram put up when he won it. He can obviously get better, but how much better can he even get at this point to get MIP? The opportunity is there, but it just feels so unlikely that he improves SO much from last season that he wins it IMO.   MPJ - Probably has the best odds to make it IMO. He has the talent and most importantly the opportunity with Jamal Murray out for most of the season. If he can take on more of the scoring load and put up around 25PPG on similar efficiency &amp; improve his defense while making the all star/all NBA team the award is as good as his.   I'm not going to bet on any of the sophomores, because historically you need to see a HUGE improvement to win MIP as a sophomore. Improvements from lottery picks like Edwards/Williams would be expected, and Bane would have to average 20PPG which I don't see happening given his role.   Guys like JJJ/Garland/other top 5 picks would really have to get their first all star selection in order to be in the conversation for MIP. I just don't really see it for those guys right now. Injuries aside, I just don't see JJJ make the all star team this upcoming season over Ja, and I DEFINITELY don't see the Grizzlies have more than one all star player.   I really like OG at those odds, he just fits the criteria the NBA is looking for in their MIPs IMO. The only things he really needs to be a good offensive player at this point are tighter handles which he has reportedly been working on all summer. It's really hard to judge the Raptors right now because their season in Tampa was so unorthodox, nobody knows how much playing away from Toronto has affected their player. If the Raptors look good before all star break and OG is putting up 20PPG + great defense, he could very well sneak into an all star game and end the season on an all defense team. +5000 odds I feel like this is a no brainer.  In regards to NAW, I love NAW but I just don't see opportunity for him to take a huge leap like that. The Pelicans already have two stars in Zion &amp; Ingram, how many minutes/shots are realistically going to be available for NAW? I guess not having Bledsoe/Lonzo on the team anymore helps his case, but we also have to consider that they also brought in JV who's going to command a LOT more touches than Adams. I feel like the minutes might be there, but the opportunity might not necessarily be there. But then again, his PER 36 stats do look good so at +3000 it's still pretty good.   Anyways, my picks for MIP so far is probably MPJ/OG/NAW."
If it’s just pure basketball skills in prime all of a sudden guys like Derrick Rose and Bill Walton take huge leaps
There's a timeline where Chicago fans would have been able to root for the following incredible nimble and flashy athletes ALL in their primes:  Derrick Rose  Devin Hester  Javier Baez  Patrick Kane
Derrick rose.
"‘09 Derrick Rose against the Celtics.  Had 36PTS in his debut, blocked Rondo.  That was a great series."
"I am worried about the Knicks ruining their new team culture by trading guys away to try to get a star, especially one that doesn't fit perfectly, but a big sore spot for the Knicks was having only 2 guys trusted to guard small forwards (RJ and Reggie Bullock), and they were 2 of the only guys who would be trusted in the clutch to guard shooting guards. I don't want RJ to play 46+ minutes in back to back games ever again unless its conference finals or finals and overtime both times. I would be ok with the Knicks trading for Ben Simmons if they don't have to give up Randle, RJ, Reggie Bullock, or Immanuel Quickley. I think losing Derrick Rose would be unavoidable, he seems like the only one outside of those players the Sixers would actually want. If we get Alec Burks back, RJ keeps improving his 3pt shot, and Randle keeps shooting like a god, it might not be terrible spacing, at least not worse than with Frank Ntilikina (yes I know he shot like 40% from 3 this year but a lot of them were uncontested corner 3s in garbage time) or Elfrid Payton (as long as we forget the first 5 games of the season where he looked like discount MVP Westbrook)."
Derrick Rose sliced himself on his bed apple knife  https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/roses-thorn-is-a-knife/1848890/
If derrick rose dosnt return to the knicks i can see them throwing some money at reggie
"It was also a he-said, she-said case and no other women ever came out w similar allegations. And at the time of the trial a lot of the legal reporting was that the case was weak (not saying it didn’t happen, but there was no strong evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt).  It wasn’t like the Cosby or Weinstein allegations where the evidence is undeniable and there are multiple allegations.  Derrick Rose literally just went through a sexual assault case a few years ago that also ended in a settlement. And he’s one of the most loved players in the entire league by the media, players, and fans alike.   Cristiano Ronaldo is another very beloved athlete that reached a settlement in a sexual assault case and hasn’t had it affect his career in any way."
His defense was always overrated.  Ironically enough he got better at guarding smaller players when he got older.  The Lakers would often put him on Chris Paul or Derrick Rose because he was smart enough to stay in front of those guys and frankly was just way better than Derek Fisher.  Still shouldn’t have made any all defense teams but young Kobe was best as a help defender because he could fly over the place but he still was just like most young wings and gambled for steals and what not.

Derrick Rose was proved consensual in court. It’s only a massive dent to people who haven’t taken the time to research his case.
"Idk man they were in a friends with benefits relationship for a while and the dude said he doesn't know what consent is, that they went over to her house at 1am with no indication that she wanted sex, and took pictures with the jurors afterwards, doesn't exactly look like sunshine and rainbows.  Also all I said was fuck Derrick Rose, your responses are funny and telling, in my mind I hate him primarily for his comments and the fact that he was posing for photos, I just want people to be aware about it and at least question it, I only found out a month or so ago and he was my favorite player for 10 years before that lol."
"As Derrick Rose would say...""we men"""
"No joke this is inevitably gonna come to the NBA at some point, it’s been pegged for a little while as the next innovation. We’re gonna be like “man remember when Derrick rose had a nasty floater but couldn’t make a 3 pointer? How did he not think to just do deeper floaters?”"
Derrick rose
Baby steps (I hope)... fuck Derrick Rose
This getting such a huge deal when the mamba mentality of the NBA had a massive dent in his life and so does Derrick Rose right now and many others  People really pick and chose who to shit on
"""Derrick Rose will come back before Nerlens Noel gets drafted""  I lold. I forgot Derrick Rose comeback memes were a thing"
Is that Future or Derrick Rose?
People loooove Derrick Rose now
"&gt;	“I don’t wanna deal with all of this shit, here is the money you obviously fabricated all of this for so you go the fuck away” just as much.   Or, since you are innocent, you call their bluff, especially if you want people to give you the benfit of the doubt later.             Even Derrick Rose didn’t settle.          Again, daming testimonies with medical record to back it up + settlement should get you to the back of the line for a position for a position with many qualified candidates. This isn’t even a punishment."
Kobe stans in a constant battle with the Derrick Rose cult over the most embarrassing subgroup of fans in the NBA.
"I’m relatively certain Pistons fans still have PTSD from the last time they traded for a star in their mid-30’s (Allen Iverson). Honorable mention to fellow former Pistons Tracy McGrady, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Chris Webber, and Bob McAdoo."
"After Derrick Rose tore his ACL in the 2011 playoffs, I remember seeing him the next game sitting in a box seat eating a hotdog with his family. I’m not defending Kawhi here, but him sitting in a box seat can be a sign of a serious injury"
"Injuries are part of the game you can come up with these excuses every year for some teams it’s dumb as hell. Staying healthy is part of the game. We don’t say Derrick Rose is a champ because if he didn’t get injured the bulls might have won a chip. Or that the we should diminish some of champs the celtics missed out on because Bird shouldn’t have paved his own driveway and Len bias shouldn’t have overdosed. This is just a coping mechanism for when your team misses out, that’s it."
Well you can say this is a dumb take but i really believe that putting Kobe on any team will make them better.  I really do.  Im a foreigner from another continent so i do not know about the salary cap limits.  Take the New York knicks for example.  I think they have space salary wise no?  Derrick Rose/RJ Barret/Mitchell Robinson/Julius Randle/Kobe.  The knicks struggled in the playoffs D Rose was doing good for a reason he is a former MVP.  Sometimes you need a leader or someone to take the load off other players on the court and he does that.
Derrick Rose on Thibs
Derrick Rose
"Jordan to Blazers, Len Bias, Derrick Rose (injury), Grant Hill (injury), Greg Oden (injury), Maurice Stokes (paralyzed), Magic Johnson (HIV - could be potentially considered greatest all time if he won a few more rings), Kobe doesn’t get traded on draft night, Ray Allen doesn’t hit the 3, etc.   But actually I wonder about Roy Tarpley, who no one talks about. For people who don’t know who he is, he was All-Rookie and then the Sixth Man of the Year and help lead the Mavs to Game 7 of the 1988 WCF vs Lakers (while high and drunk) in just his 2nd year. In fact in only his second season, he had the highest rebounding % in the NBA (higher than Barkley, Malone, Hakeem, and Ewing), and he averaged a double double coming off the bench. He also could dribble the ball in transition and hit mid range shots as a near 7 footer back in that era which is rare. But then drugs got the best of him and he fell off the earth (he died a few years ago). He coulda been a HOF actually. Mark Aguirre (who played with Zeke and Rodman and was good friends with them) said Tarpley was the best player he ever played with.  Maybe you can still find some of his playoff highlights vs the Lakers online, but it’s pretty rare to hear his name. It’s just as sad as Len Bias imo but no one talks about it."
"he kinda did get cancelled for a bit. his image was severally damaged for a long time, which is all you can do to an athlete of kobes caliber really. Even today, people disliking the guy wouldnt keep him off the court like it would a comedian on the stage or actor in a movie- he's contractually obligated to keep playing. and keep in mind Derrick rose wasnt cancelled and his case seems at least as suspect.  and it was a slightly different story for Kobe as well, there was a subtle racial element that boosted the story in a way it wouldnt have today. This was 2003, post iverson, and much of the media and public were a bit ravenous for athletes to fulfill the deviant/thug stereotype that the league was dealing with at the time.  and jason kidd and chauncey billups were just hired this week. Sports are generally cancel free. Ironically the closest you get is kapernick, who probably would have a bench spot if not for the unwanted attention."
sign derrick rose off rip for sure
"Yep a combination of love for Derrick Rose and hatred for LeBron James is what fueled my fandom when I was younger. Good times. I have respect for him and his accomplishments, but it’s still fuck LeBron in my house."
What gives you the impression the NBA has an intelligence requirement? Derrick Rose cheated on his SAT's to get into college.
*laughs in Derrick Rose*
"That's a silly question, a better one would be Derrick Rose, tick tock tick tock"
Elfrid Payton averages like 12 minutes per game in the rose era   Derrick Rose  would  make old man Kidd do the cba cha slide
DERRICK GOES DERRICK ROSE
My all-time favorite player (Mark Price) is three degrees from my current favorite (Sekou Doumbouya): Tyrone Corbin to Kurt Thomas to Derrick Rose.  Pretty cool.
Derrick Rose???  (He was well on his way to iconic.)
Derrick Rose agrees with this comment.
Derrick Rose
Then you just invite Derrick Rose.
I think Michael Red is Neji. Harden’s still going strong. Westbrook being Rock Lee is perfect. Derrick Rose is Guy.
"Wilt also ran about 8-10% short of Olympic medal track runners / sprinters.  He was not fast for basketball. It would be like Usain Bolt could play the game.   48 minutes of a 7-1, stronger than David Robinson, same vert as Vince Carter, long like Gobert, and faster than Derrick Rose.  He’s like Bo Jackson. Just every once in a while you get a dude that’s unrealistic. It sounds fake or exaggerated and yet it isn’t.   Wilts the one dude I wish was playing in the modern era. Shaq would have a really really rough time being physical and staying on the court when they just pick and roll and kick out for 3s as he chases small guys around or gives them 12 feet of open space.   Wilt could cover the ground and block your 3."
"Derrick Rose over there like: ""Bruh"""
Derrick Rose has fake teeth because Taj Gibson broke 9 of them when he accidentally elbowed him at practice and broke his eye socket
"He always turns into Derrick Rose against us for whatever reason. This guy has been playing the best games of his career specifically against us for some reason. Maybe someone beat him up as a kid with a Celtics jersey on.  Either way, Brooks should’ve played him more, cut almost all of Neto’s minutes. Gafford obviously got into foul trouble, so I get why he didn’t play more but Brooks should’ve directed them to fee Robin more. We had a hard time guarding him. No idea why Bonga didn’t see minutes."
"Poor man's Derrick Rose my ass.  Derrick Rose was better at dunking viciously, that's it.  Wall was the better defender, passer, fastbreaker, and pretty much scored at the same clip."
"Mediocre doesn’t typically refer to teams that are getting bumped in the second round (only 8 teams even make the second round). An example of mediocre is the Sixers from the ten years before Hinkie where we went 367-437 (0.456 winning percentage), had one season where we drafted in the top ten (and it was Evan fucking Turner), and made it past the first round once (due to Derrick Rose getting injured in game 1).   That’s the treadmill you don’t want to ride: bad enough to not have a realistic shot at a first round win, good enough to not have a realistic shot in the lottery."
I love Derrick Rose
"In 2021, would you rather have Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook on your team?"
Derrick Rose.
You can't name Derrick Rose?
"Derrick Rose prob has a case, but I’d still give it to Clarkson."
I mean...Derrick Rose was kind of big. As far as acquisitions go.
"semi hot takes:   West:   * Jazz only advance out of rd 1 if either SAS or Mempis move up past LA/GSW.   * Clippers over Mavs in 5   * My guess though is Lakers slide to 8, then beat the Jazz in 6, then the Clippers in 7.   * Blazers over Nuggets in 7, and Phoenix in 6 to reach WCF  * Lakers over Portland in 6   East:  * Wizards beat the Celtics, and take Brooklyn to 6  * Knicks-Hawks goes 7, but I'm picking the Knicks  * Derrick Rose is good for 40  * Sixers in 4 if they play Charlotte, 5 if they play Indy or DC, 6 if they play Boston  * Sixers in 6 over the Knicks  * Bucks over Heat in 7, Nets in 7, (I hope I'm wrong) Sixers in 7, and Lakers in 7"
"You'd think so, but the issue is, Thibs can turn a decent defender into a good (or at least solid) defender. So a guy like Frank whose defense is great but provides nothing on offense is useless to Thibs. Think of it like this:  Frank can be a 10/10 on defense but he's a 2/10 on offense.  Derrick Rose, meanwhile, is a 7/10 on defense, under Thibs, but also an 8/10 on offense."
Derrick Rose for 6MOY.
"""The way I look at it in myself is why not? Why can't I be the MVP of the league? Why can't I be the best player in the league? I don't see why. Why can't I do that?"" - Derrick Rose before becoming the youngest MVP in NBA history."
"Julius, Most Improved Player; Derrick Rose, Comeback Player of the Year; Thibs, COY, same core as Fizz, but 20 wins more?! Sorry Monty, great man and great coach, but if Thibs had Chris Paul, KNICKS are the 1 seed in the East..."
"Funny how people always say that a player got injured due to playing too many minutes, but they can't provide an ounce of proof of that. I guess the Knicks don't have physicians and sports scientists in their facilities that know that playing 38 minutes a game has zero correlation with injury.  James Harden averaged 37 minutes per game in Houston in a seven year stretch, he missed a grand total of 33 games in that span, most of it for rest.  People have this fixation that too many minutes causes injuries when there's nothing conclusive in sports science about it, players get injured in a billion different ways, from fucked up mechanics like Derrick Rose to basketball accidents like Gordon Hayward and LeBron James, there's zero proof whatsoever that playing 32 instead of 38 minutes will increase the chance you avoid a serious injury."
"Michael Jordan joined the Wizards, they traded Pippen, Derrick Rose got injured, and now they’re trying to have Zach Levine carry their team."
"it worked out for randle and RJ, randle made his first all star and might make an all-nba team.   RJ had a great sophomore season instead of stalling out in his development.   they are both in the playoffs for the first time  also derrick rose had a better season than probably anyone expected, he really seems to love playing for thibodeau even though he got injured playing for him before"
but people say Derrick Rose can’t huh...
"Hard to say, but I feel like that ship has sailed. He'll be relevant, and if he works hard enough, he could stay in the league a long time. He's got a ton of raw talent that didn't come together for whatever reason. But kind of like Derrick Rose re-invented his game, maybe Wiggins can do the same, even if it's not to the same extremes."
didn't this approach injure Derrick Rose that one year going into playoffs ?
He was setting screens for Derrick rose - just watch drose highlights
\*Derrick Rose
6MOTY is Derrick Rose  Ignore my flair
Except Derrick Rose...
"As someone who loved the Derrick rose bulls, and rose himself, it’s impossible not to love this year’s knicks. Also love the bitterness at tingus pingus.   Also if y’all get out of the first round and the mavs don’t, pretty sure you guys win the trade."
"People always says he avoids contact which is just not true. His problem is that he doesn't flail, bitch to the refs enough, and actually tries to finish every one of his shots in the paint instead of letting the ball free to put pressure on the refs. Every other person who gets to the free throw line more than him do these things, except maybe Giannis. This is the same thing Derrick Rose suffered from."
"Oh yea I know. a few of the upsets had special circumstances surrounding them.   One was in a strike season so same thing, shortened, where the 8 seed knicks would have moved up given time and were only 5 games behind 1st anyway.  Another was MVP Derrick Rose getting injured in game 1.  Run TMC warriors had best offense in the league as a 7 and beat a 2 seed in another.  And one was when the west was stacked(kinda like this year) and the Spurs were 50-32 as a 7 seed.  So for most of the upsets it’s something extra that happened.  This year would be no different."
"Works so hard on and off the ball. Great ball skills, floaters, teardrops and can finish around the basket with either hand. Also an underrated passer and defender. Such a joy to watch when he is on his game. Top 5 most fun players to watch ever alongside Jordan, 08-10 Lebron, peak Shaq and Toronto Vince Carter. Honorable mentions: T-mac, Kobe, 05-10 Steve Nash, Iverson, Wade, Hakeem and 08-12 Derrick Rose."
"The MVP is so narrative-based that I really view it as more of a check box on the resume than something where counting them really makes sense.  Historically, every player who has won an MVP is in the Hall of Fame or will be when they are eligible (except for Derrick Rose), so while having one is definitely an important part of a player's legacy, the overall total is less important.  A more personal gripe of mine is that I don't feel that a regular season-only award is really the best way for the NBA to be going about their MVP.  Let's face it:  More than half of the league makes the playoffs, so I can't really think of many situations where you could make a case for an MVP from a non-playoff team.  if you take the playoffs into account, I think you end up with a more representative award of that season.  2019 is a great example.  Giannis won the MVP award that year, but when I (and I'm guessing most NBA fans) think of the best/most impactful/most valuable/whatever your definition of MVP is player from that season, we think of Kawhi Leonard first, and probably rightfully so."
DERRICK ROSE BACK IN THE PLAYOFFS   I'M LIVING BABY!!!
Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook both shot less than 26% on threes in their second seasons. I think he’ll be fine.
"He’s got more than enough. It’s rare for a 5+ time all-star to not make it in the HOF.  - 5x NBA all-star  - 5x All-NBA  - 1990 All-Rookie  - 18th All-Time in Assist  - 2000 Olympic Gold Medalist   - WAC Player of the Year  One top of this Hardaway’s dribble crossover style of ball handling was massively influential on the game. Before there was Steph or AI or Derrick Rose, there was Tim Hardaway. He had every kid on the court trying to imitate his moves. Hardaway was like a modern NBA PG playing in the past. The dribble pull up 3 pointers and hesitation jumpers we see every player do today originated with Tim Hardaway."
Derrick Rose won't make the HOF unless he's able to magically will the Knicks to a ring or two.
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"Derrick Rose isn’t a lock because he has literally just the MVP, Curry is a 2x MVP, 3x champion, 7x All Star, going on 7x All NBA, 5 finals appearances, has a scoring title (probably gonna add another one tomorrow), steals leader, and is in the 50/40/90 club. Find me someone else who’s even close to that level of accolades who isn’t in the Hall."
"MVP isn't a lock for HoF, take Derrick Rose for example. I could see him getting in but at the moment his accolades aren't enough"
Derrick Rose in about 15 years
Derrick Rose
"Quickley, cap space for Randle, DSJ eventually became Derrick Rose by attaching a second to him, we don't have our money locked up in an injury prone center beefing with a superstar  I know this is a Mavs thread and u can have ur moment but the Knicks did win the trade. The Knicks are also dumb as fuck for not getting more value out of KP, both can be true at the same time"
The Knicks offense is what scares me the most.  I still need to seem them make shots against playoff defenses for me to pick them in a series.  The defense I'm less concerned with but also how much is Payton going to play in the playoffs.  Does Thibs stop playing around and just start Derrick Rose or Alec Burks.  Payton should get zero minutes.
"The last time an eighth seed knocked off a first seed was 2012 when the Pre-Process Sixers beat the Bulls because Derrick Rose tore his ACL. 3 eighth seeds have gotten out of the first round since the change to best-of-seven. Only one eighth seed has ever been to the Finals, and they didn't win.   The last time a seventh seed pulled off an upset was 2010 when the Spurs knocked off the Mavericks. They are the only seventh seed to get out of the first round since the NBA changed the format to best-of-seven.   Considering neither a seventh or an eighth seed has gotten out of the first round in 9 years, and the best-of-seven format makes that even less likely than it was in the past, I think it's safe to say that it is fairly rare that they significantly affect the playoffs.   In contrast the most recent 6th seed upset was in 2018 when the Pelicans swept the Blazers. The 6th seed Houston Rockets also won a championship in 1995. And of course there is the last year's Cinderella, the Miami Heat to represent the most recent 5th seed.  I'm willing to discount the 7 and 8, but not the 5 and 6."
Derrick Rose easily.   I remember hating Clippers but Noah was on the team last sesson which was even tougher.
"Been plenty of MVPs that weren't actually Top 5 players in the league man  Derrick Rose, Steve Nash, Giannis, AI..and of course Westbrook"
Would you say the same thing about Derrick Rose or Brandon Roy?
Derrick Rose is also a special case. He didn’t play or was bad when playing for 5+ seasons. Then at the end of the 6th season post injury his old coach saves him and he has a revival. Rose is pretty much the only one with this type of arc.  Most guys either bounce back right away or wash out like Boogie and IT.
Here’s two more: Derrick rose and ja morant; must see TV
Derrick Rose has our number. Kudos to him
"I've been thinking this a lot lately. ""Knicks need a star PG!"", yo we have Derrick Rose"
"&gt; in a way that Rose wouldn't    I disagree if we’re talking about the current version of rose. The  current version of rose has a  basketball IQ that’s up there with rondo and other vet Pgs and the skills to take over in spurts. I don’t see why  current Derrick rose couldn’t run that  unit as good it not better than rondo did.  You would take rondo if you need a sure bet, but if risk is completely removed you’d be insane not to take the current version of rose imo."
"Same bro, I couldn’t believe how salty half the fanbase was. How could you write off Derrick fucking Rose... The disrespect."
Derrick Rose is an elite NBA point guard and I'm tired of pretending he's not
"In 2019, if someone told you that the Knicks FO would turn Dennis Smith Jr into prime Derrick Rose, what would you say?"
"Nah, we just ignore everyone but derrick rose highlights in that quarter 😂"

Thank you lord for Derrick Rose
i would kiss derrick rose
i would kiss derrick rose
Shout out to Derrick rose!
The only way to explain the last five minutes of this game is that Derrick Rose took a fat shit all over the grizzlies. If you don’t believe me watch the highlights
Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose cost us a 2nd and our 4th string PG
[I cant believe this man was here tonight](https://cdn.nba.com/manage/2018/10/derrick-rose-mvp-2011.jpg)  Also dont yell at Tony Brothers he dont like that shit. Melo knows that much
That was ugly in the 4th but I only have two words that I need to say:  DERRICK ROSE

He's done a great job reinventing himself as a bench leader much like derrick rose

Derrick rose can even play without getting hurt
"Anytime I see him pull some crazy clutch shot i'm like ""well yeah, he's still Derrick Rose"" ... Dude is a real baller."
Derrick Rose doesn’t deserve it more than Haywood lmao
They should. Someone like Derrick Rose deserves to be in the HoF more than someone like Lamarcus Aldridge or Spencer Haywood
Derrick Rose disproves that
"“People was throwing out different numbers with me saying if I’d play 26 minutes I would get injured, or crazy stories like that,” Rose said Sunday after scoring 24 points in 31 minutes against the Rockets. “Which I didn’t understand. Because in practice, you have an hour-and-a-half practice and I’m on my feet practicing for an hour-and-a-half, two hours during training camp and stuff like that.  “And they overlooked the practice. How do you overlook the one and a half hours, two hours I’m on the court in practice but tell me I can’t play more than 26 minutes in the game? It makes no sense,” Rose continued.  “Especially with the way I’m playing now. I’m not driving every time now. I changed my game. So I felt like it was always an excuse. And now Thibs is allowing me to be out there. I don’t pay attention to the minutes.”  https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-derrick-rose-20210503-eozcijpskfh5lbf6qwmnhu2o3u-story.html"
"I’m reminded of an old quote from MJ during his time with the Wiz. He said he was as good as he used to be, but he can only be that for a little while at a time. That’s where Derrick Rose is now, still really good, but can’t keep up that level of play for too long. His PER 36 numbers are All-Star caliber level production."
"I'd name my first child, girl or boy, Derrick Rose"
"Yeah you clearly didnt. No where in the Rose MVP argument in now or 2011 was the defense ever a question. He was not a defensive liability or even close to worse in the league. Pointing me to an article that states the bulls defense improves from 100-96.6 while he was on the bench doesn’t prove shit.  1) You do realize how NBA lineups work right? Derrick averaged 37 MPG that season, when he sat the best players on the opposing team sat. And he didn’t sit often.   2) Derrick was 2nd on the entire team in defensive win shares behind Luol Deng. He was not even close to being a liability or worst in the league. No player who is 2nd in DWS on the best defensive team in the league is one of the worst defensive guards in the league. John Lucas was the worst defensive guard on the Bulls and it wasn’t even close."
I would love the Knicks in the finals. Derrick Rose gets another chance at a ring? Make it fucking happen.
"I post this on every thread where Rose MVP comes up cause I know 85% of this sub probably never watched Rose play during that season and context is super important on why Rose clearly deserved MVP.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show (featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament).  MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were '04 KG &amp; '10 Lebron.  Rose was Chicago's entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.  Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose (the other two to pull this off were Lebron '09/Kobe '06).  No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG's in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT (14-25) on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q's (ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans). That's not MVP.  Lebron's own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers (and being Miami's go-to guy on crunch time shots).  26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG% Wade  Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?  Derrick's right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:  17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG% Boozer  Even Lebron's 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.  19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG% Bosh  Derrick didn't play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron's. Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.  Voter fatigued played no role in Rose's MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales that heavily is ridiculous.  To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn't have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG's to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.  The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the 2000/500 or 1900/600 groups. Making the 2000/600 club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.  In addition to everything else, don't forget that Rose's team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas 37 times that season.  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC's Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.  There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the '11 MVP award. Don't take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:  ""Derrick's probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.""  Jason Kidd  ""He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.  Steve Nash  ""Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP to me the way he's been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.""  Tyson Chandler  ""I'm gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.""  Magic Johnson  ""MVP of the season. He's playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.""  Michael Jordan  ""Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He's been tremendous down the stretch of games, he's been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he's headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.""  Scottie Pippen  ""You look at what he's done for his team, it's tough to argue D Rose isn't the MVP.""  Kevin Love  ""MVP. He's my MVP.""  Z-Bo after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.  ""He's to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.""  Mike D'Antoni  ""I look at 39 PTS &amp; I'm shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid's just out of this world. He's [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?""  Frank Vogel  ""I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He's missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That's remarkable.""  Charles Barkley  ""The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You've got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don't skip a beat. We've been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.""  Mike Breen  ""I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we're talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.""  Jeff Van Gundy  ""He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it's scary.""  Scott Skiles  ""Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn't be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It's a hard choice to make, he's affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I'd be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn't win it.""  Stan Van Gundy  ""I'm not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they're surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he'll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you're usually pretty good.""  Doc Rivers  ""I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He's literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.""  Phil Jackson  ""Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What's really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.""  Gregg Popovich  ""I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose.

Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.""  Chris Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball.""  Lebron when asked to weigh in on MVP race  ""I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.""  Brian Scalabrine  Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it."
"I know Derrick Rose isn't what he once was, but he's still a big name"
*future finals mvp Derrick rose
Derrick Rose actually took 9 more free throws that year.    The outside the lane argument is about efficiency. For people to say Rose was a better offensive player that year and that made him the clear cut winner is nonsense when he was that much better then the best defensive player on the offensive end.
And future MVP Derrick Rose.
I stopped reading and shed a tear at derrick rose making the list.  Mymvp
Not Westbrook hate.  It has nothing to do with Westbrook.  Derrick Rose was on his way to becoming an all time great when he was the youngest MVP in history.  Catastrophic injuries derailed his career.
"Probably Derrick Rose, he was the MVP at 22, destined to bring back Chicago to its former glory, and then he blew his knees."
"1) In your post, you only mentioned talent, not career. 2) At 22 (Full season before Rose got injured), Derrick Rose had a better regular season and playoffs than Westbrook did at 22. If you had only seen them up until that point of their career, you cannot say that WB was more talented than Rose. Rose was only getting better and better before his injury."
"Somehow had Isiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, and Jae Crowder, a weird fucking injured mix of malcontents.   Then trade them for Clarkson, Nance, George Hill, Rodney Hood, and Jeff Green, who all promptly have their talents stolen by the Mon-Stars."
I feel you man. I got this feeling in 2011   All under 25 players in 2011   Dwight howard   Cp3   Derrick rose   Kevin durant   Russell westbrook   Kevin love   Andrew Bynum   Rajon Rondo   Brandon Roy   Tyreke evans   Blake Griffin   These guys had me excited for the next decade    The future of the NBA is currently really bright.
The Greg Oden year was unfortunate because he had a catastrophic injury.  Without the injury he probably would have been the best big of the 2010 decade.  Similarly Derrick Rose was undoubtedly the best player and would continue to be without those terrible knee injuries.  Pre-injury he was the most explosive and exciting guard in the NBA.  Remember he was the MVP at the time and the youngest MVP of all time.  I think both of those deserve an asterisk to be honest.
Derrick Rose is the youngest mvp and he was only getting better bruh.
"Derrick Rose **WAS** better than RWB. Youngest MVP ever. Took Bulls to ECF as the solo star and lost to the super team of prime Wade, Lebron, and Bosh. Russ had KD, Harden, Ibaka, and couldn't take the Heatles to 6 games."
Derrick Rose was better than Westbrook.
"too much lost potential, to name a few: Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Vince Carter/Tracy McGrady, Derrick Rose, Paul George/Danny Granger, Gilbert Arenas...       not that the West didn't have its share, but these guys primes could've made the East much more competitive than the depressing Bud Hawks to Trash Bros era."
Derrick Rose was right.
"Russ had a bump in efficiency that year due to a career high in 3pt%, FT% and FTA. He never had the same efficiency since. You can't assume that Rose automatically gets better efficiency due to better spacing.   &gt; The entire purpose of this post is to assume Rose gets better lmao, so I don’t get that argument. Yes, it’s not a certainty, along with all hypotheticals.  No. Stephen A Smith said, and I quote ""Derrick Rose, if fully healthy is a better version than Russell Westbrook"" he didn't say ""could be"". We aren't using hypotheticals, we are using what we've seen as the benchmark, and using what we've seen, Westbrook is the better player. It's nitpicking, sure, but those were his words, not mine."
"He's the new Derrick Rose, he got injured so often it became a meme. Same thing with Porzingis."
So... I wonder why Derrick Rose had career altering injuries? Or why couldn't Vince Carter keep dunking over 7 footers past age 30? 🤔
&gt; i'm saying you cant compare someone with a fully healthy career to one  that lasted 4 years. you just shouldn't make the comparison. it's one of  those things we'll never know.   You can only make the comparison based on what we've seen. And the best of Russell Westbrook is better than the best we've seen from Derrick Rose.
Athleticism and durability are 2 entirely different things. Derrick Rose is one of the most athletic PGs ever but constantly was hurt in his prime. Same with Vince Carter
"You're comparing russ' entire nba career to a derrick rose who's career was ruined like 3 seasons in, your comment isn't valid"
Bad take. Rose was never averaging a 31 point triple double or averaging triple doubles for multiple seasons. Westbrook is a better version of Derrick Rose
"Uh, maybe you're forgetting Derrick Rose?"
"Most ""romantic"" timeline:   a 35 years old Derrick Rose returns to the Bulls (maybe his last season), back to wear jersey #1 and plays as 6th men.   Bulls barely reach the playoffs and Rose win the 6th man of the year award.  Bulls struggle to win series, Rose struggle a lot but somehow Bulls lead by Lavine reach the finals and at that point Rose suddenly goes on another level and lead them to the title.  I don't care that much about Rose or Bulls but I think this would be absolutely great for NBA."
derrick rose
Derrick Rose winding it back to 2011 by being the Bulls MVP
Both have 3 All-Stars.   Currently Rose is the only one with an MVP. Not to mention Rose actually has a record for youngest MVP ever.   If you are acting like Jokic has far surpassed Derrick Rose in career accolades so far in his career than I don’t know what to tell you.
"Derrick Rose comes off the bench, he doesn't start for us."
What about Derrick Rose?  I guess he didn't play with them the whole season but still. He changed things for New York.
*cries in Derrick Rose*
"Particularly in the East, where Middleton is fighting Durant, Giannis, Embiid, Tatum, Butler, etc for an All-Star spot.  Last year, when voting results rolled in for the Eastern Conference Guards, the 4th highest vote-getter was... Derrick Rose."
one first all-nba team guy through 10 years on east against him. One guy. Derrick Rose.
I don't know I think some one like Derrick Rose would take pride in being able to revolutionize his career into a very impactful role.
"Probably the worst-timed injury in NBA history. It feels the kind of injury that completely ruins a franchise, like Chris Webber in 2003 or Derrick Rose in 2012."
Derrick rose slept on smh
Derrick rose
Playing your star player in a game that's already over is exactly how Derrick rose tore his ACL
A lot of people debate if Derrick Rose should get in.   So he wouldn’t be a lock but would most likely get in
watch Derrick rose mvp highlights. my friend made me do that to get into basketball and it worked
derrick rose and MJ on the bulls
derrick rose?
Neither is Derrick Rose
"I’d disagree and I’m biased but context makes Rose’s mvp really impressive. Comparing MVP cases year to year is idiotic in the first place but I’m really sick and tired of people who never watched the NBA that year talk down what a player he was.  u/Poorchris from 6 years ago summed it up well:  Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP.

"This game proved the Knicks are for real, I think. In a game in which their most heavy usage guys (RJ and Randle) go 13-35, they still took the 2 seed in the west down to the wire.        Derrick rose looked great in his minutes. Take the Knicks two highest contributors out of the lineup — and they’ll still make you earn it. That’s such a turnaround from last year, and the Knicks should be hopeful"

"If that were the only criterion, Derrick Rose would be better than Stockton."
Derrick Rose scored 20 off the bench. Multiple games in a row. None of those guys can do that that you mentioned. You don’t watch Knicks games and it’s clear.  Knox is the worst defender in the league.  Obi is backing up the player who logged the most minutes this season  Frank is useless.
"Am I overreacting by saying this is the best I've seen Derrick Rose play since his early Chicago games? Dude just has a feel for the game and almost immediately provides a boost whenever he's in, from the playmaking to the timely floaters. He's gonna be huge for the Knicks in the playoffs."
Is Derrick Rose the best bench player in the league now?
Derrick rose imo even with homer bias. I’ve heard Brunson is super important to the Mavs too but I feel like rose is really the Knicks “starting” PG
Agreed and regardless Derrick Rose is one of the most famous basketball players out there. I think his peak is enough to get a nod. Maybe not first ballot but eventually.
Knicks were missing Derrick Rose for the first game and Mitchell Robinson for the second.  A starter and another guy who can be a starter and plays big minutes.  And yet the Hawks still lost both games.  We had a starter missing just like you did but still won.
Kyries is way more controlled. This guy just moves his body cause he can.  Kinda like a Derrick Rose Kyrie Irving mixture
"Longevity is just as important as peak though. Sure, prime is important, but look at how Grant Hill/Derrick Rose flamed out. They don’t even SNIFF the top 100 because of the lack of longevity."
"KD doesn’t have to be tier 1, because Steph and Dame are in 2 tiers by themselves, to be a range shooter. Just because there are 2 players better than him at it doesn’t mean that disqualifies him from the moniker.   Would you say for example Andrew Wiggins isn’t athletic because Lebron and prime Derrick Rose were both more athletic than him? Doesn’t make sense"
"Someone I haven't seen mentioned is derrick rose, and I think he will have a strong case to be in there."
No offense but  Youre a Derrick Rose fan calling a Top 2 all time player a bitch
"Derrick ""Patrick Bateman"" Rose: This is *Billions.* Great, great show. A personal favorite."
"Lifelong Bulls fan here, this Knicks team is giving me serious “Baby Bulls” vibes. A horrid stretch of years post Jordan, finally getting to the playoffs again with a group of talented but by no means superstar players. Rooting for the Knicks 1. Because every team deserves this kind of come up after years of shit seasons and 2. because I always want to see Derrick Rose win games. Y’all are the storyline of the season."
"Derrick Rose leaving the knicks for family matter during his first tenure. People were quick to hate on him there, saying he doesn’t care about turning his career around."
I mean it's not really fair to Casey. Any team that is fighting for 8th spot that loses a player like Derrick Rose is going to get a lot worse.
1.	Derrick Rose  2.	Gerald Green   3.	Michael Beasley  4.	Blake Griffin   5.	David Robinson   Just pure athleticism these the guys.

"&gt; Anyways, what else applies is your global impact on basketball. Derrick Rose is a superstar to this day in terms of his name. Basic NBA fans around the world know his name along side players like MJ, Lebron, Kobe, Melo, KD, etc. His popularity is way too high to not put him in the hall of fame.  Maybe I’m just ignorant, but what’s the evidence that Rose is this well known around the globe?  And that he’s more globally popular than say… Paul George or Jimmy Butler, who both have an Olympic gold and have been all-star and all-nba more than Rose.  Yet George and Butler are probably in that Joe Johnson category of falling just outside the hall of fame."
"He's making it, everyone forgets the hall of fame is not only about awards and stats. That being said with his awards alone he makes it. Gold medals and nba awards will get him in. Anyways, what else applies is your global impact on basketball. Derrick Rose is a superstar to this day in terms of his name. Basic NBA fans around the world know his name along side players like MJ, Lebron, Kobe, Melo, KD, etc. His popularity is way too high to not put him in the hall of fame.   This question also never makes sense to me, I feel like no one has even actually looked at the players in the Hall of fame. There's members with less accolades and achievements than Drose on that list."
He has absolutely no business making it. He had a tiny peak where he was good and then all nba level for a year and then hasn’t been all star worthy since then. I still think he ends up making it though because nobody hates Derrick rose and he’ll garner sympathy votes.
"There are a dozen guys who impacted the 2010s more than Derrick Rose: Kobe, Pau, Carmelo, Wade, Bosh, Curry, Klay, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi and arguably many more (and you already mentioned LeBron).  What exactly did Rose do that had a bigger impact than these guys?"
i'm sure derrick rose appreciates the sentiment as he does his daily scroll of r/nba
"Derrick Rose will make it, if you go through the HOF there’s so many guys with much less impressive careers that are way lesser known."
you also can't define the 2010 era of basketball without derrick rose  he is as influential a player in the 2010s as anybody besides lebron.  he'll get in for his impact on the culture alone
"Derrick Rose and John Wall are 2 that can think of. Although D Rose MIGHT make the HoF. Slim, but possible"
Especially after Derrick Rose ended Dragic's career
"People are ignoring the Chicago ties him, THT and AD share. THT and him both played for the Chicago powerhouse Simeon (for context, Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker also played for Simeon)."
"33 min a game is not what I'd consider ""letting him coast through the regular season and keeping him healthy""  They spent very little money on him and have guard depth, they can afford to keep him on a restriction of like 20-24 minutes if they have to. It's different when a team has Derrick Rose and Immanuel Quickley behind him instead of just Payton Pritchard and Jeff Teague or whatever Boston had."
If Derrick Rose doesn't go to the HOF he will be the only MVP in that situation.
Derrick Rose to NY still bothers me to this day.
Hell they gave more money to Derrick Rose who's about to be 33 and has missed over 15 games every season since he tore his ACL. Going to be going on 5 yrs now since he played over 50 games really.
"For sure, KD carried that 2010 team. I always remember that one because Derrick Rose showed what he was going to become in that tourney though. His stats weren’t necessarily eye popping but watching him that year was a revelation and he won MVP very soon after."
Derrick Rose injuries himself eating an apple in bed
"Fuck that I miss both😭. Obviously I’m a lifelong Nets fan, but Derrick Rose holds a special place in my heart as my favorite player of all time, as he was the person that made me fall in love with basketball. Been watching dude since highschool when I was 5-6 years old. Chicago is special to me"
Westbrook was a low seed and shouldn’t have won imo it’s not all about numbers. A lot of great players have had great seasons but don’t win because they are low seeds. The main reason he won was because the triple doubles. Derrick rose had a great season and lead his team to top team in his conference which also had the big 3 heat.
"Derrick Rose for Jerian Grant. I think everyone could tell the Rose era was over, but that made it official."
"Westbrook had an awesome season.  The narrative thing is so silly to say for him.  Is he one of he weaker MVPs in history? Yes.  But he was no weaker an MVP then Derrick Rose or Allen Iverson.  His supporting cast in fact was arguably weaker than both of teams.  At least Iverson had the 6moty, COTY, and DPOy on his squad.  Russ had to carry a really bad team that didn’t fit his skill set.  That being said Kawhi was the real KVP in 2017 and the playoffs proved that, but let’s not slander Russ when he was an actual difference maker."
"Nunn, maybe. Malik and THT hell no. They are not at the same level as guys like Clarkson or Jingles or Derrick Rose"

"i swear to God, I think Derrick Rose is straight up better than Westbrook"
Slightly on topic but it used to bother me so much how ESPN sweated Derrick Rose but used to trash Westbrook. Their games were so similar.   Found a great solution in just not watching ESPN.

Don't know why you're talking shit after your team traded two firsts for Vucevic and still finished with a worse record than us despite Lamelo and Hayward missing a bunch of time. The Bulls haven't been a true contender since Derrick Rose had his original knees and haven't won a title since the '90s. It's fine if you don't like the Oubre signing and I truly hope that your new signings work out for you. But talking down someone else's franchise to make yours look better by comparison is pretty pathetic.
The Raptors used to use our university's gym in the summer to train (this was before the 905 team existed).   Went in to lift with some buddies and Bosh and Kris Humphries were doing squats. Surprisingly everyone just left them alone. Gym bros being gym bros I guess.  Also played pickup against Will Solomon on our open court hours that summer. He was basically as unstoppable as prime Derrick Rose while going like 50%.
1. Prime Derrick rose 2. Kobe 3. KD 4. Lebron 5. Curry 6. Prime melo 7. Dwade  8. Harden 9. Westbrook 10. Deaaron fox
"One thing is the personal issues. I'm not saying any thing about Schroder himself, but have you ever worked with someone who thinks that he should be paid more and is already looking to leave? it's a nightmare.  He thinks that the season with the Lakers destroyed his chances of getting paid, and we talk here about a difference of 20 millions. He will clearly be unhappy, the Lakers will need him to be a bench player which will hurt his chances more to get paid next year.   His best option is to pull a derrick rose kind of contract. Even though he is no Rose, he can go one year to a small team for MLE and work his ass off."
Modern medicine and training along with him not having a game that heavily relied on his athleticism.  Even then plenty of players that did heavily rely on athleticism have changed their games up to account for loss of it if they’ve had injuries (Derrick rose and Blake Griffin for example).
Derrick Rose still got a lot of game left in him if they give him more minutes and design plays for him.
"As far as recently, I was at both of those games at the United Center where LeBron and Derrick Rose traded game winning shots in 2015, I was also at Game 6 of that legendary first-round between the Bulls and the Celtics where Ray Allen dropped a 50 piece but the Bulls still got one, and given the magnitude of the moment I guess I would also say game 1 in 97 where Jordan hit the buzzer beater over Russell , that one was great for a number of reasons"
Derrick Rose was like the last superstar I remember that didn't do that shit  Melo didn't really at his peak. Also Curry probably  But yeah everyone else does lol
"I 100% agree that's actually why at the end I think Derrick Rose is probably a better fit for the Monta comp.  Side note It feels strange having someone respond back respectfully in this sub. I like you, upvoted."
Derrick Rose 50 points game.
i'd rather have Derrick Rose. and the Knicks get all those other guys too
"in 2017, Cleveland had: Larry Sanders, Andrew Bogut, Deron Williams, Derrick Williams, James Jones and Richard Jefferson for a little over $5M  In 2018 they had: Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Larry Nance, Jeff Green, Marcus Thornton and Jose Calderon for like $9M"
"Nah, I follow the Bulls very heavily. Derrick Rose is my favorite player and will continue to be. No need for that shade my guy."
"The Knicks gave Derrick Rose, Evan Fournier, Noel $43+ million per year. Doesn’t seem great, (RIP my inbox) but I do like the Randle extension and the Kemba snag though."
Our playoff roster was Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson
And he’s headed to the Knicks to play with superstar Julius “Beyblade” Randle and MVP Derrick Rose. League is le fucked.

"I feel like I have said ""holy fuck booker is fast"" at least 15 times in the last few months  his raw speed reminds me of prime derrick rose"
"Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Nerlens Noel.  That team would get a few wins against some starting lineups.  Its the Knicks, all day."
melo should have been on the team. derrick rose too. Dame isn't cutting it and Tatum just doesn't move the ball.
Derrick Rose is younger than Steph Curry
Derrick Rose gets more money.
He should pray that he can make something out of the rest of his career like Derrick Rose.  He's lucky he got the minimum.
Why would they give him more money? He's lucky they even offered him the minimum.   He should pray the rest of his career works out like Derrick Rose or something.
"Really depends on how Kemba plays, but he's got a good shot.  His competition is:   * Marbury constantly prioritizing his 20 points and 8 assists (or whatever arbitrary mark he was after, it's been like 15 years, I don't remember exactly what it was anymore);  * Jeremy Lin putting up 24/9a/4r over a 7 game wining streak in February of 2012 (""Linsanity"");  * Raymond Felton putting up 17/9 (first stint in 10-11);  * Derrick Rose last year (15/4 off the bench, 19/5 as our best player in the playoffs);  * Raymond Felton 12-13 (14/5, starter on a 54 win team);  * 105 year old Jason Kidd;  * Derrick Rose ""We Men"" year."
I don’t get how people keep ranking New York above Chicago after we saw what happened in the playoffs.  Randle shot 30% in the playoffs. RJ disappeared at times. They’re best performer was Derrick Rose.
"While I do agree with most of your sentiments, I do think expecting improvement at every position is unrealistic. Derrick Rose for example will probably see a minutes decline as well as a minimized role. Randle will likely see a decline since he doesn’t have to carry the offensive load as much. Fournier is an above average nba player and will drop you 15+ a game and someone is gonna suffer because of that. I get what you’re saying about the quality improvement, but in reality you should expect declines based on lack of opportunity"
MVP: Luka Doncic  ROTY: Cade Cunningham   6MOTY: Derrick Rose  DPOY: Nikola Jokic  MIP: Lonzo Ball  COTY: Steve Nash
"I know he had been unhealthy for a while but is his issues a chronic/degenerative this or just a series of bad luck.   I guess what I'm asking is, is he Derrick rose or Brandon Roy?"
"Derrick rose, jalen rose, Malik rose"
"I mean yes, but also, what a smug ass comment. “Oh, are ALL OF YALL SO AGGRESSIVE, uh, seriously like I’m wondering”   Some valley girl, basic bitch response.   Text does not translate well, yet no one seems to keep that in mind, and at the same time, read responses with the worst possible inferred “tone”.  Kinda like what I did just now, except I bet I’m right, and you meant to be smug.  I wasnt being hot-headed, it was more “dude, really? Or are you fucking with me?” Cause to say “the Knicks are dumb for signing derrick rose, they shouldve gotten Buddy Hield” is so absurd.  I said thrice, thibs made him and MVP and they went far together. Wouldve may be won it all if Rose didnt die for a bit. Notice Rose followed thibs everywhere. His relationship to him is insanely important, especially for youngsters. He also balled the fk out. And his price is not high.  Otherwise, there’s not even another PG, because saying “rose signing dumb” is insane on its own. Considering what I said AND MORE (not yelling, imagine its in bold, emphasis) how valuable he is, but also WE NEED ANOTHER PG. If we didnt, still such an important signing, but we need a starting PG. clearly there isnt a market this off-season.   But why youre trolling and why my coffee fueled, poop-break rants are done, is because for your answer you said Buddy Hield.  Not a PG, not even a ball handler, and a terrible value and fit. Like…what?"
Derrick Rose and Lebron in Cleveland.
Part of 17-18 had Steph and KD as well as Lebron and Derrick Rose
"I would agree with your ranking, all things equal. But back in 2011, all of us kids wanted to be Derrick Rose. We didn't give a shit about Jay Cutler."
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
I kinda like that the Knicks are becoming rivals for us because of this last playoff series and can see them being a rival for a while as long as both teams stay good. I guess I’m most jealous that we don’t have a backup PG as good as Derrick Rose.
We were definitely a Bulls town at the height of the Derrick Rose years.
"If Murray is healthy Nuggets r tier 1 Celtics r also tier 2 imo   Hawks are tier 2.5, they had a nice run, but beating a Knicks team that had Reggie bullock/Derrick rose as their 2nd option is whatever. Also that sixers roster continues to be flawed along as embiid and simmons r together."
derrick rose caused the supermax? damn
"Trae Young but it isn’t really officially named after him.   Derrick Rose rule: Rose won his MVP while playing on his rookie contract, allows young stars in the NBA to qualify for a higher maximum salary–30% of the cap instead of 25%–early in their careers.  Arenas Provision:  Put in the 2005 CBA to help teams to keep their young restricted free agents who aren't coming off rookie scale contracts. Think Lakers/THT is the most recent example."
"If you're a Kings fan you probably know about him more than me, but Fox is more fast and beats his man with a quick step for most of his points which is good while young but we've seen fast players like John Wall and Derrick Rose fall apart and lose their game. Although Ja is fast as well, his game is much more balanced and in my opinion will develop and age much more gracefully with age than Fox's. Ja has two more years to catch up to Fox and he has all the ability to do that and even more"
"I couldn’t disagree more. Chicago is a big market. It’s the biggest market outside of NY/LA. But for too long, they’ve played the “small market game” under GarPax, where they basically relied on drafting, and sometimes it was successful (see MVP Derrick Rose.) but too many times, I consistently felt they resorted towards excuses usually given out by the Grizzlies, Pacers, and Jazz (no disrespect to them, it is what it is.)  But *finally* they are big dick swinging in free agency and actually using that big Chicago market to their advantage. DeRozan has no ties? *Who gives a shit, we’re fucking Chicago* like the LA teams do every year.  For me, it’s not about the perfect fit or team-building in the right way - it’s about the bigger picture here.  The Bulls need a consistent run of actual tangible competence. If they are first round exits for the next few years, that’s not the point. They need to be able to show they can get to the playoffs consistently over a long period of time. Then they’ll be able to attract bigger and bigger fish.  Someone can correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe when AD was asked if he ever come home, I believe he alluded to the Bulls being dysfunctional at the time as his biggest hesitation."

The best comeback story ever will always be Dirk in 2011 unless Derrick Rose somehow wins a ring in a main role on a team
Call up Derrick Rose
"Do you think 18 points, 2.5 assists, and 4 rebounds are starter-quality stats? What about 14.9 points, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 rebounds?  The first is Jordan Clarkson, and the second is Derrick Rose. Both of these guys were sixth men. Clarkson’s stats mirror the one Schroeder had while in OKC when he came off the bench, while Rose’s stats are pretty close to what Schroeder averaged this year.   Schroeder couldn’t get going even when we put the ball in his hands. He’s been a starter for 3/8 years in the nba, including getting to the starting role in Atlanta only to be sent right back to the bench when he got to OKC. He started for us, but he might as well have not been in that lineup with how mediocre he was. Hell, him and Caruso basically did the same thing.   Having seen him play for 60 some games, I can confidently say he’s one of the worst starting point guards in the league, but would be solid as the first option off the bench. That’s a role he thrived in. Even for us, the best he played was when he was up against the backup PG while he was with the second unit."
 bulls fan virtue signaling while the fanbase kisses the ground derrick rose walks on is pretty funny
"I’m really curious, why is Derrick Rose not in the starting line-up? He’s still absolutely amazing."
Every other guard signing for market value to even pretty cheap destroys his hopes of getting paid on top of his shit playoffs.  Derrick Rose really killing it in the playoffs and only signing for 3yr/$43M is the bar.
"The guardian article? You linked an opinion piece instead of an actual article. Even if you read the guardian article, nothing Derrick Rose said was wrong. If a guy texts you at 1 am trying to come over, obviously it’s for hooking up."

"The absolute hit job on derrick rose was criminal during those proceedings.  Racial tactics were used with intent to damage his reputation, truth be damned."
"Reminds me of that year the cavs had lebron, dwade, and derrick rose lol"
They got rid of All-Star eligibility in the 2017 CBA. There are three scenarios through which a player can earn a Derrick Rose Rule (rookie 30%) or Super Max (vet 35%) extension:   1) make All-NBA or win DPOY in the final year of the current contract  2) make All-NBA or win DPOY in 2 of the final 3 years of the current contract  3) win MVP at least once in the final 3 years of the contact
"Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Isaiah Thomas, Jeff Green, Richard Jefferson..."
"Yes it is   &gt;The rule allows a player finishing his rookie contract to make 30 percent of a team's salary cap -- up from 25 percent -- if he's twice been voted an All-Star starter, twice been voted All-NBA or won an MVP award. Rose, 23, is the reigning MVP.   https://www.espn.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/7294815/chicago-bulls-derrick-rose-surprised-derrick-rose-rule"

derrick rose vs monta ellis
Getting kinda mad that Derrick Rose absolutely blew up the Bucks shit two games in a row and then he rocks up to an important game for the Knicks to win and has 3/1/1 in ten minutes.
So starting meaning the player who started the most games for each team at pg? Because Derrick Rose at least made the cut on NBA stats with the starter filter.
"&gt;3 actually  KD was injured in the final the 3 season. So 2.   &gt;And Derrick Rose has more MVPs than Wade  Yeah? what's your point. We are talking about top players here.   &gt;Highly team-reliant. You essentially only win it if you win the ring, which depends on your team situation. Is it really fair to hold 2015 against Lebron, for example, given the injuries to his team? Would Jordan still have 6 rings if Pippen and Grant/Rodman both got injured for one of the Finals?  Neither Pippen nor Grant was all stars when they won their first ring, and Rodman was washed as fuck when they won in 1998.   &gt;Yet he lost earlier than the Finals a few times, which is why this is one of the worst arguments in all of sports discourse. It implies that losing before the Finals is preferable to something like 07 Bron, where he gets penalized for carrying a mediocre team farther than it should have gone.  It's a choke argument. When Jordan had any semblance of a team he won. Lebron has quit and choked several finals even when be the odds on favourite. No one holds him losing in 2009 against him, losing in 2012 and too the spurs is a different matter.   &gt;And faced generally worse teams than Lebron has. Also the Bulls &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Cavs. Picked up a GOAT coach and an all-time 2nd option within 3-5 years of MJ getting drafted.  Lebron lost finals to the Mavericks, the Spurs and GSW, despite forming several super teams. Most of his wins came against teams with less talent. Pippen again wasn't an all star during the first and last championship. Lebron played with a better player in Wade. He also played with tons of other all nba level players in Kyrie, AD, Bosh, Love etc.   &gt;No, it clearly isn't.     Yes it clearly is."
Only reason I know this is because Derrick Rose
"&gt; The ""KD warriors"" literally existed for two seasons.  3 actually  &gt; Jordan also has more MVP's  And Derrick Rose has more MVPs than Wade  &gt; more FMVP  Highly team-reliant. You essentially only win it if you win the ring, which depends on your team situation. Is it really fair to hold 2015 against Lebron, for example, given the injuries to his team? Would Jordan still have 6 rings if Pippen and Grant/Rodman both got injured for one of the Finals?  &gt; 100% win record in the finals  Yet he lost earlier than the Finals a few times, which is why this is one of the worst arguments in all of sports discourse.

And faced generally worse teams than Lebron has. Also the Bulls &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Cavs. Picked up a GOAT coach and an all-time 2nd option within 3-5 years of MJ getting drafted.  &gt; So the whole ""team succes"" argument is kind of bullshit.  No, it clearly isn't."
It has Derrick Rose as pg though and higher than both balls
Derrick Rose second among all guards despite coming off the bench. Only behind Curry.
"Look at Steph Curry, a loving father to his kids and a faithful husband. Look at LeBron, exact same thing. LOOK AT DERRICK ROSE, overcoming a fall from grace and accepting his role as a FATHER. Ben Simmons is a 25-year-old who just had a city of millions rip him, destroy his confidence, and wreck is psyche, and all you can see is a ""little hissy fit."" Really disgusting and sad what a lack of empathy you have for these human beings.   Let me be clear, I don't agree with what Ben Simmons is doing – I think he should be playing – but don't act like facing mental struggles over the brutal reaction he got to that performance makes him not a ""man."" Your jealousy is showing, and it's horrifically ugly"

"Derrick Rose is absolutely filthy. He's 2nd in total RAPTOR and 5th in RAPTOR WAR and I really think anyone who watched last night's game sees why.       Rose on the floor breaks down defenses, moves the ball, can shoot lights out, and facilitates. He is shooting 49% from 3 on ~4 attempts per game. Full stats (per game): 23.2mpg, 13/3/3 on 47/49/93 shooting splits. But he can absolutely take over still.         Randle has got to stop with his game. It's awful to watch. As opposed to Rose running sets, getting guys running off ball, Randle is a black hole. When he gets the ball, he turns his back to the basket, the other 4 players move to let him ISO and stand around doing nothing. Randle will then take a stupid shot (turnaround fadeaway, step back deep 2, all highly contested) with 10 seconds on the clock. It's such low IQ basketball compared to Rose being the primary handler.       For reference, Randle is taking  ~7.5 FGA per game from 3 feet to 23 feet (mid range). He is shooting just 36% on these. If we focus on 10-23 feet, he's taking 5.34 of those per game and shooting a **horrid** 31%.       Randle's game is killing the Knicks this year as opposed to last year. It sucks out all of the momentum to watch one guy go back to the basket every possession with 0 off-ball movement just to throw up a gross brick.       This is why the Knicks starters are *awful* +/- this year while the bench is extremely good."

Derrick Rose could have/can actually still do it - DPOY being the tough one. There is no other case as unique as Rose tbh
"""What are you doing Dragic??!?!? Did you not get the Memoo?? Derrick Rose can GO. UP. STAIRS!""  one of the Goat calls imo"
Shoutout Derrick Rose
There's a very specific reason Derrick Rose has not been a starter in like 5-6 years now. He's coming off the bench and it's perfect for him. Kemba is bad but he's much better than the PG they were starting last year
"*D-Rose dunks on on Dragic*  ""Dragic, did you not get the memo?!?!?"" ""Derrick rose can go upstairs"""
Punishment. For the Knicks hubris. Just like Derrick Rose is punishment for the Bucks' hubris.
"Derrick Rose is legitimately a phenomenal player still and the best player on the Knicks IMO. His plus minus is INSANE this year. When he’s in, he facilitates, makes good decisions, plays great defense, and shoots absolute lights out these days.        Randle’s game is kinda shitty to watch. When he’s leading, as opposed to Drose running plays, he just backs down a player into a contested turnaround fadeaway brick with 10 seconds left on the shot clock. And he’s shooting under 35% on those yet takes at least 6 per game lol."
I cannot cope with Derrick Rose.
I was enjoying the small early lead and then I remembered Derrick Rose is here.
I did not think the Derrick rose trade was going to be a big deal.  I just assumed he was already washed and would be constantly injured and also no jump shot.   D rose feels like he’s rejuvenated and reinvented himself - I’m shocked and impressed by his 3 ball.  His first stint on the Knicks was a nightmare so I was expecting the worst - instead it was the complete opposite.   Another homer take - RJ Barrett is gonna be an all star caliber player in one or two years
"He still does that, and it isn't related to going for a foul. He was taught and encouraged to do so to protect his ankles after those two years of ankle problems. It is actually one of the major reasons for Derrick Rose getting those knee injuries for a while, till he was also taught to fall instead of trying to stressfully land."
"His lack of outstanding numbers, longevity or accolades. The same reason he won't get in now lol you guys always confuse your sentimentality towards Derrick Rose for him having a HoF-worthy career, which he does not"
"In terms of ability, yes. However, take ability and price tag into account and I think he's right. The difference between Rubio's salary and DLo's salary is a Jordan Clarkson or a Derrick Rose or a Marcus Smart or a  Pat Bev.  Once you factor in DLo's 29.5m price tag and I'll take Rubio and Clarkson. I'll take Lonzo + Caruso. I'll take LaVine + Seth Curry. I'll take Murray and Rose."
"Okay, but can we talk about Derrick Rose being #2 in overall RAPTOR. Mostly noise by the defensive differential between him and Kemba, but it's not *all* noise."
"Derrick Rose is a very intriguing case. For one thing, even at the time that he won MVP, there were a lot of people who thought he shouldn’t have won it. Also, D Rose’s MVP season came juuust before pace and 3 point shooting truly exploded. He averaged 25 and 7 in 2010-11, his best season. Great numbers, but if you stacked them up next to today’s stars they don’t look like anything crazy. Damian Lillard averaged 29 and 7 last year, 30 and 8 the year before, and came in 7th and 8th in MVP voting in those years. I feel that D Rose might be stuck in that middle ground, where his peak numbers are compared with many of today’s stars, despite being from a truly different era of basketball.  I think Rose would have put up huge numbers had we gotten the chance to see him at the height of his powers for the last decade, but unfortunately we were robbed of that chance. I don’t think he has the resume to warrant being a Hall of Famer. However, he has also carved out a nice career for himself after the injury, so I won’t say it’s impossible he gets in. He was a great college player and had a legendary NCAA tournament run to the championship game, although they lost and the whole season was later vacated. He was at one point considered by many to be the best player in the league and has an MVP award to solidify that claim. He has legendary status as a “what could have been” story, and for that reason I think he could possibly still get in."
what notable accomplishments does he have outside of the NBA though? His college career was vacated and i guess he has two FIBA golds as a lower level contributor but that’s not all that impressive. The statement that it’s not the NBA HOF but the basketball HOF is more so for players with legendary college or international careers that would help push them over the edge if they are borderline NBA HOFers like Bill Walton or Manu Ginobili but Derrick Rose doesn’t have any great accomplishments outside of his first few years
" &gt;The argument goes like this: LeBron, newly of the Miami Heat, put up an MVP caliber season and deserved to win. But, because of lingering resentment from The Decision, voters gave the MVP to Derrick Rose instead.  This line of thinking is very reductionist.   &gt;Here are the stats: Rose: 25 points, 4.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.0 steals, .6 blocks, 44.5% shooting, 33.2% from three. 81 Games Played.  LeBron: 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.6 steals, .6 blocks, 51% shooting, 33.0% from three. 79 Games Played.   So outside of rebounds and fg% they're basically the same. Not sure those two categories alone are swinging the MVP vote considering it is an award that takes a lot of things into account, including narrative.    &gt;In addition to putting up better stats across the board, LeBron had to learn a new system, run by a new coach, and how to play with ball dominant stars.   Again, their stats aren't that far apart. Regarding the system/coach/other stars aspect. No one, and I do mean no one, is taking this into consider when voting for LeBron James for mvp in 2011."
"&gt;What about the role one plays on a team and their new circumstance? Why is that “an excuse”? Isn’t that literally the argument made for players who missed time due to injury?  Its an excuse cause you use it as such. You use that to explain why Lebron failed to secure 1st seed with a superteam. MVP award is not going to care about anything else than the fact that you failed.   The injury argument is not an excuse for anything. In fact, its the opposite of an excuse. Rose got the best record in the league *with* an injury riddled roster with no allstars. He didn't need to use any excuses.  &gt;What was LeBron supposed to say after the team underperformed expectations and lost the championship? Everyone hated him. Imagine how much more people would have hated him if he said “btw I deserved the mvp that beloved superstar Derrick Rose just won”. Come on, that’s not a real argument.  What? I thought you said you watched back then? Cause this doesn't make any sense. The MVP award was handed out during the playoffs back then, not after the finals. Lebron, his coach and teammates said this *before the regular season was finished* in like march or early april. Not after losing the finals, they said it *before* anyone knew who would win.  Literally EVERYONE knew Rose deserved it back then. You *really* dont remember?"
"So if it’s not an award for best player, then you’re saying other factors go into the decision beyond stats. Great! I agree. What about the role one plays on a team and their new circumstance? Why is that “an excuse”? Isn’t that literally the argument made for players who missed time due to injury?  I absolutely was following the NBA back then. It seems you weren’t since you don’t remember the absurd vitriol directed at LeBron every single day. What was LeBron supposed to say after the team underperformed expectations and lost the championship? Everyone hated him. Imagine how much more people would have hated him if he said “btw I deserved the mvp that beloved superstar Derrick Rose just won”. Come on, that’s not a real argument."
"He was not a better player than dwight, which is my point. And to be honest that doesn't mean he should be there. After all, Derrick Rose isn't on there.  And really, it's just ridiculous how well regarded Cowens was in the first place. We are talking about a center who never had a FG% even near 50% in his entire career. He was overrated because he was on boston and it was the years following the Russell celtics. Everyone focused on them."
James Johnson has a black belt and does mma on the side. Derrick rose once stayed at a hotel that was said to haunted. He ended up bunking with James Johnson cuz he was afraid and felt if there was a ghost JJ would kick its ass lol
Derrick Rose for the Thibullwolvesknicks.  James Jones for the LebronJames.
That’s not Derrick Rose
"Oh believe me not I only do I not care, I actually prefer it this way lmao. If this dogshit sub was praising every move the Knicks made then I’d know we’re fucked.   Go back and look at the r/nba brain trust reaction to the hiring of Leon Rose, the hiring of Thibs, the draft selection of Immanuel Quickley, and the trade to bring back Derrick Rose lol. This place couldn’t be more clueless if it tried.  My thing with Nerlens is I wanted some diversity with our bigs because him and Mitch are very similar in a lot of ways. I was hoping to maybe bring back Robin Lopez on a 1 year $6M deal or something to have a big who can bang down low in the post. But Nerlens is good and the contract should be moveable so it’s fine."
How did the Bulls go from Jordan AND Pippen to Derrick Rose to Lonzo Ball?
Love Derrick Rose on the Knicks
"[Derrick Rose](http://bleacherreport.com/derrick-rose) is running it back with head coach Tom Thibodeau and the [New York Knicks](http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-knicks) after agreeing to a three-year, $43 million contract with the team Monday, per ESPN's [Adrian Wojnarowski](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1422349393659838465).  Rose began the 2020-21 season with the [Detroit Pistons](http://bleacherreport.com/detroit-pistons) before New York acquired him in February for guard Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2021 second-round draft pick"
Get that bread Derrick Rose. Boy deserves it
did you not watch derrick rose last season? dude deserves that money and more
Former MVP Derrick Rose would disagree
"Derrick Rose has agreed to a three-year, $43M deal to return to the New York Knicks"
Shoutout to Derrick rose
Derrick Rose
"It's a Big 3 in the way that the Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis Knicks were [""a superteam.""](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/87453086) 😂"
plz don't let Derrick Rose leave NY 😥
Lol bubble jimmy really got some of you fooled. Derrick rose and it’s not even close. Guy was a top 2 player in the league for multiple years and challenged lebron. Jimmy has done nothing besides one finals run in the bubble during a pandemic. Never been considered a top 5 player
"Rose was a MVP, jimmy was never even top 5 in voting. Derrick roses peak is way higher, but when you consider whole career, it's jimmy."
Derrick Rose with jimmy buckets knees is the best player
"Sad to say but Derrick Rose is probably in that category. Also Horace Grant, Joakim Noah, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, and maybe Jimmy Butler. Butler probably has a better chance than Rose."
"Lots.  Derrick Rose. He was setting up to be a huge rival for my Cavs but after the injury and his short time playing for us I can’t help but root for him.  Jordan Clarkson. I was just an overall angry person in 2018-19. Watching the Cavs wasnt any fun, and when JORDAN CLARKSON and RODNEY HOOD are your 1 &amp; 2 options, it’s gonna make you a pessimist. I gave him a lot of shit but I’m glad he became an important player on a contender. He deserves it"
"I agree the finals mvp is a big deal for his legacy. The better playoff record probably has to come with the caveat that Pierce’s supporting cast was better than carmelos.  At the end of the day Carmelo wasn’t in the same tier of star as a lebron or Kobe who could will a crappy team above its potential, and he didn’t do his legacy any favors by refusing to play for the Derrick rose bulls. But it’s interesting  to see how the perception of him has changed, he was considered to be better then pierce when they were both playing."
ion watch this. seeing derrick rose and spencer dinwinddie over dejounte murray was astonishing enough for me to not see any od these lists anymore
Derrick Rose game winner was fun though
The one area where I'll disagree is that during his 8 year streak there weren't any other theats.   The Derrick Rose bulls were incredible (and the 1 seed) in 2011   The Pacers were really *really* good and could've had a defense-minded Pistons-style run to the finals   Anyone who watched the 2012 playoffs knows the Celtics would've beat the Thunder in the finals  and that's ignoring the fact that it's well known most teams couldn't recruit superstars in the east because Lebron was such a beast.
Tbf the T-Wolves also had MVP Derrick Rose for a hot minute when he dropped 50
That’s not true. You had MVP Derrick Rose for a hot minute.
"The 2nd biggets “What if” in NBA history, right below Derrick Rose"
Player - Derrick Rose 100%  Team - Clippers just for shits and giggles
"I find there's a lot of focus on this sub and elsewhere about the things players can't do. Like, Rudy Gobert couldn't guard 2010 Derrick Rose 1 on 1. Well guess what, nobody can do *everything*. LeBron may have come closest, but he's a top 2 player of all time.   Let's appreciate Kawhi for what he does well, which is a whole lot of things"
Not that Dennis Smith Jr did much for us either.   It was really the Tim Hardaway Jr for Derrick Rose trade. Win-win :)
They already have a Derrick Rose
I share a birthday with Derrick Rose and Tyrese Maxey
"I like the Derrick Rose comp more, Ja is an insane athlete with good vision. Bad shooters too lol."
Oh shoot Derrick Rose would be super interesting! I obv want him back on the Knicks but damn... I'd love that
julius randle was an all star  RJ + quickley + 3 first round picks + 2 first round swaps for dame  plus you can take something else that might be nice like mitchell or derrick rose if we sign+trade him
All players at their peak:  Derrick Rose vs Russell Westbrook  Kareem vs Tim Duncan  Anthony Davis vs Kevin Garnett
Randle was a beast this year but our success was very much a collective effort from all our guys. We got smoked by the Hawks because the collective sucked. Only Derrick Rose was good and consistent
"2007 was a outlier year and he carried, but the east was weak basically from 1999 to 2019. Pathetically weak, lacking all NBA players.   Can you tell me what all time greats he was going through in the east?  Or even still, which all NBA players he faced? Because it was literally just one in the Derrick Rose in 2011. His teams, largely due to him but his supporting cast too, always was heavily better than the teams he went up against."
"Man I was in Phoenix last Feb when you guys played the Derrick Rose Pistons. Blake was out. Rubio was still there.   You lost (Rose balled out and as a Bulls fan, that was great to see) but I left the arena completely impressed. Book is good, Ayton is good, Cam Johnson is good. CP3 is a god.   Your bubble performance wasn't surprising and this show you're currently putting on isn't either. You guys are very nice"
"I'll just copy-paste what I wrote in that thread  &gt; I'm sure (LeBron) is disappointed and frustrated, and he can clean it up later with personal messages or talking to the media.  &gt; But it takes a big person to do it in the moment, just look at Derrick Rose earlier. I'm sure he was thrilled to be back in the playoffs and frustrated to see their magical run come to an end, but he still stayed.  It's cool that LeBron eventually got around to it and the media/fans always blow it out of proportion. But anyone who's played in competitive sports knows that it really matters to swallow your pride and end the competition on good terms.  Maybe LeBron did enough with Booker and others and none of the Suns took it personally. But it was just surprising to see him walk away after his mixed effort, meanwhile so many of the other Lakers stayed."
is current day Derrick Rose supposed to be anything close to 2016 Playoffs Kyrie?
So how good he actually was doesn't matter? He clearly hasn't been the same since his injuries in Minnesota. If team Derrick Rose up with Luka and KP are they a super team?
Forgive me if this sounds harsh but the Knicks just got destroyed by the Hawks and their best player for most of the series was Derrick Rose who plays the same position as Dame.  I don't think that's the type of team Dame would want to leave Portland for.
"Didn’t Rondo say that to him? I vaguely remember Rondo taunting either CP3 or Derrick Rose during a post-season game when Rondo was on the Celtics with something like “I got a ring, you ain’t never gonna win one”"
"That is not really true. Outside of Derrick Rose, who Lillard would replace, the Knicks team was pretty bad in the playoffs. In a vacuum Julius Randle is better than any of the Blazers players individually, but that's not really an ideal supporting cast. Also are we even sure that Randle is going to keep up his anomalous scoring rate?"
"Bro I’m big into politics and have debated people on topics insanely more nuanced than this and have fully understood their point lol. I just had no idea what you were getting at until now, of which that comment I still don’t agree on. Leg injuries are insanely difficult to overcome as an athlete’s main tool without some lingering issue even as a younger player, a la Derrick Rose, a la Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, and Kawhi."
"Because Thibs promised him to be the closer role --which he was earlier-- but they replaced him with Derrick Rose, and threw him in garbage minutes."
"Seriously and if this were Kawhi or PG on the Clippers, they'd be getting destroyed for weeks after. I'm sure he's disappointed and frustrated, and he can clean it up later with personal messages or talking to the media.  But it takes a big person to do it in the moment, just look at Derrick Rose earlier. I'm sure he was thrilled to be back in the playoffs and frustrated to see their magical run come to an end, but he still stayed.  Well at this point I guess it doesn't matter to the Suns, they're moving on."
Alternative title: Did Derrick Rose seal his own First Round Exit ?
I hope if it's a blow out they sit booker and ayton  Coming from a Bulls and Derrick Rose fan... It's not worth keeping your stars in when they don't need to be
He's above Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant have got to be in the top 10 of revered rapists right up there with Roman Polanski
"Quick rundown of every team in the league:  Boston Celtics: a corp of young players, exciting to watch, however aren’t quite good enough to make noise in the playoffs yet. In the past they have been one of the most dominant teams in sports history winning 17 titles, tied with the Lakers for first. Very storied franchise with a passionate fanbase.  New York Knicks: one of the wealthiest franchises but are a joke as they tend to have a history of disappointment and missing out on big free agent signings. They make it into the playoffs every 5-10 years and are always fun to watch when they’re good. Large and passionate fanbase.  Brooklyn Nets: went from being a joke and a backwater in New Jersey to being one of the wealthiest and most renowned franchises in a matter of a decade. They have a super team built around three all stars and are heavy favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference and possibly win the title. Tends to have a lot of fair weather fans.  Philadelphia 76ers: another storied franchise with some of the NBA’s greatest players ever. After a fairly successful rebuild they are a playoff staple and are currently the highest seeded team in the Eastern Conference.  Washington Wizards: a fairly mediocre team that’s pretty fun to watch. They are going to have to start rebuilding soon I’d say.  Charlotte Hornets: an up and coming team that had previously been an absolute dumpster fire of a franchise. They have young talent galore and are on pace to becoming the NBA’s next big thing.  Atlanta Hawks: formerly a fairly mediocre team that made the playoffs but never actually did much. The Hawks get better every year and are in a position to make a deep playoff push and maybe even contend with the other big East teams.  Orlando Magic: a franchise tht always lands good players in the draft, but always loses them to bigger markets. Entering a total rebuild at the moment.  Miami Heat: a solid franchise that was infamous for its super team in the early 2010s. They made a surprise run to the finals last year but this is mostly due to the conditions of that season. Young and old talent alike and a decently fun team to watch.   Cleveland Cavaliers: a miserable franchise that has only ever been relevant because of LeBron James. Right now they are amongst the worst teams in the league as per usual.   Detroit Pistons: feared in the late ‘80s for their physical play and again in the early 2000s for their finals run, the Pistons, just like Detroit, are a far cry from their glory days. In the middle of a big rebuild.  Indiana Pacers: best summary of this franchise, bad luck. The pacers always put up decent teams for the most part and have a solid history but always are good in a time where the Eastern Conference is fierce with competition.  Chicago Bulls: internationally one of the NBA’s most famous teams. Michael Jordan, the best player of all time played here. Watching the last dance must have given you a decent amount of information about the Bulls. Since that 1997-98 season however, the Bulls have never even touched any semblance of their former glory (except maybe with Derrick Rose in the early 2010s, which was a basketball tragedy). A decent roster that just doesn’t perform how they should on paper.  Milwaukee Bucks: overall a fairly good franchise and in the modern day one of the East’s top teams. They are a favorite to take the Eastern Conference, I highly recommend keeping up with their series versus the Nets it’s shaping up to be a good one.  Toronto Raptors: The only NBA team not located in the U.S. A fairly new but good franchise that recently just won its first title. They are at a crossroads and are most likely looking to rebuild.  Memphis Grizzlies: have always been kind of irrelevant, but have put together solid teams. They have a young corp of players that can be built upon. They may be a Western Conference playoffs staple in the near future.  New Orleans Pelicans: similar to the Grizzlies and Hornets, with the exception of an arguably even better roster than either of those teams, but with less postseason success. They’re still trying to find their rhythm but it is quite possible that they could be contending for a title in the future.  Minnesota Timberwolves: the t-wolves in my opinion might be the most frustratingly disappointing franchise in North American sports. High draft picks seemingly all the time, but are just terrible year in and year out. They’ve had like five rebuilds in the last decade. Wasting premium talent is Minnesota’s specialty. However they might change this narrative soon, maybe.  Houston Rockets: formerly (as in literally two years ago) were a formidable team and the second best in the Western Conference (after my team, the hated Warriors). They had a solid run that was exciting to watch. It all came crashing down at the beginning of this season when their superstar James Harden demanded a trade. Houston is one of the better franchises in the NBA but they are about to enter a dark age.  Oklahoma City Thunder: the Thunder for the past decade have been a playoff staple and filled with young talent. This reputation is looking to continue. They’ve hit a rough patch but they own the most draft picks in the next 5 years than any team in the league. This team is very soon going to be overflowing with the nation’s top young talent.  Dallas Mavericks: a well-operated and storied franchise with a young superstar in Slovenia’s Luka Doncic, who may be a future MVP. With some small improvements to the roster or the addition of a second option, I could see this team making a finals run very soon.  San Antonio Spurs: a great franchise that built a 20 year long dynasty. Very well-liked by most other fanbases in the league. Currently in a rebuild right now but it may not be that far away until they see the playoffs again.  Denver Nuggets: one of the Western Conference’s top teams. They are consistent and have been a solid team for the past 5ish years. They are a dark horse finals candidate this year.  Utah Jazz: The top seeded team in the Western Conference and owners of the NBA’s best record this season. They have a solid franchise and a loyal fanbase for such a small market team. Talked about a lot in the Last Dance as they were the team the Bulls beat in their championship.   Phoenix Suns: Another one of the NBA’s top seeded teams. For a long time the Suns were a backwater in the NBA that rarely made the playoffs. Many of the NBA’s best players have spent time in Phoenix. Have a legitimate chance for the first time since the 90s to make the finals and win.   Portland Trail Blazers: a small market team with a die hard fanbase and solid history. A playoff competitor for most of the decade. Kind of hard to hate this team. However they’re just never good enough to seriously contend for a title.  Sacramento Kings: a small market team that has been the definition of pain and suffering for the past 15 years. Haven’t built a good team since the mid-2000s. Always have to compete for attention in a crowded California market but despite all this have a good fanbase.  Los Angeles Clippers: the second rate Los Angeles team that everyone likes to make fun of. They’ve had some good teams recently but they never get it done in the playoffs and always lose to a team they should’ve beat. History is looking to repeat itself this season.  Los Angeles Lakers: perhaps the NBA’s most storied and well known franchise. The largest fanbase of any basketball team in the world. Their also extremely shallow, arguably one of the worst fanbases in the league out of California. They most recently won the finals but their on thin ice and probably won’t repeat. Tied with the Celtics for most championships with 17, however I would argue the Lakers have a better overall history. I will not apologize to Boston fans for that.  Golden State Warriors: my favorite team and one of the more hated teams in the league. A great history with some of the NBA’s top players. A large fanbase in Northern California and plenty of bandwagons outside of that area. Stephen Curry, basketball’s greatest shooter is the focal point of the team. Injuries have hampered this team recently as the dynasty begins to dismantle after a 5 year era of unrivaled  dominance.  That’s basically a small rundown of every team in the league that will undoubtedly piss everyone  off."
Derrick Rose is the more apt comp.
"I really like the Derrick Rose series, but my abosolute favorite is this one: https://sports.theonion.com/chinese-officials-respond-to-nba-controversy-by-moving-1838886896"
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"&gt;Besides Derrick Rose, they really don't have any likable players  Idk man I kinda like Quickley and Toppin. Young boys were hoopin better than the Knicks Vets. Also Taj is different off the court you would love him if he's on your team.   Definitely agree with Rose being the most likable guy but then again it's so hard to dislike him."
"Derrick Rose also doesn’t watch games, no one cares"
"Luka has had the better team every year. Last year Trae had post injury Jabari Parker as his second option and a bunch of rookies. You’re lying to yourself if you think that team was better than the mavs. I also don’t see Luka included here  In Game 1 of the Hawks’ first-round series against the New York Knicks, Young had 32 points and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player alongside Derrick Rose, Chris Paul and LeBron James to record at least 30 points and 10 assists in their playoff debut. Young and James are the only two players to have at least 30 points, 10 assists and five rebound in their first playoff game."
"Derrick Rose, in his prime, had MIP Butler and Joakim Noah.   That's pretty bad, even though Noah was elite defensively at the time."
"Steph Curry? Steve Nash? Derrick Rose? Hello? Small guards win MVP awards all the time.   And besides, Trae improved drastically on defense this season, he went from having the league worst Defensive Real Plus Minus (-6) to 27th among all NBA PG's (-0.14), close to Steph, Luka, and Kyrie, and above average league-wide among all positions at 169 out of 530 players. He had a couple key defensive plays last night even."
"If you play that game then you can do the same with 90% of all championships ever won. Just in the last few years, Bam and Dragic were injured in the 2020 Finals, CP3 was injured in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi in 2017, Curry in the 2016 Finals, Kyrie and Love in the 2015 Finals, Dwayne Wade in the 2014 Finals, Russell Westbrook got injured in the 2013 first round when the Thunder were probably the biggest threat to both the Spurs and Heat, Derrick Rose in 2012, Kendrick Perkins in game seven of the 2010 Finals, and so on."
the east only had Celtics and then came the derrick rose bulls. you could throw miami in there but they werent that good. east was so weak in that era.  This is like the first era where we've been closest to parity.
"Everyone saying Randle wasn't that good when the guy was taking and making CJ McCollum type shots all year. If the Knicks are truly back, they're back because of Julius Randle and Derrick Rose."
"Knicks this year reminded me of the Nets prior to acquiring our superstars. Scrappy, undervalued, and a lot of heart. Seeing Derrick Rose play like he did this season was just so exciting to see."
People on ig still believe russ is better than dame currently and Derrick Rose is a lock for hall of fame
Luka’s body takes some major abuse.  I could see him peaking early like a Derrick Rose.
Probably thought the same about Derrick rose
"I loved that shit, I loved the chants, the hush, the ""see us in the A"" the ""we wish the shits"". The series reminded why Derrick rose is the mfin man, I got to hear Capela talk his talk (my biggest fear was him personally not backing it up tonight), the 3 trae shot at the end. It was what both teams have been missing for years, outside of the spitting fan I couldn't have asked for a better series"
Waited until Derrick Rose broke down
He'd be best in a Derrick Rose-type role. His usage is just too much.
"Wow derrick rose is such a beast, dude managed to score 6 points even though it's been garbage time for a quarter now"
I like Derrick Rose don’t get it twisted but there is a huge problem if he is/has been your best player in a playoffs series in 2021.
"didn't he take you to the ECF?  you were always a threat to make deep runs until derrick rose had his first big injury  like a lot of coaches he can only go as far as the talent he has on his roster, lots of room for improvement there"
The Knicks is the most trash team I’ve ever seen. I have no idea how they made the playoffs. And I feel really bad for Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose has been off today
Yeah true. You'd wish Derrick Rose was a baby too
"Guys, I tried to say something clever about Derrick Rose and roses having thorns, but I couldn’t think of anything so I’d appreciate it if you just pretend that I did."
randle for sure.  derrick rose is ight
"Shoutout Derrick Rose, man that"
"These Suns are absolutely not the best opponent he’s faced in this run. The pg13 pacers were insanely good and he faced them a couple times, he faced the big 3 Celtics, and the Derrick rose mvp bulls that were pretty scary."
That reminds of the old joke that a Derrick Rose jersey is a three piece suit.
"I do not know if you have watched any of Hawks-Knicks games but if you have, you should clearly see that Atlanta is a much better basketball team than New York. Trae young is playing better than Julius Randle and Derrick Rose.  The Knicks have poor offence but good defence. The hawks have good offence and good defence.  However, The New York Knicks might win today at home if Randle and RJ Barrett show up. In that case, Atlanta Hawks can win game 6 in Atlanta."
"Meniscus tears are all about location. Ron ""Meta World Panda Friend Peace"" Artest had surgery and was back in 10 days (so did I but it was sand volleyball league.)  Some heal on their own. And some are Derrick Rose."
was Tyson Chandler a Free agent? Amare Stoudemire? Felton? Julius Randle? Derrick Rose?
It is interesting to see how quickly things change. PGs kind of feel like NFL Rbs. You can be top 5 for a few years and then immediately fall off a cliff.   John Wall put up all star season of 23/10/5/2/1 at age 26. But at 30 hes been called a corpse for several years now.   Derrick Rose MVP. Up and down off random benches.
"Depends on what his stats are I guess, you can't blame Lebron for losing the series if he played great. He's averaging like 22 points in this series, that's far below what we expect from him. He's not entirely to blame or even mostly to blame if they lose this series, but if they go out with Lebron scoring less than Derrick Rose I'm not gonna say he's entirely blameless"
"Sure thing. I’ll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
"crazy trivia fact is that in Lebron's 8 straight Finals appearances, he played ONE total 1st Team All-NBA player in the East. that's 24 playoff series and the best player he faced was a 22 year old Derrick Rose  That’s why he went to all those finals. In the West he missed the playoffs, won a disney ring and it’s not looking great so far in the first round."
no derrick rose on this team
"Derrick Rose has remodeled his game post injuries, same with Blake Griffin."
How many times does Chris Paul have to fall on his shoulder before they yank him?  Shades of Derrick Rose 2012.
Derrick Rose literally has a highlight of him hitting a 3 over Lonzo and yelling weak ass n-words
"The thing about this is that Clint never would have said what he said had the Knicks not said stuff first. I don't know why Rose responds to this at all lol. And come on Derrick, everyone has talked shit in their life. You might not have ever talked smack on live TV, but you definitely have at some point, man."
Derrick Rose was rolling over in his grave on that shit. Wtf kinda highschool shit…
Derrick Rose drives a Dodge Stratus!
"I like Derrick Rose for being a (seemingly) chill and level-headed guy, but what exactly is the purpose tweeting just to say “I’m not gonna talk shit”? Why not just ignore Capela completely?"
Derrick Rose is a wise old sage at 32.
"""I'm too old for this shit,""  Derrick ""Danny Glover"" Rose"
A real answer lol. This is why we love Derrick Rose!
Derrick 'Roger Murtaugh' Rose is getting too old for this shit!
Jimmy did not ask out of Chicago. When in Chicago it was up for debate if he can be the #1 guy...at the same time Jimmy was staying he felt he was a point guard while playing alongside Derrick Rose which further complicated building a team around him on a supermax so they traded him. I am a huge Butler fan but his offense inconsistency with his ego commanding a supermax contract makes it difficult to build a championship team around him (he isn't taking a team friendly contract). The NBA today needs an offense that can put up 130 points...he fit better on the 76'ers.
Hot damn do I love Derrick rose
"Poor LaMarcus, man.  Had a window in Portland with BRoy and Oden. They both get injured. Then Dame comes around and they could be contenders again but LMA can’t stay healthy. Goes to the Spurs to team up with Kawhi and then Kawhi is a bitch. Goes to another contender in Brooklyn and almost immediately has to retire. Then go on to remember it’s quite possible he could’ve been teamed up with Derrick Rose had he not been traded on draft day.  The game is full of heart break"

i’ve never come close to raping so i promise i’m not nearly as bad as derrick rose
Neither did Derrick Rose
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
"derrick rose, if u watch the doc his childhood is pretty sad and he came in to the league as a superstar, life got really bumpy and he was almost out of the league but he reworked his game and now he is the knicks best player"
Right now Derrick Rose
imagine dapping up a teammate happily after he shoots like 25% from the floor and gets a tech. it’s a clown team and i feel like derrick rose is the only one taking the playoffs seriously
"Prime Rose has also become fairly overrated amongst a large segment of fans. This is an ex of that talking like he's something above comparison and that we wont see again for many many years. Ja vs Rose isnt some ridiculous comparison, it's not perfect but it's not some grave insult to the alter of Derrick Rose and the mythical figure fans have created of him in their mind."
"Shout out Derrick Rose.  But fr love how he plays, also like his attitude to the game - dude puts his head down and just works. Moreso in his prime but even now it's crazy how he contorts his body midair to make some extremely challenging shots. He's my favorite player who isn't a Celtic."
Is he the one who said “I love Derrick Rose”?
Derrick Rose.
I thought Dennis Smith was going to be better than prime Derrick Rose.
Comparison is scary accurate. He's like a 90% prime Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose been on point with his too
"Derrick Rose in this form is better than Simmons, and Randle sucks right now but this past season he did better than Simmons has ever done in a regular season. Simmons should go play in Australia or China."
I don’t think so at all. People are just seeing them play a playoff team led by Derrick rose and Julius Randle. I think you’re going to absolutely manhandle them.
"That was as good as we saw Derrick Rose, none of us have any idea what his actual ceiling was because injuries took that from us.  So yeah, that was ""prime"" Derrick Rose as far as his career is going."
You say that now but wait till Nash drops the big leg on Derrick Rose.
"We need a backup point guard in the offseason, Derrick Rose should come do that. We would be unstoppable"
"crazy trivia fact is that in Lebron's 8 straight Finals appearances, he played ONE total 1st Team All-NBA player in the East. that's 24 playoff series and the best player he faced was a 22 year old Derrick Rose"
"Bud in the West there's a good chance the Hawks miss the playoffs entirely. They would have the 8th best record and that's not even considering the tougher schedule. They'd have to fight through the play-in and then would've just gotten clapped by the Jazz/Suns if they survived the Lakers/Warriors/Grizzlies.    Instead, they somehow get to play a team led by Derrick Rose and Julius Randle as the 5 seed"
Derrick Rose didn't seem to enjoy it.
"I'm pretty biased, but I'd say Trae Young (and to a similar extent Ja Morant), just because of how they've been performing in their first ever playoffs.  Derrick Rose too has been balling out."
Two important points:   1) better team won   2) Derrick Rose shredded his ACL with 1:22 left to play in a game they led by 12
"i mean not like the knicks have the potential to attack him anyway, their best offensive players is mummified derrick rose  wouldn't do that lap of victory just yet about that lol, it was an issue for steph fuckin curry in 2016 who's both taller and noticeably stronger than trae"
Ben is not Derrick Rose or any of the other Knick guards. He’s a much better defender. There’s also thybulle to deal with.
Derrick Rose is arguably the best player on the court when he is in but the Knicks run no concept of an offense. It is pure chaos watching them try to score.
How is Derrick rose worse? Trae can’t even keep guys in front of him. Drose atleast has to guard the other top player. Trae on Drose and it’s an easy forty.
Derrick Rose has been worse
"I have huge respect for Derrick Rose as a Hawks fan, and this dude has a history of cooking my team. He knows that shit ""is not basketball"" as most New Yorkers love to say."
BREAKING: Knicks release G Derrick Rose; expected to sign free agent G Derrick Rose
I LOVE DERRICK ROSE
Kyle Lowry bruh who’s Randles Lowry? Derrick Rose coming off the bench?
"I'll be real, Randle didn't play well, but he is still receiving far too much criticism. It was his first playoffs being ""the guy,"" and he wasn't used to such ferocious intensity and targeting by Nate McMillan. Both of these teams had unreal defense but Atlanta was by far the more aggressive and favored offensive threat. This team had no expectations coming into the season and you can't say this isn't anything but a crazy success.  The same way people are talking about Randle rn is how people talked about dirk for like ten years before he won with the Mavs. Very young team.   Exciting time for the league rn and this series was sick even though its a little one sided. Trae young straight balled out and told everyone that he is here, no denying him anymore, even compared to Luka hes legit. Derrick rose proved he still got that shit, even after a long list of injuries this dude is still a baller, greatest what if in NBA history. Knicks young players are unreal, RJ, Quickley and Toppin had no business playing like they did the first couple games. I feel like if all of the players develop accordingly the Knicks could win the title eventually. Thats the first time I've said that in like 10 years."
"We don’t have a lot of talent. It’s true. On paper our team is not great. Julius Randle is our most talented player, then it’s Derrick Rose. He’s good, but most teams that have D Rose as their second best player isn’t going as far as the Knicks have this year.   It’s not easy to keep up with a team like Atlanta that has offensive talent like they half do"
"Kidd is the gold standard. Other examples include:  Rajon Rondo, Ricky Rubio, Jason Williams and Derrick Rose"
Derrick Rose
Derrick rose kinda
I disagree. That's really underselling how good Derrick Rose still is. He should have been starting a long time ago for the Knicks.
Derrick Rose needs some help
Derrick Rose will comeback from down 3-1   Cuz nobody else on the Knicks is helping him
"Nate McMillan, there is a way to beat the Knicks. Please watch any Knicks game. You need to stop RJ Barrett and Julius Randle by having the guard defend Derrick Rose and the big man drop to intimidate Randle. If he or RJ takes a shot, that is a win."
"Derrick Rose looking at Randle, like the wise old master disappointed in his pupil, while all the other immature students giving him hi-fives."
Everyone high fiving Julius Randle for their shit play save one guy: Derrick Rose who just looks disgusted
"Hawks have just a lot more talent its that simple. Trae Young is a future superstar. They are a deep squad. The Knicks are starting Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Reggie Bullock."
Derrick Rose looks done.
"They dont have much talent. Randle is not a number 1 probably not even a real number 2 on a contender.           Derrick Rose is their only scorer and its 2021.          No idea why 14 out of 16 ESPN ""experts"" picked the Knicks to win this series"
"gallo runs like 40 year old dirk, how is he getting blocks on derrick rose lol"
You know youre trash when your best player is Derrick Rose. Reset that shit.
"Knick’s offense consists of Derrick rose runner’s , lol pathetic"
Crazy how Derrick Rose is the only reason why this series is not a complete joke
derrick rose singlehandedly keeping the knicks from being swept. goddamn.
Derrick Rose won that MVP for a reason. Crazy dudes think he fell off. Situations matter
It’s not just randle .. everyone else not named Derrick rose is also shooting terribly .
"Derrick Rose: ""This is MY team now"""
Get Derrick Rose some help
Derrick Rose is the best player on the Knicks and I dont care what anybody says
#Shoutout to DERRICK ROSE
"Hey Scott Foster, Derrick Rose said you aren't half the man Chris Paul is."
Derrick Rose: possibly anti-MLK
What other period of prevalence have you had? 2 years of good Derrick Rose? Your franchise is ass.
Some of this drives by ja toward the end were so ridiculous. So insanely quick and springy while also giving 0 ducks who's in front of him. Reminds me of early derrick rose a bit. Gonna watch him as much as I can.
I do not agree with you. The Knicks are much  bigger than the Nets in New York. It is a big gap when it comes to enthusiasm between the two franchise. You can see the fans in Madison square garden and how they reacted to the New York Knicks winning a play off game.  I saw a comment say that Derrick rose is bigger in New York than Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.  People in New York still care more about the Knicks than the Nets even though the Brooklyn Nets have a much better basketball team.
"TBF to him, after DRose's injury people started paying attention to landing mechanics. So it's not because Derrick Rose was doing it but because Derrick Rose brought attention to it even if for negative reasons."
"Yeah, I forgot about Jazz legend Derrick Rose"
He should’ve never been the starter.  Derrick Rose should’ve been starting from the jump
Agreed but by that definition Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony are still superstars
"Derrick Rose is that one player that is universally loved by every fanbase. Everyone is rooting for him, and it’s so cool to see him do what he’s doing"
"Only loyalty I have to former players is Derrick Rose and taj gibson, Bubble boy butler trashed our franchise when he left."
I don't think he's terrible by any stretch of the imagination but he's struggled big-time in this series up to this point and I don't think that's going to change. If he doesn't figure something out soon the Knicks are doomed.  The Hawks' defense has done a good job of suffocating Randle by forcing him into help defense - Capela - and daring guys like RJ to beat us. If not for Derrick Rose playing like a savant and our shooters being Very Very Bad for 2/3 games this series the Hawks are up 3-0 and it's not even close.
Derrick Rose 🌹🌹 for me anyways
"Derrick Rose is on one, wtf"
"It's like how he said he thinks Pat Will is awesome. He just says the right things.  Later on (its on the same article) showed his self entitlement  James believes his production is strong enough to validate a third consecutive MVP trophy. But he also said Rose seems to be garnering more support among the media block   ""Right now, **statistically, it's probably one of the best years I've had**,"" James said. ""But we'll see. **The media kind of controls it**. You've got some guys here that have done their job also. At one point, I thought Dirk was also \[worthy\] until he got hurt. But Derrick Rose definitely **has gotten a lot of the exposure and a lot of the media attention** because of the work he's done. He's playing some unbelievable basketball."""

"lol. Dude. At this point, I’m not sure if LeBron is even a human being considering how successful he has been. He and Tom Brady are likely from Mars, but Derrick rose? He’s got knees like you and me dude, and they’re cooked at this point 😂"
"LeBron didn’t get a single first place vote, yet there are some people who are absolutely convinced he’s the real winner. Do you know who LeBron thought deserved MVP that year? [Derrick Rose](https://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=6274778).  That should be the end of the debate."
For now. But Derrick Rose playing 38 minutes of playoff intensity basketball is very concerning.
&gt; Russell Westbrook needs to call up Derrick Rose and train with him in the offseason.  I know before his string of injuries Rose actually did train with Westbrook as well as Durant.
Outside of maybe Derrick Rose is there a former MVP that has lost superstar status?
He’s had a good year and all but absolutely no way someone pays a 32 year old Derrick Rose that kind of money
I mean they aren’t all wrong. Randle is a good player. Most improved? Absolutely. But is he a superstar that is a mismatch in the majority of his matchups? No. He’s got a quick first step and is strong in the paint against contact but his jumper is average at best and he can’t vertically beat defenders at the rim.  He’s not the guy can consistently beat defenses geared to stop him. He’s good at exploiting winnable matchups which he did in the regular season consistently. Randle desperately needs a “star” type player that can handle the load for him so he can be that 2nd option. Derrick Rose is playing out of his mind but he doesn’t have the wheels to be out there creating offense and attacking for 36 minutes a game.
Honestly believe Derrick Rose would be the greatest NBA player today had it not been for his injuries.
SHOUTOUT TO DERRICK ROSE.  I’m so happy for him
So essentially Knicks turned KP into Derrick Rose on a cheap contract. It's looking like they won that trade
"To be fair, Derrick Rose was the best PG in this game. The only player on the Knicks that actually came to win."
"God said, ""rise"".  So Derrick Rose."
Derrick Rose is the Knicks best player.
Nvm I thought that was about Randle. Derrick Rose is the best player on the team.
Derrick rose being our second best player is not at all a controversial statement lol
"The New York Knicks have, Derrick Rose....   and the rest of nobodies."
"Russell Westbrook needs to call up Derrick Rose and train with him in the offseason . It's beautiful to see how DRose has adjusted his game , he's able to play with pace and composure while still being one of the strongest/quickest guards out there."
It's really Derrick Rose vs the World again.
Derrick Rose is playing his best ball in a while and its going to waste. Shame.
Man shout out Derrick rose. He did his best
"We win, and Derrick Rose plays great  Double win for me"
Derrick Rose is still *that* dude.
Derrick Rose might have to carry the bus there
"This was a really fun game that always felt very contested. Trae was great without a lot of trunovers, and Derrick Rose popped off as usual.  This is such a fun series, although my heart-rate is definitely faster."
It’s Derrick Rose vs the Hawks on offence this game.
Imagine Derrick Rose being the best player on your team in 2021.
If it wasn't for the fouls and Derrick rose this might've been a 40 point blowout.
Derrick Rose is carrying him rn
"No offense to Derrick Rose, but he cannot be our best player in any series. Hawks got some lethal shooters but I think we still take this in 6"
Man shout out Derrick rose. He did his best
It's insane how good Derrick Rose still is given all that happened. Would have been a ridiculous career if he was always healthy.
SOMEONE GET DERRICK ROSE SOME HELP
Only Derrick Rose deserves to ride the team bus to the hotel. Everyone else is walking
"Despite being a bench player Derrick Rose is still a very good player in this league, he should have a starring role somewhere"
Yup no excuses this was pathetic. Anyone not named Derrick Rose has shit the bed.
The Derrick Rose Knicks
"Are you referring to the RAPTOR stat? That states Kyle Lowry was -1.1 even though he's known was a good defender. LeBron James was +.6 even though he was considered coasting on defense last season. Luka was -0.8 and no one would say he's a better defender than Lowry and be taken seriously. Jrue Holiday was +1.1. Derrick Rose, Cameron Payne and Raul Neto are all better defenders than him by this metric.  This is why advanced stats aren't the end all be all. They're usually only useful for comparing people on the same team. Which is why Sexton being -0.5 and Garland being -3.0 so far this season is significant. Within their own team, Garland drags the defense down much more. Defenses are way more about teams than individual players. Which is why usually most people on a good defensive team even the bad defenders have good defensive advanced stats number."
"We got Randle, Derrick Rose, Quickley, Grimes and most of our free agents from the assets and cap space we got in that trade. All of that stems from the moving KP"
hardaway isn’t greater than or equal to  Derrick rose
What else could we of got for KP? He did not have the high of value coming off an ACL injury  DSJ became Derrick Rose and that cap space became Randle and Morris (who turned into Quickley). We also got Grimes and another 1st  I think it’s a clear win for NY
Shout out to Derrick rose
Russ fans might get a little too hyped up over him but Derrick Rose fans are the most delusional group of nba fans outside of late career-Kobe fans.
Derrick Rose carried an entire team this last playoffs. He was the reason the score was even close most of the time.
Easily Derrick Rose.
I've seen examples of his bad foot work especially when driving. But I also remember a comparison video between him and Derrick Rose landing after layups or dunks and he had much better landing footwork. The video was showing kind of why Rose ended up having the injury-prone career and Westbrook didn't. So all of his footwork is not bad I guess that's what I'm saying.
"Nah, you're wrong.   Derrick Rose was being moved for chump change-- DSJ was not a key. We could have tossed in Frank instead and the trade would have been the same.   The cap space we got? We only needed to free that up because of Mills' dumb signings that summer. We payed to undo an error from just a few months prior. That's not good value, it's awful management.   We got two late firsts. Luckily, one of those converted into Quickley which has been great. But the fact is, that if we had had a remotely competent FO at the time, we could have gotten a much better return for KP.   We've done well with what we ended up getting from the trade, but over half of the value we got in return was essentially wasted, so I don't think it's fair to call the trade a win."
"You're wrong.  We traded DSJ - Derrick Rose  The picks we got don't allow the Mavs to trade any of their future picks unless they give up protections of the 23rd.  The cap space we got, while not signing KD or Kyrie, led us to sign Randle who is a all star/All-NBA player now &amp; Marcus Morris who we traded for picks - that became Immanuel Quickley.  The Knicks intentions were to trade KP, Led &amp; THJ for the cap space hoping for stars but effectively we pivoted &amp; now the Knicks have done a great job building from the trade."
So did Derrick Rose but he’s still chilling
Depth is not just bench players. They brought in Kemba and Fournier which has been exactly what their offense needed. It also pushes guys like Derrick Rose down in the pecking order so when it comes to the playoffs they don’t need him to play 35 minutes just to stay in a game.

"idk what that guys is talking about. Knicks starting 5 is nothing special when comparing with other playoff teams.   Where the Knicks are strongest is they have one of the strongest bench units in the league. Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Nerlens Noel (once he comes back from injury). Knicks bench regularly scores 40-50 points a game between them."
&gt;Fair. I also think their roster will look pretty different by the trade deadline.  Lol remember when dwayne wade and derrick rose and Isaiah thomas was on the cavs with lebron james and kevin love.
Derrick Rose blamed himself for landing terribly. It was bound to happen. Just look at how hard he landed. If he trained to land properly like Westbrook. Rose would still play at a high level. Plus if Rose did blame it on Thibs. Rose wouldn't even follow Thibs to wherever he goes and play like a 6moty candidate
"It really was amazing to see this amazing, extremely smart and aware defender just get hung out to dry with simple rhythm dribbles. That’s Derrick Rose."

Shout out Derrick Rose
Welcome to the life of Derrick Rose
Derrick rose impersonation with the three point floater
"Back when Rose played for Minnesota (shoutout to that 50 point game), I remember seeing a tweet that said “Derrick Rose grew dreads and became a shooter. This is a Chicago story.”"
"He's not better than Barkley's peak, duh. There are certain things he does better now than Barkley ever did, but peak Barkley is better overall than 20 year old Zion.   The scoring efficiency also has less to do with the era. The 4 other players his scoring last year is grouped with are Kevin Mchale 1987, Kareem 1980, Wilt 1967 and Shaq 2005. McHale had the advantage of being the 2nd option to a top 10 player, but the others, including Zion, did it with the defense focused on them. They are outliers. An argument can be made that this era makes it harder because you couldn't quadruple team a driving Kareem like they sometimes did to Zion. But I think that doesn't really matter. These were all massive outlier seasons in the era they played in Zion included.   But back to the Barkley comp.  Is Zion better than Barkley was at 20 and 21? Yes. Is he better than Barkley was through their first 82 NBA games? Yes. Comparing a second year player to the peak of one of the all time greats is pretty disingenuous.  Maybe he doesn't improve at anything from here on out, but it would be shocking if what Zion was last year is his peak. No one else in his tier of players has peaked at 21. But he's had one really concerning injury he already recovered from and a couple of annoying injuries. Maybe he never gets healthy. But that's the only way he doesn't improve.  And no, not every prospect has that 2% chance. Going off the Pelicans roster Kira's peak if he develops what he is good at will still never be Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook, other super fast point guards. Kira's absolute potential peak is probably around 2nd or 3rd year De'aaron Fox, not even an All-Star.  Jax's ceiling is unusually high for an 8th pick.His floor is also unusually low for an 8th pick. The dude can be special if the game ever clicks for him. Also, and I didn't make this clear at all, even at his 2% peak he'd still be just below AD in terms of tiers and he'd likely never get an MVP vote."

Derrick Rose
"Seeing how everybody has Grizz projected to be in the 7th-11th seed range, if this dude carries them to a seed with home court of even top 3 record, he will be a strong candidate. Last time we saw guy shock the world, and come out blazing like this was Derrick Rose."
&gt;I love Derrick Rose  Antoine Griezmann... also United Center
"Remember when Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson and Derrick Rose were n the Cavs a few years ago and a ton of people said that they sucked, and all of them went on to play very well elsewhere. I think Lebron is a great passer and very versatile and people conflate that with making everyone better."
It's funny but Derrick Rose actually is a very good 3 point shooter now   Imagine if he had that in 2011
Ja Morant is a slimmer Derrick Rose who is developing a 3
Ja Morant is literally Steve Nash + Derrick Rose combined.
Ja Morant is literally Steve Nash + Derrick Rose combined.
Derrick Rose + Steve Nash
"How is it false?   Derrick Rose ($5.5 million), Joakim Noah ($3.1 million), Taj Gibson ($1.2 million). That's a total of $9.8 million in salary.  Mike Miller ($5 million) and Udonis Haslem ($3.5 million) is $8.5 million.  They would have had to take $433,000 less each on their first year to go to Chicago instead.  The Bulls needed to create cap space for the third guy, but even GarPax probably isn't too incompetent to move a 25-year old Luol Deng and a 2nd year James Johnson to get there."

My man Derrick Rose with one MVP vote last season. The fan vote lol
Shout out Derrick rose 🥺
"no, not all of them were. dave debusschere was not the face of the league when he played, cousey, west, pettit, chamberlain, robertson, and bill russell were.    also i promise you that dwight howard was very popular at one point.   if it was about marketability than derrick rose and tim hardaway would be on there."
"Would anyone get injured? Assuming they keep their draft pick in 2011 and draft BPA, their lineup eventually would have included:  Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and Nate Robinson. Winning would be so easy for that group that they could rest guys when they have minor injuries and blowouts would be so common that guys wouldn't need to play heavy minutes.  And when three of your allstars are injured, you still have 3 more + Taj."
"Seeing this game brings a smile to my face.  Some great memories of that Bulls team with Taj, Joakim, Rose, and Thibs.  If Derrick hits a game winning buzzer beater tonight, I won't even be mad."
Two good defensive teams that can push the pace. Id be okay if this game came down to a Derrick Rose buzzer beater 🥲
I feel like fans around the league felt similarly.  Derrick Rose was about to become an absolute monster in the NBA.
"Lol his college career never happened. He has a ROTY, an MVP, 3x All-Stars and 1 All-NBA. 2 gold medals. That’s not a hall of fame resume. Career averages of 18/3/5. That’s not a hall of famer. You guys always factor in your emotions when you talk about Derrick Rose but he’s not a hall of famer. He “could play” 7 more years. He also “could” win another MVP, but that doesn’t mean it’ll happen. As of right now, he’s not getting in. Sorry"
"Stats don't tell the whole story, especially regular season ones. You've discounted the fact that Derrick Rose has an IQ just barely high enough to not be considered mentally handicapped and how it hurts him in the playoffs when teams game plan for you specifically."
"It was very much Trae vs. MSG in this case.  Sometimes it was Derrick Rose getting in there, and there was some kerfluffle happening with Bullock and Randle and Gallo at one point in an ATL-set game, but mostly Trae vs. NY."
"I don't see how those are contradicting positions. Flip it around on offense. There are plenty of teams over the years that had one elite offensive player and the rest of the team was not very good on offense. However, this model is not sustainable in the playoffs because of tougher competition and greater scouting. But we don't blame Allen Iverson or Derrick Rose for the playoff struggles of their respective teams the way people do with Gobert. Heck Chris Paul once carried a top 5 regular season offense when he was with the Hornets and they had disappointing playoff runs, but we excused him (and rightfully so).  So what's the difference here?"
Derrick Rose*
I give Luka   Pg: Luka  Sg: Jamal Murray   Sf: Joe Ingles   Pf: pascal siakam   C: myles turner   Sixth mans : carmelo/ derrick rose.  Base off your criteria and realistic cap space. These players would fit his skill set.
Jokic? Nope. Giannis? Nope. LeBron? Nope. Durant? Nope. Duncan? Nope. Nash? Nope. Garnett? Nope. Harden? Nope. Shaq? Nope. Kobe? Nope. Iverson? Nope. Dirk? Nope. Jordan/Hakeem/Barkley/Malone/Stockton? Nope.  Westbrook and Derrick Rose. That’s literally 2 of them he’s better than in the past 50-60 years unless you wanna tell me he’s better than Bird/Magic/Dr.J/Kareem/MosesMalone.
Only Thibs would play Taj Gibson and Derrick Rose 30+ minutes in a 2021 preseason game.
"What did you see in games that I didn’t? Knicks have one all star, their second best player is Derrick Rose. Like what’s so bright about their future that I didn’t see in the games last season that you did?  I’m hoping RJ takes the next leap, Quickley will eventually get minutes but has to share for now. 5th seed was easily an overachievement. If they make 7th or 8th seed they have had another good season. But like I said, I definitely ain’t as optimistic as most."
"Mitchell Robinson played 31 games last year, had a foot injury which are typically bad for big men. His career high is 9 points. He has potential no denying it, but he isn’t nothing but a role player atm, and coming off a a leg injury as well. And if you think 8 points and 8 rebounds in 31 games is more than a role player I would be surprised.  Evan Fournier is a number 2 option on a bad team, but when he got to Celtics I think that shows the exact player he is. A 3rd or 4th option. I can’t see Fournier being a first or second option on championship team, 3rd option at best. I don’t think he can carry your team. Obviously more than a a standard role player, but a Role player doesn’t have to be playing 16 spot minutes a night. Derek Fisher was a role player for the Lakers late 2000s despite being their starting point guard.   Derrick Rose had maybe his best year since his MVP season, but that also backs what I’m saying. He was their second best player. I’m not going to act like a 33 year old playing 25 minutes a night is good for the next 5 years. There’s probably one more season left of that good Rose from last season.  They aren’t your traditional role players (as in playing 15 mins a night) but we got some dude who averaged 14 on a good team once he was traded to the Celtics and went to a 3rd sometimes a 4th option, you got a young promising big man who hasn’t taken the next leap yet and a 33 year old (absolute legend) point guard who can only play off the bench. They aren’t stars either, and most likely wouldn’t be focal points on other teams."
"Lmao this is so incorrect I don’t even know where to begin.  The funniest part was when you called Evan Fournier, Mitchell Robinson, and Derrick Rose “role players” like they are Bobby Portis or Stanley Johnson."
"He's top 20, let's not go crazy here. Derrick Rose wasn't top 10 in his MVP season either"
Difference is one team has Steph Klay and even Draymond as the main guys while the Knicks have Kemba Walker and Derrick Rose as the main guys
Murphy was a one time allstar and has the most average career that 100's of players have had and Sampsons nba Career is worse then Derrick Rose he was done real quick
Will you accept this Derrick Rose?
"AI was, for a moment, absolutely incredible to watch. A small guy whose tenacity was unmatched. That was kinda the biggest deal with AI -- he had the same ambition to win as others did, only in a smaller body, being thrown around by NBA giants.  Like if you saw early Dwyane Wade or peak Derrick Rose or current Ja Morant, you saw AI. He was those guys but smaller."
I once saw Jimmy in the TSA line at O’hare. Someone behind me leaned over and asked if it was Derrick Rose.  He ain’t that famous !
"Yeah RJ is clearly underrated.   Dude wasn’t selected for 2nd team All-Rookie and was left off the top 100 with Kemba, Derrick Rose, and Mitchell Robinson all making it over him."
Chicago has Derrick Rose AND Jay Williams as PG what-ifs. What a cursed position.
"It's Derrick Rose, but if it ends up being Mitchell Robinson or RJ the team will be in a great place."
Low ceiling my ass.  The last 2 play in tourneys hes shown how clutch he is.  His ceiling is Iverson or Derrick rose
"For their playoff primes Lillard scored 25 points per 75 possessions on +2 rTS% where Nash scored 20 points per 75 possessions on +8 rTS%  Plus Nash would be more aggressive as a shooter today. There’s no way to know, but I’m not convinced his efficiency would have dropped significantly  by taking more shots. Since he was Steve Nash. Even if you choose to disagree with that, which would surprise me if anyone who watched Steve Nash would disagree, Lillard does not have a far superior edge as an individual scorer no matter how you crack it in the postseason.  Besides, the objective of basketball is for your team to score more than the other team. Not for you to score the most points. Despite the correlation that exists between players scoring a lot of points efficiently and their team scoring a lot of points efficiently, we seem to conflate the two concepts as being tied at the hip.   Ultimately it is a player’s effect on their whole team’s ability to score efficiently that matters. Not just their own scoring and efficiency. If Lillard is trapped during every possession in the 4th quarter, scores 0 points himself on 0 shot attempts, while his team scores 1.2 points per possession as a result of that  that is more valuable than Nash scoring 12 4th quarter points on 1.3 points per possession but never demanding a help defender the entire quarter while his team as a whole scores 1.1 points per possession that quarter. The key distinction would be that Nash wouldn’t have drawn a help defender because it isn’t a fair exercise to say that Nash is a worse offensive player only because his teammates miss shots. If you draw help and put your teammates in advantageous situations you’re attributed credit as an offensive player despite your teammates shooting ability. If one of these two players most recently fits into that example it would be Lillard. His teammates seldom capitalized on the extreme defensive help which was sent at Lillard in the most recent playoffs. Lillard has been unrightly over-criticized for this for much of his playoff career.  Still, who is a better offensive player? Not scorer.   Lillard played at a previously unreached (for himself) postseason level during the last series he was in vs the Nuggets, but until he does so for more than a tiny series sample he’s demonstrably shown to be a worse offensive player than Nash. Which isn’t a black mark on any player’s career. Lillard is better than Derrick Rose ever was since that is another often had discussion."
Derrick Rose with good knees
Derrick Rose draft was rigged to get him to Chicago. I said it
The NBA rigged the 2008 draft to get Derrick Rose to the bulls.
"Derrick Rose never tore his ACL and it was all a cover to use the restroom (just like pierce), except Rose ended up continuing the cover in an elaborate multi year recovery. The meniscus injury or whatever was next was real though."
"Bulls fan here, we had the #1 pick and drafted Derrick Rose in 2008."
"Dude, I deal sportscards for a living. Been at it professionally or semi-professionally since around 2004. John Wall generated very little interest in the industry from the get go. There was middling hype on the guy when he was drafted. I would rate it equal to Derrick Rose in terms of interest from the public. He was the clear top rookie in a rather weak class and that drove a decent amount of money to him as the season went on, but very little in terms of his draft issues. By and large all of the interest that year was in Blake Griffin after his injury. Compared to the hype for Simmons it's comical. The amount of money that was being poured into every Simmons release as it came on the market was record breaking at the time. Fuck, Simmons hype is responsible for the entire Prizm craze beginning. Simmons was being hyped as a 15 year old in Australia as the future #1 pick and the successor to LBJ. His commitment to LSU was front page news. I don't know how you can sit here with a straight face and tell me John fucking Wall was considered a better prospect on draft day. You want to argue Kyrie with me, fine. Argue Kyrie with me. I think you're wrong. But Simmons just makes you look dumb."
Yes. I remember some people saying Derrick Rose was his FLOOR. Hype for the guys was unreal.

we're not. we weren't. LOL. we're talking about if stockton was dropped into today's nba. did you think they meant 59 year old stockton?? obviously stockton is in his prime in this conversation. but why would CP3 randomly get upgraded to his prime? i guess derrick rose is a top 3 point guard in this conversation

"Only counting players I had actually watched. Note, I don't have an exact order of my all time favorite players in my head, so I'm just thinking of players off the top of my head.  1: Giannis Antetokounmpo   2: Derrick Rose  3: Steph Curry  After these 3, it gets really difficult. Kawhi was probably one of them before his whole Spurs controversy, but whatever.   I don't know who's my 4th and 5th favorite players are. Probably someone of the following:  \- Joakim Noah  \- Khris Middleton  \- Dirk Nowitzki  \- Tim Duncan"
1. Tim Duncan 2. Manu Ginobilli 3. Big Ben Wallace 4. Derrick Rose 5. Dirk Nowitzki  Fucking loved those guys. For reference I was born in 1990 and a Spurs fan. I skipped the bulls big 3 entirely but I loved those guys as well.

Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
They got very unlucky with Derrick Rose
i love derrick rose
Joakim Noah for me. Went to watch Paul George led Pacers back in 2014 and Noah was towering over everything and Derrick Rose was over on the bench in his suit eating lifesavers out of a bowl
"Or Kobe, or Derrick Rose"
"Ah it's been 2 days since the last ""Will Derrick Rose be the only MVP who doesn't make the HoF?"" thread"
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE
Derrick Rose is gonna play 48 minutes every game at this point lol
Derrick Rose limping makes me wanna cry forreal.
Derrick Rose might be playing some of the best basketball I’ve seen him play and his team is hanging him out to dry
Seeing Derrick Rose limo is one of the most upsetting things I can watch
Derrick Rose is limping sounds pretty redundant
Fuck the Knicks.  Derrick Rose is trying out there.  He's working so hard and the rest of these Knicks are just shitting all over that effort.  They don't deserve him.
Derrick Rose coming back from all gruesome injuries and still being good NBA player is inspirational stuff.
Where would the Knicks be without Derrick motherfucking Rose
Why have competent starters when Derrick Rose do trick?
Derrick Rose is the Knicks best player right now
"Lol I love a lot about Thibs, but he really only has one offensive play and it's give the ball to Derrick Rose."
Y’all got him locked up. He can’t do shit against this defense and it doesn’t help that anyone not named Derrick Rose has been non existent.
"*""Derrick Rose isn't 6MOTY""* they said"
Derrick Rose has more points than the Knicks starters combined.
"You know how when you're in PVP lobby and you're going against a really good team, then you check the team stats to see how your team is doing and you're at the top of your team?  And thats a problem because you are average at best? Derrick Rose is feeling the same thing."
"People who just think if you have a rich owner who's willing to spend then that's all you need would be well advised to look at everything the Knicks did from about 2002 up until about three years ago. They regularly had the highest payroll in the league and were no good at all, and it's all because Dolan refused to ever just rebuild, and was insistent if he just kept spending money then he could ""reload"" instead.   What it took him almost 20 years to realize however, is that the truth is the only big name players who are available via trade when you have limited assets to deal are ones who are on questionable contracts. So a rich owner can keep collecting a bunch of high priced guys who are past their prime with big name recognition and even bigger price tags, but that's not how you build a winner. If anything that's more like a great recipe to stay mired in mediocrity, and how you end up with [""super teams""](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17124633/derrick-rose-says-new-york-knicks-being-put-same-super-team-class-golden-state-warriors) like the Knicks one that featured Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, rather than an actual contender."
Derrick Rose has been the Knicks best player in the playoffs and that’s concerning
Derrick rose being the best player on a playoff team is not something I expected in 2021
Derrick rose man
Gallinari vs. the Knicks? Tajj Gibson vs. Derrick Rose? Julius Randle playing like Josh Smith against the Hawks? You got yourselves a series folks.
Derrick rose is not playing basketball
Why does Derrick Rose not start?  He played 38 minutes in Game 1 and he was the best offensive weapon NYK had until Burks went crazy in the 4th.
Best=Julius Randle. Young exciting=RJ Barrett. Vet Beast= Derrick Rose. MVP=Frank Ntilikina.
"Pretty sure Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Victor Oladipo, Derozan, Lowry, and Derrick Rose were the best players in the East the Cavs faced in their 4 finals runs.  &gt;The Jordan Bulls beat Magic, Isiah Thomas, Barkley, Shaq, Stockton/Malone in the playoffs.  Magic, Barkley, Stockton/Malone all played in the West Jordan didn't face them in the East."
I heard we are bringing that rich karen back to pick a fight with Derrick Rose or Randle like she did with Lebron!
ESPN: Derrick Rose wants to join the Hawks in F5 season
"""Spit yo game, talk yo shit, grab yo gat, call yo clique"" - Derrick Rose, 2021"
The leagues been soft since Derrick Rose has been in the league.
"Exactly. There's a reason people like Dwayne Wade, Iverson, and to a degree, Derrick Rose are revered. They were smaller dudes, who drove to the basket, took their hits and just kept coming and finishing.  Those are the type of players that get everyone's respect. The idea that the Knicks are supposed to just let him do what he wants and hope he misses doesn't seem like a great strategy."
"I'm sorry what? LeBron guarded prime Derrick Rose in the playoffs. In 2012, LeBron guarded KD. In 2013, LeBron took the assignment to guard Tony Parker who was wrecking havoc on Miami. More recent examples, LeBron guarded Jimmy Buttler in the crunch time during the finals. He also regularly guarded Kawhi during their match-ups. During his Miami days he was notoriously known for guarding 1-4."
"The upvoted comments on every Derrick Rose post always make me cringe, but I guess people might not know about it I only find out a few months ago."
The Derrick Rose renaissance is one of my favorite byproducts of this season.
The Derrick Rose renaissance is one of my favorite byproducts of this season.
Ever heard of Derrick Rose? It sucks for CP3 but this is the only team he’s ever been on I thought had any chance at winning a game in the Finals other than that one Rockets year where they were up on GSW. That was truly soul crushing.
god i love Derrick Rose.
"I disagree. In 2011 put Dirk, KD, and Derrick Rose on the same team and they win the title. 10 years ago the elite offensive teams with bad defense only had 1 or 2 elite offensive players. Like the Nash Suns only had Nash and Amare who were elite. Add a 3rd elite scorer and they win the title."
You know the league is soft when Derrick Rose says it’s soft
"Derrick Rose, 55 year old former NBA player."
True. I’d rather have spencer dinwiddie at this point or even derrick rose over Dipo.
I think Frank Ntilikina may help them more than Derrick Rose does... Frank may become playable given Clippers' roster.
"I think there’s also a tendency to keep every player referable with max two syllables. If their name is not already two syllables, nicknames can be used.  Carmelo -&gt; Melo   Derrick Rose -&gt; DRose   Iguodala -&gt; Iggy    The more ubiquitous you are, the more deformed and shortened your name might get.   PS: i think it’s for this reason that I *personally* hear people say “Chris Paul” way more than “CP3”"
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"
"Chicago - Derrick Rose  Milwaukee - Giannis  Boston - Tatum  Warriors - Curry  Atlanta - Kevin Huerter (no clue why)  76ers - Iverson  Hornets - Kemba  Memphis - Zach Randolph  Washington - Nick Young  Lakers - Kobe  Pelicans - Anthony Davis  Wolves - KAT  Knicks - I immediately thought of Spike Lee and Mike Woodson before thinking about Melo, and am now realizing that Woodson also played for the Knicks in the 80s. So, Mike Woodson.  Toronto - Kyle Lowry  Miami - Wade  Pacers - Sabonis  Jazz - Mitchell  Denver - Melo again  Cavs - LeBron  Spurs - Timmy  Nets - Deron Williams (sorry Nets fans lol)  Portland - Dame  Phoenix - Steve Nash  Kings - Bogdan Bogdanovic (yeah that's an odd one)  Pistons - Andre Drummond  Magic - Dwight  Rockets - Harden  Mavs - Dirk  OKC - Russell Westbrook  Clippers - Blake Griffin"
"Lmao John wall averaged 19.9ppg and had been all defense the season before and was an allstar (for the 3rd year in a row).  Derrick rose far removed from mvp, 20ppg allstar (for 2nd year in a row) jimmy butler.   Both those teams had better rosters than Detroit.  Idk what you are trying to argue that Van Gundy should have done in Detroit."
"&gt;RJ/KCP/Tobias/Marcus Morris/Andre  I can't believe you threw this out there as a lineup he should have gotten more from. The fact he got this line up to the playoffs is an accomplishment in and of itself. You expect a Detroit team with no 20ppg scorers, no allstars, no notable defenders, and no notable depth to win a playoff seriers? This team made it over      \- a young Wiz with John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter, Markief Morris, and Marcin Gortat   \- the Bulls with Derrick Rose-Jimmy Butler-Taj Gibson-Nikola Mirotic     And that detroit roster only got worse every year.     What is there to defend? The Pelicans best player is 20 and has played 1 season of NBA basketball. Literally. 85 games. Did I say this year was a success? No i didn't say that anywhere. They underperformed, they underperformed by 3-4 wins."
"The West was a blood bath when that trade went down. If Amare doesn't get hurt you are likely looking at the Knicks as a solid 2-4 seed every year with only LeBron and the Big 3 Celtics to worry about as major threats out East. Throw the Derrick Rose MVP Bulls in too but that was fleeting. Maybe the Pacers for a couple of years too.  Out West he would have had to deal with the Spurs, Kobe's last few elite years with Gasol, OKC with 3 future MVP's, Lob City Clippers, Grindhouse Grizzlies, Lillard/Aldridge Blazers, and then the emergence of the Splash Bros in GSW as well as what Harden's Rockets bacame after he arrived there.   No doubt he was part of some really good Nuggets teams but just looking at how the two conferences shook out from '11-'16 any team in the East had a MUCH easier path to a conference Finals than a team out West would."
I am rooting for Derrick Rose cause I am a bulls fan.
Bud plz pull Giannis we don't need a repeat of derrick rose
"Idk man Derrick Rose was totally slowing down trae young for most of the game and without Bogi the Hawks lose. As far as I can remember, Aside from that early lead the hawks were behind most of the game  Time will tell I guess, my biggest question is if he can do it a championship level. But the question becomes what’s the difference between trae and Steph in the eyes of the refs because it really feels like they get the opposite treatment of each other."
"I'm pretty upset that Jazz legend Derrick Rose didn't win, ngl."
It's to award someone who sacrifices for the team. Starters tend to get more minutes and attention. That said a ton of 6th men play huge minutes. I which the award went to true bench guys. Derrick Rose played a ton of minutes in game 1. Someone like Manu sacrificed for the team by giving energy off the bench. It's probably why he has less individual accolades when competing with people getting starter minutes.
"For one, I’m not “Bucks fans”, I’m one guy. For two, they’ve called it once all year. It’s not preferential treatment because nobody gets called for it, Giannis is definitely the one breaking the rule the most consistently but he’s not the only one and nobody gets pinged for it.  I’d be fine if they called him for it every time, or at least most of the time. He would have the chance to adjust accordingly knowing he can’t get away with it. Not once over at least a couple hundred violations before doing it at the end of a tight playoff game.  Think about something like carrying. I don’t think there’s a ball handler in the league that doesn’t break that rule more often than not. Game’s on right now and I just watched Donte do it like three or four times taking the ball up the court in one possession. It’s never going to get called though, nobody cares. Imagine if they finally decided to call it on Derrick Rose while you guys were tied up at the end of your next game against the Hawks. It’d be a correct call but it’d still be bullshit right?"
Derrick Rose getting more votes than THJ and Brunson is insanity. He played 20 games less than THJ and had worse production.
"Damn, I really wanted Jingles to win it. I guess old school voters still value volume scoring.  Also, shout out to D Rose for becoming such a solid player. Imagine in 2011 being told that 10 years later, former MVP Derrick Rose would be finishing 3rd in a 6th man race."
"Except his style isn't all that similar to Harden's, he was closer to a Derrick Rose or John Wall with a better 3 ball."
I'm just flashing back to Derrick Rose. MVP to bench in a game that didn't matter.
Give us former Jazz musicians Alec Burks and Derrick Rose and we may consider.
Wheelin and dealin.....Derrick Rose more with the kiss stealing tho

"“WE HAVE THE BIG 15 WHO NEEDS THE BIG 3”  Also this   “THIBS COACH OF THE YEAR, JULIUS RANDEL MVP and 1st team all NBA and MIP, DERRICK ROSE 6MOTY, IQ 1st TEAM ALL ROOKIE, ALL 5 FOR ALL DEFENSE TEAM”   Shit is so corny when the team literally won 41 games"
I remember derrick rose having a pretty awesome playoff debut against the celtics. Turns out he missed out on this stat by one rebound. 36/4/11
"If you told anybody 5 years ago Knicks would be the 4th seed one day with Julius Randle as their best player and Derrick Rose coming off the bench, you would’ve been clowned into oblivion.    KD made the sharpest criticism that was on point, nobody wants to come here if there isn’t a winning culture.  The fact we got this far with this team shows somebody took the criticism seriously and we are now effectively working on making a winning culture."
"Derrick Rose always had a nice floater,  I wanna float higher!!! Where is my poster machine? where its at?"
"Acting like he’s hard AF getting the softest foul call at the end of a game maybe ever to set up this play. If that’s a foul, Derrick Rose should’ve been at the line at least 6 more times."
Call me a homer but I'm never giving Julius Randle a big shot over Derrick Rose

"Yeah, like that 2014 World Cup team that consisted of scrubs like Steph Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Derrick Rose, Paul George, and Kyrie Irving. To say they don't care is not totally accurate."
Highlights of Derrick Rose
"I started watching in 2011 so for me it had to be derrick rose, I'm from the UK and basketball isn't so big here so I'd heard of LeBron, Kobe and MJ but that's about it.  So naturally seeing this dude being clutch repeatedly, and dunking on everyone, he looked like the only dude challenging LeBron. He made me love basketball."
Derrick rose. The dunk on dragic and the up and under with wade and lebron coming for the chase down
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation
Derrick Rose
Rose is just a douche in [other](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation) ways lol
"Derrick Rose. I was 11 when he was in his prime and soaring above the rim, and I wanted to watch him every night. When he wasn’t playing I’d watch mixtapes of his highlights that people made on YouTube"
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose &amp; Taj Gibson… but only if Thibs is coaching.
Derrick Rose is prolly one meaningful finals appearance away from that   On track to be the only MVP to ruin it
"Not exactly an answer to your question, but an interesting related fact that I always find surprising is that Derrick Rose is younger than Steph Curry."
"Yes the Pistons isn't out of the dark YET, but just one year ago when Troy Weaver joined the team our best asset were an expiring Derrick Rose"
"East vs West. Bron and Dwight had to go through fucking Paul Pierce? Paul George? Derrick Rose? CP3 had to through Kobe, Duncan, Dirk, Tmac, Brandon Roy, Yao, etc. The levels of talent in East vs West in the early to mid 2000s was laughably one sided."
"I’d propose a three way trade with the Pelicans to bring in Brandon Ingram for Randle and a pick, send Lonzo and a couple picks to Portland, and Derrick Rose to NO. Then I’d try to sign a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Derrick Jones Jr in free agency."
"I thought he’d be great too, though maybe not “that” great.  A lot of people forget that Derrick Rose wasn’t a consensus #1 pick.  It was either him or Beas.  Bulls picked right."
Well he was injured at the time..its not just kevin durant ur signing him with injury..its a max contract. I think they felt the risk was worth it for kevin durant most players prolly wouldnt have got that...even so to pay someone that much money they would have to b somewhat confident he would comeback. Wilkins did it in 1992 and cameback fine basically at the same age and wilkins was a leaper..sport medicine has come a long way. Like derrick rose still balling.
Are we talking about Derrick Rose or Klay Thompson?
The Derrick Rose mistake pretty much gives away OP copied and pasted the majority of this from that article in 2020 that someone linked.. Dude worded the post like he did some grand research himself lmao reddit is hilarious
"“Took the suns from missing the playoffs to the finals”    They went 8-0 in the bubble last year without him, they were clearly on an upward trajectory. While I see where you’re coming from with the knicks, there’s no way he moves the needle. They may have been the 4th seed but they were in a completely different stratosphere as the top 3 seeds or even the hawks. And Derrick rose played great for them. While CP3 is an upgrade over Derrick rose, he’s not going to make them better than Brooklyn, Milwaukee, Philly, or even the hawks. Add in that they’d have to hand a 36 year old guy with injury concerns a max contract and it makes zero sense."
"I got 2:  Lakers vs Celtics Game 7 2010 Finals : Metta World Peace! I watched that game in a Celtic household and screamed my ass off. Looking back, I don't know how the hell I didn't get thrown out. Lots of emotional roller coasters that night.  Lakers vs Bulls Christmas 2011: Derrick Rose game winning floater. Playoff atmosphere. Disappointing finish for the Lakers as it was a classic 4th quarter for Kobe with last possession down by 1 with 5 seconds to go but couldn't get the shot off and instead drove for a layup.... it was blocked. But the whole game felt like a Finals that we got on Christmas day. Also I love Derrick Rose."
The East is also a little easier than the west though so from a standing perspective it might have a big impact. The Bulls have needed a proper point guard since Derrick Rose. They have 2 all-star calibre players and some young talented pieces in Coby and Patrick Williams. It'll be hard but i can see it happening.
"While he wasn't as good as he thought he was, Monta was underrated during his time on the Warriors. He shouldn't be the primary scorer, but he was often the best offensive Warrior on the court playing beside BD and Stephen Jackson during the regular season. I remember him smoking Derrick Rose whenever they matched up. His career would have probably been better if it weren't for the moped accident. But as he stated, the Curry-Ellis pair would never work defensively. Luckily for the Warriors, the Bucks chose him over Curry for the Bogut trade."
Pre injury Derrick rose
My Derrick Rose tinted glasses are staying on tyvm
"Common use of the term superteam is 3 stars. Some people have your definition yea but your definition is weak and easily proven as dumb and inconsistent. Only weird control freaks think a superteam is a team that players organize, because they have some sick view of players as mindless chess pieces and think only GMs should control them otherwise it's a ""superteam"".  Tell me, were the 2017 Knicks a superteam? Derrick Rose said so. He colluded with Melo and Porzingis to team up.   What about the Bucks? Jrue Holiday demanded a trade. Giannis recruited him. Tsk tsk. Superteam!"
-Oj mayo or derrick rose -Can lebron get over the hump i had alot of people tell me after the mavs series never. -Steph or monta -ben simmons being the next lebron -ingram or kuzma -skip said lonzo is like the next great point guard 100 times.
"I said offensive star. Jrue was awful for the most part offensively this post-season, but he made up for it with his perimeter defense. And, ""MVP"" derrick rose averaged 19.4 ppg. Look at what happened, with Mavs, and clippers. Luka forced them to take out pat Bev."
Derrick rose - Luka Doncic - Zion Williamson - Giannis Antentoukounmpo - Steven Adams
"I'm just saying, in terms of the playing the team in front of you. The Heat and the Lakers played pretty healthy opponents and won. They played eachother mostly healthy and Lakers won.   If you want to bring in every injury across every seeded playoff team in every year... I mean go ahead you can do that research if you want.   But I'll say this: The Lakers were the #1 seeded team. The Heat were incredible in 2020 because it's been such a long time since a seed as low as #5 made it to the Finals. And beating a healthy #1 56-win team with the League's MVP was historic and definitely earned them their place.  This year the Suns and the Bucks were #2 and #3 respectively. Every year pretty much the 1 and 2 seeds duke it out in the Finals. The NBA is way more predictable than most other sports. Injuries definitely derail top-teams, but it's pretty rare and it does get remembered. Derrick Rose, Kyrie, KD, Westbrook, Kevin Love... But in the end it doesn't really get in the way of us celebrating who won it all."
Pablo Sandoval and Bartolo Colon are absolutely not nobodies. Sandoval is a 3x all star and World Series MVP and Bartolo is a 4x all star and Cy Young winner. That’s like saying “nobodies like Derrick Rose and Andre Igoudala”
Derrick Rose: “you cant spell ‘choo choo’ without consent.”
derrick rose was pretty fucking popular i can’t even imagine if he won a ring
Derrick Rose had the benefit of playing in Chicago (and being the first real Bulls superstar since MJ) and a far more marketable name though.
Derrick Rose too
Derrick Rose is confused.
[he does](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation)
"does Derrick Rose have any history/accusations against him? Havent heard about those, hope theyre not true I like him"
Question: “Do you have an understanding as to the word consent?”  Derrick Rose: “No but can you tell me?”  Question: “I just wanted to know if you had any understanding.”  Derrick Rose: “No.”
Derrick Rose in shambles
"I thought so as well, but Basketball Reference percentage chance didn't agree, mainly because of the lack of counting stats.   Similarly they have MVP winner Derrick Rose with just a 12% chance based on his stats &amp; accomplishments."
"decent list unless you consider KD a PF too.  My order: Duncan, Malone, KG, Dirk, Giannis, Barkley  To those that have recency bias, especially those saying Malone doesn’t belong on the list, keep in mind we’re talking about career resumes. Malone was dominant for 2 decades while Giannis has a handful under his belt. I’m confident Giannis will retire top 2 but let him get there first. Derrick Rose was in the goat PG conversation at one point but now he’s likely not even a HOFer after unforeseen injuries. We can’t jump to conclusions but it’s fair to say Giannis is already a top 4 or 5 PF."
Not sure Derrick Rose agrees
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."

&gt;	interesting development  derrick rose first said this years ago
"Sorry, didn’t know Deron Williams and Derrick Rose are the same person"
"Derrick Rose throwing up GD signs.  I mean, I'm sure he has ties from where he grew up, but it's probably not something he's happy about that it got online."
"Idk what people aren’t understanding about this lol. Jimmy is a consistent, fantastic playoff performer. You wanna know how I know something was clearly off with Jimmy? He normally shoots 84% FT…he shot 72% that series. That’s like significantly worse lol…12 percentage points lower. So idk what the hell was up with him but that was quite CLEARLY an outlier performance. All this talk about other players being better than Jimmy after only one series is literally akin to saying like Dirk or like Derrick Rose was a better player than Bron after 2011 lol."
Derrick Rose is being wasted on the Knicks
Derrick Rose doing the hardest of carry job
"*Derrick Rose to the Knicks roster*:  “Look at me, I’m the first option now.”"
I don't think you can blame Thibs when everyone not named Derrick rose is playing terribly. He can't get out there and make Randle score the basketball
Lol 48 of Knicks 80 points are free throws or derrick rose
I know he has been back at it for a while now but its so cool to see Derrick Rose still playing.
Espn we get. Derrick Rose changed his game. We know.
Derrick Rose
Can someone help Derrick Rose please.
Derrick Rose is still my MVP
Derrick Rose carrying his team offensively in the playoffs   Just like old times
Derrick Rose is the greatest player of all time
"I'd actually say it's more our star player forgetting how to play basketball and Derrick Rose being Derrick Rose.  I'll concede to Nerlens (of all people) getting a lot of foul calls, but the Hawks aren't getting calls PURELY because of Nate McMillans' comments."
derrick rose might be the only player on the knicks that knows what offense is. we have to beat this knicks team cause a nets series would look ROUGH
Derrick Rose has bum knees and is still carrying this Knicks team up and down the court
Derrick Rose is carrying the Knicks offense
"If Derrick Rose wasn’t on the Knicks, the Hawks would’ve swept the series 4-0 prove me wrong"
Derrick rose is their star player
Derrick Rose and free throws vs Hawks. Never expected it
Derrick Rose is the New York Knicks.
LOL KNICKS FANS ARE SO DELUSIONAL THINKING THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING IN THE PLAYOFFS WHEN DERRICK ROSE IS YALL BEST SCORER 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
"The Knicks' offense without Derrick Rose on the court is not good, and he just is not in the physical shape to dominate for 40 minutes anymore."
Derrick Rose = best player on the knicks
Just  Let Derrick Rose handle the game please
Derrick Rose is the only player on the Knicks that isn't a shitter
So we just have a Derrick Rose segment and then back to commercial? Ok then
DERRICK ROSE IS BETTER THAN JULIUS RANDLE

Derrick Rose jump shot looking smooth tonight LFG
It's insane how good Derrick Rose still is given all that happened. Would have been a ridiculous career if he was always healthy.

DERRICK ROSE STARTING YERRRR
Derrick Rose- Injures   Bill Walton- Injuries  Kevin Garnett- Drafted by Minnesota   Elgin Baylor- Kept running into the Celtics dynasty   Patrick Ewing- Kept running into the GOAT and played in the hardest era for centers  Chris Paul- Untimely injures
Again I disagree. Kyrie is arguably the fastest/quickest in the league. He just doesn’t dunk often but check this out:   https://mobile.twitter.com/Ballislife/status/1379948372967186432  That’s pure explosiveness. Not to mention the guy doesn’t have a crazy wingspan or height like these other guys. Derrick rose is a little taller than Kyrie and Drose has a 6’8 wingspan!   Also dame is above Steph in terms of athleticism. Guy has some nasty dunks.
"For guards to stand out as ""athletically gifted"" in the NBA you've got to be like Derrick Rose or Ja Morant.  Kyrie, Steph, Dame -- all these guys are superior athletes, but they're a tier below the guys who can jump out of the gym."

Rivers was good for like 2 games for us in particular and hot garbage a lot of the other time. It just wasn’t a great fit and once Derrick Rose came his mins were cut even more.
You mean the same Derrick Rose that injured himself after not landing properly?
"He’s an okay 3 shooter who will have long cold stretches where he shoots 20% from 3. Knicks don’t need him. Rose, Quickly, Bullock, all worth playing more minutes.   Rivers has found a home on the Nuggets because they need guards, the Knicks don’t need guards cause they got Derrick Rose in a mid-season trade"
Derrick Rose too.
Derrick Rose
He wasn’t getting minutes after Derrick Rose arrival.. Tbh they should have waived Elfrid Payton but idk why or how that dude is still the starting PG for the entire year like this
&gt;It’s like the Derrick Rose quote about the Knicks crowd that was the top post yesterday. Rose said the league has gotten soft and the Knicks crowd is supposed to do that. Except no one at all was complaining about the Knicks’ crowd… It wasn’t a story at all. Rose was just desperate to make himself look macho so he called “the league” in general soft. Just threw it out there randomly and vaguely. Despite the fact that no one at all had complained and the fans and players openly loved it.  I thought the exact same thing. Everyone from the players of both teams to the analysts talking about it the following day to the people here online loved it. I dunno who he thought was complaining lol.
Derrick Rose and Dennis Smith Jr
The Derrick Rose response was perfect for the indecency although he was reacting to the foul call
"Younger people forget but LeBron was capable of playing great defense on Dwight Howard, a center who was an MVP candidate, and Derrick Rose, a point guard who won MVP, both in their primes. There are very few players in NBA history who could do a good job defensively on both the league's best point guard and center."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/02/no-derrick-rose-didnt-overcome-his-gang-allegation  Maybe not as reasonable as you thought.
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  &gt; Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  &gt; As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)  \- Dwayne Wade     \- Channing Frye     \- Isaiah Thomas     \- Jae Crowder     \- Derrick Rose     \- Iman Shmpert     \- Dimitrios Agravanis       \+ Jordan Clarkson     \+ Larry Nance Jr.     \+ George Hill     \+ Rodney Hood     \+ Artūras Gudaitis      It was a weird season."
"Aaron Gordon to Denver and Derrick Rose to NY are definitely the biggest hitters. I will say that getting Fournier for two seconds *could* be a steal, but only if we can resign him— it would've been a lot more of a win if he hadn't spent most of the season after we traded for him in COVID protocol (fuck this season)"
LeBron also has eliminated the derrick rose bulls in the playoffs a couple of times
"Derrick Rose has always been my favorite player so I'm thrilled to see the Knicks in the playoffs. I expected to root against the Hawks and let that be that but they won me over, man. I want them both in the next round. 14 more games of this please."
I must have missed when the knix drafted Julius randall and Derrick rose  Oh yeah that was a free agent signing and trade  Foh
"I was kind of cheering for the Knicks because I like Derrick Rose, but their fans have changed my mind completely.  Fuck the Knicks."
Derrick rose was the youngest mvp
Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson playing closing minutes of a playoff game while Thibodeau coaches in 2021. What a time to be alive.
Derrick fucking Rose with the huge block!
Lol I caught that feels like the announcer had to misspeak but have no idea what he’s going for. Might as well have said he idolized Derrick rose when he was on the Knicks
I absolutely love watching Derrick Rose in the playoffs.  I absolutely hate watching Derrick Rose play against the Hawks in the playoffs.
alec burks and derrick rose baby! and Spike Lee! go knicks! plus Noel got some nasty defense and these rooks lookin real smooth sometimes. plus who else is really that likable on the hawks?
wasn't sure who I wanted to root for and then i realized the knicks have alec burks and derrick rose and it was an easy decision. GO KNICKS!
DERRICK FUCKING ROSE
Derr goes Derrick Rose
"Hey KD  You hear that crowd during that Knicks run?  That was Knicks fans cheering for Derrick Rose and Julius Randle. How do you think it would have sounded if you were the object of their affection? How many times a game would that have been you triggering that roar, helping prove to your easily-triggered self just how great you are?  Hope you’re enjoying Brooklyn, tho."
Taj Gison-Derrick Rose lineups in the playoffs in 2021.  I love to see it.
Derrick rose
Derrick Rose seems like he's gonna be something someday.
Shout out Derrick rose
thibs secret to playoff success is to use derrick rose
19 straight minutes to end the half for Derrick Rose. Thibs is trying to finish the job.
How’s it disrespectful when “vintage” Derrick Rose was a literal MVP
"""he with derrick rose""  english op"
DERRICK FUCKING ROSE!!!!!
You was my number one but you ain’t Derrick Rose
Shout out to Derrick Rose
"if not for derrick rose and taj, clint capela would have the most playoff experience in this series from all his runs with harden"
Derrick Rose just felt a chill…
It was a Bulls town during the Derrick Rose era too.
Derrick Rose. And he still is my favorite. Next to him is KD.
Derrick rose
Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr are not that good. They are young players averaging decent counting stats on weak efficiency with little defense on two completely terrible teams.  There is no world where a team is better with Garland than Derrick Rose.
Derrick Rose
Derrick Rose
"Outside of Derrick Rose, Damian Lillard is the #1 player I want to see win a ring man"
Derrick Rose
"He got us Derrick Rose, so pretty good lmao  good luck being cash strapped into first round exits"
How are we not talking about randle in the MVP convo? Top 4 seed with the second best player being derrick rose. But we're talking about Jokic who has MPJ and had Jamal Murray... Come on now.
Derrick Rose and Westbrook for MVP11!!1!q!1!
Ain’t this we men Derrick rose?
"No idea, and it's soo cool when it pays off. One of my favourite moments in the time I've been watching basketball was an interview with Derrick Rose where he's talking about all the names that are usually in the MVP conversation then just casually asks ""why can't it be me""? A few people chuckled and the comments were full of people telling him to stay in his lane or that he's a few years out. D Rose just said fuck them and went out there and had his MVP season."
"Oh I love the dude. Jae's a second generation Jazzman, and I wish he'd been a better shooter so we wouldn't have let him go.    But all-time Jazz legend? He's no Derrick Rose."
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion’s? Fit is one thing, but he’s playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"I've seen comparisons to Derrick Rose, but imo the real comp is Iverson"
Yeah idk about that comp lol. I’d say he plays more like young Derrick Rose
"It was awful yes, but this is a lie. It gets brought up literally every time someone mentions Derrick Rose. Including like ten times on this post."
"Only his 2nd year in the NBA and he is carrying a playoff team down the stretch in big games. Every possession was going through him, and he made good decisions all game.   He's special. I loved Derrick Rose and we never got to see what prime Rose was gonna be, I think this kid might show us."
"Watching Curry in the playoffs would be fun, but getting Ja Morant in the playoffs is like when we got young Derrick Rose in the playoffs. It's not like a garbage team like the Hornets or Spurs took out the Warriors."
[I love Derrick Rose.](https://streamable.com/oo4lh)
The Netflix documentary on Derrick Rose will be call Pawn Sacrifice
Derrick Rose is the fucking shit.  He was able to completely salvage his career even after horrific injuries.  He changed his game and figured out how to continue to win despite losing some athleticism.  Just a baller.

Ja Morant is like Derrick Rose amiright or nah?
I can't wait for playoff Derrick Rose.
"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again;  Derrick Rose is legitimately the sole reason why I like basketball. An inner-city white kid from Chicago who had no interest in hooping. From day one, his style and quiet, humble demeanor appealed to many more than just me I’m sure.   Without question my favorite athlete of all time."
Derrick Rose should get 6th man at least. Him and Thibs have good chemistry and that's when the team took off
I was like why is Derrick Rose talking about Fenerbahce :/
"Derrick ""Bodie"" Rose"
"He can be good at chess and still be dumb, you know  He can also really enjoy chess, while being bad at it, and still be dumb, too  Anyway my point is that Derrick Rose is stupid as shit, and a couple chess analogies doesn’t really change that"
And it was in this position that Derrick Rose won the 6th man of the year award
ill ride this to ask an acl expert: why such a world of difference between Zach Lavine and Derrick Rose post-injury?
Derrick “Tryndamere” Rose
"I love Derrick Rose, growing up in Chicago in the 90s it’s tough to imagine liking another player more than MJ. But damn he is the man, I always believed he could get back to his old self. We should have protected him better. He gave us everything he had and more."
Derrick Rose out here playing 2d chess.

"I'm a simple man. I see Derrick Rose, i upvote."
Derrick Rose definitely watched Queen’s Gambit
Derrick Rose is the shit and needs to be appreciated by the NBA more. I’m glad we had him in Detroit for a bit he was a great dude in a tough situation but always did his job. Happy for him with Knicks.
1. Dominique Wilkins 2. Dikembe Mutombo 3. Greivis Vasquez (Maryland fan) 4. Paul Millsap 5. Shawn Kemp 6. Clint Capela 7. Trae Young 8. Ben Wallace 9. Dennis Rodman 10. Derrick Rose
SHOUT OUT TO DERRICK ROSE ❤️ seriously the will power &amp; thoughtfulness of this man inspire me everyday. Bless him
If you built a basketball player from the ground up youd have derrick rose
Derrick Rose is the Keanu Reeves of the NBA
"Derrick Rose still a big softy.  Remember when the Bulls made the playoffs and he just sat, even though he was medically cleared?  He's a big sopping wet pussy."
Vintage Derrick Rose was one of my favourite players to watch ever.  2021 Derrick Rose is one of my favourite players to watch.
Derrick Rose has brought an energy to this team that can’t be matched. He’s a beast!
D Rose was actually namedropping Bobby Fischer as far back as 2016 so he's definitely not just a Netflix casual-- https://nypost.com/2016/12/03/derrick-rose-talks-return-to-elite-status-chicago-trauma-and-being-a-loner/
fuckin Derrick Rose spinning and winning to the basket
"I'm replying to the general assertion above about the SAT having a negative impact on poor applicants, not Derrick Rose.  In fact the SAT is much fairer than many of the admissions criteria used by selective universities, especially things like extracurricular activities and reference letters.  &gt; Its not really jut about income but also the mentality and having a community that fosters education  We agree on this."
Did you just say nobody can fake the score in a thread about how Derrick Rose faked his score in order to meet admissions qualifications at Memphis?  I’m not advocating for one or the other.  I actually work closely with an admissions office for my job and this debate is happening and I get to witness it.  It’s fascinating.  But Rose and the recent admissions scandal show there are ways to “fake” the score.
I mean Derrick Rose comes from the poor side of Chicago filled with gangland. Education is just not taken seriously enough and a lot of it came from the introduction of drugs in the black community since the 70s and imprisonment of many black men. Many families are broken and the kids don't have any guidance. Its sad to see many kids out there in 12th grade reading at a 4th grade level. Its not really jut about income but also the mentality and having a community that fosters education. I bet you D Rose or none of his family members knew the importance of the SAT Test and how to study before the basketball recruiters had a chance to speak with him. This is definitely an American education system issue
Shout Derrick Rose. Man that Ni🤫🤫a nice
"""Derrick Rose can't start. We need to limit his minutes because we're worried about his durability.""  *Derrick Rose plays 30 minutes anyway*"
"""That was a nasty line by me""     -Derrick P Rose"
Shout out Derrick rose 🙏
i hope Clyde and mike see this and stop sayin vintage derrick rose
"look up ""Derrick rose sexy pictures"" on google and that will tell you otherwise."
"How are you not following this?  Derrick Rose was traded for because he was a valuable role player + his contract situation is great.  His value as a role player was diminished because he looked worse this season.  If he'd been playing like he did last year, we could've gotten more for him than table scraps."

"Derrick ""We men. You can assume"" Rose has had a nice comeback story but I can't ever root for him due to ""We men. You can assume"". He's lucky this came before #MeToo era. Also, Kobe shoulda won MVP that year."
"Certainly there's Asian bias, I'll even provide you with some examples:  * [1st team all state (California) alongside Ryan Anderson, James Harden and Chase Budinger; co-MVP with Kevin Durant of McDonald's All American game](https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team). Despite these accolades, he doesn't get any scholarship offers to notable colleges, aside from a walk-on at Stanford and a full ride with Harvard. * Slam Online article ""Life in the Fast Lane"" shared Lin's Draft Combine scores (or BAM):AVERAGE SPEED Jeremy Lin: 16.66 mph Derrick Rose: 16.60 mph John Wall: 16.48 mph Kyrie Irving: 15.67 mph Lin wins this battle.START SPEED Lin: 13.93 mph Wall: 13.25 mph Irving: 12.64 mph For Rose, BAM has only average speed data.

While we can argue that he's not in the NBA currently due to age or injuries, I wonder if perhaps things would be different had he gone to an actual top 16 college; or been drafted where the scouting metrics had him; or been acknowledged for his physical attributes.  Your 50 downvotes are certainly due to fans of Lin who are biased in their opinion, but the greater bias lies elsewhere."
Derrick Rose didn't have Kevin Durant on his team.
Til just one player separates shaq from Derrick rose. Lindsey hunter.
"I think our roster is better than the pacers though, and thibs and derrick rose have some kind of mystical chemistry  Pacers are also missing multiple rotation players"
Derrick Rose over Elfrid Payton currently
"The Knicks were 24-11 with Derrick Rose this season. Extrapolated to a full season, they would be tied for the 1st seed in the East.   They were 17-20 without Rose."
