"Maybe casually isn't the word, but you don't move a generational talent (and Kyrie absolutely is, maybe not impact wise but the ceiling of what he's capable of) for Robert Covington and Steven Adams or anything like that. In this set up, when you've got to guard KD and Harden, Kyrie can probably eviscerate any defense in the playoffs. That's extremely valuable. He's a better shot-maker than Harden. You can get serviceable players before the playoffs start. The nets have shown that they can play okayish defense when they want to. They have a playable NBA center coming back (Claxton), they just signed an athletic big (pelle) and they just got Iman Shumpert. For all we know, that fixes a lot of their issues. They've been without a playable big man since getting James Harden. I just never saw the sense in giving up on the chance for the GOAT offense with zero chance of being stopped for a couple of guys who won't move the needle as much as you think in the playoffs, especially when the issues can be somewhat solved. Trading one of these guys rarely works out"
Surprised no one said Steven Adams
Yeah like the other guy says the shooter can't cross the line until the ball hits the rim so its a violation if he only hits backboard or air. Rebounders can move as soon as the ball leaves the players hands though.  Here is a couple of intentional misses that I remember working:  [Yao Ming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohHoK4-LeuY)   [Steven Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-9OZvl1c)

Lacking Steven Adams ruined NOLA tonight. No one could stop Fox down the stretch driving at all.
"I’ve done some amateur boxing and there’s maybe 1-3 players I would actually stand a chance against. Can you imagine a 6ft dude in decent shape trying to fist fight, I don’t know, Steven Adams? lol hard pass"
Giannis or Steven Adams I want zero problems with either of them
Steven Adams
"I had Russ as a customer twice at my time working at the Apple store. Both times he put his hood up and faced the wall directly. Turns out, people want to know who the gargantuan-sized man trying not to stand out is. He was friendly with everybody that approached him.  I sold Steven Adams a MacBook during his rookie season, before the hair and the beard. He had his name listed as Dr. Steven Adams on some registration information. I asked him, why?  ""I thought it was funny."" It was."
"Man if only we had good individual defenders like Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, or that Josh Hart! Maybe we could add in a great help defender like Steven Adams!  Then you know what we could do? Give them more than 18 games to judge whether or not its gonna work."
Trading Jrue for Bledsoe is a downgrade. And Steven Adams is simply not good.
"Short players get away with a lot of hits on bigger guys and people don't care because ""they are big it can't hurt that bad"". I personally love these hits on midgets that get out of line. Steven Adams laying out Beverly being the best."
I want Lowry to get hit with a Steven Adams screen just like Pat Bev
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
"A hook is definitely a variation of a jump shot, same thing with a floater. The fact you won’t acknowledge that says a lot.   Are you kidding me? 10-16 classic mid range shooting. Kobe and Jordan lived off the 15 footer and they’re considered elite jump shooters.   Let’s take LMA for example. Someone whose considered an elite mid range shooter for his position, for his career he takes 20% of his shots from 10-16 feet and he averages 41% from there. AD for comparison averages 16% of his shots from there and averages 44% from there for his career.   Steven Adams takes .05% of his shots from that distance for his career. But let’s take a look at his most efficient season when he shot 57% from that distance. I. 2015-2016 he shot 18-29 from 8-16 feet(I couldn’t find the 10-16 feet so this is close enough). Now let’s compare that to AD. We can use an average year for him. So in 2013-2014 he shot 43% from that distance. He shot 42-88 from 8-16 feet. Obviously Adams is efficient when he does take shots from that distance but % doesn’t tell you the whole story. One takes way more shots from there so he’s obviously going to have lower numbers. That’s why no one uses FG% anymore when discussing someone’s shooting. Harden has a low FG% compared to other great scored today but no one would say he wasn’t a good shooter.   Your straw man argument falls apart when you put context to the numbers lmao."
"Turnarounds? Sure. Hooks? Hell no. A hook is not a jump shot.    AD is good from **one distance**, which is the least representative of jump shooting. And he's trash from all the other ones. You are not elite at shooting if you shoot 30% from 16-24 feet and 33% from 3. Stop it.  Steven Adams has great numbers from 10-16 - better than AD actually. I want you to tell me with a straight face that despite having zero jump shot, he's an elite shooter. After all, he shoots better than AD from apparently the only range that matters. Ignore that he sucks from everywhere else.   Steven Adams is an elite shooter."

Steven Adams.
"You can't see a lot of good defense, a post of Steven Adams rotating correctly,  communicating with his teammates and closing out at various levels of urgency depending on the percentage of the shooter is just not very interesting"
What happened to Steven Adams?
"I called Steven Adams washed yesterday and said yall were too focused on that one games statline and overlooking his overall performance the last two seasons.   4 points, 2 rebounds, 3 turnovers. Don't let the friendly face and the long hair fool you."
"I don't think it sustainable, because as great of a player he is. Jokic is a better passer than he is and is having an MVP season. Rudy is playing elite defense and is averaging around 13 pts, not great but it is a good value stat. Davis is a player who is by far the greatest vertical spacer and finisher in NBA History. (I say this because you have seen a player have no weakness in his play, he is an elite defender, an above-average shooter from mid and three, and his ball skills make it difficult for bigs to defend him in the paint). His only problem is that he isn't enforcing his will on the court. There are games where he will go off for 30 plus, but games where he will just have 18 pts. For him, he has to average at least 7 pts per game. Get to the paint if your shot isn't going in. You are impossible to stop.   &amp;#x200B;  Zion is playing great, but a lot of an all-star hype around a player is based on both how well your stats are and how the team is doing. The team is struggling with Steven Adams &amp; Bledsoe. They have to trade both of those guys. They provide no support for Zion. And they are going to trade Lonzo which will hurt because i think the pick and roll between those two is elite. Lonzo has great vision, and Zion has elite vertical finishing.   The biggest problem is, if they make it to the playoff, you are going against teams that are gonna make him shoot three similar to Giannis, I am wondering if he can do that at a high level. We have yet to see that from him. His weight as well."
Oh yea it’s SVGs fault Ingram and Zion can’t play a lick of defense and that the front office got Steven Adams to boot.
"Lmao please go look at the mavs subreddit or a mavs Facebook group. After every loss, it’s “fire Rick Carlisle, Mark Cuban and Donnie Nelson need to go, Porzingis should be traded for Steven Adams but the Pelicans might say no”. Please stop making baseless statements."
It's nice because Adams is also teaching him all his tricks.  Brandon/Josh/Zo also fight for rebounds against Steven so it doesn't surprise me that Zion's aren't crazy high lol.
"looks like zion &amp; ingram are having a good season, maybe all-stars this year.  steven adams is a great 3rd fiddle strong big rebounding center who sets monster screens on the offense.  I bet new orleans fans have had some nice games to watch."
"Sounds like one Steven Adams to me. Rebound, PNR with Luka for easy lobs"

"He missed at least a couple tip ins you would've expected Steven Adams to make, but those rebounds were so valuable regardless"
"His best game for me was the OT game he had against the Thunder a couple years back. Had it all, passing clinic, dropping threes, hard defense, and best of all, *driving into Steven Adams multiple times in an overtime that his mistake actually caused*  It’s the one game I look to that gives me hope of his success if he can be consistent. Such a complete game"

Hart getting rebounds away from Steven Adams is always funny to me
Has Steven Adams been good for the Pelicans?
Calling this a big 3 when Melo wasn't even the 3rd best player on the team was always very disrespectful to Steven Adams
"Jokic couldn't move him. Ayton is STRONG. Jokic had been playing a lot of minutes and looked pretty tired, but still. He couldn't back Ayton down, and I've seen him back down Steven Adams."
"Even a quick glance at bpm for last year shows a ton of discrepancies that are pretty irreconcilable.   For example: Steven Adams, Bradley Beal, Montrezll Harrell, and Mitchell Robinson all have a 2.9 bpm and that's a wide range of player value right there. They all have a lower bpm than Whiteside, and from what I heard he wasn't positive value for Portland last year. It's full of stuff that contextually makes no sense. Jaylen Brown had a 0.8 bpm while Hayward had a 2.7, Smart had a 1.4, Tatum had a 4.0, and Kemba topped them off at a 4.6. Not only is that wrong, I'd go so far as to say it's pretty much completely off in terms of which players played the best and which players had the most impact"
"Tomas Satoransky   (Healthy) Otto Porter   Avery Bradley   Steven Adams  Jae Crowder   Sato and Otto are generally productive, though they haven't consistently been part of winning teams. That could change this season though, depending on how the Bulls play throughout the season.  Bradley, Adams, and Crowder have each played as starters on good teams. Maybe not as productive this season, but definitely last season and previous ones too."
"I remember there were literal studies showing the disparity on officiating on *who* you are, not *what* you did. Nets were an OK team a few years back (enough to make the playoffs in the East, not saying much), but despite performance that equaled some teams with star players, the officiating against them was so lopsided it was ridiculous, like a 30% disparity.   Then of course we can't ignore all the officiating scandals of the past. Why was Draymond green suspended in the 2016 finals, but got away with repeatedly stomping Steven Adams nuts in the WCF? To me that title still feels fake, same with Wade's first ring, Shaq and Kobe's third, the list goes on."
You forgot about Steven Adams.
Embiid averages more career ppg vs Steven Adams compared to Tristan Thompson.  Hope this helps.
"LeBron: *""Steven Adams is trying to tear my shoulder!""*  Also LeBron: *(((shoving sounds)))*"
Yeah but I don't know whether they had the cap space with 44 mil of CP3 and 28 mil of Steven Adams.
They did that too you know. Steven Adams had the second highest rebound for OKC and has good passing range.

"yeah but i'm curious as to how him grabbing the board helps with generating the fastbreak, as opposed to him catching the outlet pass from steven adams and pushing the pace the same way"
"To all the Russ stans: How did Steven Adams spoon-feeding him a rebound on the other end of the court help with ""generating fastbreak points""?  Back when Russ was on the Thunder, Adams would box out and let him get uncontested boards  Thunder fans would always say ""we have a 80% win rate when he gets a triple double"", ""when Russ gets the rebound it generates fastbreak points""  What does an uncontested defensive rebound with both Westbrook and Adams in the backcourt have to do with fastbreak points?  The opposing team got back already- they're entirely on the other side of the court with the defense set up by the time Russ has grabbed the board  How would their offense be any different than if Adams got the board himself and gave Russ an outlet pass? It's literally the same exact thing, except Russ would be closer to his own basket, therefore saving clock  As for the win rate, correlation =/= causation"
Damn? They really want Bron to be the bad guy on this sub. I've scrolled through all these heavy downvotes. At least he didn't get kicked in the balls... twice. RIP Steven Adams
Steven Adams
"Nope, I'm asking for accuracy instead of how it seems to become a bigger and bigger thing the more people dislike him.  They were absolutely things he deserved to be punished by the league for, but there's way too many people talking with stuff like ""been doing that for *years*"" or ""an *entire season*"" instead of actually saying what he really did.  All three happened in the same season, two in the same playoff series on Steven Adams (who was playing such a hard working, never quit game that I think it got under Draymond's skin because that's usually how he wins despite being smaller - he got stupid because of it)."
Yeah when he carried the team and had such super stars around him like;  - Not good yet Oladipo  - Bad defense Enes Kanter   - Jerami Grant before this year   - Steven Adams who was actually pretty good.   - Ersan Ilyasova before he went to the Bucks for the 237th time.   Yeah those teams were totally loaded with talent feeding him stats.

"End of first Quarter:  Rebounds - Steven Adams 8, Washington Wizards 8. Close contest atm."
"This isn't a bad question.  Center right now is still super undervalued... except when it's not (\*cough\* Steven Adams \*cough\*).  It's really hard to figure.  Like Houston didn't want to pay Jarret Allen.  Both Boston and Indy supposedly couldn't find any takers when shopping Myles Turner for a 1st.  It's a weird situation out there for Centers.  Seems unless you have that 'it' factor, no one wants you.  And Drummond does not have it."
"In your defense, both of those guys have been interviewed about Duncan:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/thunder-steven-adams-tim-duncan-nice-guy-story   https://www.poundingtherock.com/2019/10/8/20904850/when-tim-duncan-welcomed-brook-lopez-to-the-jungle"
"&gt;Westbrick never had a good mid range shot, much less a great one  Great was an overstatement, I will admit that, but his volume and the type of shots he's taking (end of clock situations), he's been above average in 16-17 and 19-20 and right around average the years in between. He was pretty good in some KD years as well.   &gt;His rebounds are a joke. He started shamelessly padding those stats but not closing out on shooters and by snatching rebounds from his own bigs or demanding that the back off and let him have them.  That was OKC's set-up. Bigs clear the path and Russ grabs the board so he can push the ball as quickly as possible. It made sense and it worked. Also remember how many people said Steven Adams was going to lead the league in rebounding without Westbrook? How much did his rebounding go up?   &gt;his best rebounding season was 7.8 rpg (2015-16). As soon as he got traded to Houston, and they would let him pad so shameless he dropped back down to 7.9 rpg.  And how may PGs average that many rebounds? OKC had them inflated because Russ was running so much offense they wanted the ball in his hands, that wasn't the case with Durant and Harden. But even with a different scheme, he's grabbing more rebounds than most at his size/position.  Westbrook's rebounding numbers benefited from playing in OKC, that's not debatable. But you don't just magically get 10 rebounds a a game for three straight seasons but doing what you're saying. He is one of the best rebounding guards of all-time. Sure there are plenty of better rebounders, but not many coming from the PG position.   &gt;Wesbrick's only value is in getting to the basket and scoring or drawing fouls and in passing. If he had stuck to driving and dishing and played defense instead of chasing cheap rebounds to pad his stats, he could have been a truly great player  That's an hilarious over simplification and you're not even critiquing him for the biggest flaw in his game. Why were those post-OKC teams (specifically the first two years before George broke out) able to win as many games as they did?  Again, you're just sighting numbers from basketball reference without looking at the context to those numbers. And keep saying Westbrick, it really adds to the quality of your post."
I think Zion and Steven Adams stick out more because pretty much every other team has a 4 or 5 that had some kind of perimeter shot. Other teams can space the floor more while teams can get away with more zone D vs the Pels.  It also doesn't help Lonzo shoots the most 3s a game on that team
I love Steven Adams but he can’t be good for zions development.  Same with Bledsoe.
Baffling offseason. Who thought that team needed Steven adams
Rose/Steven Adams/Jokic are rarely negatively talked about   Kyrie definitely most hated. He can literally say 'I like cake' and people will somehow get offended by it lol
"Kinda saw this coming. They have Zion which is wonderful but they surround him with Steven Adams, Bledsoe, Lonzo    Where’s the spacing!?!?"
I think Steven Adams had a 20/20 game on him too lol
"Absolutely played Jokic very well. Ayton is STRONG. Part of Jokic's problem this 'series' was that he is pretty gassed right now and you could see him give up on trying to back Ayton down. I haven't seen that many times, even against guys like Steven Adams."
Damn I've never seen Jokic defended like this. Jokic used to man handle and physically abuse Steven Adams every time he plays us and Steve is a great post defender. Ayton may also be one of the best defenders in the league. I think Jokic will take this personally like he did to gobert (he struggled vs him I think) and start dominating him
i think draymond is better than steven adams
"I mean it’s not that surprising, the team is basically one super star next to a bunch of average fringe starter/bench player type guys. At least in the west I think the kings are the only team with a worse 2nd best player than you guys. This years warriors reminds me a bit of the 2016 thunder when Russ won mvp, but even Steven adams is better than anyone on the warriors this year. If curry drags this team to the playoffs it will definitely be a boost to his legacy."
"David Griffin constructed a poor team around Zion. Lonzo's been in the league for 3 seasons now. If you were expecting him to save you from the 3 pt line, that's your fault because there's nothing about watching him that makes you think he's ""suddenly start missing threes.""  Griffin could've gotten better shooters in the offseason but didn't. The only reason Steven Adams is a positive for your roster is because you literally don't have any other centers. You guys have no worthy bigs besides him. And then he picked Bledsoe over George Hill, again which could've helped your shooting. He didn't get shooters for Jrue Holiday. This is not a well-made team for Zion."
"What did they expect when they traded their best two-way player, extended Steven Adams and hired a fossil to be their coach?"
Because they're last in 3P%. Which is probably due to the fact that they have \*checks notes\* Zion AND Steven Adams on the floor together. And then their second unit consists of \*check notes again\* Zion and Jaxson Hayes sharing the same floor together.
"&gt; look at their draft picks for the last decade  Yeah, let's look at their draft picks over the last decade when their only picks not in the 20s were Steven Adams (12), Cameron Payne (14) and Eric Bledsoe (18). It's hard to draft great role players when they are dealing with the crap shoot of the late first round."
Naz reid quietly dominating the league lately. Steven adams couldn't do anything all game
Reid is really fucking up Steven Adams
Gz to anyone with Steven adams on your fantasy team
Lol. Do you see my flair? You're talking about how everyone was outraged that Draymond didn't get suspended after kicking Steven Adams in the balls. What team was Adams on? Move along nephew
"As they should, to be fair; A baby hook isn't a mid lol.   For example, you'd never say Steven Adams is an elite midrange shooter (3-14 last season), but by your metric you'd say he was. Like he shot 51.3% from 10-16 last season...but none of them were jumpers  There's a difference between post moves/layups/floaters and a midrange jumper"
Steven Adams would have got the [Chris Dudley treatment.](https://youtu.be/AbJlEKI4-Co?t=11)
Id still say Embiid would be the best to put up against him. Definitely not Steven Adams lol
Steven Adams is not a good player
"It was not an analogy, it should have been an analogy so it might have made sense but you forgot to actually have an analog. It was just a statement. Your  argument was that Shaq would be a liability in today's NBA, and the only evidence you could supply for this was that he would get roasted in the pink n roll, just like Kanter is despite the fact that he's massively better than Kanter in every measurable way.  If I were to say something like Charles Barkley would be a liability in today's NBA and my only evidence to that point was that Steven Adams is exposed in playoffs despite being a better defender than Chuck it would not be an analogy but it would be really, really stupid because the two players are nothing alike. Even if I tried to make it into an analogy it would be a terrible one because the two players have nothing in common, just like Shaq and Kanter don't.   Defensive liabilities get plenty of time on the floor in today's NBA. Steph and Dame are both perfect examples of that, and Shaq wouldn't be any worse than they are while providing similar effectiveness on offense. Saying Shaq would be a liability in today's NBA is idiotic, all time dominant players don't become liabilities just because they would have a weakness. Bill Russell doesn't become a liability just because he wouldn't have much of an offensive game today."
&gt; When they made that trade this off-season and decided to keep Bledsoe over George Hill.  It takes two teams to make a trade. They wanted Steven Adams. I doubt OKC wanted Bledsoe.
Steven Adams clogs the paint while Ingram plays hero ball between he and Zion.
Really? I always felt Steven Adams had one of the better touches in the paint and at the rim. He also had that crazy box out stat a few years ago. I feel like he rarely makes mental errors.
He gets too much of a pass for kicking Steven Adams in the nuts
Steven Adams mate
Man he's like the one dude on the list of hate playing against them guys that I also just don't want. I do not want to root for Beverley. When I need to be cheered up I watch Steven Adams annihilate him on YouTube.
"Yes, up there with Steven adams"
"Luka's block numbers are interesting. He averages more per game than Jokic, Vucevic, Steven Adams, Ben Simmons, Sabonis, and, just to be a jerk, Bagley."
"People decided Steven Adams and spacing were our issues, and they'll stick with it"
adore steven adams
"As a jazz fan it happens on a pretty consistent basis when we play on the road, mitchell hit his breaking point you know its a problem when Mitchell snap he is a good calm dude all the time, thats like Steven adams gettin that pissed."
Yeah I don’t think we’ve been watching the same Steven adams lol. Not worth an extra 2 years 35m
Robin Lopez is much better than him for like $5m. Adams has a $30m this year + $35m 2 year extension. Steven Adams needs to overhaul his terrible fitness regime. I read his profile a few years ago and he said he drank Guinness after every workout and knew this guy was doomed but didn't expect it to be this bad.
"I'll give you an argument that doesnt include any of that -  Steven Adams on Def RTG 117.36,  Steven Adams off Def RTG......117.15  wait shit"
"Agility, vertical, first step for a big man was off the charts. Dude was a freak of nature. Steven Adams has size and strength. Yao ming had size and strength. Mark Eaton has size and strength. A. Sabonis had size and strength. None of these guys had the athleticism. Did you even watch his career? Youre way off here"
&gt; Reminder that Steven Adams' is the highest paid center in the league this season at $29.5 million.  Actually he's making 27.6M this year and isn't even close to being the highest paid.
It replaced Steven Adams' gold tooth.
Steven Adams has a career in sports media if he wants it  Shit I wouldn't mind him in an Inside the NBA style show
Back in the day?  #Steven Adams is 27yrs old!!!
"To be fair, the Thunder also lost Steven Adams, Danilo Gallinari, and Schroeder, who are all extremely productive players."
Steven Adams got his back
Steven Adams would probably win if they let him heave his 3s from half-court.
"I would actually love if they got a bunch of bricklayers. Steven Adams, Ben Simmons, Draymond, and Joakim Noah. That would be so entertaining."
"I feel like the Adams play is the right thing to do just the wrong player. Imo Zion needs to be the 5 on offense and the 4 on defense (especially since his rim protection isn’t amazing). He’s gonna need a semi traditional big to play the 5 on d, why they signed non shooting Steven Adams to do it is anyone’s guess but it makes sense on the defensive side at least."
"Couple things here. I’m sure Hill was the one we had more offers for at that point. Steven adams isn’t great but the idea was to bring in some tough vets in he and bled to help bring the young guys along after seeing that be a huge hole last season. Good idea in theory and Adams has been fine but Eric just doesn’t care most nights it seems. Also Bled should’ve never been selected to all defense over jrue. If you go back and watch film he made a lot of the same mistakes with the bucks, he just had giannis and Lopez backing him up at the rim."
"Yeah, I watch plenty of them and am super active on the pels discord (who all agree with Steven Adams being bad lol). Nephews here just don’t know how to tell is a player is good or bad on defense."
"Any big white center can give Embiid fits. Marc Gasol, Steven Adams....those types of players"
Steven Adams exists.
Steven Adams has to be my favorite current player that has never played for the Jazz.  I'd burn my family savings to finance a buddy cop movie with him and Joe Ingles.
I too would like to subscribe to Steven Adams Facts ^^tm
"&gt; a good point guard. When he's off the court we can get ridiculously clunky at times.   &gt;   &gt;Zion is the best at making reads/creating offense on our team. Followed by BI and then Steven Adams. Zo is starting to get better at it though (or maybe just more into his flow after a slow start.) A dominant PG doesn't fit into our system anyway though, because BI/Z like to get a lot of reps at point.  They just gotta take Onyeka from the Hawks and it's a wrap for the league."
Was Steven Adams out for this?
Isn't giving much on offense either. He throws balls away on his possessions... it's mind-boggling. He tries to throw up super athletic lobs to Steven Adams or pass to him in the middle of traffic.  Too many times it feels like he's just passing the ball into the other teams' hands for no reason.
"It starts with Steven Adams who is not a good defender either in PnR or at protecting the rim.  Teams are shooting 68% in the restricted area against the Pelicans which is 2nd only to the Nuggets this year (70%).  Adams gives up 1.42 points per poss in PnR which is the worst mark among all players that have defended &gt; 20 PnR possessions this season.  SVG doesnt even trust him to finish games anymore bcuz he knows teams target him on PnR or switches, instead they go small by inserting Josh Hart in and playing Zion at the 5.  They need a long-term starting center, which is probably a problem bcuz they've already committed $65 million to Adams through 2023."

"Giannis just moved Steven Adams, he must be strong"

What a clever play by Steven Adams.
Steven Adams is so zen
Steven Adams with the reverse 3-point play
Steven adams  one handed
"Pels fans, how has Steven Adams been this season so far??"
Its HBK! STEVEN ADAMS!!
Steven Adams could tear you apart limb from limb.
Man Steven Adams is built like a gorilla
Myles Turner is the obvious one. A different one is Steven Adams
Ever see the video of Steven Adams playing against the Korean basketball team? He’s dribbling like Kyrie and he’s not even allowed to handle the ball in the NBA.
"I hate saying things like this because they’re so annoying to hear but I would’ve tried to package the picks and make a play at a guys like Myles Turner, DeMar Derozan, Steven Adams, Bogdan Bogdonvic, Jrue Holiday, Harrison Barnes. Or if I was really confident in my draft skills I wouldve made more of an effort to move up in the draft in either 2019 or 2020"
"Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond, Enes Kanter, Greg Monroe, Steven Adams, Allen Iverson"
"6'4"" 260lbs though. He's pretty far from normal proportions too, though I do agree Steven Adams is even more of an outlier and would have a harder time because of his extreme height.   I just thought it was amazing that the rock was able to do it at 260 lbs."
i think i'm in love with steven adams
I stan Steven Adams
"Yeah the comparison between the rock and steven adams isn't fair. The rock still has human proportions (he's actually 6'4""), steven adams is superhuman in size."
"You mean, Steven ""Jason Mamoa"" Adams?"
"Could you imagine playing against Steven Adams? His muscles are like corded steel. One time I had a New Zealander on my back on the set of News Radio, and it just slapped my back, it was so hard, I nearly fell over. Motherfuckers are strong as shit!"
"It's also an ""exponentially easier for small people than large people"" move due to size and leverage. Marcus Smart can kip up, that's the only clip of an NBA player doing it I can find.  I did find another clip of [Steven Adams jokingly failing to do one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay1GL__-1L4) though.  Interestingly enough, there are clips of The Rock doing them, so it's not impossible for larger folk."
Steven Adams is a goddamn treasure
Steven Adams is a universal treasure.
I feel like Steven Adams and Jimmy Butler would be a funny duo
Just look up Josh Hart’s stat lines. He’s one of the best rebounding gaurds in the league. Him and Steven Adams make up a lot of the boards for the pels. Zion doesn’t need too rebound a whole lot when those two guys are on the team.
"Steven ""Shawn Michaels"" Adams"
I feel like its easy to forget these people are seven feet tall... Like it's honestly a miracle Steven Adams moves as well as he does.
Steven Adams is literally every middle school kid who at one point tried this...
Im laughing my ass off at the idea of Steven Adams playing with his wallet in his back pocket right now.
Steven Adams on the muhfuckin floor tell em George

Shoutout to Steven Adams for the funniest moment of the game when he tried to do that crazy ninja getup and just fell back on the floor
Yea it was inevitable :/ He deserves the steven adams contract forsure. Hope y'all win it all this year btw
Steven Adams is a fucking gem
"Steven Adams is the best.  Even if he did create spacing issues, I'd want to keep him for his personality and hustle.  But the stats show he's a giant net positive when on the court too."
bro running into someone and hurting yourself is not their problem or else steven adams would be unplayable
Steven Adams is literally every moderately in shape teenager who believes they could do this.
Lmao Steven adams the goat for this one
"I'm comparing his defensive impact to a wing, not a Steven Adams.  I'd elaborate further but I'm too busy watching the Pels give up 39 in the 1st quarter to the Pistons 3rd stringers."
He doesn't have the same responsibilities as someone like Gobert or Embiid on defense though. Steven Adams exists
"Kemba, Boban, Steven Adams"
"CP3 admits he's grown up over the years. The Clipper locker room was different b/c CP had an old school, vocal, pull-no-punches approach, while Blake was more passive aggressive. Blake probably felt the Clipper was ""his team,"" but when CP3 joined he likely took his role as the ""coach on the floor"" off-court. Having the coach's son in the locker room added to the tension.   CP3 was excellent in OKC. He coached up the young guys, and you can still see his influence in their play. He also bought the entire team suits, and even got Steven Adams to wear his for their ""suit night."""
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
"I feel like this guy has been an aging center on his veteran years before retirement for the last 10 years.  Steven Adams has the same energy too. ""He'll probably retire after this season.""  Wait he's 27?"
"They needed to pair him with a big that can actually shoot, not Steven adams"
Man Steven Adams got snubbed twice
both brad stevens and steven adams have first names for last names with an s added at the end
U are right steven adams is so fucking motivational
"He still looks like a kid, but in a few years, he's going to have that Steven Adams effect."
"I get it, its harder to get rebounds when u have steven adams and such but its also hard to put up 25 when you have cp3 ayton and a bevvy of scoring options at the 3 and 4. The knock on booker was that he couldnt win and now that the Suns are destroying elite competition they put zion in ahead of him when zions on a losing team"
Steven Adams wrote a book and he dedicated pages explaining why Reggie was an asshole for what he did and didn't fit the culture.
"Porzingis for Steven adams, hart, and lonzo.    Mavs get a reliable center, secondary ball handler, and round out their defense.    Pelicans get to play zion/KP at the 4/5 on offense but vice versa on defense."
"height, wingspan and strength aren't athleticism, that would make aron baynes and steven adams the most athletic players in the league. speed, acceleration and jumping ability are; pat checks all those boxes."
"When Steven Adams writes damn near a whole chapter about how shit you are as a teammate, im willing to bet Reggie was the problem. Not Russ."
"Trade for Nikola Vucevic.   trade would probably be steven adams, and JJ reddick and a butt ton of picks for Vucevic and Evan Fournier.  Both adams and JJ are expiring deals. magic who are currently 12th in the east would get a ton of cap space and a ton of picks to set up a rebuild. can build through fultz, isaac when he is healthy again, bacon, and get bamba more minutes. if the magic can find a bonifide star in the draft and pick up and sign a really good player (maybe like bringing back oladipo) while lowkey tanking this year.    Vucevic spaces the floor for Zion. plus Fournier can create his own shot and can be a guy who can get buckets off the bench."
Porzingis for Steven Adams straight up
"Steven Adams, the guy who was voted second dirtiest player in the league by 24 actual players in 2016?"
I'd also like to point out that Steven Adams has been voted the 2nd dirtiest player in the league by actual players before and he gets tons of love on this sub. Can't put my finger on why...🤔
Did someone else force you to kick Steven Adams in the balls **TWICE**? and then force you to try and hit LeBron James in the balls? Like what? You're responsible for your own dumbass actions Draymond. All of them
I mean our FO has shown signs of competency and even if we sign a couple good role players with our cap space/hit a couple 1st round picks we’ll be a playoff team which is more then sufficient after years of suffering. Anyways I’d rather use 20 million in cap space on an All Star then spend it on Steven Adams 🤷‍♂️.
Listen to Steven Adams say he was bigger and heavier as a high school senior.
Reggie Miller comparing Steven Adams screens to JJ Watt sacks.
The Thunder had a better supporting cast with CP3 than they did in 2018-2019. These bad contracts like Steven Adams really killed the chance of them getting any other good pieces.
"I know people didn't care about us that year, but I really did think that team was a few pieces from looking like the current Clippers/Jazz/Nuggets. Doubt we'd have won anything but could have been a tough out.  I think if they could have gotten talent like Danilo or Seth Curry or just someone happy to shoot 3s, it would have made a difference. I also think we needed to give Jerami a bit of a larger role. Oh and I wanted a stretch 5. Steven Adams been terrible for like 3 years at this point lol."
"The rebounding stat alone means dick.  So it's really all up to each possession.  If say Steven Adams is clearing out and boxing out and the rebound is uncontested, Russ getting the rebound provides no value, same goes for anyone who grabs the rebound.   If the rebound is contested and Russ gets it, then he's improving the overall rebounding of his team which adds value.   If the rebound is long and Russ gets it, more value because the threat of transition offense is higher.  Offensive rebounds yield the most impact and value by far.  Westbrook's offensive rebound numbers are pretty phenomenal, especially for a guy his size. On that alone you can assume that his rebounding IS very valuable.  James Harden is the other guy with good rebounding numbers, especially during the MVP race between Westbrook and Harden. But all you have to do is look and see that Harden's offensive rebounds are completely mediocre despite having good rebounding numbers."
"You can't be serious lmao, Sabonis was a rookie who averaged 6ppg that year who by the end of the year was benched in favor of a declining Taj Gibson and Steven Adams that year scored over 10ppg for the first time in his career with a scorching 11. Oladipo was decent offensively coming in but was at best a good role player not a second star yet. Like Enes Kanter took the third most shots that year, literally no one considers a team decent when Enes Kanter is getting that many shots.   Like if you didn't watch them play that year just say that, nobody at the time was considering Sabonis a key contributor or Steven Adams as more than an okay starter. The team looking back has some good names on it but that was way before they developed the games that they have today"
Wait who’s ringo? Steven adams?
His defensive rebounds were a league low 15% contested his MVP year  Steven Adams also averaged more Offensive than Defensive Rebounds that year I believe
Extending Steven Adams before he even put a jersey on was ridiculous
He’s lucky CP3 doesn’t play with Steven Adams anymore
"Definitely Adams for winning basketball  But some of the Drummond hate goes a little far.  Even with Steven being good at  offensive rebounding, I think Andre is still definitely better at it"
The Steven Adams transformation still blows my mind lol
Drummond. He has quick hands and feet. Steven Adams is like a statue now. Always getting cooked on the perimeter
"Nope. 2 2nd round picks with a 2023 first they had from Denver, and George Hill.   https://www.si.com/nba/2020/11/21/steven-adams-pelicans-thunder-trade-grade"
"The only thing that doesn't make sense is Steven Adams but apparantely they signed him for culture purposes   They have cap space, Adams is a tradeable contract and they can build a good team"
"Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steven Adams?  Seriously though they have something like 17 or 18 FRP over the next 7 years right? I think given they have the contracts and good young players in Shai, Dort, etc they could realistically get 3 all star/2 superstar caliber players pretty easily."
better is subjective. Like lebron is better than Steven Adams
if Poku turns into a Steven Adams tier shredded brick wall I'm going to sue Sam Presti for fleecing reality and getting a first round pick out of it
Draymond in 5 years has gone from my most hated player (RIP steven adams future children) to one of my favs  Talk ya talk big fella
Damn that's crazy because I could've sworn that a certain GSW player caused the spurs to lose and caused Kawhi to essentially leave the spurs or maybe when Draymond decided to kick Steven Adams
"I love Steven Adams. Could fight anyone in the league, but is still nice as anything"
Probably not a double dribble but definitely a huge carry. His hand is practically under the ball for a decent amount of time which is probably why Steven Adams closed out with the block attempt
"Who cares if the washed out LaMarcus Aldridge can come in and score 22pts, he has no defense. Did you see how Steven Adams dropped 40pts on his ass?    /s"
Steven Adams had like 20 something against the Wolves on perfect shooting I think
Griffin paid Steven Adams a big bag to do nothing but make the game harder for the Pelicans best two players.
Doris said Steven Adams on the All NBA Back-Alley team lmao
Doris banging Steven Adams later
biggest hustler is Steven Adams and his $27 million dollar salary
"He kills top centers. Embiid, KAT, Gobert, old man tyson chandler, steven adams. Crushed em all."
"The only reliable shooters are Zo and BI in a league shifting towards 3pt shots... Roster just sucks tbh. Steven Adams is an upgrade over Favors but at 17m/yr that's nasty. I've seen Bledsoe and Hart airball the 3 so many times this season. If this was 2003 it might've been a decent roster, but not today. If I was GM I'd flip BI for another superstar, and get actual role players that fit in today's NBA. Pels have picks for days and they really should not be afraid to pull the trigger, Zion is literally the future of the NBA and you've already got the guard position covered with Lonzo, who just has the best chemistry with Zion. Fill the rest of the blanks and go from there"
"You're clearly beyond emotionally invested in this. Are you KD's Reddit burner account?  Why did you go straight to Caron Butler and just glance over Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka? Westbrook was hurt for part of the year, but still played in 65 games that year including the playoffs. Ibaka averaged 15/9 and was first-team All-Defense. They also had Caron Butler, Steven Adams, Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefalosha, Derek Fisher, and Nick Collison who are all 10+ year NBA players. That team wasn't the 2017 Warriors, but they weren't even close to those crappy Lakers teams."
While jumping off Steven Adams back.
A timeline in which they got Zion? They wanted some who could space the floor and had money to spend. It makes complete sense. The move that makes no sense was Steven Adams.
"If Lonzos 3pt shoot isn’t falling, he can’t do much else in regard to scoring for us. Perimeter defense has been bad all year. Eric Bledsoe is terrible. Steven Adams gets more hate than he deserves but he’s been less than stellar. And now our guys are getting injured left and right"
They have Zion and the fossil Steven Adams. Might be the worst perimeter defense in the game
"I also got J&amp;J and felt like I had taken a charge from full-speed Zion, then got up and ran into a screen from human brick wall Steven Adams. Thinking about it, Jesus Christ, even though the Pelicans suck, it must be a bitch physically to play them."
"I suppose if he wanted to give back a meaningful amount of the guaranteed money from the last year of his deal, it might make sense to buy him out after the trade deadline next year. I am optimistic that Presti will find a taker for his contract this offseason, though. All it takes is one team, as we saw with the now-comical Steven Adams heist last offseason."
He thought Baynes was his boy Steven Adams for a second there
Steven Adams would like a word
I'd say the downvotes were warranted if you were suggesting GS trade the #2 pick for Steven fucking Adams
"Steven Adams is nice, but he was considered a dirty player at one point. Kicked Bradley Beal in the balls, he throws elbows, etc."
"I got downvoted before the draft but I didn't understand why GS didn't go after Steven Adams. It seemed like they really didn't want Wiseman but didn't they could have gotten value for the pick otherwise. Oubre was just another stopgap while waiting on Klay. You have one of the greatest shooters of all time, get him someone with high BBIQ that can screen and get him open looks."
"Yeah they’re way off. It’s more of a David Griffin and SVG problem than Ingram. Ingram’s playing his role. It just so happens they 1) don’t have a lead ball handler to set things up for him and Zion, and 2) they have zero spacing out there because they decided to pair Zion with Steven Adams and Bledsoe in most lineups to be passable defensively.     Ingram is averaging 23/5/5 on 47/38/87 and they think he’s the problem?   It’s like people for the longest time thinking Middleton was the problem with the Bucks then realizing that he’s the perfect compliment to Giannis and the rest of the teams needed some altering."
And he has Steven Adams and Zion on his team. Imagine him on like the warriors or something he’d get like 12 a game
"Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Steven Adams"
Steven Adams is the box out champion and Zion is 6'6 he doesnt actually get as many rebounds as you may perhaps expect.
i think literally anyone on new orleans could ask steven adams to box out the paint for them so they can grab some cheeky rebounds and he would more than happily oblige 😂
"Not a pels fan, but Steven Adams was boxing out for him and he was statpadding boards"
"They traded him for Steven Adams. But we didn’t want to give him up, Pelicans wouldn’t agree to the trade if we didn’t."
"Yeah, and Steven Adams was 100x the player Bennett was haha."
Steven Adams went in the lottery that year. It was a shit year.
"Steph had loaded ass GS, by the playoffs Steven Adams was dominating Duncan, SA's true colors were showing."
"&gt;Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT. So that's already a lot of names considering that 6/7 centers make the all-star teams, if that.  Robinson doesn't play defense consistently and Adams doesn't provide help defense consistently.  Of the rest you mentioned they are all ""all star level"".  Which just proves my point."
"Gobert, Bam, Nurkic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, Ayton, Mitchell Robinson, Poetl, Steven Adams. Then you have all-star level centers that aren't great defenders like Jokic, Vucevic or KAT."
He put up 21/12 in a win against Steven Adams two days ago so yeah absolutely agreed
Maybe if Green got suspended for kicking Steven Adams in the nuts during the WCF the Warriors don't even make the finals.
"That takes into account the last 3 years, so basically the last 2 playoffs for Harrell.  Whilst I'm sure his grandmother's death affected him, it's more about his skillset and that skillset not being conducive to the playoffs.   That guy who tweeted what I originally posted is the BBALL Index founder and Lakers fan, and what he said is on point, bigs who are post scorers on offense or anchor bigs on defense have a lot less value in the playoffs.   Conversely, bigs that are stretch bigs on offense or mobile bigs on defense, have a lot more value in the playoffs.  Think about it logically, it makes sense. It's why somebody like Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson (god damn it Danny Ainge), Drummond, Harrell etc. aren't valuable in the playoffs, whereas bigs like Ibaka, Gorgui Dieng are what everybody wants.   Celtics played Theis over Kanter in the playoffs for most of last season. Raptors were dominant whenever they played Ibaka in the playoffs last season, but thankfully they didn't play him enough minutes, and we high PnRed Gasol to death when he was out there and exploited him."
"I mean look at the 2016 thunder roster that Westbrook took to the playoffs. The only players that are still in the league are Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, Sabonis, and Oladipo. Grant and Sabonis were both really young and no where near the players they are today, and Oladipo was awful that season.  I'm not saying Draymond, Kent Bazemore, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman are better (they might be, but I haven't watched any warriors games). But Steph doing worse than what russ already did and gets called GOAT level lmao"
Steven Adams just gives everybody rebounds.
"""You don't want to mess with me. You eat with spoon and fork. I eat with hands.""   Steven Adams"
Enes Kanter and Steven Adams starting next to each other for a series was one of the last tall ball successful post season series win
- Gilbert Arenas holding a gun - Ron Artest who thinks everyone is a bitch-ass Pistons fan - Angry Steven Adams
"I love it cause he got almost the entire team into halal food. I remember a story he told about getting halal food early on when he got to OKC and he said Steven Adams just walked by and took some of his food as a joke and loved it. Next thing you know, the entire locker room is scarfing down halal.      I miss the Stache bros =\["
"I mean, having an elite playmaker definitely helps a scorer's efficiency. Not to take anything away from mpj as he's a good young player, but I doubt he'd be scoring this efficiently if he was playing with Steven Adams instead of jokic"
"Buddy. You’re not making the poor you think you are. One of the best aspects of having Russ and Harden was that you always had an elite playmaker on the floor. There was no obligation to play Russ and Capela big minutes together. Nonetheless, Russ and Capela built great synergy as the season progressed. Russ was playing well and the team was wining with Capel on the roster. He was injured and wouldn’t have been available for the playoffs. The Rockets made a two birds with one stone kind of decision. Stop trying to make it an indictment against Russ. He played with Steven Adams as his center for Christ’s sake."
I remember when Steven Adams was about 29 feet out. Westbrook passed it to him and said 'shoot it you fucking midget.'
"Better centers. Jo Jo, Jokic, Vucivic, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Drummond, Allen, Nurkic, Aldridge, KAT, Ayton, Gobert, Steven Adams, Clint Capella, Christian Wood Ehhh bout the same: Mason Plumlee, Time Lord, Noel, Poetl, Claxton, Kanter."
I’m not talking about that right now...that’s not the point of the post. But even so...I said Myles Turner or Serge Ibaka. Both better defensively than Steven Adams.
the common factor? steven adams
"All you did was throw out a bunch of teams and names and didn’t even check if the money works lol. The only one that remotely makes sense and makes the money work out is the celtics offering their entire TPE and their 2 picks for Aldridge.   Zeller does not make nearly enough to match salaries.  Bledsoe does not make nearly enough to match salaries. Steven Adams cannot be traded this year bc he signed an extensions after august 6th. The Knicks “fillers that they just waived” make nowhere near enough to match salaries.  Robin Lopez doesn’t make nearly enough to match salaries &amp; “filler” is not a player nor a contract, it’s just a bail out answer.  Again, “filler” doesn’t play for the Mavericks and doesn’t make $24 million.   So, just to recap, you mentioned “plenty of teams” and offered one legitimate answer. I guess that’s enough, smartass."
I cant believe Steven Adams is clogging the lane and killing our offense so much that we only have the... checks notes... top ranked offense over the last 30 games.
If there’s nothing wrong with Steven Adams they don’t need a new center right?
"He has Ingram, Lonzo, Steven Adams, even Eric Bledsoe. Tatum has Jay and Kemba. Name another."
Remember when Pelicans fans were mad that they got Steven Adams instead of Baynes? lmao
"Can't tell if serious cause of April Fools, but I don't think a team will overpay him that much lol. He deserves to get the bag, but then again Steven Adams has his ridiculous contract lol.  Edit: 4/$80 M makes a bit more sense lol. It used to be 4/$100M."
Still looks fantastic for an Undrafted guy. I could see him developing into a great roll man if he puts on a bit more weight. Steven Adams lite maybe
"Perk doesn't belong there. Ron Artest, Bill Laimbeer, Larry Johnson, Anthony Mason, Robert Parrish, Karl Malone, James Johnson, Matt Barnes, Zach Randolph, David West, Robin Lopez, Udonis Haslem, Steven Adams above Kendrick Perkins. Perk is just mean mug dude. Steven Adams is more of an enforcer than Perk will ever be even if he doesn't do the ugly mean mug like Perk did."
Steven Adams
Surprised to see all defense caliber guy like Steven Adams here.
Go into the Raptors subreddit.  It's fucking pathetic how toxic and fickle Raptors fans are.  4 months ago they were head over heels about signing FVV.   Now they talk so much shit about him. There are comments being upvoted saying they would rather have Steven Adams then FVV.
"These were my thoughts as well. JJ isn't having a good season and quite frankly doesn't have the NBA clout to choose where he gets traded. Go back to the Steven Adams podcast episode and listen to him talking about missing fame, the dude thinks he's an A-tier player."
"My 5 favorite players are all on the Jazz, so just for fun, I'll compose my team from other franchises:  PG: Raul Neto   SG: Ricky Rubio   SF: Malcolm Brogdon   PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo   C: Steven Adams  Greek Freak carries this team to a playoff position in the East, but there's probably not enough shooting for a playoff run."
"Biggest additions probably Gordon Hayward for the Hornets and Chris Paul for the Suns, biggest losses John Wall for the Rockets and Steven Adams for the Pelicans"
"Embiid, Giannis, Thybulle, Steven Adams, and Jokic.  I have no earthly idea how well they'd do."
"Kenrich Williams most underrated, Steven Adams most overrated"
His rebounds do hurt his team when he had a guy like Steven Adams. Instead of getting out in transition and having adams throwing him a outlet pass Adams boxes out for him to get the rebound. If Russell has almost 10 assists he will assist hunt instead of taking another high percentage shot himself.   His triple double win percentage doesn't mean shit.  His overall win percentage is low. And hes played with so many great players so bad team isn't a excuse
Is he the new Steven Adams meme
"Draymond, Steven Adams and Steph"
"Thank god its not Steven Adams setting up the screen, Facu might get sent to the hospital if so. lmao"
"Yes, and he only played there until he was 22 because the GM in question chose to trade him for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Alex Abrines and Mitch McGary (the final three being future  picks at the time of the trade)  If we're going to laud a GM for his picks and team-building ability, we should probably also consider their bad moves too.  Picks aren't everything."
"Also, this GM: Trading away James Harden for nothing (Steven Adams the only useful player) just because they didn't want to pay him."
I'd be thrilled if my teams best player dressed up as me for https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2015/10/25/9609898/russell-westbrook-steven-adams-costume-halloween
I want to see him try that on Steven Adams.  Might legitimately knock himself out.
Zion is a nice boss but the real Thanos is Steven Adams
I think i remember a lot of players saying steven adams was strong as hell
If he ever trucks Steven Adams I will get a tattoo dedicated to Facu
Yeah he's old and a big reason houston was able to get Harden. Morey traded him to Toronto for a weirdly protected 1st round pick that basically only transferred over a few years if it was in the lottery. It was the prize piece in the Harden trade that would yield Steven Adams for OKC.
"Jimmy still has a slightly better per 36 then Zion and that’s also not accounting for the Heat being 28th in Pace and the the Pelicans being 18th in Pace. You can go to BBRef and look at the lineups that Zion plays with.  Their top rebounders in Hernangomez, Steven Adams and Josh Hart spend either half or more of their minutes on the court with Zion. Same goes for Ingram and Lonzo playing alongside him. They surround him with rebounders to make up for his lack.  Jimmy Butler is the 3rd best rebounder on his team behind Bam and Precious. And Precious plays most of his minutes without Jimmy anyways.  You can claim stats are flawed without context, but it’s pretty easy to look into the context. There is really no argument for Zion being at Jimmy’s level at this point in their careers."
I would bet a Steven adams screen would hold up against him
And steven adams dedicated a chapter of his book to basically shit on Reggie so you know that Reggie's opinion is nothing to go off of.  Also  Fuck reggie jackson
Here's a list of Prestis first round picks   Player | Pick # ---|--- kevin Durant| 2nd Russell westbrook | 4th serge ibaka | 24th James Harden | 3rd rodrigue beaubois | 25th eric bledsoe | 18th craig brackins | 21st quincy pondexter | 26th reggie Jackson | 24th perry jones | 28th Steven Adams | 12th archie goodwin | 29th alex abrines | 32nd mitch mcgary | 21st josh huestis | 29th Cameron Payne | 14th Terrence ferguson | 21st Brandon Clark | 21st Immanuel Quickley | 25th
"Sabonis, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, Darius Bazley, Lu Dort too but I guess that doesn't really fit the narrative."
I’m a big fan of Ingram and think he’s a good passer. But he’s not as good as Booker.   I do think Ingram is weirdly underrated on this sub. He’s an efficient 20+ scorer while playing on a team that clearly isn’t built for him whatsoever.   He was forced this year to become more of a midrange shooter because the Pelicans brought in Steven Adams with Zion to take away arguably his best ability: driving.
2017 thunder was an all time carry job though. yes they had the 11th best defense but russ had no help offensively outside of a role player steven adams. kanter was solid off the bench tok but that’s as much help as russ had on offense  for reference curry has a top 5 defense right now and more offensive help than Russ did in 2017. Russ took them to the 6 seed while Curry might not even finish as a top 8 seed
[Steven Adams would like a word ](https://youtu.be/UGWHmEwXTaY)
The only person that could bully Zion is Steven Adams that’s why we had to sign him
"Also... ""allegedly fleeced"".   How was trading guys on the verge of retirement for two perennial All-Stars not a fleece?  Like does KD signing with Brooklyn mean that 37-year-old Garnett is now a better asset than 22-year-old Tatum?  Maybe she means Boston would rather have 36-year-old Pierce instead of 24-year-old Brown?  The Warriors have a better record than us right now so I guess that means they won the 1980 trade where we swapped Joe Barry Carroll for Robert Parish and Kevin Mchale.  OKC actually won when they traded James Harden for Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams."
&gt; BI and Steven Adams as questionable. I doubt BI or Adams will play either since they've been eliminated.  They didn't play in a must win against the Mavs a few days ago. Seems the starters are done for the season for them.
Steven Adams is like the offensive tackle of the NBA. He doesn’t show on the stat sheet but he does all the things to make your star player look good AND he’s strong as shit.
"LOL. On bball-ref it shows for Pels game:  * Curry: day-to-day (tailbone) questionable  * Green: day-to-day (finger) questionable  * Mulder: day-to-day (knee) questionable  * Oubre: out (wrist)  * Paschall: day-to-day (hip) **probable**  * Wiggins: day-to-day (knee) questionable  Looks like Nico, Paschall, Jordan Bell, and Smiley are gonna get big minutes on national TV lol. ESPN must be mad af since the Pels have Lonzo and Zion listed as out for Friday, and BI and Steven Adams as questionable. I doubt BI or Adams will play either since they've been eliminated. We're gonna have a rooks &amp; G-Leaguer battle on national TV."
"I mean, why do you think Pelicans traded for Steven Adams? They don't want anyone bullying Zion."
[The intentional missed free throw three from Steven Adams. ](https://youtu.be/964srQ6aKIs) Yeah it may have been more an Adams highlight but I was rooting for the Thunder this game and it was a clutch shot by Westbrook. Too bad they immediately gave it up with a bad foul on the other end.
Also unless you're [steven adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-9OZvl1c) apparently
*Steven Adams has entered the chat*
"Lebron wasn’t a perfect fit with other ball dominant players. It isn’t a coincidence that last year was the easiest championship run Lebron ever had. Yes he won in Miami, but that was because the team was so stacked. Yes he won in Cleveland but Irving had to take a back seat and they staggered the line up. Besides Kyrie really isn’t a point guard. He is mostly a shooting guard. And even then they needed an absolute miracle come back and a suspension of Draymond to win.  Yes KD didn’t win with Harden. Harden was only 21 year old.  Yes KD didn’t win with Russ. But NO ONE and I mean NO ONE will win a ring with Russ being the primary decision maker and then having terrible shooters like Kendrick Perkins, Steven Adams, Thabo Sefalosha, and Andre Roberson as the other starters."
Shut up bro u wouldn’t know you don’t watch games bro. Me big pelicans all my life I know !!!!!!! STEVEN ADAMS IS LITERALLY A TERRORIST BRO
"I really don’t understand the “Steven Adams is a terrible fit, he can’t shoot!” people. This Teams biggest problem is their defense, do people think legit stretch 5s who play good defense grow on trees??? There’s only a small handful of those players in the league, so grabbing a good veteran center who is a solid smart defender (even if he is too slow for the playoffs, which is ok they gotta win the regular season first) seems like a good move to me. And like others have said, his offensive rebounding is really tough for defenses to deal with with Zion attacking the rim so much and provides a lot of spacing in its own way.  The real problems with the team are defense and closing tight games. Their two cornerstones players play at the forward spots, which are extremely important to team defense, and they are both really really bad defenders. Zion needs a swiss army knife forward (SF or PF doesn’t really matter) who plays good defense and hits 3s next to him. As great a player as B.I. is, he is at the center of their two biggest problems: he can’t defend, and he stall their offense in crunch time (and isn’t nearly efficient enough for it to be worth it). It’s a tough situation because while you know it’s a bad fit between your two best players, you’re never gonna get equal value back for B.I. in a trade. You could trade him and see marginal improvements to the defense and end of games, but then maybe the offense sees a drop-off, and now you’re still like a 10 seed with one less cornerstone player. Plus other teams have seen the fit issues with B.I., and in many cases those issue would carry over to other teams as well. His trade value probably isn’t quite as high as one might expect given his talent and youth.   I don’t envy David Griffin at all, he’s a got a tough roster situation to work with. Buttttt he did do a pretty shitty job in Brons second stint in Cleveland so that doesn’t provide much optimism lol"
&gt; the biggest fault in the Pels roster planning is that they're guards are very bad/inconsistent if we're being honest  You know who might have helped with that? George Hill. Too bad they traded him along with a 1st round pick for *checks notes* Steven Adams.
"The Steven Adams extension is something I still don't understand, just having him makes no sense, and then locking him up for that much money for 2 more years? wtf?"
"&gt; a slight overpay for a starting caliber center  It's an extreme overpay for a traditional big. Centers who don't shoot 3s and can't defend on the perimeter are of extremely limited value in today's NBA. If all you want is a big dude who can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots, there's no need to pay that kind of money to get a player like that. Look at what guys like Ivicia Zubac, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard or Nerlens Noel are making: combined they are making $8 million less than Steven Adams is making by himself this season."
"Sorry, no, that's a horrible deal for a traditional big like Steven Adams. If all he wanted was a big dude who can't shoot 3s or guard on the perimeter but can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots he could have got any number of guys who fit that description for dirt cheap and not had to waste any draft picks to get them. Go look at what Dwight Howard and Nerlens Noel signed for and you'll see that trading George Hill and a 1st round pick just so you could pay Steven Adams $66 million over the next 3 seasons was an insane overpay."
okc has a very short history  but if i tries it would be   1-westbrook  2- durant  3- ibaka  4-steven adams  5- nick collison  6- paul george  7- james harden  8- chris paul  9- thabo sefolosha  10- shai gilgeous alexander  11-kendrik perkins  12- jeff green  or somethingh like that
He had Paul George and Steven Adams two seasons. And he never came close to getting out of the first round.
"Iirc this isn’t his first time being coached by SVG and Van Gundy sucks as a coach. Too “old school”, the team did not improve in the standings and still missed the playoffs despite having two top tier offensive players.   Incompetent FO gives Steven Adams a huge contract extension before he plays a single game in the Pelicans uniform despite already being their highest paid player. Went from one bad coach to another and they still have a shit GM."
The only part of that trade that's really bad is the Steven Adams inclusion and extension. Didn't make sense to do then and sure as hell doesn't make sense now.
"So, does this mean no more Steven Adams or Zion on JJ’s podcast?"
See when Steven Adams was on his podcast.   He doesn't understand a non famous grounded outlook very well.
david griffin has no idea how to build a team. completely lost faith in him. how the fuck do you give up assets for steven adams and then extend him. how the fuck do you keep bledsoe over george hill. has this moron ever heard of spacing? what an idiot.
"On paper pelicans is a playoff team: bledsoe, lonzo, ingram, reddick (before got traded), zion,steven adams, NAW but not sure what happened. Seems svg is just a bad coach?"
Steven Adams esque
"What was Len thinking grabbing 10 boards in 23 minutes? Hopefully Steven Adams will get in touch this offseason and explain to him that on the defensive glass, his job is just to box out and keep boxing out to give Russ an opportunity to swoop in for the rebound. If Len does this right, he will average more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds, just like Adams did."
"Currently he is feasting on backup bigs. He has a silky smooth jump shot and has a nice post game.   His all time ceiling is a low end starter or high end backup probably, he is undersized as a 5 and still gets overpowered by some bigs, he needs go to the Steven Adams school of boxouts because he doesn't rebound fantastically but it is okay because we pair him with Vando who is a fantastic rebounder."
"But saying this Warriors squad could be a poor 1st seed is going too far. It’s basically Steph and if you can get any of the other guys to step up, they’re pretty good. But it’s the Steph show. Klay coming off two injuries ain’t gonna push them back to being the best in the West. They remind me of the 2017 Thunder team. Russ’s MVP year. It was Russ and a bunch of various pieces each night. Draymond is important enough to play that Steven Adams role, but he’s inconsistent offensively"
"I wouldn't argue that, Steven Adams is a beast at boxing out and setting picks for his temmates. However just to be devil's advocate, he played with Westbrook who averages about 6 rebounds more per game than the average point guard. And the pelicans have some solid rebounders including josh hart, zion, lonzo, BI"
"yup. i wasn’t actually trying to discredit steph, just making that point. steph is actually a very underrated rebounder for a guard  rebounding comes in so many different ways. you have stronger guys who box out (brook lopez, steven adams, etc.), guys with great vertical and hustle who get up and get it like westbrook, and guys with great IQ and positioning such as curry.   Russ is a combination of the last two, yet people use raw contested rebound % to dismiss all of this all-around contributions and label him a “stat-padder”. which is dumb, curry isn’t a stat padder because of his low contested rebound %"
"steven adams is a G but objectively overpaid, idk why you would select him"
Probably not because none of them have Steven Adams  to box out for them.
PG: Stephen Curry (43 mil)  SG: James Harden (41 mil)  SF: Lebron James (39 mil)  PF: Kevin Durant (40 mil)  C: Steven Adams (29 mil)  This team just barely edges under the salary cap
It's not revisionist. Where's Terrance Ferguson? Where's Josh Huestis? Raymond Felton? Tell me how Steven Adams is looking in NOP?   Only guys doing something off them teams is Jerami Grant who's role was ridiculously diminished cuz he played alongside Paul George. And he didn't even break out fr until going to Detroit via Denver.
Only because of Steven Adams box-outs.
"Steven Adams is better than Ömer Asic, tho. So, while you can’t say the management doesn’t do the same stupid moves, at least they’re a bit less stupid this time."
"Honestly not worth getting into it with guys like this. Westbrook dragged OKC to 47 wins and the playoffs in 2017. His best teammates were Steven Adams, pre-breakout Oladipo, and Andre Roberson. The rest of the relevant guys were rookie Sabonis, pre-breakout Jerami Grant, and Enes Kanter. Guys like the dude your replying to definitely takes one look at that roster and thinks Westbrook had a good supporting cast because Grant and Sabonis are around allstar level now, but those guys were averaging under 6 ppg and weren't nearly as good as they are now. You can't argue with guys who clearly have never played or watched basketball in a meaningful way and base their entire view off of stats and hot takes. During the Thibs and Butler Minnesota stint, these were the guys calling Thibs and Butler assholes/idiots for having a supposedly antiquated attitude. Now, Thibs is a COTY candidate, Butler took a team to the finals, and the Wolves have sucked ever since. Guys with takes like these have no understanding of the intangible side of basketball and it causes them to spew nonsense because they can only interpret what is told to them or on the stat sheet."
"Boban, Steven Adams, joe Ingles"
"sitting there thinking ""yep, stealing all those empty rebounds from steven adams was worth it"""
"They ran the Steven Adams play, Russ was good.   Also, it’s just a joke Russ fans. Don’t kill me. He deserves the record for his hustle night in and night out"
Steven Adams helping Westbrook get rebounds from another conference.
Wizards and rockets legend Steven Adams
"Rui sneaking out past the defense to help Russ statpad smh. With Steven Adams making sure he's not on the same team so there's no way he can take Russ's rebounds, this is a full-blown multi-team conspiracy now."
But... but... Steven Adams
All due to Steven Adams
steven adams stretch 5 when?
Thank you Steven Adams for allowing this rebound to happen 🙏
"Yes, Ibaka was terrible. Steven Adams was obviously terrible. Reggie Jackson as a backup PG, garbage. The problem was Scott Brooks playing dumb ass rotations with Derek Fisher playing 20 more minutes a game over Reggie in the playoffs, or Beverley purposely injuring Westbrook the year they were clearly the best team in the league. Roberson was doing well with PG and Westbrook before he got hurt. He had improved his 3 point shooting and the Thunder were the best defensive team in the league before the injury.  You had Hami Diallo that the Thunder developed. They flipped Sabonis and Oladipo for PG13. This is just off the top of my head, but the ""Thunder Way"" has develop quite a few players in the past few years and you're discrediting all of them because you didn't pay attention to the Thunder."
"no they didnt. actually their inability to develop anyone alongside durant/westbrook and wesetbrook/paul george was their demise. They hit on three of their stars players early in the draft and then basically never developed any legit talent. their best player was steven adams, a mediocre center. Roberson was never a great player and consistently cost them in the playoffs. They couldnt unlock oladipo when he was on the thunder.   Yall wanna blame big markets the reality is presti put together an actually terrible team for the modern game year of year and it cost his teams despite the elite star talent he had."
How underrated is Russ' rebounding? People say he steals other people's rebounds (I guess Steven Adams is still boxing out for him) but he's putting up Rodman numbers.
"Maybe they will. Kinda depends on where they’re drafted though. Are we still talking about Kawhi in the same way today if he wasn’t drafted to San Antonio?   If these guys are drafted to OKC, they’re likely to become superstars. That organization has produced Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Domas Sabonis, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and now they’ve turned guys like Dort into productive NBA players. Their player development is off the charts.  If these guys are drafted to somewhere like Cleveland or Sacramento, chances are they’ll be squandered in a bad organization."
"&gt;The pistons with Drummond never had elite team rebounding stats  I could see a strong argument to consider Steven Adams a better rebounder than Drummond even though he has never averaged double digit rebounding while Drummond has averaged insane amount. The Thunder were a top 5 rebounding team 5 years in a row including getting first place one year, and 2nd place in two years of those years. And now guess who is tied for the best rebounding team in the league this year? The Pelicans who Adams plays for."
"I don't think us Thunder fans are criticizing Adams playing as much as we are criticizing how he and Beldsoe do not fit next to Zion. We are also criticizing the overpay. Steven is good, but not 18 million good. Thunder fans bit that pill hard about two years ago when we were paying him 20 plus mill.   In retrospect the pels should have made us take Bledsoe and you guys keep hill and Adam's and William's. But as the other guy above said. I can't believe we got assets for Steven."
"I still can't believe that we were given assets for an expiring Steven Adams AND the Pelicans gave him an extension before playing him.  I would imagine this team would be better it they had George Hill, or even Kendrich Williams with how he's been playing this year.  Forget the PG13 or Westbrook trade, this was actually highway robbery."
"Skill boost to Steven Adams, make him a stretch 5. 3 inch boost to Bledsoe and athleticism boost to Bi"
Idk for what but get rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
Why did the Pelicans extend Steven Adams again?
Draymond Green got a nut kick on Steven Adams and that was called a flagrant 1 (later upgraded to flagrant 2 and fine).
Castaways? I’m pretty sure some of those castaways are better than Eric bledsoe and Steven Adams easily
"Lonzo, Steven Adams, Bledsoe?  The Knicks are made of Randle, RJ Barrett, and NBA castaways."
Steven Adams wears a cup
"I don't know how responsible Steven Adams is for this, but he's worth whatever the Pelicans are paying him for Hayes' development alone."
"I remember when Draymond kicked Steven Adams twice, and only got technicals"
"My guy that team had pg13, russ, Dennis Schroeder, Steven adams, nerlans Noel, Markieff Morris I mean they had a pretty good team, also Felton averaged 12 minutes per game so idk what’s “significant” abt that and that’s such a bad argument to use “put prime russ on blah blah blah” put prime lebron on the warriors and they are gonna win every year, it’s all hypothetical, the thunder had a great team built for russ and u are severely down playing that and they also ended up losing to blazers who had a significantly worse roster than the thunder"
"Article from after draymonds ejection asking why:  http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2016/06/why_don_t_basketball_players_wear_cups_also_why_don_t_football_players_wear.html  Tl,dr; it’s really rare to get really injured and not worth trying to run with that on. And getting punched/hit in the nuts isn’t too common if you’re not Steven adams."
Steven Adams finished a play after getting elbowed in the head so hard he got concussed. Judging the punishment based on how hurt a player seems is why we have flopping.
"I skimmed through the majority of that very long paper. It mainly emphasizes perception of athletes as a whole as unintelligent. But it also does discuss black athlete faces being associated with more negative adjectives than white faces are. Nowhere in the research does it show that people will treat two athletes differently in similar situations based on race.   And furthermore, taking your race explanation as the main explanation is to say that implicit bias is the primary motivator. Implicit bias and unconscious motivators are present in every aspect of life. People know this. But just because they are present does not mean that they take precedence over obvious explanations like ""Draymond never had a young, overly enthusiastic fanbase whereas Luka does"". Or ""Steven Adams actually got very hurt by Draymond whereas Sexton did not"". Those are the obvious, immediate causes that are logical to jump to. It's ridiculous to consider implicit bias and ignore situational and physically observable circumstances"
"You're right, but you're being a dick about it.  Also, this sub likes Steven Adams, so they'll never admit he's nothing special."
"I feel like Steven Adams being in Hayes way of starting is not ideal. I know they were better when Adams is on the floor, and Hayes has been a lot better recently, but still..."
It’s not giannis’ fault he doesn’t have Steven Adams boxing out for him!! /s
"All 77 were stolen from Steven Adams though, so they don't count."
"drummond is not the league's best rebounder.  A good way to look at rebounding contribution is the same way as looking at scoring/defense contribution: adjusted regressions. It's RAPM in scoring but you can get adjusted REB% (how much you affect the rebounding of your lineups). Here's the current 5yr leaders  * Steven Adams (1st in oreb, 44th dreb) * Capela (3rd in oreb, 6th in dreb) * Boban (6th in oreb, 4th in dreb)  JV, Kanter, TT, DeAndre, Dwight, Looney and Nurkic round out the top 10. Drummond is 13th (7th in oreb, 212th in dreb).   It's also how we know Westbrook (310th) , Harden (837th) aren't huge rebound contributors, despite their impressive counting numbers. Adams doesn't have the counting numbers but he boxes out extremely well and someone on his team gets the rebound.   The 3 year numbers have Drummond at 7th (With Favors and Mitchell Robinson sneaking into the top 10)."
"You’re right, replacement level isn’t the right word, average is probably more accurate.  And I’ll point out that on/off stats are very tricky. Admittedly, I only used Russ’s from this year because they continued the general trend I was pointing out in my comment, but there are plenty of confounding factors that skew the results(see Mike Conley being the MVP). If say, somebody played alongside one of the best rebounders of recent history, that would affect things quite a bit(I don’t think even the most rabid Russ fans would suggest he’s actually worth +8 off reb %). There are two ways you could get around this problem.  -	You could look at games at which Russ missed and compare team rebounding then, which would completely eliminate the lineup problem, but you’d be working with small sample sizes -	Or, you could look at his ridge regressed rebound rate, which adjusts for contextual lineup data([explainer if you’re unfamiliar with it ](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/)  From the first approach [when Russ hasn’t played this year, the team grabbed 48.79 rebounds per 100](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy/nba?0Exactly1DidNotPlayInGame=201566&amp;TeamId=1610612764&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Type=Team), [and when he has played, they’ve grabbed 47.31](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy/nba?0Exactly1PlayedInGame=201566&amp;TeamId=1610612764&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Type=Team). That’s not what you’d expect from a great rebounder. Again though, that’s only with a sample size of 7 games(I would try to get the same numbers from OKC and HOU but the query is so large pbp just fails to get results), so I’m guessing you don’t find it especially persuasive.   The better approach is to just use the ridge regressed rate, it combines all the plus minus numbers from the last 5 years and adjusts for contextual lineup data to get an estimate of his actual rebounding ability, without all the variance of on/off data. By this measure, he ranks [310th in the league](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=1417219936), a very slight positive(and I’ll admit, above replacement level). Amusingly, Steven Adams ranks #1. Crazy how that works.   I will cede though, using a single year of raw team on/off data as a knock against Russ was unfair of me. From [2011-2016](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=989835881), he was the 13th best offensive rebounder in the league(for a guard!), so I’m not trying to say he’s never been great. I do think though, that at this present moment, his stats are inflated quite a bit and he’s no longer the transcendent rebounder that many claim he is."
Westbrook continues to steal rebounds from Steven Adams
"I’m 6’4” and he walked by me in a Hotel in Utah. He’s definitely the height he’s listed at. Carmelo was with him at the time too, made me feel short. Then walked by Steven Adams in the lobby and felt like a dwarf"
He gets 1.9 contested rebounds a game.   Steven Adams for example gets 4.2 contested rebounds a game and he barely averages more total rebounds than Luka. It is why guard rebounding is really not valuable as it is usually inflated.
Sorry none of that counts though because Steven Adams lets him get 2 uncontested rebounds a game so he will unfortunately have an asterisk by his name
"When you used to watch this guy fight steven adams for rebounds, you really dont care anymore"
Could certainly achieve it. Depends on how the pels surround him. Steven adams earning 17.5 mil till 2023 certainly doesnt help tho.  But I can see him putting up something like 30/8 and 5 in like ridiculous efficiency in a few years.
Steven Adams made him rebound that
They rank bottom 5-6 in the league in Def rating. Not like Steven Adams is an elite defensive player anyways.
The craziest part about this is he somehow managed to sneak Steven Adams onto all his post-Thunder teams to box out for all his rebounds.
"This is true, but he brings energy even for the other team.  Sometimes he's just too much for me though.  Like calling out Steven Adams to put a jersey on the other night, like dudes hurt ya clown and who cares anyway."
[Steven Adams let him get this rebound](https://streamable.com/nt16kg)
He plays with Steven Adams only Steven Adams should ever rebound why do you want the ball in the point guard's hands even
Steven Adams let him get that block

He only got that because Steven adams let him
"It doesn’t help that his team doesn’t have great shooters out there. Steven adams clogs up the paint and Bledsoe acts like he doesn’t want to be there. Give a team of solid shooters and point zion becomes even more lethal. I’ve seen too many games of Zion passing to wide open pelicans and they miss their easy looks. At 20 years and 1 year of playing experience under his belt, he’s way ahead of schedule."
"Huh? I didn't make any excuses, I'm not even the original commenter moron, I'm just responding to your comment about ""\[taking\] a shot at the super young team"". They have no excuse for being sub 500 in any universe with 2 all stars, coach or not.  You're the one trying to make excuses, ""young"", ""worst coach"", BI has been in the league for 5 years, Lonzo 4, Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, etc. You just sound like a sad, cynical bitch trying to take what little satisfaction you can in the Lakers failure, when the Pelicans have been failing for the past 20 years LOL  Guess you gotta enjoy it whenever you can"
"Huuuuuge props to Steven Adams for the last game we played, one of Joel's worst games of the season because they had Hayes and Adams out there, and Adams is definitely one of the better Embiid stoppers in the league"
KAT is in no way acting like a normal dude. Watch some Looney or Steven Adams or Ayton to see what normal means. You never see these guys act like manbabies.
steven adams breaking plumlee's fall comes to mind

"Yeah like... maybe don't extend Steven Adams, who clogs up the lane, for another two years?"
"Maybe if he traded for players who could hit jump shots, zion could go to work down there? Instead, this moron traded for Steven Adams ($29 m, and a $19 m extension coming, signed off again by this same moron), Eric Bledsoe ($16 m), and James Johnson ($16 m).   This guy also drafted a lane clogging center in Jaxson Hayes at 8 over Tyler Herro.   Whose idea of a lineup combinations of the following is a good idea:  Zion.  Adams.   Ingram  .       .   Hayes.    Johnson . Bledsoe.   Ball Lewis.   .   Hart?  What possible lineup is going to give proper spacing?   They could have gotten into the Turner for Hayward SnT and send picks to Boston, or they could have just sent #4 for him to Indy after the AD trade. But, this idiot thinks he has the magic touch with drafting.   Yes, zion is getting hacked. But it's partially your fault because of incompetence. Maybe he'll stfu and hire someone who doesn't eat glue and then let that person make personnel decisions for him."
Also no Steven Adams tonight. And Embiid is a gametime decision.
All you need to be is a 57.4% FT shooter to equal the 1.148 points per possession that the Clippers had this season to lead the league. You need to be just a 54.4% FT shooter to match the 15th best (average) points per possession this season  The qualifying player with the lowest FT percentage this year was Clint Capela at…. 57.3%. The player with at least 100 attempts with the lowest FT percentage this year was Steven Adams at 44.4% and there were exactly 4 other players who fit this category and had a lower FT% than Capela  There is very little being asked of Ben Simmons and he is not coming close to meeting it  And it’s clear this will never become a mainstream activity that you see in every game because so few players are actually bad enough at shooting FT to be worth hacking every time. And the ones that are don’t even play enough to be unbenchable
My fav stan related moment is when Steven Adams was doing an impression of him or talking about someone else's impression of Stan and said it wasn't good enough cuz his breath didn't stink.  And that's when I knew this would not work out.
"The skyhook in particular is a highly technical, unorthodox shot though.  There’s still quite a few bigs/forwards who use jumphooks and running hooks (Steven Adams and Ben Simmons come to mind), but the actual skyhook is very hard to pull off. It was more of a one-handed jumpshot than a traditional hook really."
What in the hell was the Steven Adams signing?
Zion doesn’t have any limitations. He’s doing fine.  Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams hurt Ingram more than anyone.
"SVG had to be a big part of the Steven Adams trade, having a big space eater in the middle is a big part of his defensive philosophy"
And I didn’t say they would. Turner had a career worst season from 3 last year and is still a career 35% from 3. A defender will at least be somewhere near him if he stands at the arc. My original point was about the decision behind trading for Steven Adams who spends his entire time on offense in the exact space Zion needs to operate effectively
That extension was looking bad from the get go. The only people that thought adding Steven Adams was a good move were Pelicans fans and OKC fans overvaluing their former player.
You mean you didn't think Steven Adams was the ideal stretch 5 next to Zion?
"True, but that could have addressed by coaching doing a couple of things. Such as, moving Bledsoe into a bench role &amp; limit the minutes played together with Lonzo. Also, giving Steven Adams the extension he got is looking pretty bad right about now. Dude is seriously a talented center, but not when your main offensive option involves the one of the best paint drivers in the league"
"The Steven Adams decision was pretty baffling. Giving up assets and then paying him that much when he’s no longer the player he once was, and that player messes up Zion and Ingrams spacing anyway"
Ehhh he definitely needs to be better defensively.     It’s just hard to set plays and not turn the ball over when you’re sharing the floor with literally zero shooters. How tf is he supposed to maneuver in space when he’s playing with Bledsoe Zion and Steven Adams.      David Griffin is a friend of the media so he gets little attention today. But SVG got fired cause Griffin put together a dumpster fire of a team. He had no chance with that sort of spacing. What was Stan supposed to do differently?
Or maybe he's just trying to find a fall guy for his trash roster construction. WTF was SVG gonna do with Zion and the amazing spacing of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
He got my man Steven Adams another bag. I love it.
"I thought he was solid in Cleveland when you account for the crazy degree-of-difficulty he was working under: he didn't have the freedom to think about anything but the next season.  In retrospect the Wiggins-for-Love trade wasn't great, either, although it's possible he didn't have much of a choice.   The Jrue trade, the Steven Adams trade/extension ... I don't know. The SVG hire. I don't know. I'm just having a hard time seeing the smart overall plan, here.   (It's possible that Jrue wanted out and DG did right by him, which is okay. But why Adams?)"
"Yeah the two egregiously bad decisions he's made so far are  1. Taking back Eric Bledsoe instead of George Hill in the Jrue Holiday trade. Zion plays almost the same style of ball that Giannis does, but Griffin didn't get the message that the Bucks were literally trying to dump Bledsoe because of how egregiously bad he was in the playoffs. I'm pretty convinced that they could've easily had HILL considering he was just redirected to OKC anyways. Hill's contract was much more manageable and he was a much better fit alongside Pelicans' core (spacing + decent defense) 2. Bringing in Steven Adams instead of Myles Turner. Myles Turner, while he is not as good at rebounding/boxing out, is a better rim protector and can actually space the floor on offense for Zion. One of the reasons the Bucks exploded was because they brought in Brook Lopez to clear out the floor for Giannis. Myles Turner was VERY AVAILABLE. The Celtics were exploring a market to redirect him and found that few teams valued him. The Pelicans coulda had him last offseason for super cheap  The team David Griffin is building around Zion, in spite of the fact that they have a shit ton of assets, is so bad that I'd be worried that Zion would take the qualifying offer just to gtfo  Pelicans need to fire him if they don't want Lebron 2.0 on their hands"
"he tried to thread the needle of ""compete while developing"" and has failed. Steven Adams and Bledsoe have been horrific. Keeping George Hill would have been amazing for them to help their lack of spacing. Acquiring Al Horford would have been such a natural fit with Zion on both ends."
I think this was inevitable given the lack of potent identity from the Pelicans this year.  It's time to build that squad around point Zion in my opinion &amp; I like Steven Adams but he doesn't fit in NOLA in my opinion.
"Gosh, it would be terrible if someone's opinions were ""extremely heavily influenced by reputation"". Someone like that would probably make claims that weren't backed up by reality - definitely want to avoid being one of those people.  In totally unrelated news, here's what advanced stats say about Lebron's defense this year  * 18th in [DEPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), between Marc Gasol and Rudy Gay * 26th in [DRAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm?id=-2146555570), between Duncan Robinson and Brad Wanamaker * 40th in [Real Plus-Minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM), between Steven Adams and Jae Crowder * 92nd in [RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/), with the same rating as Jokic and John Collins * DWS tied for the lowest of his career * DBPM below 2.0 for the fifth season in a row  Interesting.  &gt;awards that are extremely heavily influenced by reputation  Wait...you you actually think that *Lebron James* hasn't been named to an All-Defensive team since 2014 because of a lack of reputation? That's delusional. His reputation (well-earned because of those late Cavs/early Heat years, when he was one of the best defensive players in the league) is basically the entire reason why stans keep insisting he belongs in these conversations despite the fact that he hasn't actually been an All-Defensive level player in years.  &gt;I recommend actually watching the games  [**The people who vote on NBA awards**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/htmlview) **are literally employed to watch the games**, and not just the ones involving the player they stan. Basketball is their career. They haven't put Lebron on an All-Defensive team since 2014 because he has not been one of the best defensive players in the league since 2014. Other than that, great comment."
"Hasn’t been good. Didn’t build a competitive roster around Zion, botched the Steven adams signing, and missed on the coaching hire. Also burned bridges with JJ Redick and his massive platform"
"David Griffin needs to go ASAP. This guy has no direction. I don’t think SVG was the goat or anything but how are you going to fire a brand new coach after you create the roster the Pelicans had? Who could’ve realistically done a better job when your starting 2 guard is Eric “I don’t want to be here” Bledsoe, a grossly overpaid Steven Adams and some of the worst shooters in the league. Can Zion get some continuity with a coach?? Griffin needs to take responsibility"
Pelicans are just not good enough. Steven Adams sucks and nobody in that team can play defense.
"Bud is a decent coach.he sucks in the playoffs but he also has rarely had the best team in the playoffs IMO.  And like I said yeah he'll get fired but to me putting all the blame on him or Bledsoe is like if we said Westbrook failures were all on Brooks/Donovan and Steven Adams : yes its part of it, but you expect better for an MVP level player.  Like okay he is empowered too much and the whole point Giannis stuff is bad.   But on the other end nobody is forcing him to take early clock jumpers randomly even when he is cold, its not Bud fault that he cant make free throws anymore either or that his defensive strenght are a bit neutralize because he has to guard shooters in the playoffs."
The last thing the Pelicans need is another Steven Adams with an inflated ego
we need Jaylen Brown and Anthony Edwards and Steven Adams or something.
That was a Steven Adams type of screen lol
"Steven Adams, did not know much about him early in his career. He was greeting kids as they got on the bus for a charity event and the looks he got from some of the kids as he said hello were great."
"Steven Adams is a unit but he's also nice, chill Kiwi man.  Joker is from Eastern Europe."
"Crowder is all bark no bite, Steven Adams is highly tolerable.. it doesn’t say much"
"Shades of 2016 Steven Adams, mate"
That's like the one time I've ever seen Crowder back down. Dude got in Steven Adams' face ffs
Steven Adams wins a melee.
"It exists because of reggies toxic attitude before and after being traded. Nobody on the Thunder gave a fuck about him. He was the one constantly bringing it up  Steven Adams, KD, Russ, etc. All shit on this dude when asked about him."
"See this is such a weird angle. Russ at that point in their careers would win more games than Reggie for them, so naturally like Stevens own quote says he would rather have Russ since it’s implied they would win more with him. Obviously Steven Adams cares more about winning than Reggie starting so he backs that side. Reggie was averaging 20/8 starting and wanted to continue his role, which is not outlandish like your saying , so he requested a trade and got one where he could be a starter.  Not sure what’s complicated about that."
"nah reggie was very toxic about it. [steven adams wrote about it](https://247sports.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/Article/Steven-Adams-blasts-Reggie-Jackson-in-new-book-120411022/), everybody on the team was fed up with jackson's bullshit"
"You put it better than I did. There are big contracts that you have to overpay for because you don't just have 2nd team all nba or productive rookies fall out of the sky everyday so you have to give contracts out like Steven Adams or De'Aaron fox or Kristaps because circumstances require you find the best of the bad option, but most mid level players are not on cost effective contracts and the best most teams can do outside the draft or overpaying is rehab a risky/injury-laden career, hope that an inefficient volume scorer can learn defense, or find someone that bursts out of the advanced metrics models and pray they are scalable. These are all 1/10 chances though so it's easier to just give Kemba $30 million and hope for a 6th seed"
"I don’t think our position is really that bad anymore. Monte &gt; Vlade means we don’t have to have anxiety going into draft night and Fox is a legit star that nobody watches. I’ve said it before, this team has holes but they’re easy to fill and we could be in the playoff hunt next season.  Holmes is likely gone. Some team is going to pay him big money to start and then realize that he’s too small and his defense is not very good. We get dominated by opposing bigs every night. My dream scenario is trading Buddy for Steven Adams.   I think Marvin is unfortunately gone. He’s really not bad. He’s not Luka or Trae, but I definitely think he’s going to average 20/12 next year on whichever team decides to take a leap of faith.  Barnes is such a solid vet and great dude  Buddy needs to be traded. Target someone on a bad contract and see if they’ll make the swap (Kemba, KP)  Hali is the goat."
"What point does it prove? lol  I have no idea why people STILL harp on preseason expectations when talking about that OKC team (which were partly made because a lot of people that CP3 was washed).   SGA, Schroeder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lou Dort these are NBA starters, and they all played a lot of games.  Not to mention, OKC was a couple of the most brain dead plays you’ll ever see on an NBA court from PJ and Gordon from being swept.  CP3 was great that year, acting like he took a bunch of scrubs from the YMCA to within a quarter of a championship is going overboard."
"Your first statement doesn't even make sense at all. Are you saying the Suns shouldn't have looked to improve the team? Obviously CP3 makes them better and the assets they gave away weren't all that great.   No one is denying CP3's impact but he's not CLEARLY the Suns best player. Devin Booker took down the number one defense in the league when Chris Paul was playing on one arm and averaging just 9 points per game. He's averaging 27/6/5 on 62% TS in the playoffs so far.  OKC got rid of Gallo, Schroder, and Steven Adams. SGA also missed majority of the season. Of course, the Thunder got a lot worse. Not sure why you're making it seems like Chris was the only piece missing from that team."
"Last offseason NOP S&amp;T'd Kenrich Williams, Zylan Cheatham, and Josh Gray in the Steven Adams OKC trade."
"They easily could have taken George Hill and Al Horford instead of Bledsoe and Adams upon getting their transaction with OKC. 2 great vets who would have helped a young team with even better fit around Zion, Ingram and Zo.  But I guess Griff and SVG loved the idea of pairing Zion and Steven Adams bc they extended Adams right as they got him 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ fucking bozos"
Nah I doubt it but Zion averaging 27 on 62% shooting with Steven Adams as his center is insane
"The issue with Steven Adams isn't his offensive fit with Zion, it's that Adams Is hella overrated as a defender. The pels need to find a defensive anchor"
"Getting bledsoe was the price of selling Jrue for way more than he was worth.  Steven Adams being extended though, that's inexplicable"
"They have Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe making like 45m dollars combined, I'm gonna say they're fucking up"
Ayton's screens are like a damn brick wall. Almost as good as those old school Steven Adams screens where he would murder people.
"Anyone that takes the under on 100k is an idiot.  You have any idea on how many professional fighters, boxers, soldiers, etc.... that are in the entire world?  I'd argue there are easily 5-10 million+ people in this world that could kill Steven Adams in hand-to-hand combat.   Adams is an NBA player; he has little to no training in how to hit, how to get hit, how to endure and dig deep in a fight, how to gauge distance, how to defend, and in general any of the fighting techniques that one needs to fight in a real fight.  All he's got is size and toughness, which will get him some edge. But if the fight goes to the ground against an experienced grappler, wrestler or juijitsu fighter ...... he's gonna choked out or arm broken. And if the fight goes on long, he's going to get gassed and get smacked by an experienced boxer.  If you want to see how an NBA athlete performs in a boxing ring, check out Nate Robinson vs Jake Paul; dude got embarrassed by a youtuber."
"You know Dame could call for a pick by the guy Jokic is defending 30ft from the basket and Denver would have to switch early.  Harden, Steph, and Dame call for it as they cross half court a bunch of times per game.  That’s why we sometimes see a wing picking up a PF, or even a C picking up a 4 at mid court when they know a high PnR is coming.  Also, there’s only a handful of 5’s in the League that can run a PnR consistently out on the perimeter.  Teams have adjusted now as to not leave Steven Adams out on an island 28ft from the basket trying to guard Steph.  Bigs have to be able to defend the PnR nowadays and that’s a big reason there’s hardly any traditional 5’s now."
"I think alot of this comes down to Lakers fans perception of the roster and their guys(overrating them) vs the reality. And Im using Lakers fans as a rough proxy for the national consensus because I think there is alot of overlap between the two. Lakers homers are just a considerably more rabid version of it.  But the general idea is alot of people the extent to which they pay attention to that team beyond Zion is just to see how those Lakers young guys are doing. A number of them their vested interest being about those guys with little interest in the Pels team overall. The Lonzo thing I dont remember the last time you had something like this where a hyped young players own current teams fans are lower on than the general consensus.   People just blame the limitations of those guys on the ""system"", situation, SVG and Steven Adams.   So it's why so many of these convos really just trace back to people entering them from the starting point of ""Lakers young core cant be the issue"" and analysis tacitly focusing more on what's ""best for the lakers young guys"" over the Pels team itself. That's how you get the cognitive dissonance people have of saying ""the core sucks"" but ""individually they are good its stupid not to pay to keep the Lakers guys"". Same reason why they all talk about ""needing spacing"", because their focus is on what's good for those individual guys stats more than the overall team's performance."
Say that to Steven Adams
"I'm with Dray on ball kicking, but not with Zaza on destroying ankles. Zaza v. Kawhi was gross - you don't try to injure a player like that. That can destroy a career and cost a person who has worked his ass off millions and a whole lot of pain. Asshole move, even if you're just a clunky giant oaf and didn't mean it.  But Dray kicking Steven Adams in the balls multiple times in one series was comedy gold and only made the game more fun. That's not a career destroying injury. Dude had nuts big and hard as coconuts, he could take it."
steven adams for sure
Ricky Rubio or Steven Adams
"Dwight had an offense run through him. Ayton already has a better offensive game than Rudy and does SO MUCH MORE than just layups and dunks. Capela shoots from 3-10 feet and at least attempts mid range shots. Bam shoots mid range and threes.   Congrats, Rudy is better at dunks and layups than Steven Adams and washed up Deandre Jordan. Is that really what you’re proud of?  Also calling Ayton a post up center shows how little you actually know"
"but why can't you can be a fan of a player over the team?  why can't someone be a james harden fan because they like the way he plays, and support OKC when he's drafted, and houston when he's traded, and brooklyn when he's traded again?  i've followed OKC and NOP for a few years because i'm a kiwi and steven adams was on those teams. am i a bandwagoner for caring about his career?"
"People who aren’t from America telling Americans to stop being pussies seems to be the new norm….wish we would take their advice.  Steven adams laughed at all the Americans complaining about the bubbles, saying we are staying in 5 star hotels….this ain’t Syria.   Rich Americans are just soft these days"
Steven Adams does a good job against him
The Raptors. Players Al Horford or Steven Adams
"Zion, BI, NAW, Jaxson, Kira, Naji, Steven Adams or Didi depending on how we view Steven Adams"
Draymond is the only C who has successfully forced Steven Adams' nuts to retreat into his body
Had to lock up Steven Adams for 17.5 mill a year before he played a game in a Pels uni after his 27.5 mill this year. Such a steal /s
"It used to be Gasol on Embiid, but Marc's aged a ton and is washed at this point. So probably Al Horford or Steven Adams"
"The only guys left who give Embiid trouble are the super strong ones like Steven Adams. If you're strong enough to stand up to his power moves it somewhat limits the options he has. He'll still get some because he's doing crazy shit like baseline fadeaways and whatnot but it's at least a speed bump for him.  Capela doesn't have the strength or size to deal with him. Maybe younger Jo would have struggled but not anymore, he's fully online now."
Seeing him fix that this year has been amazing and I think people still don’t realize how good his finishing was even with the month he was missing everything coming back from covid.  Restricted area numbers (percent and total attempts):  Tatum: 68.1 on 326 Zack Lavine: 65.5 on 388 Simmons: 65.7 on 364 Ja: 60.4 on 364 Kyrie: 60.4 on 255 Embiid: 68.9 on 238 Steven Adams: 67.7 on 220 Harden: 63.2 on 212 Trae: 56 on 207 Ingram: 66.1 on 201
Steven Adams would like a word

"Could you like, I don't know, kidnap Ayton or something?  I knew he was going to give Jokic problems.  He's so bloody strong.  He's one of only a few guys in the league that Jokic can't use his weight/strength/timing/footwork to bully.  I've seen Jokic back down Steven Adams.  He just bounces off Ayton.  Jokic NEEDS to get his midrange going."
You could probably find like 30 clips of LeBron not getting back on defense after a no call. That's quite literally quitting on your team. Only difference is Rondo quit on offense. The Klay thing is just trash talk. If you're really trying to sit there and tell me LeBron has never trash talked in his career then there's really nothing I can tell you lol. Look up LeBron kicking Andre Iguodala in the nuts. Literally the exact same thing Draymond did to Steven Adams.
"Rebounds and assists only have value when some circumstances met.  For rebounds, you have to measure contested ones because the uncontested rebounds you get don't produce any additional value to the team. The matter is how much you can add to your team rebounding. Boxing out, positioning, team defence are more important attributes for rebounds than rebounding itself.   For assist, a team like Portland and Harden Rockets constantly produced league low assists yet remained one of the best offensive teams (like top 5) in the NBA for years. The problem with assist contribution is that it has to be a shot creation out of nowhere to have an additional value, that way you are increasing the basket probability.  Because handoffs are assists too but can be done by literally any 15 player on the roster (Steven Adams had a triple double that way). Which means some hockey assists actually have more value than some of the counting assists.  And you don't even really need that much assist to have a great running offense. So about only half of rebounds and assists are actually valuable to the team and thus scoring.   League best offenses this year are Bucks and Nets produces around 6 assists per 20 FGA. Portland has around 5 assist per 20 FGA and in the top 5 offense convo.  Take Steph for example. Steph is averaging less assists than fuck ton of guys but he is easily better than almost all of them offensively. Take Lillard and Kyrie for example. All 3 guys have eerily similar counting stats but Steph easily is the better offensive player.    That's why 27/7/7 is much more valuable than 15/11/11 (assuming defense and TS are the same). Because actual value is easily more in the prior."
"The Suns would be a title favourite. In this hypothetical, the Suns use their resources to get a center instead of CP3. No Ayton slander but center, in general, is the easiest position to fill in NBA. Clint Capela was gettable. Myles Turner. Ibaka. Steven Adams. Derrick Favours. Christian Wood. Valanciunas.  Even lower-tier centers like Mason Plumlee would probably be fine on this team, and use those resources to get another wing or playmaker.  I think you can find someone that does 50-75% of what Ayton does fairly easily for his role on this team.  I think you have to look at it from the perspective that they used resources on CP3 because the team needed a lead ballhandler and more permitter scoring and playmaking. Luka is still on his rookie deal so those resources can be used in a lot of different places.  And, of course, there is the obvious. Luka is a significantly better player than Ayton. Anyone who says Ayton is really overthinking it. Luka is on his way to his second first All-NBA team. If I had to bet right now. I would take the under on Ayton ever making a first All-NBA team. That doesn't mean he's bad, but barring a big jump he is significantly below AD, Jokic, Embiid and Gobert in the second tier with Capela and Bam."
"I’m so glad people are actually noticing this about the Thunder teams now. I always see how people say we were so talented those years but to me those teams overperformed. For one Scott Brooks is terrible. The lineups he had were trash. Roberson is a great defender but pairing him in the backcourt with Westbrook will never fucking work. Westbrook needs shooting around him. Not Steven Adams and Andre Roberson. Worst of all we had no offensive system, literally just played hero ball with KD and Russ. We relied purely on the talent of those two every year. It was legitimately insane to me that we were up on the 73-9 Warriors 3-1. I always believed that what we were doing for years would never get us a ring. We were relying on Andre Roberson and Dion Waiters to space the floor out at the wing. Like to me those years just proves to me how fucking good KD and Russ are. And especially KD."
Steven Adams
"I wish the Mavs could get Steven Adams. I think Adams would be a great fit for the Mavs, much better rebounder especially on the offensive boards."
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
"It's because of only taking the highest percentage shots in the game while being assisted, thats why DeAndre is also a top 5 offensive rating ever and has a big modern bias because of the efficency and spacing we have today. That's why you have someone like Steven Adams or Valančiūnas in the top 20.  Offensive and defensive ratings are shit, unless you want to tell me Shawn Kemp was a better defender than Gobert.  I agree thay Gobert is underrated in general in offense, but this the other extreme."
"steven adams for kristaps porzingis makes a lot of sense to me, throw some filler guys and maybe picks in there too"
I think rebounding just hasn’t come as naturally as we all probably assumed with him and as you’d think with his size and athletic ability. Feel like rebounding is also a lot more than size and athletic ability but also positioning/grit/effort.  That being said too I’m pretty sure the Pelicans as a team are also a pretty good rebounding squad and have a lot of dudes that rack up rebounds. They’ve got Steven Adams obviously but also Hart himself averaged like 8 rebounds per game this year and Lonzo/Ingram each had like 5 a game. Rebounding can be a individual attribute but can also be addressed with overall team emphasis and other tall dudes.   I’d be more concerned about it if the Pelicans were a terrible rebounding team or if there weren’t other surprising things about Zion’s game that are actually good (like his passing ability).
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
"&gt;But players like Steven Adams don't get rebounds   he in fact has always gotten rebounds, and was regularly around the average for 7fters even when he played next to Westbrook.  This was always just some silly 'anti-Westbrook' narrative that he (or others) were helping pad his stats.  Did he box out?  Yes. Does that help others?  Yes.  Did he do that to 'let Westbrook get rebounds'? No.  He did it because that's good fundamental basketball that helps a team.  Westbrook is just a super athletic, strong and particularly aggressive rebounder for a PG."
This doesn't apply to Zingis. But players like Steven Adams don't get rebounds they box out hard and let Westbrook get it. Lot of teams play like this.
"Kevin Martin and the picks that became Jeremy Lamb and Steven Adams.   What has gotten lost to history is that Harden had to be traded because the owners were cheap. They could have been able to afford Harden had they not traded Jeff Green for Kendrick Perkins, who was given a very fat contract extension to be basically unplayable. That trade was the beginning of the end for OKC.   In an alternate universe they don't make that trade, they extend Harden and win a couple of titles."
"You mean how he kept his job, Steven adams and Jeremy lamb ?"
Trade Porzingis for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. Then sign DeRozan after signing THJ to a team-friendly deal.
The only answer is Steven Adams
"The classic Steven Adams foul. Bigger and stronger than everyone else contesting him for the rebound, so they hooks his arms, but somehow he's the one called for the foul.  Traditional big men are already being phased out of the league, so when the refs make it even harder for them to be on the floor fucking sucks."
The Inverse Steven Adams
"Who's beating the All-Cancer team.  PG: Dame Lillard SG: Brad Beal SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Zion Williamson C: Rudy Gobert   With a bench of: Ben Simmons, SGA, Tobias Harris, MPJ, Steven Adams, Bam Adebayo"
Steven Adams exists
the Blazers aren't trading Dame until he asks to leave.  What if instead of Bledsoe's awful contract it was Steven Adams?
Steven Adams
"I think they do    Sign and trade Kawhi, trade PG, bring in bad contracts like CJ Mccollum/Steven Adams in exchange for picks or young players. You can rebuild pretty fast and have a playoff team in time to open the new stadium."
I still remember seeing one dude claiming he would be the “3rd star” on the Lakers and people were only hating on him because he wasn’t a “flashy” scorer. Also the people hating don’t like/care about EFFICIENT scoring lmfaooo. I also remember how many Lakers fans thought picking Steven Adams over Andre Drummond was gonna age badly
Zion  Not only is he averaging 27 on 62% FG shooting but he’s doing this with Steven Adams as his starting center
"Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, Kira Lewis, Naji Marshall, and some picks for Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic?  Pelicans Starting 5: Dame, NAW, BI, Zion, Nurk  Blazers Starting 5: Lonzo, CJ, Cov, Naji, Aquaman"
"Hi, Portland. What if we throw in Kira, NAW and Steven Adams and all 7 1sts and 9 2nds we have and you toss in Dame too?"
"If you say “let’s deport Steven Adams” if he plays bad it’s fine, but you can’t say that about Dennis? Just because someone is black doesn’t mean it’s racist."
It also had a lot to do with Steven Adams who could set the hardest screens in the NBA to give a 3 guard lineup free shots
"You've literally got Steven Adams' flair, and you still cant spell his name right lmao"
Imo Pelicans should see if they can finesse a couple picks out of the Mavs to take on Porzingis. Something like Steven Adams and filler for Porzingis and two 1st round picks.
&gt; Not Steven Adams clogging the paint for Zion.  That's Frank Kaminsky music
"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.   There was just a level of [delusion back then](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat) with these Harden trade ideas that even for homer fans standards was absurd.   &gt;Framework of the deal: Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker + 3-4 first round picks to Houston for Harden.  And the Pelicans writer said no in response to this offer!   Heres another one   &gt;Framework of the deal: C.J. McCollum and Zach Collins + a couple first round picks to Houston for Harden.  &gt;""Giving up CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, and picks is a big ask from Portland’s perspective. As things stand, I wouldn’t give up a single player from the roster in exchange for Harden, let alone two key players and two first round picks""  Do people even hear themselves when they talk, this was an actual sentence someone said like 6 months ago."
Kevin Martin and Steven Adams is not “a pack of gum”. Is it one of the worst trades in nba history? Sure. But Kmart was pretty fucking good for us
"For both trades, he was on the side that is selling short-term value for long-term assets.  \- If he didn't trade AD, then AD would've left the NOP dry. NBA awarded Zion for making LA-Lebron super team.  \- With or without Jrue, this year's NOP team would not be good enough. At least they got picks  The roster construction is more of his downfall. He did go for Steven Adams and then Bledsoe. Those two kills the spacing for a team playing with Zion. Not a good strategy at all."
"I’ve liked David Griffin but everyone knew immediately handing Steven Adams that big extension was dumb. Cmon, you need a floor stretching rim protecter at center next to Zion, a la Brook Lopez or Daniel theis.   Part of me wishes we got to see the AD-Zion combo"
"Highly unlikely but Id love to send them to Philly with the 9 this year and a future first for Simmons.  Otherwise I wouldn't mind Bagley to NO for Steven Adams and an asset, Buddy to the Lakers for Kuz and THT, and then try and grab Duncan Robinson, if money works out  PG:Fox/ Delon SG: Hali/Davis/THT SF: Robinson/Barnes/#9 this year PF: Barnes/Kuz/#9 C: Adams/Holmes or Vice Versa  I'd be happy as a clam"
"We already have a Steven Adams on half the salary. I'm all for taking on salary, but I'd rather not have someone taking Jakob's minutes"
Steven Adams signing is a dumb dumb move. They could have just signed Okafor or Nerlens Noel for the minimum and get the same production. I am sure there are other avenues to trade Jrue than taking Bledsoe on.
"&gt; He’s better than a free agent you can sign for the same price.  Steven Adams isn't worth $17 million per year--no old-school center without an outlier skill is--and OKC has no reason to sign aging free agents during this stage of the rebuild.   &gt; He has a positive value, no one is paying you to take a good player at a good price.  He's a mediocre player at a bad price, and he has negative value as an asset.   &gt; And you should be ashamed to wear that flair.  I earned my take via years of disappointment watching Adams fail to improve after receiving his contract extension in fall 2016."
"Maybe he should’ve just never signed Dinosaur Steven Adam’s to that contest in the first place? Love Adams the person by the way. Similar to Boban, he just belongs in the 90s/2000s."
Clippers should trade Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey to New Orleans for Steven Adams. Win-win trade.
"The owner is out there saying ""you must grab Steven Adams and max him before even playing a game""  Or ""Pay  mozgov 64 million""  Or "" Evan Turner is a perfect fit and obviously worth 70 million"""
"Griffin is a clown. Wtf is Steven Adams trade?? His fit with Zion is pathetic. Also, didnt trade lonzo whos gonna leave for basically nothing in free agency. Stan van gundy was a bad hire and got fired after 1 season."
"Your franchise is trash and you’re going to lose Zion just like you lost AD and Zion is going to win a championship as soon as he leaves the garbage Pelicans just like how AD and soon to be Jrue Holiday did before him. Lonzo Ball is gone next year and no one is going to take trash Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe off your books, enjoy being a fan of a trash franchise and stupid as hell you said 25% and then said “oh he improved to 36%” aka you don’t even watch the games of the team you support cause that’s the only reason you would be incorrect about how JJ Redick has been playing all year LMAO."
Griffin sucks. Extending Steven Adams’ before the season when he was making 27.5 mill already.. yeah sure let’s pay an outdated center 35 mill before he plays a single minute and we see the fit. Now they’re trying to move him lol
Steven Adams is white privilege in action. I got no other explanation.
Trade Adams to OKC into the Steven Adams trade exception
"Classic panic move, “we traded 5 guys and 2 picks for him plus Bledsoe, we better extend him without losing him for nothing”.  Admittedly Steven Adams is still good and 17 million a year is still moveable money. But instead of being stuck in this situation they could’ve just been happy with the free cap space"
And he too lost in the first round  Also that Thunder team had 4 guys nearly averaging 20 along with Steven Adams who was a pretty good center
Both Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams will have each earned over $160 million in career salary after their current contracts are over. Good lord.
Steven Adams  Also Christian Wood is so overrated on this sub
still awesome   2016/2017 russ  2013 40% 3 and D  thabo sefolosha  2019 paul george  2016 durant   2014 Ibaka   bench   2012 harden  2020 cp3  2021 shai   Steven Adams
"Yeah. Our FO had a trade in place to get that pick back from OKC if their guy (Steven Adams) wasn’t available at 12. Our intent was to select Giannis with that pick. Adams was available, OKC pulled out of the deal. And we were unable to trade up ahead of the Bucks."
The only thing I remember (as someone who watched 80+ percent of the games) was calling for the refs to give the t wolves a delay of game penalty for an untucked jersey (Jordan bell if my memory is correct). That gave us a free throw to cut it to one.  Kat hit his second free throw and then Steven Adams had the crazy pass to Dennis to send it to OT where we won
"Going to get a bit draft nerdy here but bear with me. I’ll always find it interesting how high certain teams were on Giannis DURING the draft process, (not in hindsight). Raptors were high enough on him that we were trying to draft him 12th If Steven Adams hadn’t fallen to that spot. Dallas too was quite high on him and would have taken Giannis at 13 if not for Cuban allegedly. It’s very much the product of a weak draft, where teams all had their guy and were willing to take that player wherever they could.   And it never panned out thus he fell to 15, Bucks draft him, and the rest is history."
Steven Adams?
"It's actually 2 picks and 2 swaps, I think. Which makes it all the more better.  I have a feeling we might have went for it if Kemba didn't have that regenerative knee surgery or something at the start of the season, and we might not even need to give Smart away.  A lineup of Smart-Holiday-Brown-Tatum-Williams III would have been a defensive nightmare for other teams.  Edit: [Source](https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee)"
"I consider the Pelicans my Western Conference team, and adore Zion. I really think I just have a type. Plus Steven Adams is extremely fun imo."
Still kinda low key  mad that OKC drafted Steven Adams when Giannis was still on the board.
"When a player hits free agency he makes his decision based on whether he thinks he can win going forward, not based on whether he's won in the past. So if the Pels have some success now but appear to be in decline due to Dame's advancing age, there's no guarantee Zion will see that and think he wants to stick around for it. The Pelicans need to take the next 2-3 seasons and build a team that looks ready to make some noise going forward. They should not be trying to build a 2023 championship team. That's what New Orleans did with AD, and instead all it did was saddle them with a bunch of unmovable contracts (like Omer Asik). They've already started down this path with that insane Steven Adams trade/extension. They need to be careful."
Steven Adams after that beautiful full court pass to Dennis Schroeder. That was my play of the year.
"Shoutout Steven Adams, he belongs on this list"
&gt;Lonzo has become Jason Kidd &gt; &gt;KAT wins an MVP &gt; &gt;Steven Adams is an all-star &gt; &gt;Wolves win a title   Lol

Lonzo ball  Bledsoe  Ingram  Zion  Steven adams
Steven Adams for a while
Steven Adams. Mate.  This sub had a side bar of Andrew Bynums hair for a minute.
"Here you go Zion we got you shroeder, bledsoe, Kuzma and Steven Adams"
"Every defensive metric certainly doesn’t say he’s below average. That’s just wrong.  He was in the 60th percentile of d-epm. Tatum was in 54th along with Middleton, below average would be like Lowry in the 46th percentile of Dame in the 33rd. Jaylen’s closer to Mikal Bridges, Steven Adams, and KD among others than he is to being below average.  He’s above average in d-raptor too for this past regular season. Some guys below him (below average with numbers in the negative) include KD,  RJ Barrett, Siakam, Middleton, Lowry, CP3, and Tatum. The difference between him and Tatum was more than the difference between him and Dejounte Murray, Lebron, Lonzo, Ayton and Adams as well as equal to the difference between him and Mikal Bridges and Jrue. He’s historically been above average in raptor too.  The stat he generally doesn’t look good in is regular season dbpm but even that doesn’t carry over to his postseason numbers. He also generally raises his game in the postseason. While playing less games than the Miami Heat players, he had the 4th highest total defensive win shares last postseason after Tatum, Lebron, and AD."
I think they’d need another semi-allstar caliber player on the wing. They probably also need a better 5 than Steven Adams
"Steven Adams is a better player than the team's current record, and Zion is there now. You assume Ingram goes as part of the trade."
Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams lmaoooooo  We could only trade with them if the blazers were gonna tank and valued picks and prospects over getting a star back.
"what is this roster???  C - Steven Adams  PF - Zion  SF - Free Agent Scrub #1 (37 year old Iguodala, Kelly ""3 point sniper"" Oubre, Will da Trill)  SG - Bledsoe (trash)  PG - Dame  Looks like more of a hot mess than Portland's roster last year"
Nobody thinks that.  If he was that he would be the best big in the world.  We just think he's average at shooting and pretty elite at rim protecting which is good enough in my books to make him more valuable than people here think.  Some people think Steven Adams is a better center.  That's how insane some Myles Turner hate get.
"Ehh... there are very very few people in the world that are as athletic as Giannis is at his height and even fewer who have the kind of hand eye coordination he does with his wingspan and height. Giannis does have skill of course, he has defensive IQ, can read plays, plus he passes decently. But what makes Giannis special is his sheer combination of size and athleticism. His brothers are also tall and athletic, but not quite as athletic, most aren’t as tall, and they don’t have the basketball IQ to be starter caliber in the NBA.   But comparing Giannis to other tall people doesnt really prove your point since even compared to other players that are 7’, Giannis is genetically gifted. General rule of thumb is that the taller you are (past a certain point), the less coordinated, slower, and most importantly more injury prone. The people that break that rule are super rare. Giannis is one of them, he’s actually faster due to his longer legs, he has excellent skeletal geometry that perfectly suits basketball, isn’t injury prone (comparatively for other players of his height and usage), very coordinated, can move his limbs with speed and dexterity, and he has a cardiovascular system that can support his size and go the mile. You don’t see Steven Adams move like Giannis does, because he straight up can’t even if he worked out at the gym 24/7. Shaq is another example of incredible athleticism at that height, they come once in a decade and it really is that rare."
Can you imagine the sheer force Russel Westbrook could dunk a ball if he was Jose Canseco levels of juiced? Running into a Steven Adams screen when the man is on that Barry Bonds healthy breakfast regiment?
He's not a tough guy. He cheap shotted Steven Adams in the back while on the Celtics and Steven turned and walked at him and Crowder looked like he was fighting every instinct to not immediately run away.  &amp;#x200B;  E: Crowder was on the Jazz
Same in New Zealander except it’s a Steven Adams Powerade commercial where he takes the ball coast to coast
"Tristan Thompson was a little over a year older than Holmes, coming off a 12 and 10 season but only got 19m/2.   Plumlee was 3 years older than Holmes, coming off a 7/5/2 and got 25m/3.  Steven Adams was younger than Holmes is coming off a 11/9 season and got 35m/2.  I write this to say the market has no consistency and I have no idea how much Holmes will get. I feel like Christian Woods deal should be the high water mark for younger unproven bigs right now. If Holmes gets Steven Adams money I'll think it's an overpay."
"Why don’t you ask Steven adams nuts how friendly the rivalry was, I’m sure they’d disagree"
"I didn’t trade for anything, so you can stop typing in a voice as if I have anything to do with the Pelicans’ decision making.  Eric Gordon *isnt* trash, our fanbase hates him because he literally skipped on rehab to get back at our organization for not letting him walk, costing himself more than anything else. He won 6th man of the year in Houston. He’s not an allstar, but he was a key player on a contender. He’s not trash, THATS YOU clearly trying to bullshit to paint me in a bad light.  I didn’t say Mirotic was great. But he’s a good role player. He’s better than Enes Kanter coming off the bench. He helped torch the Blazers when the Pels swept them.   Portland didn’t put LMA next to Dame. He was in Portland since 2006. Dame was drafted in 2012. And he left 2 years later. How many Allstars has Dame played with other than LMA? That would be 0.   Is CJ and Nurkic really a lot better than Holiday and Mirotic? Or Holiday and Cousins? Or Holiday and Randle?   I don’t hate AD or blame him for leaving, the team missed on signings all the time, and the ones they didn’t miss on got hurt. That’s why they literally fired every member of management from the AD era.  Also your Zion take is horrible. He’s 21. He’s played 85 games. “The Pels are wasting him.” Lmao he was so out of shape his first year he couldn’t even play. He was virtually a rookie this year. How the fuck do you waste a rookie? Steven Adams is a starting caliber center on a 2 year contract at 17mil. He’s going to be salary for trade filler."
"Trade BI and Steven Adams to the mavs for KP, Green and Richardson. Fuck it, blow it up already"
Eric Gordon is trash. Your fan base fucking hates him for a reason but you are clearly ignoring that to try and paint Ad in a worse light.   Mirotic is not great. He was a role player who was -30 for the bucks in his last playoff series in the nba.    You traded for half a season of cousins after wasting almost a decade of Ad. That’s a case of too little too late.  Why not list all the dumb shit free agents your team signed to “help AD”. Asik? Solomon hill? The list goes on with awful overpays for trash or mediocre players who handicapped your cap space     &gt;Portland is a consistent playoff team because of dame   Why not take a peek at who dame played with. CJ McCollum and LMA for example are better than 99% of the people AD had to share a court with.   The Pelicans front office was and still is trash. They’re already wasting zion as it is with dumb shit like extending Steven adams
Steven Adams doesn't care about NZ
Honestly he’d fit good on the Pelicans. He can space the floor and won’t clog up the paint like Steven adams.
"Firstly, you don't know me or anybody else on here. You don't think doctors, lawyers, firefighters log on to reddit to let off some steam? Or you just think that athletes by default work harder than everybody else?  Secondly, I'm not looking down on anybody, I'm just stating an opinion.  No doubt Steven Adams works incredibly hard. That has nothing to do with the discussion here. I'm not talking about hard work, I'm talking about assertiveness.  Be honest, do you really think that Steven Adams has achieved everything that he could've been in the NBA? You don't think that if he had've had a different approach to his role that he could've had a different career trajectory?  What about Ben Simmons then? Is he doing absolutely everything in his power to be the best version of himself that he can be? I sure don't think so, and apparently Doc Rivers, Joel Embiid, Danny Green and Daryl Morey agree with me.  But maybe those guys don't realise the amount of work it takes either, and we're all just being unfair to these guys and looking down on them."
First of all I’m sure they’d be happy to sign Lonzo for 18 mil a year. I don’t think he’ll be had for close to that. More like 4/100 rather than 4/72.  Also just because they signed Steven Adams for a foolish but fortunately short extension doesn’t mean they don’t give less of a shit about how they spend the rest of the cap. If anything it would make the FO more scrutinizing.  Anyway I’m still hoping they do a sign-and-trade if it gets to be too expensive.
"That's poverty franchise talk. Ball is still only 23 years old and is clearly developing and improving alongside Ingram and Zion where he is now a valuable asset that other team's are vying for.   This is a team that signed Steven Adams to a two year extension last offseason at $18M/yr. So now they can't re-sign Ball for a similar number (give or take a few million)?  Regardless, if they have budget constraints this is when you make secondary moves to fit someone like Lonzo Ball into your budget. You move Adams or Bledsoe to another team for cap space. Add in prospects or future firsts if you have to. If your eye is to a couple of years from now you don't need those guys anyway.  Unless they sign and trade Lonzo to the Sixers in a package for Ben Simmons or to another team for a different positive asset then the Pelicans are really doing their fans dirty."
"We don't know the reasons for that, I don't think that should be used as a knock against Simmons and I'm one of the biggest Simmons haters out there.  Steven Adams for example has never played for New Zealand, which pains me, but he has deep seeded personal issues with the people that run Basketball NZ for a multitude of reasons. And I don't hold it against him."
"I envisioned him more in the Steven Adams role, except with a jumpshot/3 threat. Could be devastating now that you can't drop during the PnR since Embiid CAN shoot."
"No, you just gave Steven Adams 17 million instead and traded for Eric Bledsoe who’s on a similar contract until 2023."
"See Steven Adams describing defending the Warriors as ""chasing round little monkeys """
"We're talking about *currently*, not a few years ago.  He doesn't even crack the top 10.  Most recent rankings:  1. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  5. Russell Westbrook, Washington Wizards  6. Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks  7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  8. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  9. Steven Adams, New Orleans Pelicans  10. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  He's behind *Jaylen fucking Brown*."
"I don't know. Wouldn't you consider guys like Nurkic or Myles Turner as middle class big men ? Aaron Gordon, Steven Adams, Capela, Al Horford ...  These all feel like middle class bigs."
"What's wild is that Cavs team could have had Giannis, Oladipo, Mccollum or Gobert.  Hell, even Nerlens, KCP, or Steven Adams would have been huge contributors compared to what they got that year for the #1 pick."
Steven Adams ——&gt; the great khali
"that's like saying an old ass MJ would still play like the goat if he suited up right now. stop it. that spurs team played basketball where everyone took their shots, but Kawhi was definitely phenomenal.  kevin Martin was only there for 1 season and you're shitting me if you think andre Roberson and Steven adams are good. that OKC team was nothing but durant and westbrook who dealt with injuries cause of pat bev  the houston team that took Durant to 7 games was underrated as hell. Eric gordon was balling out, cp3 was balling out, capela was great, and pj tucker kept hitting all his 3s."
"Steven Adams On How Athletes Are Worshipped In America:  ""**You kind of get detached from reality because a lot of a people will just, like, kiss your ass**. And you know, you’re the funny guy. They laugh at all your jokes. You become a lot more handsome. You know, this is what comes with the NBA logo. If you wear it, it’s quite amazing. But it’s just not reality though. You know what I mean? It is for your stint, I guess. But for whatever else it’s not. So that culture change is really crazy, especially in America too. The athletes here are held really high, and a lot of players should be, once they reach a certain level. But it kind of goes across everything. **Some people look at them for political guidance. Moral guidance. It’s just like, maybe just maybe just for the sport, look for this dude. But for some other things go to some of these other guys.**”"

"It doesnt matter, they are fucking Tim Duncan, Manu Ginboli and Tony Parker, players who have won multiplle chips together and the GOAT coach. You are full of shit. Kawhi was a role player.   Thats fine but he's also had better teams for his championship runs.   Kevin Martin, Andre Roberson, Steven Adams, and a top 10 player in Westbrook, more talent than Harden has had on his team except for 1 year where he took Durant to 7 games with a MUCH better team. Stop capping."
"Your opinion does not equal a consensus opinion, is Steven Adams the most popular player amongst MOST voters?"
"No, popularity has nothing to do with best. My favorite player is Steven Adams. Are you ignorant enough to think that I believe hes the best player?"
"Yeah I agree. Although the comment I was replying too did have a Bulls flair, and was making the argument that GSW was rigged to win the OKC series. Although I don't remember details of that series, I do remember Draymond doing some bitch shit throughout, though I remember the Steven Adams nutshots getting Ts and upgraded to flagrants after the game. Didn't OKC just lose because Russ missed shots and KD shot marginally worse those last 3 games?  I do think it was a modern day tragedy OKC didn't make the finals that year with how well they played up until that point. Beating the 67 or 69 win Spurs in the second round and then winning 3 games against the warriors was absolutely incredible. With that being said I do think the Cavs would have beat them that year had they made it, however KD possibly doesn't go to the Warriors 2 months later and the whole KD warriors dynasty doesn't happen."
"I hope you realize you are reinforcing my point.  He got away with **everything** he wanted against OKC because the league wanted GSW in the finals (greatest record narrative, biggest viewership team that year) and they were getting outplayed by OKC. He kicked Steven Adams in the nuts multiple times, and did all sorts of flagrant stuff that he didn't even get a T for. Many times he didn't even get a regular foul.  Then when CLE start feeling the heat and needed the series extended, the refs T up Dray up for getting teabagged, knowing full well what that T meant (missing a game)."
Steven Adams is the 1%
"Is he the fuck who calls Steven Adams ""Stevie""?"
One of the biggest What-Ifs in NBA history. What could have happened if he didn't spinkick Steven Adams in the nuts in 2015-2016? Would LeBron leave Cleveland again and do Decision 2 0? Would KD still remain in OKC?
These are NBA players bruh  Didn't you see that one vid where Steven Adams was raining 3s in an open gym? These guys are still insane enough to make the league
He's actually Steven Adams.
Close enough. She married Steven Adams.
Zion played with Steven adams and Eric Bledsoe
"Yeah athletic bigs tend to do pretty well with him. AD, Giannis, even Siakam if you could call him a big, Steven Adams worked him in 2016 back when he could still move really well."
They gotta throw in multiple firsts + Kira and Steven Adams for Myles Turner
"Call me crazy but I'm taking Zion over anyone before Anthony Davis on this list. He's an inside scorer on 29/8/4 per36, 65 TS% - if he's on a winning team we're not shutting up about him. Then you remember that he's doing that while the spacing around him is so busted it's like they built the team to challenge him. He scores at will in the paint while the two best shooters on his team are barely breaking league average from the arc, Eric Bledsoe is his point guard, and offensively Steven Adams can only do nothing or bring a big closer to the rim."
Harden to Houston for a bag of balls and Steven Adams
Steven Adams plays guitar -- I have no idea if he can play jazz guitar though.
Buddy Hield and #39 for #10 and Steven Adams?
"Somehow Steven Adams only has 10 pounds on Kevin Durant apparently haha.  I’ll look into it, thanks for sharing."
You think it’s a flex of accomplishment to elbow Steven Adams? Adams is a brick wall with lots of restraint and calmness.. it doesn’t mean you’re a tough guy if you accidentally hit Steven Adams in a midst of a kerfuffle
That's Jae Crowder for you. I witnessed this man once elbow Steven Adams in the head while he was in the process of arguing with two other players.
"The Harden OKC -&gt; HOU trade was a good trade for OKC. Harden would not have developed in OKC as he did in HOU. That trio simply was not sustainable long term.  During the 4 years after the trade OKC made the west finals twice and in the 2 other years Beverly injuring Westbrook ruined that run and their 2015 season was riddled with injuries. IMO, Heat win 2013 regardless. Spurs still win in 2014. 2015 OKC could have won it all if it wasn’t for injuries and 2016 they probably should have won. By 2015, there’s no way Harden would have still been cool with being a 6th man and I just don’t think the 3 of them could have made it work successfully.   Steven Adams was a great fit for that team. Mitch Mcgary, Jeremy Lamb and 1 season of Kmart were big misses, no doubt, but I’d argue Harden’s absence allowed all 3 of them to reach their full potential and I don’t think a player as good as Harden would have thrived as a 2nd/3rd option early in his career. Value wise, Harden for those players is insane but I think the trade worked out better than most give credit for, even if it just opened room for KD/Westbrook."
I mean. Look at those names you just typed. Doubtful it had much to do with Steven Adams.
He’s on the Pelicans?! To be honest I kind of forgot about Steven Adams…

Steven Adams
"Heh, optics vs. reality can be nemeses, but Steven Adams' optics are somehow surviving this dirt. He *is* well liked."
"What do Jordan Hamilton, Nick Young, Jae Crowder, Larry Sanders, Zach Randolph, Vince Carter, and Robin Lopez have in common? They’ve all been ejected for taking shots at Steven Adams.  I’m not saying he’s a bad person, but the dude starts shit."
I don’t know about that one. His style of play does not have a good reputation. https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/27/steven-adams-named-one-of-the-9-dirtiest-players-in-nba-by-complex/amp/
I feel like Steven Adams should be on there.
 &gt;you don't pay a rim running center that much money.  And then you say Steven Adams?
If you told me in early July that Steven Adams would be on the Grizzlies and not Mobley I would have called you crazy
"Gotta be honest, was very suprised at Steven Adams running curls and casually making 3s"
"Glanced through to make sure I wasn't repeating any names already mentioned;  Guys like Steven Adams could have entire highlight reels of them just setting screens. Same thing with Robin Lopez at his peak. I think Joakim Noah deserves a nod too for how hard he hustled on every play. That Bulls team had a few guys who deserve a mention actually, Luol Deng and Taj especially."
"Lebron, Draymond, Westbrook, Paul George, KD.   I also think people forgot there was not a time to long ago when Steven Adams entered the league and was classified as a dirty player. He used to get mauled by broadcasters during the game when he got subbed in."
Thought Steven Adams could be an all star after he played so well in the 2016 playoffs
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
"You're using cherrypicked stats of a loaded OKC team vs a severely outmatched SA squad.   KD played on a team where Dion Waiters, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter were outscoring Tim Duncan, Tony Parker &amp; Manu Ginobili.  Comprehend?  That's the reality.   TD+Manu were averaging 6ppg each in 20mpg, TP 10ppg, Waiters 8ppg, Adams 11ppg, Kanter 8.7ppg  2nd year players like Kyle Anderson in his 1st playoffs was tasked with guarding Durant.     The #1 reason OKC even won was because their role players outplayed San Antonio's, they KILLED the Spurs on the offensive boards, Adams-Kanter erased any bricks thrown up by Durant or WB.  That's the problem with not watching games &amp; taking them totally out of context.   Again this series went 6 games because Kawhi managed to slow down KD &amp; WB whilst being guarded by Roberson."

It was Roberson who shut Kawhi down who at the time was the best perimeter defender in the NBA. Not to mention Steven Adams was at his peak.
I don't know if the Grizzlies need him now that they have Steven Adams.
"Without relying on combinations of two all-time-greats;  * Ben Simmons + Chris Paul. This is mostly an excuse to get Chris Paul in a 6'11 body with good rebounding.  * Khris Middleton + Zion Williamson. Shoot from anywhere in defenders faces, Zion's touch at the rim - you'd have to bite on a pump fake, and before you land he's dunked it. Also get Zion with good defense and a bit more height.  * KAT + Steven Adams. There's better options, but it'd just change the rules for what either teams can do with picks; other team doing a pick and roll? Absolutely not. Your team runs a pick and pop? Easiest points you'll ever score."
Steven Adams: massive shoulder into face
Bill laimbeer is not as gos as Steven Adams is at setting physical screens
Steven Adams- HOF screens  Anthony Morrow - HOF shooting speed release
Steven Adams... HOF Screens that will make you cry to your mama. Plus his boxing out that let Russ get 10 plus rebounds a game
"Steven Adams - screen setting, offensive rebounding and falling on the floor"
"Thank you for that Enes Kanter recognition. I think someone made a really good post about Enes Kanter's rebounding skills complete with gifs about how he positions. Or maybe it was Steven Adams, but yeah maybe Steven Adams should be on the list too."

"Or just do the Steven Adams way, pretend that you don't speak English."
"That's cool that the Pels did right by Jrue, but if I'm a Pels fan I'm probably more concerned with whether they did right by the Pels. They have so little to show for the Jrue trade because much of it was squandered on the whole Steven Adams experiment, which was obvious to everyone that it was a huge mistake as soon as it was done."
Steven Adams setting up screens.  Kwame Brown defending the post.  Even Shaq couldnt back him down.  And he was way lighter than most centers at the time.
Steven Adams and Andrew Bogut - setting screens
Bill Laimbeer is a weird way to spell Steven Adams. Smh.
"Congrats you traded the 10th overall pick, a future first, Eric Bledsoe (who we turned into Culver and huancho), the 40th overall which we turned into a late first, and Steven Adams for the 17th pick, the 50th pick, and a chance to sign an MLE center that might propel you to the 10th seed. I am so envious"
"the current Memphis Grizzlies but I start at PG and have to play at least 30 minutes per game. (I am not very good at basketball). Steven Adams has to wear surgical gloves and 30 lb ankle weights on each ankle, and average 40 mpg. Kevin Garnett (present day) will start at PF as well, and average 35 mpg. Also everyone has to shoot free throws with their non-dominant hand.  I think this team would win 1 game."

"Memphis Grizzlies! Recently acquired Steven Adams, the most well-known (&amp; perhaps only) kiwi NBAer (who is easy to love), plus they’re loaded with young talent"
"You can’t just get role players to come for cheap to OKC.   We had to pay Serge and Steven Adams.   This isn’t LA bro. We can’t get Nunn, Monk, Ellington, Dwight, Melo for piss cheap deals."
"Neither KAT or Dlo played more than 50 games last season, and they had the 3rd worst defense in the league. Getting a DPOY runner up in Simmons will help them immensely. They'll be better than the Blazers and Grizz, unless Steven Adams really helps the Grizz and JJJ makes a big jump (hoping he does).  All they need is a few plus defenders and health. A year under Ant's belt will help as well."
"So ive been thinking about this thing where players are members of the justice league.  Giannis - Superman Steven Adams - Aquaman Cyborg - Lebron/Kawhi  Now with these in mind can anyone help me find a Flash,Wonder Woman from WNBA , Green Lantern and Batman? Also if you feel you have a better fit for the aforementioned heroes than mine tell me about that as well. Thanks."
"The outcome is going to be the same. The trade to get Steven Adams and then his extension gave me Omer Asik flashbacks. What is the best move the Pels have made since drafting Zion? They were run poorly under Dell Demps, they're now run poorly under David Griffin. We were getting reports Zion was unhappy and wanted out before his second season was over."
"&gt;Shooting; 3pt, mid range  He does these things at such a low volume, they barely matter.   &gt;Rebounding too.  You guys were already a top rebounding team.   &gt;staying healthy.  JV played 3 more games than Adams lol  &gt;Steven Adams was not an offensive threat at all. Now the opposing center will actually have to guard his man.  JV needs the ball in the paint to be a scoring threat. That both takes the ball out of Zion's hands and clogs the paint. It's not a good fit.   &gt;Also Steven Adams wasn’t good at defense last year. He was only good at defending post scoring centers, so there will be no downgrade there.  Going from bad to worse is still a downgrade"
"Shooting; 3pt, mid range, free throws. Rebounding too. Scoring in general, and staying healthy.  Steven Adams was not an offensive threat at all. Now the opposing center will actually have to guard his man. Also Steven Adams wasn’t good at defense last year. He was only good at defending post scoring centers, so there will be no downgrade there."
"Kevin Love, Steven Adams? Al Horford? John Wall?"
"Look at points in the paint as one example.   NO went from one of the worst teams in the league to about 10th last year.    You don't add a negative defender and then totally change the way you play defensively in a positive way, you have to acknowledge that he was at least forcing other teams to alter their playstyle.   If you were tracking his advanced stats he was still the same old Steven Adams before he got hurt.    Especially when you look at NO history last year, with the same exact type situation happening to Favors, discounting his injury his on/off stats were crazy.    That team really plays much better with a traditional defensive center.    I get why NO fans would be disappointed in both of those transactions but it's clear to me he's going to be a hugely impactful player for the Grizz."
"no i am arguing about Steven Adams defensive play on a Tuesday afternoon in August because I hate basketball and never watch it.   of course i did, lol."
&gt;Over under on Pat Bev begging for a buy out?   If I was him I'd rather play with KAT/D'lo and Edwards than Ja/JJJ and Steven Adams lol.
"Damn kid, it’s ok to take the L that Bev was worth pennies. Memphis turned Valencuinas into Steven Adams, a reach for Zaire Williams, and a struggling 3rd year."
Steven adams isn’t a good defender either so we don’t downgrade on defense.
He doesn’t have to shoot 3’s at all to be a better offensive fit than Steven Adams next to Zion.
Imagine Zion forcing a switch or help. Imagine what Steven Adams can do to help exploit that. Now imagine was JV can do to exploit that.
Imagine Steven Adams trying to exploit a mismatch caused by Zion drawing help or switches. Now imagine JV doing it.
Pelicans fans are pretty delusional if they think Steven Adams is not a plus defender.
I’m not really disagreeing because I do think that getting rid of Bledsoe and Steven adams and adding JVV is huge so they probably will improve but Lonzos defense definitely is worth that 10 mil when the pelicans have no other good defenders.
I have a Steven Adams plush. Fucking love that guy
Him and Steven Adams plus Brooks are going to wear down opposing teams.
Steven Adams. Probably not a famous one but the guy is such a fucking badass teddy bear it’s hard to not love him.
"It's the rebounding that really sells it for me. Contrary to popular belief, Zion can not be the only rebounder. Hence, why Griffin attempted to rectify that issue with Steven Adams. I'd like to see Hart get his percentages from outside up."
I managed get a shit quality picture with Steven adams when he was leaving a restaurant for some kind of nba cares event. I sent it to my friend who is a huge nba fan. That dude sends me back a pic of his med school group with Shaq that he got to meet the same day. Point is Shaq is dope and my friend outshined me that day lol
[https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/\_/id/2991235/steven-adams](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2991235/steven-adams)  Never had a double double season. In general Adams is heavily overrated on this sub because all the white guys on here want to look like him.
how do you feel about my guy Steven Adams though ?
"Isn’t it crazy how the same dude keeps “accidentally” diving at players’ knees or broke the nose of the guy he was defending? Even if it’s not completely intentional, he’s incredibly reckless and doesn’t seem to care. He’s a foul magnet and honestly should get more fouls but doesn’t.   Pat Bev/Clips fans cant justify him shoving Chris Paul with his back turned. Imagine if he didn’t land properly and broke his wrist or something. It’s one thing to play tough defense, it’s another thing to be reckless when doing that and hurting the man you’re defending. My favorite Pat Bev moment is when he ran into Steven Adams’ shoulder when he wasn’t looking. Hard screen bitch."
"Lmao was actually starting to root for Memphis again because of how solid hey were last season and playoffs and the addition of Steven Adams, who I like. But now they're adding this asshole PatBev?  One of the nicest guys in the league and one of the most hated in 1 team?"
Pat beverly and Steven Adams together this team will be scrappy as hell

Steven Adams should be bodying everyone then.

Damn that sucks if you’re hang your hat on Steven Adams over the past 8 years.
"&gt; And Sam Presti made the pick, I wouldn't be too concerned as an OKC fan.  Presti hasn't drafted an impact player since Steven Adams in 2013"
"I'd argue he ""regressed defensively"" due to how easy it was to score on the Pelicans as a whole.   BI, Zion, Steven Adams, and Eric Bledsoe were literally training cones on defense and no matter what Zo did alone, his numbers were slated to drop. He's not Jrue Holiday levels because he doesn't have the strength to match up with the top scorers but his team defense overall is top tier in my opinion. Dude is almost always there defending the right play or at least in the vicinity of where he should be. Once he muscles up and gets a bit more physical I can see him going back to being top 3 in advanced defensive stats"

Tbh they could have really used Horford instead of Steven Adams.
"This is the first thing I opened this morning and I completely misread the title as ""Steven Adams yams over David Stern"" and was wondering why I had never seen it before lmao"
Grizzlies legend Steven Adams
Steven Adams is going to shoot 40% from 3 this year on 3/4 attempts per game
zbo punching steven adams was peak rivalry imo
"I said this from the start too. I remember this one Pels homer literally told me,”we have amazing defense because of Steven Adam’s and we don’t need spacing because Zion can bully through anyone.”  Lmao they literally ended up like the same spot the year before. I’m pretty sure SVG wanted Adams - old school coaches like him love traditional outdated centers. Then they extended him to a massive contract before he even played a minute in a Pels jersey."
Steven Adams
Steven Adams  Dont push him tho... CJ Williams lol
Steven Adams
[Best one is Nick Collison and Steven Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2mPCpV851s)
"It's going to be the Pelicans.   Better coaching, more space, growth from their young guys, less Eric Bledsoe, less Steven Adams, more Valanciunas. They lost so many close games last year."
Yes but does he have a cool accent and hilarious demeanor? No.  Steven Adams 1  AD 0
Presti hasn't drafted a meaningful player since Steven Adams in 2013 has he? I think it's safe to say he's not very good at it
"He may not be as obsessed with it as Westbrook, but all stars care about their stats. Hell, every player. It's the way they get paid and stay relevant. Modern players now care about raw stats, but also analytics. Back in the day a PF and C cared very much about rebounds. If Westbrook was playing in the 80s and 90s, Steven Adams would have elbowed him for trying to steal his rebounds. In the modern game, Steven Adams was boxing out for Westbrook to get the rebounds and start the fastbreak."
"Ya’ll alright mate?  -Steven Adams, probably"
Not to mention several players credit Steven Adams to be the strongest player in the league. This man just went head first into a 7ft brick wall.
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Two former Thunder legends right there....  Contrast that to Steven Adams, who took a trade kicker AND an extension"
"If he had a premonition that there would be a Steven Adams soon that would be so much better than Perkins, he would have. Sadly, that’s difficult to predict."
ngl i thought steven adams was dirty af watching him vs steph and klay in the 2016 wcf 😂😂😂
presti hasn't made a good draft pick since steven adams in 2013
Yeah he looks barely taller than CP3 and considerably shorter than Westbrook. I'd call him 6'1  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/steven-adams-dennis-schroder-chris-paul-head-coach-billy-donovan-picture-id1172916483 https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/dennis-schroder-and-russell-westbrook-of-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-picture-id1040228242?s=2048x2048
"Drafted KD, Westbrook, harden, ibaka, Steven Adams, Sabonis in a 10 year period."
"I agree 99%. Super glad we got Russ.  The only thing that stands out that I somewhat disagreed with was when after a playoffs loss, a reporter asked Steven Adams a question about the team. Westbrook cut in before Steven had a chance to say anything and basically said don’t try to break up the team.  IMO he should have at least let Steven answer first. The question was towards him and he’s a grown man. Have something to say, fine. But that was a bit off to me"
"You wouldn’t know it from watching him play now, but in 2016 there was a legitimate argument for Steven Adams over Steph Curry. If I’m remembering right, Adams was actually 3rd in MVP voting that year on 20/20/5/5/5 with incredible defense  I want Adams!"
"Although they only did it for about 5 games until they realized Grant is just way better. By the way his MVP year they surrounded him with great shooters in the starting lineup such as Roberson, Taj Gibson, and Steven Adams lol. His MVP year gets way too much hate."
Let's be fair - who among us has not thought that Steven Adams is better than Steph Curry.
Steven Adams on the most liked bench
The hate really started when Draymond kicked Steven Adams in the groin in the 2016 playoffs.
Nutcracker Draymond gonna destroy the other team.. ask Steven Adams 😂
"I completely disagree.   There's so many guys who you can replace with someone like Sims and not downgrade very much at all. Especially considering the money a second round pick makes.  For example, would you rather pay Steven Adams $17.5 million or Sims $1 million?"
"If Zion averages 30/10/7 on close to the same efficiency he has now without developing a reliable 3 pointer I will be shocked. You added Devonte Graham, but lost Lonzo who was also a 38% 3 point shooter on 8 attempts a game so that's pretty much a wash when talking about spacing.  Summer league is basically irrelevant to the actual NBA, I'm sure the dude is a good shooter but don't expect him to average 50/40/90 as a rookie. Valanciunas is a good centre and has a better offensive game than Steven Adams, but he's not a good 3 point shooter or passer so I feel like he would just clog the lane when he shares the floor with Zion.   Zion can for sure get up to 30ppg or increase his assist numbers, but doing both at the same time whilst maintaining his current efficiency I really don't think is possible. Would be happy to be proven wrong though, the kid is really fun to watch."
"I remember when dudes used to try to fight Steven Adams all the time before they realized   * Adams was just a hard working good dude who wasn't taking anything personally  * he would confusedly absorb their punches/elbows and barely flich, making them look like little bitches  * they'd get teched, suspended and docked pay for hitting him"
Neither is Asik so how is that different? Asik was traded away with a 1st round pick after signing that awful contract just like Steven Adams was. Seems like the same thing to me.
"&gt; Ppl say the pels fucked up the AD situation rushing to compete and then say the Pels need to rush with Zion to compete, it is just astounding.   If anything I think the complaints are basically that the Pelicans are just making the same mistakes all over again.  If you can explain to me how everything having to do with Steven Adams is appreciably different than everything the Pelicans did with [Omer Asik,](https://syndication-bleacherreport-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2522332-new-orleans-pelicans-will-probably-regret-re-signing-omer-asik-to-huge-deal.amp.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16324448564316&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) I'd love to hear it."
The record is held by Steven Adams for that Warriors series
"Given the reports about Zion, he's clearly not at a maturity level to lead a team. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were busts as veteran leaders. James Johnson did a lot for the team TBH if you watched their young guys down the stretch. More than JJ did all season. Iwundu, who they got in the deal, was part of the grizz-pels-graham deal that got them Jonas and Graham."
"&gt;Last year on paper, we had Zion, Ingram, Ball, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe who were all though if to be ark east good. starter level players. Then we had Hart on the Bench, and during the second half of the year, NAW and Hayes stepped up to become good productive players. NAW really should’ve been starting post all star break last year.  That still isn't more talent than the Knicks b.  Randle, RJ, IQ, D.Rose, Burks, Mitch(tho injuried), etc.  &gt;This year we have Ingram, Valunciounas, Graham, NAW, Hayes, Hart, Murphy, who will all be good positive players for us. I could’ve included Naji too. We also have Kira, Satiransky, who could possibly be solid.  We got the same core plus added Kemba and Forunier, a resurged Mitch, a more confident Obi, and some good rookies who have the ability to show out.   &gt;If Zion is as good to where people can say that we’re wasting his talents, then he should be able to carry us to the playoffs. This is not like when we had barely rotation level players starting for us during some of those AD years.  That's not how things work, lmao. You need a valid front office as well. Good coaches. Good chemistry. Etc."
"We had Lonzo, Jrue, JJ when he was good, Hart, Favirs before the bubble was solid. Melli was ok that year too.  Last year on paper, we had Zion, Ingram, Ball, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe who were all though if to be ark east good. starter level players. Then we had Hart on the Bench, and during the second half of the year, NAW and Hayes stepped up to become good productive players. NAW really should’ve been starting post all star break last year.  This year we have Ingram, Valunciounas, Graham, NAW, Hayes, Hart, Murphy, who will all be good positive players for us. I could’ve included Naji too. We also have Kira, Satiransky, who could possibly be solid.  If Zion is as good to where people can say that we’re wasting his talents, then he should be able to carry us to the playoffs. This is not like when we had barely rotation level players starting for us during some of those AD years.  I’m still not sure if Zion is committed or not, but he hast done much to convince me he’s fully committed."
"I could understand those comments with AD, but we’ve but a lot of talent around Zion. I would say we had a lot of talent last year, but Bledsoe checked out before the season even began, and Steven Adams slowed down after the first month of games. We had more talent then y’all had last year, but the Knicks players actually commuted to the things it took to win, like hustling, playing defense, and playing hard at all times. We would’ve been good if our players did that too. Even though the spacing was bad, that didn’t stop philly from making the playoffs.  Also that first team could’ve actuallly been good if Zion didn’t come into training camp out of shape then get injured. Even if he just showed up to the bubble in shape, we would’ve made the playoffs (check pre bubble records). We had the easiest schedule in the bubble."
Except the Pels have been making shitty win now moves that won't get them anywhere instead of doing a proper full rebuild into a contender. Trading RJ Hampton who has a crazy high ceiling for Steven Adams to give him a huge extension was stupid as fuck. Then trading down from #10 when they could have gotten a potential star in Bouknight was also bad. Then letting Lonzo walk so they can trade away a pick for Devonte Graham also isn't good.  They're going all in to try to be a low seed 1st/2nd round exit every year instead of building up an actual contender. Don't blame Zion for getting mad that his team's management is garbage.
I don’t think its a complete AD.  Griff is a moron though.  Stan?  Steven Adams?  Bledsoe?  It is like Griff wants him to leave.  The new coach is really the only shot I see of him staying.  If those two get along.
"At least the sixers are a good team who made sure Simmons had what he needed to succeed. Meanwhile NOLA trades Jrue for shit, adds players that like Steven Adams that only hurt his spacing, and then get rid of one of the only guys he really synced with in game, Lonzo.   pelicans are setting Zion up to fail."
"No, I can definitely admit that every team needs to build in different ways, and I'll very willingly say that a team like the Lakers has a margin for error that other teams do not. But that's a big part of why teams like New Orleans need to be extra smart about the moves that they make. They can't afford to not spend money on a medical team or training staff and they can't afford to overpay someone like Steven Adams, especially after way overpaying just to trade for him. If you're in a small market you need to nail all the moves on the margins, you can't keep making huge errors and just expect everything to work out.   The thing I hate about this whole discussion is that because I'm a Laker fan that just totally invalidates everything I'm saying to people like you. But the reality is that I'm right. Zion has legit reasons to have zero faith in the Pelicans ability to build a contender. You guys act like he needs to wait 7 years before he can make that decision, but even people like me who have never been part of that team can see how poorly they've been run for the last decade. Someone like Zion only has so many years in the league. Why should he be obligated to throw many of them away before he can finally go play competitive basketball?"
steven adams
Oh this tired trope again. The Lakers put themselves in a position to offer two max slots to LeBron and someone else (presumably Paul George) while still retaining enough young talent to flip for a 3rd star (which ended up being Anthony Davis).   The Pelicans drafted Zion and ever since have been throwing away assets and cluttering their team with negative value contracts like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. And this is following years of doing the same crap when Anthony Davis was there (like not hiring a medical/training staff for the team and acquiring and extending guys like Omer Asik). They're a poorly run team and always have been. You guys have been gifted three generational level talents in the draft in the last 20 years and you've wasted *all* of them. My guess is Gayle Benson is a shit owner just like her husband was and the team would probably be better off if she sold it to someone who knew what they were doing.
I really don't know but I don't think the Pels have been suffering because of Zion's behavior.  Not at all.  the Pels just suck with management and coaching.  they misuse him entirely and put ridiculous lineups with him like Steven Adams.  And Booker had the same problem for a while with the Suns.  I am saying these things are outside the control of the players.
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
"I don't think it would be that easy. Jokic is strong af. People love to say Steven Adams is the strongest player in the NBA. Put him in the low post, against Jokic, and Jokic toys with him.  Jokic is _strong_."
"Serious question, why do you think JV fits significantly better than Steven Adams?"
What drug would Steven Adams be the most likely to endorse?  Hmm.
If it wasn't for the Steven Adams and singing cats I woulda ate this up like Mac and Cheese at a Barbeque
"Gobert. Capela. Zubac. Boban. All key pieces on their playoff teams. All non shooters.   Steven adams. J Allen. I can go on &amp; on w bigs who can’t shoot, and still add value.   If shooting was as simple as working on it, surely there wouldn’t be too many poor shooters in the league?   Bron and Luka must not work on their free throw shooting since they’re both not good FT shooters. Draymond Green must not be a hard worker since his 3pt shooting has regressed, why doesn’t he simply work on it, so he can become a better shooter?   For every big who can shoot, there’s 5 more who can’t. It’s not normal at all for a big to turn into a shooter.   A big coming into the league as a shooter is completely different than trying to turn a non shooter into one.  Edit: Giannis is also another big that came into the league shooting"
"All these clips are post grit n grind era. Wish there were some full games from our playoff series against the thunder, clippers and spurs from '11-17. 2014 we took the Thunder to 7 games and 4 straight OTs. Reggie Jackson saved the series for the thunder (along with ZBO shoving young and skinny Steven Adams hard enough to be considered a ""punch"" and wrongly being suspended for game 7)."
"It gets weirder:      &gt;Griffin had purchased the piano with the blessing of owner Gayle Benson, who was a great fan of Jerry Lee Lewis. Benson had hired Griffin largely on his impromptu rendition of Great Balls of Fire during his interview, and agreed that a piano would bring passion and a sense of community to the team. Little did she know that Griffin would have the piano wheeled to various team meetings, practices, and weight training sessions, where he enjoyed singing music from Cats. Occasionally Griffin would accost players and staffers in the hall, having blocked the way with the piano, and demand that they guess whatever tune he was playing. Steven Adams so rarely recognized the work of Liberace that Griffin traded him at the first opportunity."
"We can’t say Griffin hasn’t tried to help Zion. He gave him Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Steven Adams, SVG as a coach.   I just don’t think it’s enough."
Russell Westbrook getting the rebound and initiating the fast break is far more valuable than Steven Adams/ Clint Capela/ Robin Lopez.
"I still remember  the harden trade and how people in the Rockets forum would rather have monta ellis , oj mayo or tyreke Evan's and keep that toronto draft pick that became Steven Adams. This forum is very myopic sometimes"
"Bro, if simons never played another game, you telling me he is going to have a better career that Favors? Lost your mind. If he played in Sacramento, would he have been anything. The only reason he had a max and people know who he is because he is in philly. Otherwise he would be sitting behind Steven Adams or Derrick favors somewhere."

"Draymond with multiple heel-face turns. Though Draymond isn't as beloved as JJ is now.  Though after Draymond retires people will probably forgive the arguing and kicking, except for Steven Adams."

Steven Adams and D10 wear sleeves to save themselves from getting clawed to shit
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"

"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
"Nobody saying he’s strong than 10 16 year olds. Basketball isn’t about the combined physical strength of the team though, lmao. If it was Steven Adams would be an all-star"

Steven Adams is gonna retire with a career 600Ms and buy a section of New Zealand for himself
"Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marcus smart? My bias wants to say Kyle Lowry is different but these guys all hype the shit outta teammates and are annoying as hell to anyone who isn't but also they're going back you up or pull you out of any situations  Edit: saw someone say Steven Adams, that's probably the guy"
I've seen James Johnson fly in a couple times lol  I feel like Steven Adams could be a big bro too just not enough highlights
Y’all already know it’s STEVEN ADAMS
I’m definitely not bullish on him becoming even a Steven Adams type defender because Sabonis just isn’t very big. When Adams was in his prime he could provide a certain level of rim protection just by being huge and in the lane. Sabonis is definitely a tier down from Adams in terms of size.
"That’s a very real possibility. Like I said in my original post, Domas has improved every season in one area. He has to get better at defense to be the starting center for Indiana, which is what I’m hoping he worked on this offseason. For as big and strong and aggressive as he plays, it’s a little pathetic that he can’t body people on D. I’m not even asking for elite defense like Turner or Gobert give; Steven “brickwall” Adams type defense is good enough."
Need someone like Steven Adams
You know how Steven Adams is widely acknowledged as being the strongest player in the NBA right now? [Here's what happened when rookie Zion barged into him after a single step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62pFXKvrVyg).
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
Oure telling me steven adams isn't a sniper despite him hitting threes in practice?
He saw the video of Steven adams doing 3 point drills lolz

Older brother of NBA player Steven Adams
LOL. steven adams points and rebounds have decreased every year since Russ left. he had his highest rebounding numbers playing with Russ.
Steven Adams is literally one of the best rebounders in the nba and he looked allergic to the ball when he played with Russ
"He's 7'1 and arguably came into the league underweight for his height and we cant keep counting on taj gibson to bang bodies in the paint for 20+ minutes a night. Look at guys like deandre, steven adams, and hell even tatum who all beefed up pretty considerably within their first 4 years. Our perimiter d got us in the playoffs without him last season and the hawks series showed that we need solid bodies in the paint or else we wont ever have a shot. This seems like its getting blown way out of proportion"
"I like Steven Adams a lot, he's a fun guy and cool in personality. sometimes rocky relationships happen in the first season, you can make up for it by doing the best you can."
"Shaq vs Ben Wallace,  Wilt vs Steven Adams,  Adama Traore vs LBJ &amp; Dwight Howard vs Poku."
"Steven Adams, Shaq, Kawai would do well with those mits and a little training.  Fun video of Shaq with a real arm wrestler: https://youtu.be/zqVbap7fqXA"
I used to say that I would rather get hit by a car than get punched in the face by Mike Tyson.  I feel the same way about Steven Adams. The dude is built like a tree trunk all the way down.
"Robinson: “Steven Adams pinches your arm to see how strong you are and for mind games.”  Meanwhile, in the mind of Steven Adams: “hehe, a lil pincharoo.”"
Steven Adams is gonna look like prime Shaq
Sounds like they should've been more upset with Z-Bo than Steven Adams
"Growing his hair/beard out was the greatest decision he's ever made. It's not right that it's like this, but short haired Steven Adams looks like a shit stirrer, long haired Steven Adams looks like he stands his ground."
"[Here you go](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/27/steven-adams-named-one-of-the-9-dirtiest-players-in-nba-by-complex/) Btw I don't give a shit if he was voted dirty Adams has always seemed thought out and composed, not to mention the time he caught another player from a scary fall."
Why are you arguing against a [literal fact](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/27/steven-adams-named-one-of-the-9-dirtiest-players-in-nba-by-complex/) by bringing up Patrick Beverley to a LAKERS FAN
I like Steven adams because I thought he was the guy on stargate atlantis
"I couldn’t ever phantom someone disliking Steven Adams or Boban, not the most skilled players but their such standup and likable dudes. Boban literally got to fight Jon Wick so that makes him a legend in my book."
Steven Adams
"People love Steven Adams because he is Australian. I love Steven Adams, because he saved Plumlee's life."
Steven adams
I mean who do you think is gonna play more physical against him Steven Adams or Bertans? What about Valucinas and Keldon Johnson? It’s not like there are any old school 4s in the league. Him floating on the perimeter gives him less wear and tear
I think  Valanciunas will be a big upgrade over Steven Adams and they might make the playoffs since the west as the weakest it has ever been since a long time
"At least offensively. His efficency while sharing the court with guys like Bledsoe, Lonzo and Steven Adams is great"
"Meh, weirdly it doesn't happen with someone like Morant, it didn't happen with KD, it didn't happen with Embiid, it hasn't happened with Trae, with Jokic  It happens when teams do a shitty job. It's not Rachel Nichols that traded assets for the right to overpaid Steven Adams while drafting a center high in the draft whole chosing to keep Bledsoe over George Hill"
"The Harden trade was a decade ago. Imagine if someone said we had a shitty front office and deserved what we got because we drafted Fab Melo.  Sure, Presti fucked up and was probably pressured by ownership to make that trade. They also didn’t get nothing back. Obviously he’s nowhere near Harden, a literal MVP, but Steven Adams was a good starting center for them for a while.  OKC generally are smart, I think their recent strategy has been a good one. They’ll be the ones laughing as they control the future of the league with all those picks."
Bro Cade just came into the league he doesn't have the body or strength that a player training for 3+ years has. I'd imagine if you put Steven Adams on a college team he'd elevate them more than Cade.
Steven Adams
"You’re objectively wrong. Russ IMO has been the most overrated superstars. Besides that they had Ibaka, a limited overpaid Steven Adams and fucking Roberson.  Are you kidding, compared to other stars teammates in Harden, Curry, Kawhi, Lebron etc in 2017-"
"Love that Draymond’s 10 points are lowest of the listed game-performances. Next lowest that I saw was DAJ (12), Marc (13), Thybulle (13), and Steven Adams (14). I know this isn’t listing their season-highs, but it was interesting to me anyway. Awesome work, OP!"
"His team was far from terrible grant you, but playing next to Westbrook as your number 2 can prove to be difficult regarding his questionable shot selection and efficiency. That Thunder team in general during that series lacked spacing, André Roberson, Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Randy Foye, all those dudes are poor shooters. Their only decent shooter aside from KD was Dion Waiters, yea Dion Waiters. Yes KD choked a 3-1 lead and joining the team that beat you is definitely subject to criticism but to say he was surrounded by talent is a bit too much credit imo. Of course letting Harden walk away was a big blow as well. The fact they had 3 future MVPs and blew it tells you how the Thunder organization ruined their championship hopes."
Marc gasol - 12 Steven Adams - 14  Pretty much everyone got close to 20 at least once.
"Westbrook, Alex Abrines, Steven adams, nick collision"
Confirmed: This is a 2 pointer by Steven Adams
"Brook Lopez isn't a poor rebounder at all, he's just boxing out on every play, like his brother, like Steven Adams.  There's a reason why Giannis defensive rebounds numbers jumped so much once Brook joined the Bucks"
"There was the big almost thrice, each of which I think would have guaranteed a championship.   There were strong rumours of Blake Griffin joining okc, when exactly I'm forgetting.  The rumour that Al Horford would have signed if kd resigned, providing a big upgrade over Steven Adams and a lot more spacing/flexibility.  The biggest, of almost getting Klay Thompson. That trio of russ kd and Klay would have just ended games"
Yeah I still don't understand what Memphis is doing. Why are they buying out guys that are going to the Lakers? They should've not made those deals especially since it looked like they were trying to build with their youth. I don't like the Steven Adams trade at all. It's confusing
"Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, supported by Evan Turner, Steven Adams, and Robin Lopez"
Lol even Steven Adams is draining 3s in the off-season
"The same thing could be said about Demar summer shooting videos but two entirely different situations. Spurs fans also got taken last year by Lonnie Walker going at it with Jrue.   Point is, summer workout videos have to be taken with a large pinch of salt. There's one floating around out there of Steven Adams looking like Dirk from a few years ago..."
"Wasn't Steven Adams actually in a gang?  All I know, when that dude goes to break up fights, dudes part like the sea."
James Johnson and Steven Adams
"What shooters? Kyrie was hobbled through out that run, love was out for the playoffs. The only legit shooter was JR. The other guys were Shump, TT, Delly, and Mozgov. You’re thinking of the 2016 squad. Sure but Lebron taking GSW to 6 isn’t somehow nullified as an accomplishment because he shot poorly in the same that Durant taking GSW to 7 isn’t nullified due to his poor shooting.   I mean KD averaged 28.5 ppg on 60 Ts% vs the spurs, which is elite efficiency. Against the Mavs he was very inefficient and against the warriors he was inefficient. But thats what comes getting ganged up on during every possession especially when you’re playing alongside wing players like Roberson and when you’re running 2 bigs at the same time  2014 tells a similar story, round 1 he below average efficiency, round 2 he had monstrous efficiency and WCF he had slightly above average efficiency.   So a better shooting performance overall but that is with caveat of him playing beside more competent offensive players with guys like Reggie and Fischer rather than Roberson and Steven Adams in the same lineup  His supporting cast wasn’t any better than what Kawhi had in 2019, in fact id argue the raptors had a much better overall roster because they actually had 2 other all star caliber players   Thunder were very good but i wouldn’t call them “stacked” and i never said he lost because he had no shooting. I said you cant get too mad at his underwhelming shooting performances when he’s essentially play 1v3 every time down. Just because they blew the series doesn’t mean KD doesn’t get credit for putting himself in that position"
Steven Adams   PJ Tucker   Jusuf Nurkic   Morris twins   Marcus Smart   Jimmy Butler   Jonas Valanciunas
"1) James Johnson, 2) Steven Adams, 3) Udonis Haslem"
grizzlies legend steven adams
Gotta be Draymond. I also think Steven Adams is just hella tough. People will foul the shit out of him and it doesnt even phase him
"Thats what I thought, but I just checked and of the 1350 minutes Josh Hart played, Steven Adams only played about 480 with him. Thats only like 1/3 of Hart's Minutes"
"Because of coaching and underpreforming players. We Sabonis being a spot up big and Victor Oladipo was playing like he plays now but worse. Those where the other two options on that team. People don't understand how fucking terrible that shit was. Also Hardens advanced stats where also good but the triple double counts, russ completed some shit people never thought could ever happen again period that counts for something. Harden had some pretty decent guys on that roster looking back too that where performing. Capelam Dekker, Montrezl, Ariza, Ryan Andersons last good year, Lou Williams etc.  People just read off Houston fanboy arguments and don't look at the context. We dead ass had Oladipo and Sabonis as spot up shooters  next to Steven Adams and Roberson and Billy Donovans trash ass not knowing what to do."
"Exactly. He always does that shit whether it's with Steven Adams, Deandre Jordan, whoever."
"Absolutely intentional. OKC needed Russ to re-sign, so they decided to appeal to his ego and have him challenge one of the unbreakable records. It's not a coincidence that Steven Adams' defensive rebound rate went from 15 to 24% when Russ left. I think the transition thing was an excuse they came up with afterwards."
"Stealing a rebound from Steven Adams to get to 10, instead of hustling down the court for a fast break. For example."
Steven Adams is horrific on defense.
"Using per36 isn't a fucking stat. It's a fucking joke how dumb reddit is thinking oh if he played this long it would be this much, when the fuck has steven adams averaged 36 minutes in his life. Stop inflating bs to justify yourself."
"Do you not know what per 36 means? It means it adjusts stats for time on the court dude. Adam nowadays plays about 5-6 minutes less per game than he did with Russ, (yet he still puts up similar rebound numbers) so using Per 36 to compare output only makes sense. You really shouldn't be arguing about stats if you don't even know what per 36 is.     And if you only compare defensive rebounds, it looks even worse. Adams goes from averaging 6.4 defensive rebounds (per36) playing with Westbrook to 9.9 (per36) defensive rebounds.   Did you know that Steven Adams had 2 consecutive seasons of averaging more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds while playing with Westbrook? That's a crazy stat that I didn't even know till I looked it up."
So now that he's off the thunders who is thriving without him. Is Steven Adams average going up without him. I have yet to see any actual substance in rebound averages going up after he left
Also Steven Adams
Steven Adams. Also Carmelo Anthony made a joke about Russ stealing rebounds when they were teammates in OKC
"I don't think advanced stats are proof of anything after 4 or 5 games. What do I expect from the Grizzlies? This a team that kept its core pretty much intact. JJJ is back and healthy, Ja Morant has taken a step forward (will surely become an All Star this season). So have Desmond Bane and Melton. Steven Adams is a worse player than Valanciunas but it might be a better fit. The Grizzlies made the Playoffs last season thru the play in games, so I guess they can fuck around and maybe get a 6th or 7th seed."
We lost it big to Memphis/Steven Adams earlier this week.  Interesting stuff.
"Don't worry about it, this sub is just more reactionary than a 12 year old losing a LOL game.  Last season I did my own research and gave reasons as to why more than half of Westbrook's triple doubles belong to Steven Adams and I almost had to call a lawyer."
Dont get too high dont get too low. Remember with our best player its going to be rough.  On top of that our match up  vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up. DeAndre defeated us. Jjj and steven adams hurt us. Today we had kevin love evan mobley and Jarrett allen stop us. They stopped jokic. Then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue. Cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure. I hope we can get to 500 by all star break though.
They mentioned them on the call about Steven Adams tonight. It's out there.
"ayton wants too much money too early in our process so it's just not right.  if we can get a bonafied second option scorer (i love love love giddey, but he is best as a facilitator of sorts who scores to keep the defense honest and not a bucket getter like shai), we just need a steven adams type of defensive roll man center who can ideally shoot a 3 or 2 if needed. in the scenario where we have SGA/Giddey/&lt;insert a great scorer we draft&gt;, we can't really afford to have a big contract like Ayton"
2 pointer from Steven Adams
But Steven Adams was just fine lol
"iirc it was no more than 20mill/yr even on a shorter deal so they wouldn’t even do 60/3 which is ridiculous for a player who shot as good as Lonzo the last two years, especially considering age.  Also while PG defense isn’t as important as big defense to the team they still make an impact and the last thing New Orleans needed was to be losing positive defenders when they plan to run Zion and Ingram out there every night.   Honestly they were handed a golden platter by Lakers and are some how fucking it up. I know AD is a monster so he’s more than worth what they got but they got an all star caliber player (maybe more if he ever starts playing defense) in Ingram, an above average starting PG who shoots the 3, plays D, and doesn’t need the ball in his hands, Hart is a quality role player, and then three firsts with a top 4 pick being one of them.   Considering they won the draft lottery a month earlier they basically have fucked this up in a lot of spots. Yeah Zion has been injured and they can’t control his off season habits or injury risk but I mean come on, look at the front office since they got him after the AD trade (which lets be honest was basically telling the Lakers to give them everything that they got).   Kept on Gentry for a single year(Zions rookie year no less) for basically no reason except being cheap, hired Van Gundy then fired him the next year, trade for Steven Adams then extend him unnecessarily, trade for JV afterwards, let Lonzo walk for seemingly no reason and gave up a first to do it somehow and only got back Devonte Graham.   If we were to judge FOs on what happened from August 2019 forwards only I’m not sure anyone has been even close to as bad the Pelicans are."
Ready for me to blow your mind? Steven Adams is actually younger than JV
"the JV and 17th pick (Trey Murphy) for Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, and the 10th pick was a huge win for the Pels"
Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
Replace Steven Adams with JJ Reddick and you have a list
"CJ, Draymond, Butler, Steven Adams"
"Enes really doesn’t give a fuck, i’ve loved the dude since he was with my boy Steven Adams on those Thunder teams. He continuously stands up for the right thing without much care about repercussions, which I commend because this needs to be talked about."
"&gt;Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Steven Adams on the all-star team  subscribe"
Steven Adams averages mroe assists than Jokic.
"This. I actually stopped caring once my raptors got their ring. Now i just watch for the players (westbrook, steven adams, zach lamelo dame)."
"Maybe I don’t watch enough Cavs/Nets, but he strikes me as a better scoring Steven Adams.  Not quite as strong a post defender though.  But a secondary scorer who’s good at staying out of the way, but doesn’t rely on jump shooting to get his."
"if zion doesnt fit with anyone that sounds like a problem with him not JV or steven adams  you people just repeat the same thing over and over 'bad fit bad fit'.   well who is a good fit then mister genius GM.  giannis?  in truth zions biggest fit issues are with his pants from 2 years ago cause he wont stop eating and doesnt care enough to try and get into shape  'why should zion buy in' cause he was drafted and is paid to do so, this is a question so idiotic it barely deserves a response.  what has he done to deserve anything more than NO has given him"
It's the Steven Adams trade and signing that's maybe the worst to me. Pretty much everyone at the time thought it was a bad move. And it was.
&gt;Tons of uncontested rebounds  Every good rebounder (especially non-bigs) have tons of uncontested rebounds. Most rebounds (by a wide margin) are uncontested. I think what bugged people about Westbrook in OKC is that they had Steven Adams just box people out and not even try to get rebounds if Westbrook was anywhere close so Russ could pad his stats.
you have the best chance of winning in most cases with the ball in KD &amp; Russ's hands lol should they have given Steven Adams the ball more or something????
"Yup, only other issue with KAT is that he's not strong enough for the bullyball types like Jonas and Steven Adams and Embiid. He tries his ass off, but the lack of strength and the over-helping/over-committing are his problems. He's been solid but we've played the pels and the rockets so far."
Man it was a pretty underwhelming list if Steven Adams and Vucevic made the list
"To be quite honest, yes it is kind of a joke. These are players that I have found interesting and that I respect on some weird levels. Anyone can tell you KD is a legend and it'd be true. How often does someone take a stab at Steven Adams though?"
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Felício    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokić  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
"If the NBA could guarantee Pat Bev would get steamrolled by a screen like the Steven Adams one at least once in every game he plays, I’d pay $1000/yr for league pass."
"Steven Adams, mate"
"Woah woah buddy, you get diminishing returns, remember that. Your 17th is barely worth a 2 by Steven Adams. More efficient to use other Celtics fans as a means to an end."
Steven Adams. Just ask Pat Beverly. :D
Yeah Steph and Klay wouldnt know what to do with all the time and space from a Steven Adams screen
@ last night when steven adams took all the rebounds and gave the grizz a bunch of second chance points
"George Mikan, one of the most integral parts of early NBA history and at one point the greatest Laker ever. Started the Laker Great Big Man trend. Not only is he forgotten through time by most Lakers fans, he made less money than Scottie Pippens 7 year deal. So his legacy is forgotten by fans of the franchise he help built and he wasn’t compensated well for it. I’d much rather be Steven Adams lol."
"yup, hobbled steph made some people think that guys like the two you mentioned + Steven Adams were legit perimeter defenders"
"I don't know. Seemed like a pretty weak ""foul"" to me. He wasn't shooting when the contact occured. And contrary to what many people think, it isn't just *any* contact that represents a foul. Like when steven Adams put his hand on AD's back when AD fell out of bounds. He touched him, but it wasn't a foul."

Things like this is why you need an enforcer.  If Steven Adams was still on the Thunder he'd be doing to Embiid what he did to Patrick Beverley.
After allll this time...Steven Adams who's where you draw the line at claiming a Kiwi? Lol.
"Ja - Adams PnR, big steps up to contest the Ja floater, Steven Adams gets the offensive board.  Our PGs weren't getting in the way."
"He wears himself out though.  First 10 games Steven adams looks like prime Dwight, rest of the season he looks like Kanter without the offense"
Steven Adams is a work horse
"Fam that fourth quarter was hard. The Grizzlies were making bad mistakes and the Lakers would then captalize on those bad mistakes with their own bad mistakes.  We had, AD falling out of bounds, Ja missing his third free throw, Russ getting a huge offensive rebound with Ja then stealing it from him, Steven adams throwing a horrendous turnover, Bazemore's multiple mistakes, etc etc.   It was a bad ending to this game as a neutral observer."
Wiseman for Steven Adams would be spicey
"Even to stop fast breaks. Steven Adams stopped like 3 plays, it's just plain boring watching something exciting happen for a player to take foul..."
"Idk, those 9 turnovers were the same old bad mistakes he always makes. Not to mention bricks at the rim and giant airball with Steven Adams on him"
Steven Adams really letting Ja Morant down this game. Holy shit
justice for Steven Adams
What’s going on with Steven Adams’ hand? He looks hurt.
Steven Adams almost killed Reeves on that screen
"I haven’t paid much attention to Steven Adams recently, I mean I knew he fell off a little but my god. Dude is awful now"
"Steven Adams won’t FUCKING flop not even once, if he did he would shoot so many free throws and get easier buckets but nope gotta kicked kicked in the balls and elbowed in the face twice a game and shrug it off and say “wha’eva mate”"
Mason Plumlee and Steven Adams.
Lmao Steven Adams took Dwight to the rack like that wtf
Bound to share some genetics with Steven Adams.
steven adams was a really good addition
Steven Adams plays for Memphis? I thought he was still in OKC lol
Anthony Davis would destroy Steven Adams but no
Dwight vs Steven adams should be fun
The Hornets would be a top 4 team in the East if they had Steven Adams
"I remember two of those.  Same with Steven Adams rolling someone off of him to save him from injury.    I really appreciate good sportsmanship, which explains why Steven Adams is one of my fave players and Pat Beverly is my least fave"
"I'm a huge Griff critic(check my post in this thread), but it's hard to pick on that deal in retrospect. At the time people were even wondering if Giannis was going to leave Milwaukee. It was a fine deal to make, and those picks are still far enough in the future that they could return solid value.   The Adams and Bledsoe stuff were a separate mistake imo. They likely could've sent Bledsoe to OKC and kept Hill instead which would've been very good for them in multiple ways, and no part of the Jrue deal meant giving Steven Adams that unnecessary extension."
"I have a Sixers flair, but I also root for them and it's really frustrating to watch. Basically every step of the way I've disagreed with Grif.  \#4 pick in 2019, you're right Hunter would've been a good pick, and I also liked Darius Garland there. Zo isn't a great halfcourt creator, Garland's handles and shooting would've been great for them making a Garland/Zo/BI/Zion core all 24 and younger. In the trade down, while I liked the NAW pickup I hated picking Hayes so high.  Jrue trade was good value at the time, but Griff messed a lot of it up. I wanted to keep Hill but instead he chose Bledsoe. He brings back Steven Adams, I knew immediately it was a bad idea to give him an extension. Now we had to make moves to get off those contracts, while Hill actually returned value to OKC while also having mentorship and stable PG ability to help the young guys in the meantime.  The Lonzo move I thought was god awful, I hated the SVG hiring, the list goes on I've literally been left complaining about nearly every move Griff makes. The craziest part of it all? The fanbase somehow comes back to supporting his crazy shit over-and-over again. They defended the Adams' extension, they defended SVG's hiring, they defended Bledsoe's acquisition over Hill, now you'll see them go berserk on anti-Zo stuff. They eventually come around to the fact that every one of those moves were really bad, but then go on to defend the next thing Griff does only to repeat that cycle.  It has nothing to do with how they've started the season, I've had all these takes along the way."
"No he’s not. Zion and Steven Adams worked very well together offensively. Valenciunas has better hands, a better touch around the rim, and a more diverse offensive game in general."
You don't understand. The Pelicans needed Steven Adams to protect Zion and be an enforcer. Also there's this great new band called Nirvana and it's the year 1989.

"Lay off my guy, Steven Adams."
Whatever team that has Steven adams
"&gt; Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no?  He was Denver's starting SG in that series and has played the majority of his minutes at SG.  &gt; Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars.  You...have a weirdly excessive amount of hype about Denver's roster from that series.  But even if we stipulated the accuracy of that hype, how does that mean Dame was let down by his team?  Surely the conclusion should be that the other team was simply better from top to bottom.  &gt; Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore.  Multiple players that were on OKC's roster from that season are not in the NBA anymore.  2019 Russ was not 2017 Russ.  Your assessment of the respective rosters doesn't match how they were actually playing.  However, Nurkic's absence certainly swings the argument here, and I'll concede that that's not a ""Blazers *should* have won"" series as I claimed.  &gt; You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there.  And it sure is a good thing that when Dame's toll came due in the Nuggets series, there was a team around him.  While acknowledging that Portland has had bad roster construction for ages, I'm not sure what results you expected such that Dame's results are a historic letdown.  Dame is prodigious, an All-NBA talent...and more playoff teams than not are led by All-NBA talent.  How far is he 'supposed' to get?"
I’m a simple man; I see Steven Adams praise and I upvote
"Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no? Point stands. Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars. We had Dame, CJ...um Nurkic sometimes but not then, Old Carmelo, Normal Powell who seems to be a shell of what Toronto fans think he is?  Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore. Your assessment of the 18-19 is flawed probably because you were too busy watching really good, fun, winning basketball while we ground our way to come see you in the WCF. You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there."
Steven Adams used to have so many 'bro wtf are you doing?' moments aimed at Bled on defense last season.
"They do this a lot with players I've noticed.  I really noticed it with Steven Adams in OKC.    Adams got away with so much contact that other people would get called for, but then on the other end when Adams would go up for a dunk he would just have people hanging onto his arms and they wouldn't give him the foul call."
I fucking love Steven Adams on this team he fits so perfectly.
Steven adams going to work
Steven Adams is such a better fit on this team than JV
"Im no David Griffin fan but the only move there you could argue was a bad move (only in hindsight) was the #4 pick trade, but then again NAW and Herb Jones look legit while Jax still a mystery box for now. But ultimately that's still a reasonable move either way.   Trading for Steven Adams and then extending him was the single bad move Griff made. Trading him for Valanciunas and down to get Trey Murphy wasn't a bad move in the slightest.   Don't even get me started on the Lonzo stuff lol."
Hassan tried to impersonate Steven Adams lol
Steven Adams…absolutely no reason for it just annoys me somehow
&gt; Steven Adams years ago signed 4/100.  And I shat on that contract. And the trade New Orleans made to get him. And the extension they gave him.
"Yes to Allen, he’s a young talent C that’s not even that high. Steven Adams years ago signed 4/100.   Markkanen we’ve had one game so it’s early to tell but I don’t love it I don’t hate it. Especially when you got guys like Kennard and Bertans, shooters get paid.   Rubio has been awesome so I don’t get that one but love was a loyalty contract but yes I do hate it.   Windler is like a 10th rotation guy and you could just about do this for any team picking apart misses but I don’t judge teams for not striking gold so late in the draft   Sexton is better than Bridges even if he is a better champion piece. MPJ I’m not sold on and SGA didn’t workout for us, I wouldn’t pick someone like that either.   Now to the end of your hit piece, Lauri is a complimentary piece to Mobley and Allen is our 5 till Mobley gets stronger. Mobley is in his 1st year we aren’t trying to compete right away he needs to grow into his body"
Nah Russ uses Steven Adams’ positioning and makes tons of effort in grabbing defensive rebounds
Runs to Memphis to kick Steven Adams in the nuts
Then moves on to Zion and Steven Adams
"Probably because of those Lin gossips. I swear I remember his teammates voting him as the best teammate back in NY. Those things usually go to great role players like Steven Adams or Udonis Haslem, not star players. So imagine that. I think he was described as immature back in Denver but never a bad teammate."
"Hollow stats. He chased Steven Adams off the block to snag rebounds. He actively tried to get the triple double record at all costs, no matter how inefficient, and had no regard for team success. Westbrook is fools’ gold. He shouldn’t be on this list.   I mean I get WHY if people take awards at face value, but he’s undeserving if we’re talking about players who contribute to successful teams. Amazing athleticism though, I’ll give him that."
"Steven Adams, and earlier Grayson Allen.  Also, I hated Chandler Parsons, when he joined, I thought I'd like him, then I really hated him even more."
"Ben Simmons is the biggest pussy in Australia, and the biggest pussy in the NBA  Steven Adams would never."
"they had Steven Adams, that’s the main reason they out rebounded and he was putting in work on that end all game"
The lower rebounding numbers in OKC were schematic. His job was to box out for Westbrook so Russ could push the ball up the court. Steven Adams is one of the strongest men in the league and he doesn’t afraid of anything; he’s consistently among the top offensive rebounders and has an elite success rate on contested rebounds.
"A lot of his assists were also to a rolling Steven Adams off the pick&amp;roll, or drop-off passes to Adams after attacking the rim"
Steven Adams is a pretty relax guy from what Ive seen. I don't think he gives a shit lol. He just plays basketball and stops you from getting into a fight with his teammates.
Dude's getting a little too cocky. I wouldn't be pulling that shit to Steven Adams of all people and not expect another Jokic/Morris situation.
He better shoot 20FTS against Memphis and Steven Adams.
Someone gotta post the part of the game where Scottie gets his first Steven Adams screen lmao
Steven Adams is not a scorer
"I don't know if JJJ will actually be able to handle being a 5 full time. Theres obvious concerns with fouling, rebounding and durability. Luckily he can space the floor enough as a 4 where he's not a negative in that position.  I think him playing the 5 will be similar to Giannis doing spot minutes at the 5. For the regular season, they need a big like Steven Adams to soak up minutes."
I've seen Steven Adams hit full court shots. Imagine what he could do looking down on the rim from 60'.
It wasn't straight up. Griz got 2 first for it: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=steven+adams+trade  2021 turned into Zaire Williams. Plus 2022 Laker's first.
"It was a fleece the day it happened. This sub likes Steven Adams because he’s funny and Australian or whatever, but JV is the better player and it is not even close."
No hate toward Steven Adams but the trade was stupid on Memphis' part. I never understood it.
It’s almost as if the Grizzlies knew they were giving up offense trading JV for Steven Adams…
"Don't worry, Memphis, Steven Adams could do this too."
"People in that part of the world are nothing if not what you might call *passionate*, if you were trying to be nice about it.  If you weren't you'd just say angry.  Enes Kanter is amazingly chill for a Turk. Like, he didn't charge onto the court when Steven Adams flattened Beverley and he hasn't pulled a knife on Giannis even *once* that we know of.  Now, it's possible Kanter is too racist to consider Giannis *truly Greek*, but Giannis absolutely *reps* Greece, so.  Meanwhile, Jokic is from the literal Balkans, a region so angry and hate-filled that it gave us the word *Balkanization*."
"If you're expecting steven adams to score 39 points in a game ever, you've got the wrong guy.   Grizzlies have to pass him the damn ball for him to score at all. He's one of my favourite players, but his best scoring performances were with westbrick feeding him off the pick and roll.   You watch how many points his team mates get via his screens, or rebounds they get because two of the opposition can't get around him."
Christ Steven Adams would have averaged 30rpg for the Thunder if that's the case lol
"He used to do that shit with Steven Adams back in 2017, not that obvious but there were a lot of times where Adams could get the ball but instead boxed out for Westbrook as he sprinted for the ball."
did anybody think Jonas was worse than Steven Adams? I was under the impression everyone knew Jonas was a definite top 10-15 center. Adams hasn't even been particularly good for like three years because he played through too many ankle and foot injuries. I thought we all knew they weren't comparable. lol
I've seen steven adams purposely giving westbrook the rebound on too many occasions to imagine anymore. It is exactly what westbrook forced his team to do back in OKC.
Steven Adams and JV are the textbook example of a zero sum game
If Steven Adams stood on JV’s shoulders would it be the best basketball player ever
Absolutely fleeced the grizzlies. Steven adams sucks
"I think he, Steven Adams, and Jokic might be the top 3 ever"
this clip but with russ yelling at steven adams instead is what people imagine westbrook in okc was like
"Steven Adams for me! Literally nothing to do with his game or anything, he is just a complete legend of a bloke."

I just typed a bunch of random centres into BBall Reference and I found the answer: Steven Adams.
"Wait, really? I was expecting Ja Morant and a big figure as Steven Adams would be enough to catch the attention of the casual fans.  Tbh, Grizzlies are one of my favourites teams to watch. Bucks, Bulls and Grizzlies! (Again, I am from another country, so I feel cree to cheerish for more than one team haha)."
Man did you just read Midrange Theory? Seth literally talks about both Lopezes and Steven Adams too and hits on this exact topic…great read so far 🤓
Strongest? Steven Adams may want a word
"Correlation =/= causation. An alternative theory could be that him getting a triple double is because his team is firing on all cylinders more so than he’s carrying them to a win.   Guys are hitting shots = more assists to be had, not necessarily indicative of him creating offense more than usual. High assists can be especially useless as an indicator of offense created with how loosely assists are called in the NBA.  Team is winning the physicality battle = more rebounds to be had, we’ve all seen how Steven Adams did 90% of the work on most of his rebounds with boxing out."
"Nah, I can't stand him for constantly calling Steven Adams, Stevie."
Steven Adams too :/  got destroyed down low
It's easy to shoot 3s when 4 guys have to play help defense in the paint because Steven Adams became a sieve overnight
Is Steven Adams an overrated defender? Generally asking because I'm not super knowledgeable about his ability there. I just find it curious that he was apart of the horrible Pelicans defense last year and now it looks like the Grizziles D has fallen flat this year.
I'm looking at bball references. Can you help me explain why Steven Adams' DBPM is -1.7. But his on/off is +1.8?  Jonas Valančiūnas' DBPM and on/off are similar. What situations would cause such a big discrepancy?
Steven Adams' defensive decline really happened quickly
"Yeah, he kind of looks like a Tyler Hansborough size-wise, with much less athletic pop and actually some basketball brain. That's a problem only on defense though - he will be able to post up centers, he does OK against like Steven Adams as a 14 year old rookie, he will get some Z-Bo nastiness and do fine."
"Westbrook will always have a place in OKCs heart. He picked us up when KD left and said ""We're ok, now we do what we want. Why not?"" and proceeded to give us some of the most angry and wonderful basketball to see in person. I hope I get to shake his hand one day.  Also PG didn't have to sign with us and gave us so much by doing so, so he's alright in my book.  Also Steven Adams will always be loved in OKC"
"Steven Adams: My Life, My Fight was a great read"
"He kicked Steven Adams, not Lebron. [Lebron did it too](https://gfycat.com/serenepowerlessilladopsis), but I guess being the king comes with its perks."
Steven Adams?
All aboard the Steven adams hate train ! Choo Choo
Steven Adams 2 points in 20 mins Lmaooo
"He tanked his value, threw on court temper tantrums, and completely wasted possessions because he felt he should start over Russ. So yeah he was a piece of shit. Steven Adams wrote a chapter in his book just trashing the guy and Russ, known to be loved and get along with all his teammates, acted like he didn't exist. It goes deeper than just wanting a bigger place. He was a cancer"

"Absolutely. Even if you write off the knee stuff as just being injury prone, getting his face broken by Fultz, gastroenteritis against Toronto, getting his finger bent 90 degrees by Steven adams, and missing 3 weeks for covid is pretty shitty luck."
"The Kings have tried everything with Bagley, letting him space the floor as a PF, letting him be a small ball 5 like Trezz, letting him handle the ball and running the offense through him. The Kings have tried literally everything you can think of, so please believe that he can’t score against 2nd unit bigs with a consistent diet of low post feed and lobs.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/baglema01.html  Marvin is listed as 6’11 but only makes half his shots (49.7% Career FG%), his famous “double jump” is him grabbing his own miss most of the time. In contrast Holmes is a career 60.4% FG%, Steven Adams a 58.9% FG%."
"Fuck draymond, he is dirty asf. I’ll never forgive that bum for kicking Steven adams in the nuts so many times"
Steven Adams should not be on this list lol but I still found the post funny
It was hilarious that Draymond had auto aim on Steven adams junk for an entire series with no suspension but the moment he grazes lebrons royal package he’s suspended.
You do know there are guys in the nfl who are taller than 6’4 right and are stronger/faster/more explosive than anyone in the nba. Imagine a large influx of guys just as fast/strong/athletic as Zion joining the league.  There are linemen who are 6’5-6’8 who are faster/stronger than pretty much any center or forward in the league right now. They’d rag doll guys like Steven adams with ease.   Also who’s the fastest guy in the league right now?  If football athletes came over the basketball that player probably wouldn’t even crack the top 20 fastest players on the court anymore.   The majority of our greatest athletes go to football. Guys who are freaks in the nba are pretty much run of the mill receivers/ends/corner backs.
*Steven Adams enters the chat “Are we seriously asking how we know Draymond’s the dick punching king?”
You can throw Steven Adams in that list too. He’s not going anywhere
Nobody wants to try Steven Adams
Is Steven adams going to walk on eggshells around him?
"[CJ Williams](https://youtu.be/k5HAK8mAhSI) is the one Steven Adams went after.  Edit: Coincidentally, both Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan are in this video lol"
How do you feel about Westbrook for Ja Morant and Steven Adams?
"Stupid premise and stupid description. No one got sucker punched. It was an arm extension which happens in basically every game in this league. Difference was, the extension was more forceful than maybe even Bron intended and Stew got cut up for it. Most other nights, most other players maybe get a little mad but don't create a fuss over it. Offending player gets a flagrant or ejection and we wouldn't even be talking about it. I bet you if it was Steven Adams or AD or even Bron on the receiving end, they wouldn't be starting shit over it. They might sell the contact but that's it.   Watch more ball and you'll see what a box out is and watch a few fights and you'll know what a punch is."
"In this insta link he says he grew up a rough kid and liked to be physical (referring to basketball)... If he took up boxing at age 10 to stop getting into fights that's a pretty different thing than saying he grew up fighting random people.       Most of what I've seen from Stewart is just playing really hard and other players getting pissed about it, kind of like what used to happen with Steven Adams. But he's taking on some kind of dangerous menace legend which I don't think is warranted."
Pretty sure pat bev is gonna have cte from that fucking vicious screen steven adams set that one time
"I’m having trouble seeing any WCF other than Warriors-Suns, Warriors-Jazz, or Suns-Jazz right now personally.  Clippers missing Kawhi; Luka’s efficiency has fallen off a cliff, turning the ball over as much as ever, and now he’s been having injuries nag him; Denver was already missing half their team and now lost MPJ; Portland is never really a contender and even on top of that Dame is having a hell of a time; Lakers are looking a lot worse after the Westbrook trade and it seems like every one of the older players on their team lost a step coming into the season; I haven’t followed Memphis at all but they weren’t a contender last year and I’ve heard that their only big roster change in Steven Adams hasn’t been working out well; Timberwolves are the timberwolves; and the rest of the teams are tanking.  Meanwhile Suns are running it back from the finals without losing anyone major and are looking even better than last year, Warriors have been unstoppable, and the Jazz I included as a possibility because I haven’t followed them and they have a good record so I have no reason to think they can’t. I just really don’t see any of the 12 others winning a best of 7 series vs the suns or the warriors."
"Maybe Lebron is a dirty player, but I think it's really hard to say for sure. I mean I would trust it if an NBA player said it, but it's difficult to say as a layman cause so much of the most dirty stuff is really subtle. For example Steven Adams was on some list of most dirty NBA players (*as voted by other NBA players and coaches*) and I was a bit surprised, but it's really hard to tell the difference between an elbow to the ribs and a normal box out when you're sitting at home.  It's definitely frustrating that he gets superstar treatment on some stuff that even other superstar players wouldn't though."
"Do you watch NBA games or look just look at BBall Ref. Watch games.   Because the starters are better than the bench unit. Russ’s net rating is not solely based off of his time running with the starters whereas harden and PG played more with the starters because of Russ’s reputation as a floor raiser  Is Reggie Jackson/Andre Roberson/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Steven Adams a stacked team? No, it only through the addition of another superstar that they become stacked"
"It you want to argue that Isaiah Stewart deserves to be punched for box out shenanigans, can I introduce you to Dwight Howard? Steven Adams? And every center ever? Jesus man, get your shit together."
"11 in a nearing 20 year career...??? He'd need at least 200 imo. 10+ in a season is a pretty good indicator of a dirty player. If I remember correctly, Draymond was on a kicking marathon in 2016, the year he kicked Steven Adams in the nuts twice in the same series, elbowed THEN kicked Harden in the head and also kicked Durant and some other guys that I don't remember. He was kicking everyone lol."
"I think you'd be surprised. There are tons of cheap shots that we probably can't see due to camera angles/bodies being entangled throughout the game.   Like, with intent, a hard screen or boxing someone out can definitely injure someone significantly. Imagine if Steven Adams leaned into that screen he set on Patrick Beverly or Dame, they'd definitely be in concussion protocols after."
"Steven Adams is the consensus pick, but Isaiah Stewart grew up boxing before he started playing basketball. That might explain Lebron’s deer-in-headlights look last night."
Steven Adams would be CRUCIFIED
Where’s Steven Adams when you need him? Lol
"He is calling those flop kicks and flop punches like when he kicked Steven Adams in the nuts as ""flops."""
"It was a vicious hit that made him go insane? I mean he definitely went insane lol, that’s true. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone react the way Stewart did. Like malice in the palace was the last time I saw anything like that and we know a bit about the mental makeup of some of the people involved there. I think when people go insane after provocation it usually says more about them than it does the provocation.  We’ve seen guys get knocked the face before. I’ve seen players who try to hit people in the nuts. Steven Adams was hit so hard in the nuts he had to go to the hospital. That was intentional and dirty and he didn’t freak out. I’ve seen so many guys get jabbed in the eye on purpose before. Harden was bloodied and he didn’t freak out on dray like that at all. I’ve seen players get decked by Dwight elbows dozens of times, and I’ve never seen a reaction close to this.  Fact is, suspensions for this kind of play is very very rare. Even when dray was showing a pattern of behavior for multiple series in a row, he only got suspended from tech foul accumulations.  I find it highly doubtful lebron gets suspended for this. We see guys flail limbs under the basket all the time to make space. Imo that’s what lebron was doing- he didn’t like the way Stewart was getting under him and be swiped backwards to knock him back. He was intentionally reckless, but people calling it “vicious” are, imo, hyperbolic at best."
"Toughest in like a fighting perspective, we probably don't know because pretty much every ""fight"" in the NBA is just two people that don't know how to fight trying to look tough until it gets broken up. I would guess most of them are pretty soft.  Toughtest like strong/takes abuse, lots of centers. Not AD. Probably Steven Adams."
"In a spot for real ones, give me Steven Adams and his younger brother Aquaman"
Steven Adams is another one no one in the league would wanna attempt to mess with
I’d take Steven Adams against the field.
"James Johnson, Joel Embiid, Dwight Howard, Tyler Herro, Steven Adams"
Lakers need to pick up Steven Adams as a bodyguard each time they play Detroit now lmao.
"OKC’s picks since 2013 have been really high, by and large. We don’t know the impact of their recent and  more realistic drafting for a while. Giddey is looking very good already. Poku was a risk. But you’re not going to find value (normally) in the 20s. Even in the mid teens, often.   I’m not defending OKC’s drafting ability, only pointing out that, we haven’t seen that prowess in play for quite some time. Since they drafted their trio of MVPs, Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, that is."
"We stay down when we’re hit, esp without Dillon as we were tonight and have been most of the season. We’re missing a vet to keep us focused, literally no vets other than Steven Adams. We’ve got a toughness problem. Looking at you Jaren."
"That team had cp3, shai, gallo, dennis, and steven adams. Stacked team. They werent tanking so they werent the ""tanking thunder"". I would think this is very obvious"
"DAMN IT, STEVEN ADAMS!"
"JJJ's offense has been hit or miss to start this season, but it's interesting to note that just about every lineup Memphis has played so far is significantly better with him on the court, on both ends. Particularly in lineups featuring Steven Adams."
The title reminds me of this magnificent play:   [Two Pointer By Steven Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iknkBubBo_Y)
"Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson, and Clint Capela for the 3 pt contest"
"Surprised so many here are putting it on triple J. He wasn’t amazing to start the year, but he’s really started to put it together in the last few games.   Zach Lowe hit it on the Lowe post- he and his guest said JJJ has taken a defensive leap this year. It’s true.   He’s fouling less. He’s rebounding more. And he’s not swiping for steals like a guard, which always kept him in foul trouble.   Really great article here from a respected Memphis dude, Chris Herrington: https://dailymemphian.com/article/25377/herrington-jaren-jackson-jr-skeleton-key-unlock-grizzlies  Eye test wise, and covered in this article, Steven Adams misses a lot of defensive rotations. It might just be because he’s new to the team. And Ja is the worst defender in the league this year, so it’s a bit of a struggle with them on the floor together."
They traded vaunted defensive stalwart Jonas Valanciunas for defensive liability Steven Adams
And the extension he gave Steven Adams
He’s Steven Adams with range and good free throw shooting.
"hes way better than steven adams in that sense, that much is clear."
"The man signed Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams, on a roster that has Lonzo and Zion. He clearly doesn’t understand basketball because those moves don’t fit at all"
Steven Adams is so cool
Steven Adams was a great pickup and is one of the most reliable role players out there.
Steven Adams is probably the best center for Morant. Doesnt take a lot of shots. Plays good defense. Boxes out and lets Morant grab rebounds for fast breaks ala he did for Westbrook on OKC.
Westbrook - Brodie  Mike Muscala - Moose  Steven Adams - Funaki  Josh Giddey - The Wizard of Aus  Dort - Dort Knox  Kenrich Williams - Kenny Hustle  Gabriel Deck - Tortuga  Kevin Durant - Snek  Andre Roberson - Robes  Alex Abrines - Senor  Deonte Burton - Blockhead  Raymont Felton - Uncle Ray  Nick Collison - Mr. Thunder  Kyle Singler - The GOAT  Semaj Christon - Backwards James
"I saw mobley training with Steven Adams, was so agile and skilled I couldn’t believe his height, did they make some other changes to the roster too? Or have some of the younger players like Sexton just made a leap"

"Brooks, Brandon Clarke and Jaren all look really nice together. Particularly Brandon and Jaren.  Ja, Bane and Steven Adams are a great combo.  Slightly awkward that they don't all mesh."
"no, kyle lowry was traded for a 1st round pick.  the 1st round pick that was essentially the centerpiece of the james harden trade (that became steven adams).  forbes had nothing to do with it.  morey knew he had the decent players and good contracts to make a trade but that he would need a shiny piece of potential for any big trades.  thus he got that pick.  it was part of a years long strategy of treading water while waiting to strike on an available star, and he got his chance with harden.  morey and the raptors both got exactly what they wanted out of that trade.    as for the harden trade, you are undervaluing 22 year olds who, while having a bad finals series, just had a huge WCF and have already proven to be hyper-efficient scorers who can create for others.  that's like gold in the nba.  and you aren't supposed to trade it.  in okc, morey found a team that seemingly had to trade it for financial reasons and pounced before others could.  kevin martin was a good player 2 years before the trade, but, just as this season, the league changed how they called certain fouls that martin was the master at drawing, and his free throw attempts plummeted his last year in houston.  and so did his other numbers.  28 year old kevin martin who's career was forever altered (his PER/WS48 never recovered) is not a big thing to let go of in a trade.  3 mid-1st round picks is not a big deal to get someone with the potential of harden.  it's the classic trading of 4 quarters for a dollar.  you always do that in the nba.  even if he never became an mvp, that 66 TS% harden had his last year in okc was a huge indication that this was a young player who just needed more shot attempts to possibly reach all-star production.  it was a good trade if he just did that.  that he lived up to that and more shows why no team should ever give up a player like that without a king's ransom in return.  because sometimes mid-1st round picks turn into jeremy lamb (didn't become a starter for 6 seasons) and mitch mcgary (out of the league after 2 years)."
"yeah, or on a loose ball could you imagine if someone like LeBron or Steven Adams decided to punch the ball as hard as they could to jettison it into somebody's body? could be crazy as hell lmfao  i think i read about this rule, or was watching a video where they mentioned it as an obscure rule in the rule book that is very rarely called, if ever. so when i saw Embiid punch it, i immediately remembered that and had a little oh shit moment lmao"
Yeah Longley was the Australian Steven Adams
"Is there a stat on how many turnovers he has when robin lopez is on the floor? I definitely see him getting picked more often, i feel like ot might be that hes slowing down, but also hes dribbling more maybe? He isnt just getting to his spot to shoot, and he keeps doing bad postups. Usually he rocks back and forth for a shot or bank shot. Also it kinda feels like hes treating bryant and lopez like steven adams where he can catch it wherver and hit a flip shot"
Steven Adams? Deandre Ayton?
I liked it better when Steven Adams did it.
This is some Steven Adams type shit lol Boogie is an immovable object.
"Duncan, what does trying to get through a Steven Adams or Domantas Sabonis screen feel like?"
And then there is Steven Adams.
But is he Steven Adams strong?
And bone crunching screen assists for Steven Adams
"I legitimately think no nba player knows how to fight well. And yes, I'll include James Johnson. Dude's mma background has been deified and it's really nothing lol. Park district fighting basically (yes, I'm exaggerating).  In a random scrap I'm takin Steven Adams bar none. Full of noobs with someone who can take a punch &gt; dudes who can throw a punch."
What about Steven Adams?
"Reminds me of Willie C Stein trying to shove Steven Adams and Steven didn't move an inch, you can't move aqua man like that"
So like Steven Adams. Got it
I'd put my money on Steven Adams as well.
Steven Adams was eliminated in the first round. I get that they weren't in prison or anything but they were still stuck in a relatively small place without their normal freedoms for months.
"Tbh I really don’t think the bubble was that hard on players, obviously some players had some mental health concerns, which are justified. But like... they are staying in a resort for two months with everything catered to them around all their teammates and coworkers, plus making millions. Maybe having some therapists or counsel could help with mental health issues, but other than that how is it hard on them? It’s basically a pampered up version of sending your kid to college... I think Steven Adams said it best when he was being interviewed about how hard the bubble was on him, and he said something along the lines of “why does everyone keep acting like we’re staying in Syria? We’re getting paid to stay at a resort.”"
"""This isn't Syria mate its a fucking resort"" - Steven Adams"
I have no idea how good of a post defender he is but I'm just curious if you intentionally left Steven Adams off the list because he isn't that good or you just forgot to include him.
"I might think about agreeing to this if there is a TMZ photo of LeBron on his knees begging Adam Silver.   But on a serious note, Draymond is a fierce defender who’s developed a reputation. He kicked Steven Adams in recent memory at the time of the foul in question on LeBron, and fair or not, the refs were going to make sure they call flagrants correctly especially on dray. And that was not of Lebrons doing.. that was drays fault.   And even in the event that LeBron begged the league to upgrade the foul to flagrant, what LeBron couldn’t do is upgrade the foul to an equivalent of THREE flagrant fouls. Draymond already had 2 flagrants on his playoff foul record, and getting the 3rd got him the suspension.   If there was no penalty for accruing too many flagrant fouls during the playoffs, then players like Draymond and Rodman should just flagrant foul everyone if the games not close cus why give up a three point play and why not flagrant foul if there’s no fear of suspension"
"His uncontested rebound percentage is in the upper 80's so far this season. Pretty much every guard who racks up a lot of rebounds steals it from the rest of the team. If you look up on/off stats of most of the good rebounding guards, their teams usually have a very similar percentage rebounding rate with the player on the court compared to off but with a good rebounding center, it is usually like a good 5% difference in rate which is huge. Like so far this year the Mavs are actually better at rebounding with [Luka on the bench](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612742&amp;VsPlayerID=1629029&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) but someone like lets say [Steven Adams](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612740&amp;VsPlayerID=203500&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) he makes his team much better at rebounding when he is on compared to off despite him being someone who doesn't rack up a lot of rebounds. You can flip to other years too like Luka did actually make his team a little bit better at rebounding when he was on the court last year just over 1% better rebound%."
For Steven Adams 😁
"He's way too slow to adjust in the playoffs when the initial gameplan isn't working, some examples :  \- last year he never benched Steven Adams who was a big time liability, despite for once having good options to play small against Houston  \- 2 years ago never tried to trap Dame like everything does, or just to go small and switch with Grant at center  \- 3 years ago, waited til the second half of game 5 to bench Melo  \- 2017 waited til game 6 to try Oladipo at back up point guard despite them being murdered all year with Russ off the court"
"If we’re looking at hair/facial hair combos, give me Steven Adams"
"If Brook Lopez were in the place of Steven Adams we’d be 1-8 Rn, Adams is largely the reason we’re in close games.  The issue is that our guards aren’t providing shit atm. Ingram is the only guy on the team that can create his own offense."
Cause he had no spacing. If Brook Lopez were in the place of Steven Adams you’d really see some shit offensively.
"How bout a big stretch 5 that can set screens as well. Steven Adams for Nikola Jokic, who says no though? /s"
"That's not the point, back in the days he was a ""great when he tries, meh overall"" defender and his teams could leave with it because he played with great defenders, now he's mostly a ""meh the one possession per game he tries, horrendous overall"" and he no longer plays with Paul George, Roberson and Steven Adams but with Thomas Bryant, Ish Smith and Rui Hachimura."
"LOL. Also Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Patterson  Now that most players from past OKC teams Wiggins played against have dispersed across the league, I hope he thinks he's playing against OKC every time he sees a former OKC player on the opposing team:  * Blazers (Melo, Kanter) - current split 1-1  * Pistons (Grant) - 1-0 so far (do we play Eastern conference teams 1 more time in 2nd half of season?)  * Kings (Corey Brewer) - 1-0 so far  * Pelicans (Steven Adams)  * Wizards (Westbrook)   * Nuggets (PJ Dozier)  * Sixers (Terrance Ferguson)  * Pacers (Oladipo, Sabonis, McDermott)  * Suns (Cam Payne, CP3)  * Lakers (Schröder, Markieff Morris)  * Nets (Luwawu-Cabarott, KD) - 0-1 so far  * Knicks (Noel, Taj Gibson if they sign him)  * Bucks (DJ Augustin) - 0-1 so far"
"Who decided what is speculative. It could certainly be that ownership put it to Presti, but he could have pushed back and fought for a team that I'm not sure has ever really existed before. It's not like nobody knew what they had, either. Everyone knew what they had. That's why people trashed that trade. Also...Harden for Lamb and the picks that became Steven Adams and Mitch McGary. Jesus Christ..."
"I hate Steven Adams in 2K so much for this lmao, doesn't matter how you box the man out if Aquaman wants his rebound he's gonna go get it"
"Reporter: How are you going to fit playing along side Zion Williams?  Steven Adams:  Pretty simple, bud. Just get out of his way"
I've always thought Scary Terry was capable of dropping 60.  Miles Bridges has been a human highlight reel tonight. Sheesh. Idk how I like the Steven Adams/Zion fit. Smaller guards are gonna cook Adams if he keeps sitting back in the PnR.  Best lineup in crunch time should have Zo/JJ/Hart/Ingram/Zion.
Steven Adams must be mistaking Josh Hart for Russ now if he's pulling 7 and a half boards
"2017-18 Harden, 2016 Draymond Green, 2018 CP3, 2019 Ibaka, 2015 Iguodala  Bench: Steven Adams, Patrick Beverley, Kyle Kuzma"
"So what does Steven Adams do that none of the guys I listed can? He's pretty much exactly what you described, and he's playing 30 minutes a night."
Steven adams bouta come outta the crowd from nowhere
"Smart/2013 korver/Luka/jaylen/Amare  prime crawford/2009 diaw/steven adams off the bench   i’m gonna cheat a little and start one of the reserves, i want prime korver starting with luka and diaw off the bench to run the offense when luka sits"
Well if Steven Adams could take 3's it would help that pelicans teams spacing quite a lot.
Nah KAT needs to give a Steven adams screen to MPJ then teabag him.
'13 CP '16 Draymond Kings Boogie '14-'15 Tony Allen '15 Iggy  Lou Will '13 Korver Steven Adams  I'd like to think we'd at least be a decent challenge defensively.
-Whatever the best James Harden is  - whatever the best ginobili is -2016 Draymond  -2019 Ibaka -Best Houston Battier  -Steven Adams -Jordan Clarkson -Kuzma (FKK)
should rudy gobert or steven adams take a wide open 3? Is that a good shot?
"Whether or not they explicitly claim to be ""experts"" is irrelevant.   When you're a casual fan who only watches Lakers games, but have such strong opinions on how Steven Adams will work out in New Orleans makes them have 0 credibility.   ""As a Lakers fan, who has watched OKC play twice in my life, I'll give a detailed answer as to why NOLA trading for him is a terrible idea."" - 95% of r/nba  Almost every narrative pushed on this sub turns out to be completely wrong. These people think that saying stuff like ""Zion needs to be surrounded by shooters to succeed "" makes them a genius. This sub is like the sports version of wall street bets."
That's fucking stupid. Draymond kicked Steven Adams in the nuts clearly on purpose. He's dirty for that.
I'd do unspeakable things to have Steven Adams on the Raps rn
" I think last week they covered a game and was like ""Steven Adams led the win with 9 points and 9 rebounds. Oh some dude named Brandon Ingram also got 26 points btw"" lol"
"Steven ""7-foot Chris Paul"" Adams"
Are you implying the only thing keeping Steven Adams from getting enough assists was wesbrook?
"https://twitter.com/C2_Cooper/status/1346541964133597184?s=20  This has some helpful Team defensive numbers that I think highlight his impact on that end. As for the eye test, many others are correct in saying he isn't a ""banger"" and can be overwhelmed physically - guys like Steven Adams can overwhelm him with their size. But where Turner excels is interior help D. For instance, if Sabonis get put in a PnR and switches onto the guard/wing, Turner is really good at checking his man while also coming from the weak side which forces a tough mid-range shot or potential block at the rim."

Correct. Zo looked shook after those misses and after he got the AND-1 layup he tried to force the next 2. Correct play here to just dump it off instead of missing another shot while also getting Steven Adams his first trip double
*Was Westbrook holding back Steven Adams all along?*  I can see the headline now
Way to make a Steven Adams triple-double about Lonzo Ball lmao
I'm glad to hear that Steven Adams is the first player.
Happy Steven Adams day everyone!
Steven Adams unleashed
Bam. Steven Adams.
STEVEN ADAMS TRIPLE DOUBLE UPVOTE PARTY
"What a great day for Steven Adams, and therefor the world."
Steven Adams scored but OKC didn't get any points..
lol when did steven adams bdcome point center 🤯
"This is a historic day, Steven Adams triple double!"
# STEVEN ADAMS
So I noticed Steven Adams is bordering on a triple double.  What's that about?  edit: oh wow
"I'm not gonna say greatest game, but as for ones I've watched, LMA dropping 50+ on Steven Adams head to win the game in OT was great. i remember Derrick White getting a chasedown block on Jerami Grant who was destroying us basically to win the game. probably the most fun I've had watching a regular season game."
"as far as currency for james harden goes, he is prob &gt; steven adams (and i love kiwi steve)"
Russ in 2017 was not throwing passes to KD. He was throwing passes to Steven Adams
"Steven Adams, Victor Oladipo, Andre Roberson, and Jerami Grant is not a ""very bad team"" if you add ANY all star player"
Steven Adams litterally got a 1st and a 2 seconds  Y’all really don’t think Lowry ain’t getting 2 first?
Steven Adams got back a 1st and 2 seconds and he had a contract just as big as Lowry
"Sabonis wasn't much of a 3pt shooter until this season  OKC had Steven Adams who is a complete non-shooter, thats why they shoved Sabonis into the stretch 4 role"
"I know that, i meant like: Sabonis,Durant,Harden,Westbrook,Bledsoe,Steven Adams,Reggie Jackson, Ibaka. List goes on depending on who you value."
"Nope, we're not gonna be doing this revisionism.  ESPN's 2020-2021 preseason player rankings had Draymond Green at 44th and no other non-Curry Warrior in the top 100.  ESPN's 2016-2017 preseason player rankings had Steven Adams at 36th, Victor Oladipo at 48th, and Enes Kanter at 80th."
There was also a pick that turned into Steven Adams so it's debatable
because the Rockets FO were delusional for thinking that dumbass strat would work in the playoffs against elite bigs  That shit would work against Steven Adams not the likes of AD-Jokic tier of bigs
Steven Adams and Enes Kanter
Steven Adams   To return to NZ breakers with RJ Hampton
"Only 2 of those 12 Capela rebounds were offensive rebounds. The other 10 were on defence, so wouldn't indicate that Mitchell is bad at rebounding or something like that. It is true that Mitch box outs a lot on defence and leaves open rebounds for teammates, much as Steven Adams used to do in OKC."
"Wiseman has some ways to go but he can definitely reach ""half as good as Steven Adams"" level"
STEVEN ADAMS IS NOT CLUMSY
I was OK. I am a PG and only 5'11. I played 6 seasons until I was 24 and then had to give it up for work. My main skill was getting steals where I was top 10 in the league one year despite playing 18 mins a game. All the other guys were American imports or tall blacks (NZ national team players). Played against Steven Adams when he was 17 ha. Very Raw and very athletic.
Warriors have that one announcer who is fucking annoying. He kept calling Steven adams Stevie the whole game
Damn that Steven Adams free throw rebound was tuff
I hope JJ is going to have Steven Adams on his podcast soon
lmao imagine trying to outpower Steven Adams
Steven Adams is the fucking man. So is Brandon Ingram
"Man, maybe it's me, but Jimmy Butler is easy to like. His talk about Steven Adams still cracks me up."
Steven Adams
"RoCo, Steven Adams, Russ, Furkan Korkmaz, Clint Capela.... technically Gerald Green (FOR NOW HOPEFULLY)... Embiid, Wenyen Gabriel, Jeff Green,  K-Love, Ja, Sabonis, KAT... I think that's most of them. No specific reason just dudes I like"
I’ve also never seen Jokic yank a rebound off of a teammate lol  Russ used to box Steven Adams like they were on different teams
"Coby White, Jaxson Hayes, Devonte Graham, TJ Warren &amp; Steven Adams. (Besides the obvious must watch stars)"
"&gt; racism no doubt plays a role. Most of the players are black.  I don't see any hesitation to call white players overpaid as well - eg, Chandler Parsons, Kevin Love, Steven Adams, Mason Plumlee. Ask Celtics fans if they think Gordon Hayward's salary was worth it, or Lakers fans if they think Mozgov was overpaid.   It's just natural that in a league where most of the players are black, most of the overpaid players will also be black.   In the NFL, most of the overpaid QBs are white, and most of the overpaid WRs or CBs are black. That's because most of the total QBs are white, and most of the total WRs and CBs are black."
"Also Steven Adams who is really good, just not a guy who puts up huge box score stats."
"I don't disagree with him making the team better. Point blank he's not a super star. He's a key piece/role player. No one, and I mean no one would've paid that for him given the way the league is going small ball. 120 -150 million is fair. Steven Adams got 100 million and people shat the bed - he's not as good defensively but he's a far better two-way player with better BBall IQ and he just signed a contract worth less than his previous. So yes 200 million for Gobert is ludicrous. Paying two players on your team 70% of your cap in a small market is just dumb."
"Steven Adams, for sure."
"I'm sorry harden does not have an arguement to being better than curry. Statistically speaking curry is better at everything than harden except assisting and rebounding. And I would say curry is both a better passer and actually a better rebounder. I suppose harden is better at drawing fouls but then those dry up in the playoffs and don't affect curry as badly.   For rebounding Harden often gets the board where his bigs have boxed out and leave it for him like steven Adams did for russ. In terms of gathering loose balls/long rebounds curry is among the best in the league and averages like 7-8 rebounds in the last few finals.   And with passing if harden passes there is generally only enough time left to shoot which means harden is going to have loads of assists. But in terms of passing curry is clearly among the best in the league. His first all-star year he had 8.8 assists and the reason why that went down is because Draymond suddenly became the primary ball handler in the warriors system. It is likely if curry was the primary ball handler on a team with as much spacing as the rockets had curry would average at least 10 assists a game if not more.  In terms of dribbling I think curry's handles are as good as irvings they aren't as flashy but are just as if not more effective. 2016 finals not withstanding due to a knee issue.  In terms of finishing curry I think has the highest percentage at the rim among guards. Harden is a very good finisher just isn't curry.   Midrange shooting has so much variance but curry generally shoots anywhere between 45 and 60% on it harden can't even take a midrange shot.  3pt shooting harden has greater volume and a better stepback but curry has greater efficiency by a mile and it doesn't drop precipitously in the playoffs whether that is due to overall load or tighter and more solid schemes being more effective against harden.  Defensively harden is better on the interior but curry is a much better perimeter defender holding harden to under 40% Fg percentage in the 7 game conference finals. Curry is also a much better off ball defender and is very good at disrupting the passing lanes.  Harden is a great player but he isn't in that tier 1/2 of players. Depending on whether you count lebron as his own tier.  I.e Lebron (Tier 1 guy in terms of winning basketball)   KD, Kawhi, Steph (Number one option on championship team)   Harden, Giannis etc. (Number one option on very good teams - perennial mvp candidates)   Dame, Kyrie etc. (Number 2 option on championship teams, all-nba candidate serious exploitable flaws or no top tier talent in one area maybe just great at lots of things not elite at anything Pandemic P might be a good example although his defence is borderline elite)  From their it is a 2/3 guy with elite D with flaws then borderline all-stars then high end role players (maybe more tiers in between to separate players like wiggins out from CJ Mccollum with CJ being a true bordline all-star and Wiggins being better than a role player)  Some players are awkward to add. Specifically someone like AD who clearly has the talent to be in those top 3 categories but his teams don't really win (lebron not withstanding) he is probably a borderline tier 3/4 guy for me just because his teams haven't really had that much success with him being that guy."
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
Rebounds that lead to breaks are always ok. But I’m referring to the free throw miss rebounds and all the ones Steven adams gave up to Russ for him to average a TD
"Russ and KD playing team ball put the Spurs to bed, and led to the 3-1 lead. I was convinced we were done. That and the front court of young Steven Adams and Iblocka, as well as a historical offensive performance by Roberson along w/ his usual lockdown defense and Kanter off the bench had me in fits. Will never forget game 6 Klay."
"Pelicans are for sure struggling. Steven Adams still hasn't learned to step up on ball screens, and Bledsoe just doesn't fit with these guys. They should trade lonzo,  they got him playing mostly off the ball, I don't think he excels in that role. BI and zion are the only bright spots so far this season."
"Last night, I saw both Steven Adams and Gobert moving laterally while screening, and keeping their hands on the defender they screened, multiple times. It looked exactly like offensive linemen."
"He was drafted in 2006 but didn't start playing like a star until like January of the 2013-2014 season (his 8th in the league).   That's not to say he wasn't good before. He was definitely a pretty good player, just not close to the top 20ish guy he has been for the past several seasons. He was good enough that the Raptors traded what would be the 12th pick in the 2013 draft for him (the Rockets then traded that pick to OKC for Harden - it became Steven Adams). Also think he used to have pretty bad attitude issues before he got to Toronto.   Also, anyone used to go on the Daily Dime Live chats on ESPN hosted by Zach Harper (this was like the really early '10s)? KLOE."
Steven Adams
Everyone going to act like Steven Adams isn't a starting Center in the league? Shaq would be fine.
What was Shaq’s perimeter defense like? I can’t imagine there was a legitimate sample size of him guarding bigs at the perimeter but I’m sure there’s some examples.   I also wonder if Shaq in today’s game would be forced to slim down / stay at his Orlando Magic size. Not really many tanks beyond the sheer strength of a guy like Steven Adams.
Steven Adams vs McGregor go!

"They should have kept George Hill he was a good fit.  In my opinion a center like Steven Adams is not worth much more than a minimum in the current NBA.   Adams get's abused by good teams defensively, he can't even hit his free throws and clogs the paint.   He probably helps the pelicans against bad teams but he lowers their ceiling against good teams."
"as much as I like Steven Adams, he brings almost nothing to the offense. he can’t pass, can’t shoot, can’t dribble, and can’t finish.      All he’s good for is setting screens and rebounding, but those skills aren’t very useful when the Pels have no shooters lol"
Ok and now how could we afford him? We could only offer the same thing the Clippers did and LA market &gt; NOLA market for endorsements.   This isn't 2k where we can just sign who we want. We were up against the cap even if we don't take on Steven Adams. Still just about 7 mil shy of it. Who were we getting for 7 mil or the MLE that didn't want to ring chase elsewhere?
You mean when he was given his 15th tech after yelling at the refs when he was upset he got called for kicking Steven adams in the nuts?
How do you play pace and space with Steven Adams and Bledsoe clogging the lanes lol?  Griffin is to blame for this roster and bad start.
You forgot about Steven Adams and Zion. The roster does not have a lot of shooting. David Griffin deserves  a lot more blame than SVG. They traded for Steven Adams and extended him for 2 years which was dumbfounding the moment it happened.
They’re just bad. They shoot badly from the 3 and allow the most 3pm in the league. In today’s 3pt shooting age that’s not going to win games. Their defense as a whole isn’t great either. They are a disappointment but i think it’s not wholly unexpected. That trade for bledsoe was horrible. It eliminated basically all of their spacing. They can be better but i don’t know how they’re going to fix all their problems. First they need to start defending the 3. Stop the steven adams drop coverage on screens.
"Its not great. Bad sign when in 2020 a coach thinks his personal philosophy and style override the best philosophy and style for the key players on the team. Should go coach a college team if he wants to impose his philosophy. He has Bledsoe, Ingram, Zion, Lonzo on his team and he's playing to Steven Adams strengths."
I'd pay big money to have beer and wings with Steven Adams. Big fan of the guy
"On/off is how the team does when you are on the court compared to off (ie on the bench). For example if you have a net rating of +3.0 this is really good, but if your team has a net rating of +5.0 when you aren't on the court than this means your team statistically did better with you off the court. It is good for gauging players on bad teams. For example, Khris Middleton was on some bad teams early in his career in Detroit and those early Bucks teams before Giannis broke out. He always made his team better and had really good on/off which shows that even those he was on a bad team, he made that bad team a fair bit better.  It isn't just good for net rating, it is also good for rebounds. There are players like Luka Doncic or pretty much every other high rebounding guard in the NBA that gobble up a bunch of uncontested rebound but barely influence their teams rebounding. If you compare that to Steven Adams who averages less rebounds but makes his team significantly better at rebounds you can see that Steven Adams is a great player to have on the court in terms of rebounding.  On/off biggest advantage is that it takes into account how your team plays compared to with you and without you as in the end, team performance is all that matter. This is also its biggest disadvantage though so it can be influenced by small sample sizes and noise or if you have a really good player on your bench (for example Jaren Jackson Jr's on/off is pretty bad since they got Brandon Clarke)."
"I agree, their GM needs to be called out. Trading for Steven Adams to pair with Zion Williamson who can’t shoot outside of 5 feet was one of the strangest moves I’ve seen. He got lucky the Bucks were in desperation mode and gave up a lot for Holliday, If they really wanted to compete this year they should have kept him. He had 2 years left on his deal. 29 year old sub All Star who is an excellent defender, I’d keep him over some late first round draft picks."
"I love Steven Adams, but man, it's odd to think that the Pelicans wouldn't have been better holding out or making a trade at that point with the Nets for Jared Allen."
love the Steven Adams pat on the back of encouragement
"[Here a photo of him standing next to Chris Paul (and other OKC players)](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/steven-adams-terrance-ferguson-dennis-schroder-chris-paul-danilo-picture-id1172916484)  I think Schroder is 6', he looks about the same height as CP3 give or take 1-2cm?"
Same thing happened with Steven Adams lmfao. Some guys will get a little hate even if they don’t do anything wrong.
Steven Adams arrives and tells him funny jokes in his funny accent.
"I always get downvoted for saying whacky trades, but there are 2 glaring issues with the Nets now.  Perimeter Defense and Interior Defense.  They should explore trading Kyrie for a Defensive-Minded PG and a Interior Big.  Kyrie should be explored for a package like Steven Adams and Lonzo.    With Lonzos defensive ability, and maybe having some pressure off him playing with KD and Harden - I think he could thrive in a system like that.  Maybe if they can get Dinwiddie back soon too.    Steven Adams should be involved as well.  He will be the true interior defender they will need to go up against some of the bigger players in the East.  This trade should work w/ money."
"PG: 2018 Harden SG: Bradley Beal SF: 2008 Shane Battier PF: Pascal Siakam C: 2011-12 Tyson Chandler  Bench: Terry Rozier, 2013 Korver, Steven Adams  Harden and Beal can both play with or without the ball, score a ton, and run PnR with DPOY Chandler. Battier’s a great 3 and D wing, and Siakam fits well as the 3rd scoring option. Off the bench, Rozier is the 6th man, Korver adds another shooter, and Adams provides extra size/defense."
"He just didn’t really have the energy, barely left the floor or boxed out hard. I mean I get not everyone can be Steven Adams level of energy but there were some rumors on the subreddit that he was playing hurt for stretches"
"Christian Wood is definitely a shooter, 36% on near 5 attempts a game is pretty good for a big man. And we certainly do have a problem with guys not hitting shots, and Christian Wood would definitely help with that as opposed to Steven Adams. To say he fixes nothing is just plain wrong, he's been great this season on the Rockets."
"Absolutely, with an honorable to his college side-kick and Alpha version of Steven Adams, Nick “the pick” Collison"
"INGRAM'S DRIVE AND willingness to be coached date to the days and late nights he spent with his father, Donald, who played growing up and helped run the Martin C. Freeman Recreation Center in Kinston. After hours, Donald Ingram kept the center open for Ingram and his friends.  Ingram's father viewed his son's game as representing both his family and the rec center. ""He wasn't gonna be a sorry player, or an unskilled player,"" Donald Ingram said. ""I saw a lot of players caught up in fancy dribbling and 'AND1' basketball. I wasn't having that.""  They spent evenings working on dribbling and passing, sometimes using Brandon Ingram's friends as defenders and cutters. Ingram never asked for a day off.  Perhaps Ingram internalized the example of two working parents. For 23 years, Donald Ingram awoke before 4 a.m. to arrive early at the Crown Equipment Corporation forklift plant in Kinston. He got home shortly after 3 p.m., dozed in his recliner, and opened the rec center at 5 p.m. -- where he remained until at least 9 p.m. Editor's Picks      Lowe: Answering the massive questions driving this James Harden trade     Lowe's 10 things: Awesome Lakers, Zion boards and Dort (!)  At the rec center, Brandon Ingram played against men who tried to bully the skinny kid. On defense, Donald would rest his forearm on Ingram's waist, preventing him from moving forward. He demanded his son push back. ""Don't let nobody guide you with the ball!""  Donald Ingram played in various leagues against a younger Jerry Stackhouse, who became Brandon Ingram's AAU coach in Kinston and one of his mentors. During a gathering at Stackhouse's mother's home, Stackhouse challenged Ingram -- then around 12 or 13 -- to one-on-one. When Ingram got the ball, Stackhouse grabbed his off arm with both hands. ""You're not gonna let me hold you, are you?"" he asked. Ten seconds passed, maybe 20. ""Get my damn hands off you!"" Finally Ingram wrenched them off.  In Stackhouse's memory, they did not play one-on-one again until Ingram's senior year. ""He really came at me,"" Stackhouse said, ""and I knew he was ready.""  ""I don't think he wanted anymore smoke after that,"" Ingram said.  As Ingram's star rose at Kinston and on the AAU circuit, teammates and coaches admired how unselfish he remained.  ""He always made the right play,"" said Darnell Dunn, Ingram's teammate at Kinston and on Stackhouse's AAU team.  ""Everyone knew how talented he was,"" Stackhouse said. ""They were happy to say, 'You do you.' But he ain't the 'do you' type. He would hit the open man and know the ball might come back to him.""  The Pelicans have noticed more of that this season. Ingram is making simple plays to keep the offense moving. When defenses trap him, he slips the ball to Steven Adams:  When defenses ignore New Orleans' shaky shooters, Ingram kicks them the ball, confident they will exploit open space. Sometimes, the ball comes back to him -- just as it did in AAU:  ""He's making the right play, and that gets to be contagious,"" Van Gundy said.  In past seasons, Ingram would sometimes either miss simple passes or decline them. He often requested the Pelicans video crew send him compilations of passes he should have made but didn't.  ""The guy watches more film than any player I've been around except maybe Chris Paul,"" Redick said.  He might spot himself settling for midrangers or picking up his dribble when one more bounce would have unlocked something better -- a drop-off to Williamson, or a crosscourt pass for a corner 3.  The dilemma for New Orleans is that Ingram is both their best creator and the best shooter in their starting five. That means the Pelicans sometimes use him as a floor-spacer. It also means many Ingram kickouts go to below-average 3-point shooters.  ""It's my responsibility to have guys out there that can finish those plays,"" Van Gundy said.  If anything, there are possessions where it might be better for Ingram to force it. He has mostly demurred. ""I like his balance so far,"" Van Gundy said. ""You don't want someone who is just looking to pass, but you also don't want a pig.""  Ingram has become a more confident and polished finisher around the basket -- a prolific producer of free throws. Something clicked in the 2018-19 season, his rumor-filled final year with the Lakers, and the development accelerated in New Orleans. Ingram mastered his footwork -- when to use choppy steps in tight creases, and when to gobble up space with loping strides. He finally seemed to understand how long his arms are -- that he was on top of the rim sooner than he had perceived."
Steven Adams is in the single digits for career PPG. The argument for why Greg Oden would not be Steven Adams is just too obvious to make.
You said Oden would be Steven Adams and you're shitting on me????? Lmfao maybe you need to stop relying on 2k to tell you what Greg Oden got up to
"Ok so firstly, No team is ever off to a bad start when building around a guy like Zion when you already have a 23 yo all-star next to him now locked up for 5 years.   Steven Adams has literally been the least of our issues, probably our most consistent player, the extension was a little on the high side but for a guy who is a legit part of what you're trying to build then that's fine. Zion doesn't need a stretch 5, what he does need is consistency from our guards and perhaps a lengthy 3&amp;D forward off the bench which would allow him to play as a small ball 5 at a pinch, also you dont get a better rebounder than Steven Adams really lol.  Jax, even though I didnt like the pick at the time was always a project, bigs take years to develop, I hope it's the same with him. NAW has shown flashes, and at times looks like a legit guard that can play alongside BI and Zion. Kira has been actually pretty good in very limited minutes, we need to do something with the veteran guards+Lonzo to allow him more minutes but that'll come in time, but you can make the argument that all those picks haven't contributed quickly or weren't the right picks.  There is literally nothing in common with those AD/Jrue teams, those teams had zero assets, no real hope long-term, were constantly having band-aids thrown on them and just in general were always staring down the barrel of AD moving on. This team already has 2 young all-stars, 3 lotto tickets and like 15 draft picks that can be shifted for any sort of help."

"Oh you don’t see how a guy with a three-year career that never attempted a single shot within five feet of the arc would have an issue adapting? Embiid’s average shot distance is &gt;4x Oden’s. Not everyone can magically find range. Greg would be Steven Adams, not fucking Joel Embiid who is just shy of 40% from deep on the year. What even is this discussion jfc..."
"To be fair, Karl was a 15th pick, the team's #1 option was Adrian Dantley who was a forward and averaged 30 points per game, and the team had Thurl Bailey at PF who had a great year the year before, so Malone had to share minutes with him at the PF while Dantley was basically on the floor the entire game at SF. This was also a time when in the NBA when you always had a centre on the floor and would never put Malone at the 5. If Malone had the opportunity to play 40 minutes as a rookie, he would have, and I doubt he would have been gassed after 30. As soon as Dantley left, the jazz moved Bailey to the 3 and Malone basically averaged 40 min per season for the next 15 years.  Contrast that with Zion - an ultra-hyped #1 pick who can play the 3, 4 or 5 in today's NBA and has to share frontcourt minutes at 3 positions with Ingram, Steven Adams and..... Nicolo Melli???..... Hernangomez?????.......Jaxson Hayes?????????  Seriously, we're talking 144 possible frontcourt minutes per game at his position(s), and Zion Williamson, the league's most hyped prospect in a decade is averaging playing only 22.5% of them while sharing them with Ingram, Adams, Melli, Hernangomez and Jaxson Hayes. Does that make sense to anyone on paper?  The reality is, he frequently look totally gassed after being on the floor for 5 minutes, so it makes sense that he's only getting 30 minutes per game."
"That was one of the worst moves of the entire offseason. They gave up a 1st rounder and 2 2nd rounders and than gave him a 2 year extension for $35 million. Everything about that transaction was terrible. There's absolutely no reason you should give up 3 draft picks for a player like Steven Adams, idk what David Griffin was thinking"
Clicked on this hoping for a Steven Adams touchdown pass. Got a little too excited when it happened.
"Kyrie for Steven adams, lonzo, and Bledsoe, who says no"
Steven Adams to take over for Brees next season?
Steven Adams quite productive
I don’t know how much longer they can start Steven Adams with Zion out there
If only Philly had traded for Steven Adams instead of Danny Green.
"I agree, he's definitely starter quality but I feel he would be the best sixth man in the league and it would let the Pels operate at full strength. Having lonzo, beldsoe, AND Steven Adams ruins spacing for Zion"
"yeah that's pretty weak by comparison tbh, and he follows it up by doing the 'hold me back bro' glaring behind officials, bitchass  Steven Adams throws the [and I barely even noticed you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc) turn straight back to play, because he doesn't have to fake it that he's tough."
"Yeah, because that’s where the pels sent him to in exchange for Steven Adams."
&gt; steven adams jump ball percentage  Apreciate you!
"google ""steven adams jump ball percentage"""
"If I'm the Nets I'd trade Kyrie for more complementary pieces to stick around KD and Harden. Nets could use an upgrade from Deandre Jordan and another shooter wouldn't be a bad idea either.  Not sure a good fit in terms of destination team though. Maybe something like JJ Reddick and Steven Adams for Kyrie?  Even then, idk."
"Zion's not actually with much fat.  Most of his build is muscular bulk.  If he's ""fat"" at all, he's almost what they call ""strong-fat,"" except that he actually has muscular definition.  Dude just big with strength.   Sorta like how his now-teammate Steven Adams is just big and strong. Not really fat at all. Just...big."
He cannot defend Steven Adams or Enes Kanter but he can shut down the pick n roll fine   https://section215.com/2019/02/23/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-center/
"Jaren plays on the perimeter / outside the paint throughout the game. Plus, there's no need for him to rebound because Jonas is on the floor with him, and he can run in transition where he's deadly. If you want rebounding, you look towards static paint bigs, like Deandre Ayton or Steven Adams, but Jaren is a mobile four who runs the court as a perimeter threat, and goes for blocks and loose balls due to the Grizzlies' 2 big lineup with Jonas. He'll learn to stop fouling, but he can rebound and defend well. Just watch the games (which I assume you don't) to look at his impact, instead of relying on statistics which often don't tell the whole story, because if we relied on statistics, Steph Curry right now is an inefficient chucker and offensive liability."
"From my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/khpv2o/official_rnba_power_rankings_0_tis_the_season/ggmifdg/) on the pre-season rankings:   &gt; Could we get some explanations for (I don't want to criticize/roast, just seeking some rationale):  &gt; Nets at 15 and Wizards at 27? /u/ BigEarl139  &gt; Could two teams with two all-star level talents and solid supporting casts be as low as they are? Russell Westbrook is one of the biggest floor-raisers in the NBA. Surely they're better than more than three teams. Nets have a team mostly intact from last year and they're adding KD/Kyrie. If either gets injured, then 15 is very natural, but with both they should be at least slightly better, no?  I have to owe /u/BigEarl139 a retroactive apology, because Wizards at 27 is nearly spot-on with how they look this season. Nets at 15 was ambitiously low though, even before Harden's arrival (though if Kyrie missed more games due to being Kyrie, maybe?).   &gt; Thunder at 15? /u/ S9lo  &gt; EDIT: I see you put Wizards at 14, Thunder at 15, and Jazz at 16. Can I have what you're smoking?  &gt; EDIT2: Also, you ranked, in order, Lakers, Clippers, six Eastern teams (Boston, Milwaukee, Miami, Brooklyn, Philly, Toronto), then Denver, Phoenix, Portland, Houston, Dallas. First, is the gap that wide between Clippers and the rest of the West that all six Eastern teams fit? Second, do you really believe Dallas is worse than Phoenix, Portland, and Houston?  &gt; They lost Chris Paul, Steven Adams, and Danilo Gallinari. They're starting SGA/Dort/Bazley/Ariza/Horford with an uninspiring bench. That's not a terrible team (a la process Sixers or some expansion Hornets teams), but it sounds like you're expecting major overperformances from their players.   Wizards at 14, Thunder 15, and Jazz at 16 is still ludicrous. I'm homer-ing here, but the sheer ordering of those teams caused me indignation.  Also, though the Mavs remain worse than Phoenix and Portland on the power rankings, I expect that to change. They should at least pass Portland (Blazers bros, I feel for you and losing Nurkic to injury is super painful). However, I do acknowledge that would be difficult to predict.  &gt; Pacers at 24 and Warriors at 29? /u/ Bird_and_Dog  &gt; No comment.  Still no comment. (The Warriors did start off slow, but 29th in the league slow? That was a stretch for sure. And the Pacers were at least mediocre and a solid playoff last season and lost practically no one. To slot them at 24 was disrespecting their core players, not to mention they're now missing LeVert and Lamb.)"
Lol. He gotta pair up with Steven Adams.
"Hell yeah pelicans will be. Zion , my boy ingram , Josh hart , steven adams. Y'all good"
"There's only like a handful of those centers in the entire league - Embiid, Drummond, Jokic. Steven Adams and Gobert as well but those guys are not offensive forces."
Steven adams and naw
"Not sure why you think Dwight is near some of these other guys.  Harrell was 6th man of the year last year, literally the best non-starter in the league.  Ibaka scores more, still plays good defense, and can stretch the floor, I think he's clearly more valuable than Howard. If we could swap them I'd do that in a heartbeat.  Steven Adams is a starter who does pretty much everything you'd expect from a starting center. Not flashy, but he gets the job done.  Howard might be closer to Lopez and Thompson, who aren't all that special and play similar roles. I just think those guys might just be getting overpaid when they actually should be minimum level guys, rather than Howard underpaid."
"Tristan Thompson, Montrezl Harrell, Serge Ibaka got paid 9m/yr each. Robin Lopez got 7m. Steven Adams got a 2 years extension for 17m/yr. And those were in the same free agency. Sure, Dwight's injury history and past locker room history might hurt his value a little but I would assume that he's worth at least the same as some of the names on this list"
Steven Adams.  Paying 27 million for a semi above average traditional center is a huge overpay.
Myers Leonard  Bogdon Bogdonovic   Steven Adams
"He never got steven adams to be an aggressive scorer, adams actually has a lot of offensive skills but he’s been basically regressing or staying at his exact level from 2016. He didn’t stop Russ from jacking up threes, which Dantoni was able to do in Houston. He let Carmelo’s ego take precedence over grant outperforming him, and in the Utah series where the Jazz’s two center lineups were killing us, he let Carmelo (who’s really a small forward) get eaten alive defensively at PF rather than put in grant or any other big who could have put up a fight against favors."
"They need another center too, go after Steven Adams."
I don’t keep up with him but I’d assume Steven Adams
Current:  \-Giannis  \-Ja  \-Westbrook  \-Lebron  \-Gobert  \- Steven Adams
"maybe 2 or 3. Assuming you kept KD, HARDEn, Ibaka, Steven Adams, then whoever WB was a star at that time so he would have gotten you a bigger package than what OKC got for Harden."
Yea so they'll trade firsts for Steven adams
I wish people kept this energy with Westbrook and Steven adams
I think griff is doing a good job overall but the steven adams trade + extension was perplexing to say the least
the steven adams gravity 😍
I know they don't have any other options but it's pretty clear that Zion and Steven Adams on the floor together ain't really a good fit
Kuz with 12 boards against Steven Adams…
Is there a player more allergic to scoring than Steven adams
Steven Adams and LeBron would be nasty.
Steven Adams is one of the few players (or human beings frankly) that I think could beat Lebron’s ass. Dude is a 7 foot jacked Aussie
It's really weird seeing Steven Adams not in a Thunder uniform
Who do we have in a no holds barred fight: Bron or Steven Adams?
Out of all the players lebron has played with in his career he should be scared of steven adams?   Lol
Steven Adams by knockout
Why is LeBron beefing with Steven adams of all people
Feel kinda bad for steven adams. Hes in young team purgatory
Willie is going for the really skinny Steven Adams look
"You are a sucker for the stat and have completely removed the context. Teams would rather have Steven Adams, even though he doesnt get rebounds himself, his team always rebound better when he is on the floor (yes even without Westbrook)."
"Steven Adams (Polynesian/White), Yuta Watanabe, Jeremy Lin, both Lopez's off the top of my head"
"Meanwhile, Steven Adams: I got me a worm farm, mate"
The Pelicans just for Steven Adams content.
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
"He is good, but some of those stats are pretty empty. Its hard to watch Steven Adams give up a super easy rebound so Russ can pump up this numbers.  Unless he changes up his style of play, he will have absolutely no shot of winning an NBA title.   If you are making a championship team, and you have to pick either CJ or Westbrook (just looking at their last 3 seasons), are you telling me you would have Westbrook?"
Steven Adams stunted Sabonis. We drafted him and played him out of position. Weird how that’s russ’ fault
Steven adams tho
Hopefully it was like Steven adams too. This guy would be shooting from a wheel chair
"Defense on the NBA is so much tougher. Teams spam the P&amp;R in the NBA while they sometimes barely run it in college, so you need to learn how to get over or around screens (imagine doing that against players like Steven Adams). There's so much more spacing in the NBA, so you need to adapt to how you help off your man and how to rotate when teams switch their schemes. Additionally, you are now playing against the best and most athletic men in the world - not 20 year olds."
This tone deaf comment makes me appreciate Steven Adams even more and I didn’t think that was possible.
Steven Adams is so bad now it's hard to watch.
I like the Steven Adams one
Guess Steven Adams left him the secret codes.
those steven adams screens still deadly
And meanwhile in New Orleans Steven Adams is still being a BRICK FREAKING WALL setting picks for Zion
Steven Adams to LeBron: This is not Chinese interment camps mate. It's not that hard... we're living in a bloody resort.
"They are not as bad as everyone thinks they are. I remember getting roasted when I said OKC would still be a playoff team with CP3 SGA, Steven Adams and Danillo.   There are many on the subreddit that think the only valuable thing is scoring and statistics. I think Dipo gets these guy to the playoffs if Wall and Cousins are healthy especially with the emergence of Woods.  He is a much better fit playing with those guys and plays above the rim. Wall and Dipo will play well together offensively.  Much better than him and Harden.  Dipo is also a much better defender than Harden, and they still have a 6th man candidate in Eric Gordon."
Look at a pic of rookie Steven Adams and then look at current Steven Adams
What ? Steven Adams weighed more as a College Freshman than he does right now. He said the same on the JJ Reddick podcast from 2 weeks ago. And I don't think KD seems like a very good example too. The simple truth is that weight in the NBA just doesn't usually matter.
was this before or after he injured Westbrook? steven adams must've jumped up westbrook's list of favorite teammates quite a few places if this was after the injury lol
Adams is so strong man jesus. I remember WCS and Westbrook get into a spat one time and Steven Adams just casually moves him out of the way lmao.
"RAPTOR has its own problems, but it's much, much less shitty than RPM, which doesn't even seem to be able to vaguely ballpark players.  This is a stat that also has Draymond as a decent but unexceptional defender in 2016 lol. It pins Steven Adams as the league's best defender that year"
Love me some Steven Adams screen highlights!
"But instead of Steven Adams it's a truck, and instead of a screen, he gets ran over."
"Yeah you really can't because you are really just hurting yourself because they are just standing still.   I remember hitting people with hard screens when I played in Jr High. Obviously I'm no Steven Adams but I was bigger than most people my age and setting hard screens was one of my favorite things since I wasn't very good at scoring lol. Never obliterated anyone like Adams did to Bev, but gave out some hard ones that shook up the defender a bit."
"Westbrook to Steven Adams probably: ""Good Shit"""
Or like Steven Adams
"&gt; GOOD HARD SCREEN BY STEVEN ADAMS PAT BEV GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM 🤣🤣🤣  This actually much different. Pat Bev does initiate contact and runs into Adams. You could say that Adams leans in a little, but not really that much.  On this play for Beverley, he comes from behind and initiates the contact with extra force. It's not dirty as much more illegal than Adams does here."
Shoutout Steven Adams for this
Steven Adams already roughed him up a bit:  https://youtu.be/-y3m0te_Tdc
Steven Adams sets hard screens. Patrick Beverly attacks people. Big difference.
"It wasn’t a technical just for the Jersey being untucked. The timberwolves had gotten two delay of games violations in that game which gave them a technical. If you don’t like the rule fair enough but that’s an issue with the league and Adam silver not CP3.   IMO it was a brilliant way to finish regulation of a game because it showed how well CP3 knows and understands the game, it showed how much OKC wanted to win. Also the Steven Adams touchdown inbound pass to Schröder to take the game to OT was amazing"
"75% scale Steven Adams, but with a 40inch vertical"
r/NBA : ANOTHER DIRTY PLAY BY DIRTY ASS PAT BEV FUCK HIM  Also r/NBA : [GOOD HARD SCREEN BY STEVEN ADAMS PAT BEV GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM 🤣🤣🤣](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc)
"Steven Adams, Zion, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram, JJ Reddick(big reach lol), Hayes vs KAT, D’lo, Beasley, Edwards, Rubio, Culver were sitting at 6 a piece"
Brooklyn should've got Steven Adams to lay Bev's ass out again...
Adams would be my first guess for straight up strongest in the league... the issue is all the other strongest players in the league are all 4-6 inches taller than zion...  Also zion vs Adams is a total mismatch for Steven..  ridiculous
"still feels bizarre seeing Thunder games without Steven Adams. dude was my favorite player to watch whenever we matched up, thought he'd be with the franchise for a long time"
"Shot selection is fine, this year he’s playing with no spacing and his shooting splits are very efficient. The one game where Melli, a three point shooter, replace Steven Adams, he shoots 50% from the field 41% from three and perfect from the line"
Steven Adams is injured so didn't play. The backup centre (Hernangomez) and the backup backup centre (Hayes) were playing badly so he threw Melli in and they started coming back so rode with him.
Got that Steven Adams strength but has actual scoring ability
Yeah Steven Adams is a terrible HC
"Yes, I agree. Fire Steven adams"
Wtf did Steven Adams do
when luka drops 50 on boston on tuesday and they go below .500 steven adams should be fired
"I mean Hart has Zion, Steven Adams, and Ingram all going to for boards. Turner has never grabbed rebounds"
man nobody is even giving an answer lol. just their opinion on steven adams
This is why SVG gave Steven Adams his $35 mil love it or hate can’t run his defense with that kind of resistance at the rim
"You're right about that. I think it's why people like Steven Adams so much. He's the most down-to-earth player in the league by a mile. Of course he's also funny and his New Zealand flair is also endearing, but he's one of the few guys you get the impression that he's just a normal guy that doesn't think of himself as some sort of god just because he plays in the NBA."
"The extension saved OKC from having to match his contract in restricted free agency(it likely would have been a pay raise) It meant they could retain Steven Adams. Furthermore, he was 100% worth that contract based on stats. Not the basic stats, the advanced stats. That year, he was 7th in ts%, top 5 in offensive efficiency, top 10 in shot contests within 3point line, top 15 in screen assists that year, and signing that deal had a similar effect on Giannis and CJ, granted those two became all stars eventually.   You have to remember that he was a cornerstone in that OKC team as well."
"Hey, hey don’t disrespect my man Steven Adams like that. His extension saved OKC so that they didn’t have to match any Max-deal offers(which he probably wouldn’t have gotten but he’d definitely have gotten a pay raise) and it cemented him for the next 4 years. Those were fairly good times.   Also Michael Jordan has made waaay more than “a few” mistakes, like drafting Kwame Brown, trading for DeSagana Diop, trading Emeka Okafor for Tyson Chandler, the list goes on."
"tbf every GM has made mistakes when it comes to contracts lol, its just a bet you make on a player's potential. Hassan Whiteside at 100 mil/4 yrs for Pat Riley, Steven Adams at 100 mil/4 yrs for Sam Presti, Ryan Anderson at 80 mil/4 yrs for Daryl Morey, etc some of the best executives in the NBA have gotten it wrong a few times"
Steven adams gets destroyed on the pick and roll
When he is on the bench they are about the same level at getting the rebound. Compare this to someone like Steven Adams who has never averaged double digit rebounds but his team usually has a 5% better rebounding rate which is huge. &gt;75% of Lukas rebounding aren't even contested.
Steven Adams in shambles
"David Griffin constructed an ill roster. I think SVG has the right ideas wanting to make them defensive minded, but most of the personnel just isn’t there or does it consistently. JJ Redick looks like a shell of himself. Lonzo’s not exactly a beacon of consistency. Zion is still learning when to insert himself especially in crunch time. Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe are just questionable fits too.   They need trades"
Trez is such a beast. I wish Steven Adams could play Trez’ Style of ball.
Poor Steven adams
They also have Steven Adams who is definitely a winning player. Brandon Ingram seems to be pretty good too.
Shorter Steven Adams
"Steven Adams was the anchor of our interior defense for years and, relative to his size, he sucked at blocking shots"
idk about that one Steven Adams couldn't say mate without his voice cracking for the rest of the night
"Yeah, sure, but apart from that...  Honestly think they'd be in Playoff contention right now if they'd just kept the same team from last year. Jrue Holiday is such a glaring omission and, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Steven Adams as a player and a dude but his fit on this team is just weird."
"DeAndre Jordan getting all-NBA is the biggest joke in NBA history, in his prime he wouldn't be any better than Steven Adams today"
Poor Steven Adams always getting blamed for Pels problems
"They’re committing to Zion as perimeter defender rather than a paint defender, which is a good idea. Stephen Adams specifically, not a good idea.  Edit: Steven"
Give us Steven Adams tbh
No Steven Adams tonight... this should get interesting.
Dame  Jaylen Brown  Bogdan Bogdanovic (definitely butchered his name) OG Anunoby or Pascal Siakam  Steven Adams
"- Offer Harris for Myles Turner and pray the Pacers accept it, throw in Shamet to sweeten the deal  - Not an elite rim protector, but Lamarcus Aldridge is at least a big body they can throw in the paint and can be got for Harris + filler  - Bucks fans have been wanting to trade Brook Lopez, it’s possible they can make a run at him  - Also not elite, but a deal with Steven Adams might benefit both teams  Just to spitball a few names. I may have exaggerated the amount of true elite rim protectors on the market, but they definitely need a big body when their main competition in the east are Embiid and Giannis"
 https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/27/steven-adams-named-one-of-the-9-dirtiest-players-in-nba-by-complex/
"Hmm I’d have to go with Steven Adams. Honestly never seen a single person, irl or online, to ever say a negative thing about him. And he has never done or said anything that could be considered controversial by anybody on or off the court"
&gt; karate kicked Steven Adams in the balls  Twice!
"Replace him with anyone and the Jazz doesn't work the way that they're currently configured. Domas is about on Rudy's level as  a screen setter, but he can't roll the same way that Rudy can. AD is a great lob catcher and finisher., potentially the best ever, but he's not the same active screener, and while he's perceived as more switchable 1-5 than Gobert, he's not as impactful defensively. Joel is a great paint patroller when he's locked in, but he's never had the level of consistent focus and effort, and he's never been as active off ball as Rudy on the offensive end. I guess the closest comp for Rudy as a player in the NBA is like, a better versio of Myles Turner's, a better (and healthier) version of Clint Capela's lob game, and the offensive screening activity of Steven Adams, except instead of just being ""borderline elite"" at those things, he's like, top two in the league in all of them. No other player in the NBA can lay claim to being that skilled in all three areas. Full stop. The only player he's really comparable to in all of NBA history in terms of his skillset and his proficiency in those skills is Dikembe Mutombo. He'll go down as one of the all-time five best defensive players in NBA history.  Mitchell is good. Like, *really good*. His stats don't show it because he's really unselfish in a system that doesn't rack up a ton of assists, but he's an elite scorer and an elite passer who could really grow into a Damian Lillard type of player as a borderline MVP candidate staying loyal to his home market for years, and he's shown to really be able to kick it up a notch in high-pressure situations. The Wade comps, while a little premature, also make a ton of sense. But as it stands right now, he's a guy who's around the top-20 mark in the NBA and he's a talented scorer, if a bit inefficient in the regular season. But he can get his own shot, he can pass, and he can score at all three levels in spite of his size. But that also describes a *ton* of guys in the NBA; Lavine, Sexton, Trae, Jamal, all guys who are (in my opinion) at least one step below Mitchell but who could fill a very similar role in this Jazz team without much of a struggle. Plus, one knock against Mitchell is that there are guys who do the same thing as him but better - Dame, Steph, Harden, Kyrie, all those guys I'd trust to fill his role in the Jazz' offense without missing a beat. Mitchell still has room to grow, he's not even 25 yet and his game will improve a lot with age and experience. But Gobert? He's irreplaceable. Nobody in the NBA can do what he does. And I say this as the biggest Mitchell stan in the world."
"yeah they act like he got suspended for that little dust up when he had just karate kicked Steven Adams in the balls and did a UFC takedown on Beasley. And it's funny they blame LeBron for complaining to the league office when all Draymond does is complain all game with rarely any repercussions.  If someone can make a compilation of you kicking people in NBA games, you might have a flagrant foul problem"
I think Luka probably got a lot of international votes too.   I love my guy Steven Adams getting the NZ vote out. He ranked pretty well in the fanvote.
the steven adams technique
Does Steven Adams smell?
"Steven Adams - Yeah nah, she'll be right."
yes. believe it was on the recent JJ REDDICK podcast with Steven Adams.
My favorite was probably when Patrick Beverley got his skeleton rearranged by Steven Adams
Same thing happened to Lillard against Steven Adams a few years back.  It was like he ran into a wall.
"I think these two could be good in a half time show. Add Draymond Green and idk, Steven Adams"
They have Lonzo and Hart who are great rebounding guards. They have Steven Adams who seems to get most of the rebounds whenever I check on them. B.I is flirting with triple doubles every once in a while. Simply put he doesn't have to be the guy getting 12 boards every game out.
He got suspended for swatting Lebron’s nuts in the finals. This was after he kicked Steven Adams in the crotch twice during the WCF.
"Remember when Steven Adams fuckin **trucked** Pat Bev?  That'd be enough for me in this case, though generally I'd agree with you. Maybe it just has to be someone so well liked that their rep wouldn't take a hit."
Yeah but the guys who play Aussie Rules will catch their opponent in the air to keep them from falling and hurting themselves too. Hooligan sport played by gentlemen.  There's a famous video I can't find where a guy goes in too hot and his opponent catches him by the shorts to keep him safe. [Kind of like Steven Adams saving Plumlee here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmWT9gb0WA) Which makes sense given Adams is a Kiwi.
"Could've done a Steven Adams, but didn't. It's a restricted area. Compete on verticallity and then clear the area.  Call it as it is. It was a dirty play."
"\*Heated basketball argument at the barbershop  ME: These guys today ain't shit, LeBron the GOAT. Take that BS somewhere else!  DUDE: Man!... LeBron this and that...  ME: Could you imagine Malone asking for a trade to the Bulls to win with Michael?   DUDE: The immediate look of disgust .  ME: Exactly  And it really is not the teaming up that offends so many people. It is the high school cliquish nature of the players. Dudes used to compete. Give Bill Laimbeer Steven Adams body, muthafuckas would end up in the ER regularly."
Aaron Baynes has declined hard this season. I would take one Steven Adams at center any day.   With the guard play becoming so dominant in today’s game Adams is a great interior presence. He’d start on every single playoff team in the league.
I would have thought one of the top positive would be our big kiwi mate Steven Adams.
"Aminu doesn't compare to Carmelo the year after he was an Allstar on the Knicks or Steven Adams who was pretty underrated. And cj is not better than pg13 any of the years ever. Russ never made it out of the first round as a first option. The wizards are worse this year with him on the team. Russ shooting percentage always sucked, which wouldn't be so bad if he didn't take all the shots. Cp3 brought a stripped down version of that thunder team to the playoffs in the west! Russ is fun to watch but can't carry anyone and he makes most players around him worse. Include his occasionally bone headed defense and he's an overall negative."
"Lebron, Steven Adams, Zion and Embiid become the 4 best shooters in the league"
I think around half his minutes come with Steven Adams on the court. It’s not that surprising that he doesn’t get a ton of rebounds
"Ask all the people who said Steven Adams was a dumb deal by David Griffin and ""Can't EVER fit with Zion"" lmao."
And Steven Adams!
*insert steven adams quote from last week here*
Pels are 4th in rebounding in the NBA and 1st in offensive rebounds. Even Lonzo’s rebounds have gone down since there’s just so many people on the team getting them now lol especially with Steven Adams now on the Pels.
The title hit me like Steven adams on a screen smh. I'm sad rn
"We have Steven Adams who is averaging 9 rebounds and Josh Hart, who is one of, if not, the best rebounding 2 in the league, dude is averaging 8 rebounds off the bench. Zion just doesn't have the opportunity to grab boards because those guys got it covered for the most part"
"Want me to say Saddiq bays last 6 games, it makes him look like a godly version of klay Thompson   6 games isn’t a huge sample size lmao  And if Steven adams is so good on d and Zion leading u to a top 25 offence ever why u keep losing lmao"
https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-draymond-green-steven-adams-20160523-htmlstory.html
Steven Adams says hello
I heard russ might get a buyout and he is joining the nets too.  Steven adams as well. They just need ibaka
He almost castrated Steven Adams that one time
The thing is Steven Adams is actually a decent finisher around the rim
They would. Kyle Lowry and Steven Adams are both considered overweight.
"Defensively, he’s a menace, but he’s never had a team around him and has always tried to do too much. The guy cant shoot, anywhere, unless its a dunk. He does really need to learn to be a Steven Adams or Draymond type player and turn his stellar defense into offense through his lowkey solid playmaking instincts. Ive always thought the dubs would be a good fit for him, because he wouldn’t take the ball away from the splash bros, just get their misses and send it back to them. Dude would probably average 17-18 boards a game with them. But I hope the best for him, he’s very underrated imo, just needs the right fit, and frankly he’s kinda raw for how long he’s been in the league. Source - Pistons fan."
I just can’t wrap my head around the Steven Adams deal. Wtf was that and why?
"&gt;Why doesnt he just focus on being like steven adams? Get rebounds, catch lobs, set good screens, play good interior defense.   I don't think he's a good interior defender. It's only athleticism there, not awareness. He was an upgrade over Greg Monroe there, but that doesn't mean you can't find a replacement-level player who gives you the same on interior defense.   His value is (1) rebounding (which is useful) and (2) occupying the other team's big. If he was willing to limit himself to offensive rebounds and lobs, then he'd have some value. But he's not even as athletic as he once was, so he's not getting up for the same passes.   Steven Adams knows positioning and has soft hands compared to Drummond. I was never big on him, but he was at least useful in the past."
&gt;Why doesnt he just focus on being like steven Adams  Cause he's the opposite of Steven Adams. He's Hakeem Olajuwon baby.  /s
Sounds like you guys would rather have Steven Adam's.   Damn just realizing how valuable a guy like Adams is  just does his role without overreaching
Steven Adams also has a much better touch around the rim than Drummond
Steven Adams is far more skilled offensively too
"Why doesnt he just focus on being like steven adams? Get rebounds, catch lobs, set good screens, play good interior defense. Teams should clearly define his role."
"Steven Adams is talking about our hero worship of athletes, part of which involves the rags to riches, pull yourself up by your bootstraps origin stories. I was just pointing that that is mostly a myth, most athletes have normal or fairly economically privileged childhoods. It’s not a personal gripe, I’m not trying to hate on anyone for sending their kids to nice basketball camps lol"
"Another telling moment was last year when he refused to complain about room service or life in the bubble like some other players were. When asked about it, ""[We're living in a bloody resort](https://www.si.com/nba/thunder/news/steven-adams-bloody-resort-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba)"""
"He is also credited for the spurs picking Tony Parker, selected Ibaka/Reggie Jackson/Steven Adams all with mid/late first round picks and in more recent times he drafted Sabonis, Darius Bazley(solid contributor for the last few years) and he scouted Dort and got him to sign a super cheap contract."
"Here’s my definition: Championship Team - contenders usually every year whether they have superstars or not  Super Team - 3 superstar level players(not all stars like Julius Randle superstars like KD)  Big Three - 3 all star caliber players such as Westbrook, PG13, and Steven Adams"
"&gt; Same GM also drafted Mitch McGary, Cameron Payne, T Ferguson  The same GM who has not hit on a first rounder since Steven Adams in 2013. Ferguson is the best player he has drafted since."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder_draft_history  I mean really since James Harden they really haven't drafted anyone noteworthy. Eric Bledsoe, Reggie Jackson and Steven Adams. Then in 2020 they drafted Immanuel Quickley but traded him for the 23rd pick."
Those guys were great picks but also very high. He also picked up Ibaka and Steven Adams much later
Coulda woulda shoulda. We don’t rank players on hypotheticals we look at the facts. Steven adams was Westbrook’s best teammate once Kd left what was he supposed to do? He ain’t Lebron
"Nice he beat a team with an injured Westbrook and Paul George who also employed Terrance Ferguson, Raymond Felton and Steven Adams. They were 6th seed for a reason."
The team that won the title last year had no lights out shooters. This isn't 2018. Zo and BI are good shooters and Zion shoots 97% from the field anyway so not sure what'd limit them unless Steven Adams kept playing a lot of minutes
Mainly because he played no defense and farmed tons of boards. Steven Adams and him had a deal worked out on FTs. It was kinda contrived  Still crazy tho
"Westbrook and Harden in '08 and '09 weren't sure fire things -- especially Westbrook, he was seen as a tremendous project at the time of the draft with a ton of upside.   Since 2013 he hasn't drafted higher than 11th -- a few notable picks in that time: drafted Steven Adams (12th pick), Andre Roberson (26th pick), Alex Abrines (32nd pick), Sabonis (11th pick), Lu Dort (undrafted). He's absolutely had his fair share of misses during that stretch.   At this point, he's just accumulating ""swings"" -- hopefully one or two become a home run."
More like Steven adams was clogging the paint
Steven Adams
"That and noone really understands the make up of the pelicans. Besides Zion and (maybe Ingram) the team has no synergy. Why sign steven adams (who cant shoot) with zion, bench is pretty bad, Hart and Alexander walker are the only avg players they have, they really dont have any good shooters on the team.   All this kinda tells why their record is so poor especially in the West it doesnt help"
Yep. The Jazz were one of our worst matchups that year because Russ couldn't drive on them. Forcing him to have productive shooting which he's bad at. Steven Adams also was in foul trouble a few times that series and Mitchell seemed literally unstoppable.
SMH he's stealing all these assists from Steven Adams again
"He’s playing with Steven Adams or Hayes/Hernangomez at any given time, so he isn’t crashing the offensive glass (that’s Adams’ specialty) and it’s been pretty clear the coaches have been trying to get him into less of a big man mentality and more into a wing mentality - that means less crashing the boards and more focusing on the transition O/D.   I really wanna see him start jumping passing lanes or going for weakside blocks, but it definitely seems like he and/or the coaching staff has made an effort to prioritize consistency throughout the game over big time highlight plays that are incredibly valuable when they work, but more often lead to an error and a bucket for the other team."
He doesn’t play with Steven Adams anymore
"Never forget that Kyle Singler inbounded to Steven Adams at the three point line and Russ at near half court, down 2 on the last possession.  Yeah Adams was screening for Russ but could have easily been a broken play. Thankfully we get a perfect shot instead on a record-setting night and an NBA highlight for years to come"
"It's only because Steven Adams is clearing space for him to grab all those boards, and his assists are meaningless. Fucking stat padder, dude!"
He iS sTeALiNg StEvEn AdAmS' rEbOuNdS!!!!!!!!!!
"Usually if you’re over the salary cap, you can’t trade for players with a higher salary - for example, the Lakers couldn’t trade Wes Matthews (making the minimum) for Kyle Lowry (making $35M/year). But, if you trade a player for a lower salaried player or draft picks, the NBA lets you roll the difference forward -  so if the Lakers had traded LeBron (making $40M/yr) for the Raptor’s 2021 draft pick (officially paid $0/yr), they have a $40M “credit” to use on a player within 12 months, even if they’re right at the cap.    OKC has six of these credits to use within 12 months of the trade that created the credit. The $27M exception, for instance, was created by trading Steven Adams’ contract for some 2nd round picks and minimum players, which is $27M - $0 for salary cap purposes. So they get to use that $27M on another trade."
"They actually track uncontested rebounds and players like Russel Wetbrook (76.4%) and Luka Doncic (73.9%) have a majority of them uncontested. They grab like 2.3 contested rebounds a game. A player like Steven Adams has 49.1% contested rebounds and grabs 4.4 of them a game. One of my favorite on/off stats is rebounding and a player like Steven Adams who doesn't average a lot of rebounds actually significantly improves his teams rebounding (and Pelicans are the number 1 rebounding team in the league this year and Adams has been on number 1 rebounding OKC team in the league so this is saying a lot).  When Luka is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612742&amp;VsPlayerID=1629029&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) their team gets 49.3% of rebounds and when he is off the court they get 48.9% of rebounds so he slightly increases his teams rebounding by less than half a percent.  When Steven Adams is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612740&amp;VsPlayerID=203500) his team gets 54.5% of all rebounds. When he is off they get 51.8% which is a pretty good percentage and he makes a pretty good rebounding team a good amount better.  With Russell Westbrook is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612764&amp;VsPlayerID=201566) his team gets 47.6% of rebounds and when he is off his team actually gets a good amount more at 49.7%. He actually makes a mediocre rebounding team worse. However, have to remember on/off is finicky and if you cycle through a couple different years, there has been years Westbrook has made his OKC teams better at rebounding in terms of on/off by a decent amount."
"&gt;People are underrating him saying Westbrook grabs rebounds because it’s by design.   Defensive rebounds on free throws, 2017-2019:  * Westbrook: 270 (45% more than anyone else in the NBA) * Steven Adams: 19  Westbrook is a great rebounder for a guard, but he'd never average a triple double without the design."
It’s because Steven Adams gives him his rebounds
Refs missed a game changing call in the final seconds and he got heated (Steven Adams pretty much ran Smart over and there was no call).
"Lol. Watch it again. He literally grabs Steven Adams, pulls him towards his body, and then fucking flops like the bitch he is."
"The refs are literally terrible every night. The Celtics announcers are maybe the worst in the NBA, though. There were a few plays where I legit thought they were going to have dual coronaries because Marcus Smart’s flopping ass didn’t get a whistle, especially at the end where he literally pulled Steven Adams into him and then flopped and when he didn’t get the call, got ejected for bitching."
Marcus smart taking a screen from Steven Adams sounds painful
And Steven Adams was boxing out the entire pacers team so he could get rebounds
Lmao Celtics commentators love crying for fouls when Rob Williams falls into Steven Adams as he is trying to get a rebound.
"Steven Adams is boxing out for him, it's pretty easy when he has a center giving him rebounds"
What's up with Steven adams this season
Hmm needs another big. Maybe they can get Steven Adams back from NOLA? I never liked the fit there
Y'all kill Westbrook for stat padding and taking Steven Adams' rebounds when Drummond was out here trying to hit his teammates if they took his rebounds lol
"Drummond never deserved all star. They overrated his box score. Steven Adams is a far better team player, screen setter, defender and isn't delusional about his role. Just like Whiteside"
"Well obviously. I'm just saying being realistic there is zero chance. He's not even as good as players like Nurkic, Steven Adams, or Clint Capela. There's just no way in hell he gets the max"
"I'm guessing trading Steven Adams, but don't know for sure."
"Steven Adams trade, it looks like. https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/cap/"
"They should have given it to Oladipo considering that MCW was putting up empty stats. So empty that his own team immediately disposed of him after winning the award. Funny that the 2013 batch also had CJ McCollum, Steven Adams, Gobert, Schroeder, and Giannis but they weren’t very good right away. Of course Giannis was a project for several years."
Steven Adams book is on my want to read list
it'll also help if he actually had decent 3 point shooters on the team and not Steven Adams beside him...
"I’m not saying that at all. I’m honestly baffled that’s the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn’t fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn’t make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn’t inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team’s *results* would vary from the one he’d hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let’s use your Luka example. Let’s say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren’t hitting the shots that the first team was?"
they're stupid for giving steven adams a huge ass contract when he's extremely obviously not a good fit with zion...
What's funny about it. Ask pistons fans. They say the same thing. He's an empty calories rebounder. Look at thinking basketballs video on rebounding. There's a lot of noise in the stat shown by Steven Adams having one season out of the top 200 (but I think that was the year kanter was the 6th man and he was a beast on the boards as well so not as bad). But Drummond is like 300th rank in the league multiple seasons.
"His efficiency is atrocious for a non-shooting big man. You say he doesn't have to be a first option - if only he wanted to play like that. I would go on but you have a Detroit flair - surely I don't have to explain to you how empty those stats are. He could be a very solid big like Steven Adams, but he plays like he's Hakeem."
"Also he had like 37 rebounds over 2 games (18 and 19 I believe) with literally 35 coming from defensive rebounds. I watched the recaps to check if it looks as stupid as it sounds. He's genuinely just boxing out his own team for defensive boards and they realise he wants them so they start leaving them altogether.  This was so apparent in 2017 with possibly the best rebounder in the game in Steven Adams, he'd just leave them because it's awkward to have 2 teammates being the only ones fighting over a board"
"I can believe this.  I'm sure Lonzo enjoys NO, but he's always seemed like the type of guy who prefers the big market.  Pelicans also seems like a low key shit basketball situation for him. Bledsoe and Steven Adams mucking shit up."
"Yeah, Rookie Sabonis, Steven Adams, and Victor Oladipo were total studs then dude. This sub lmfao"
"So, is montenegro like NZ with Steven Adams? I remember going there and seeing a newspaper which said something like Adams gets 5/13/3 to lead OKC to the win, helped by Russell Westbrook 20/18/11 game"
"Yeah, I can only imagine how pissed OKC fans are.  At the time I even had a lot of deluded OKC fans even telling me ""nah man, they lost fair and square"".  I don't think people realized how important Draymond Green was to that GSW roster. He was the glue, the hammer, and the nails.  For the refs to watch him do the things that he did without even a tech is INSANE. He even did the armbar takedown that Kelly Ollynyk did to fuck up Kevin Love's arm: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-draymond-green-and-steven-adams-have-a-wrestling-match/  He was doing things that people weren't just getting Flags for, but were getting SUSPENDED for. Kelly was out for one game. Dray should have been given techs, flag 1, flag 2, and suspension throughout that series. Absolutely crooked reffing transparent as anything I've seen in my lifetime.  Thanks for Billy Donovan by the way. Its so awesome to have a real coach."
Idk ask Steven adams
But I thought the only reason he got rebounds was Steven Adams and stat-padding?   God that was such a dumb take.
"He didn't trade ""for"" Bledsoe and Steven Adams is a strong presence in the paint."
"Westbrook, Wall, Love. That's the only definitively worse current contracts. If you can find any more I'd love to see them.   The first we're talking about is a 2025 top 6 protected, it's not a high lottery pick this year or next. You're massively overestimating it's value. Teams aren't going to take on Horford with the hopes of getting better, this isn't another CP3 situation where the Thunder turn around a distressed asset.  One of three things will happen between the Thunder and Horford:  1. They attempt to trade him before next seasons trade deadline, fail, and then buy him out, taking the hit on his partial guarantee into season 22-23  2. They trade him for another bad to terrible contract (Love and Westbrook both slight possibilities here, maybe Steven Adams if the Pels are desperate) and gain a few draft assets and/or a young player in the process.  3. They attempt to free cap space by trading Horford + assets for an expiring deal. (Most likely if they perform better than expected early next season)"
"Counterpoint: Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams"
"&gt;having the ball in his hands immediately saves time  What? The whole 1 second it takes Steven Adams to pass it to him? He’d be right there anyway considering he sags of shooters to go grab them. I’m not underplaying his greatness. He’s a great rebounder for a guard. Even if they didn’t pad he rebounds he’d still average 7-8 rebounds like he did last year but you can’t watch him in OKC from 2017-19 and act like they didn’t pad his rebounds, it was pretty obvious."
Yeah but Russ’ goes down in Houston when they stopped boxing out for him on every possession so he could grab a rebound. Steven Adams’ is also a great rebounder. How is a 6 ft 3 point guard grabbing more rebounds than one of the best rebounding centres in the league? Idk about this year because I don’t watch the Wizards but his MVP year Russ would consistently leave shooters on the perimeter to grab a rebound. You can’t watch his last few years in OKC and say he didn’t pad his rebound stats.
They were definitely padding his rebounds in OKC and there have been instances before where he’s tried [padding his assist](https://youtu.be/N8erK7T_LIQ) numbers. Steven Adams’ defensive rebound % went from 14.8% in 2019 to 24% in 2020 after Russ got traded to Houston. Russ’ went from 28.3% to 18.1% and now that he’s in Washington back up to 25.4%. You can’t say that’s just a coincidence.
He only gets those rebounds because Steven Adams let’s him smh
"Real question is, who's screen is harder, Thanos or Steven Adams?"
"This. Before Nets dunk, people on this sub were ""Blake got them old man legs, should retire"" and Aldridge in last 2 seasons had those Steven Adams numbers with 2ppg more, on worse efficiency"
Did westbrook stat pad ? Yes for sure there were instances of that.  But did the Thunder devise their whole system around getting Russ triple doubles? No .  If Steven Adams was some elite rebounder then  he'd have had a more active role in grabbing boards
No way. The Pelicans are the best rebounding team this year and OKC has been one of the best for several years including first place when Steven Adams was there. Adams has elite on/off rebounding and he improves his team immensely at rebounding when he is on the court. He doesn't get double digit rebounds so people thing he isn't a good rebounder but he boxes out and isn't selfish for them.
If Zion is playing the 5 is Steven Adams playing the 6?
I mean look how much money Steven Adams is making
Josh Hart + Steven Adams  Brandon Clarke + first round pick  Duncan Robinson + first round pick
I didn't get that trade for Adams. Jakob Poeltl and Mason Plumlee signed for like half of what they extended Adams for. They gave up a good backup point guard for the chance to overpay Steven Adams
Steven Adams to Schroder version 2  Only this time a slight miss.
a Dame 50-point game cooking Steven Adams in the pick-n-roll all night? that doesn't sound familiar at all
"Steven Adams, Embiid, Jokic, Aron Baynes, Gobert off the top of my head"
Steven Adams baby
Instructions unclear: Lakers have taken on Steven Adams and his contract.  &amp;#x200B;  (I'd love this as a Kiwi)
"He’d be the perfect center alongside Zion. I would be thrilled if the Pelicans were able to pull something together. They give the Pacers Steven Adams, one of Nickeil, Jaxon, Kira, and a draft pick a couple years down the road? Probably would have to give up another young piece/draft pick, but of all these teams, they have the most attractive collection of assets to make that trade. My big dream is either Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum wants out of Boston by the beginning of next season and the Pels make a big trade for one of them. Who the team gets to finish off their Big 3 is going to determine what kind of success the team has during Zion’s early days."
"2018 OKC vs Utah   Westbrook, Paul George, Caramelo Anthony and Steven Adams losing to a rookie Mitchell and Ricky Rubio"
When I read the title I was expecting the folding type of screen someone like Steven Adams sets. He took a shoulder but didn't fall or anything.
"Steven Adams, Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle."
Lol athletes that are in college because they're athletes don't usually take good courses. They take the easier courses so they can ball and get in and out.   To be fair not by their choice all the time. Steven adams was a bit of a scholar  and was actually upset that they made him take dumb courses.
Steven Adams for sure.

Of course a center would look better on defense. There are no centers in the nba to guard. Gobert is looks great until Joel or Joker come to town and tear him up. Because they are good players at the center position unlike basically the rest of the nba.    Ben Simmons is constantly guarding thr best players in the world. Every game. At 4 different positions.   I dont advanced stats people. I think its cool or whatever. But sometimes you gotta watch the games too.   Lebron scoring 32 on Ben can be a much better defensive performance than Gobert holding steven Adams to 13.
"I’ll admit I’ve only had the chance to watch the Pels a couple times, but I have no idea how a team starting Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball bad at defence"
Steven Adams: I guess Jaxson is starting now

That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"Damn I got interested in their metrics and found this amazing page https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-data-viz/ which is free. Giannis, Embiid and Lebron have super close metrics. Joker is an offensive god but his defense is average. I wasn't expecting bron to be MVP this year but he is definetely among statistical MVP candidates if their metrics are reliable. Another interesting team to check on the graphic would be New Orleans Pelicans as almost all of their roster has positive o-LEBRON and negative d-LEBRON ratings. This makes sense cuz NOP are offensively #2 and defensively #30 but all of them excluding Steven Adams being negative makes me question their coaching."
It totally is that. The Steven Adams interview on Old Man and the Three was an amazing change of perspective for me.
Schröder isn’t that good at lobs. He never developed chemistry with Steven Adams or Nerlens Noel in 3 years with OKC
I know. Watching each of them individually now they couldve been good. Pg13 obviously. I think russ and steven  adams pretty much optimize each others abilities the best. Grant is finally catching up with his athleticism. Cabarrot is a good role players. Schroder is still a good point guard option. Im just waiting to see how andre roberson pans out. Its a shame
Steven Adams is the gift that keeps on giving
"Steven Adams once bumped into me at a club, and I spilled my drink. I've been plotting revenge ever since."
You shut your mouth when you’re talking about Steven Adams
Is it safe to say that SVG's breath would have to smell pretty awful for someone as tall as Steven Adams to notice it lol?
I said he was better than Steven Adams and someone said he's close to being out of the league
You got to love Steven Adams. Got a great sense of humor.

"The Pels are strong af, and they're longbois too. As much as I love Jarrett Allen, Steven Adams is not a good matchup for him. And Kevin Love is a shell of himself."
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team! Anyway, so here are the likely lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (14-22) | [](/NOP)Pelicans (15-22) ---|---   C.

"I can't say I remember Adams being small when he got in the league, but I don't really remember thinking about it too much.  But, Steven Adams said on his recent podcast with JJ Redick that he was at his biggest/most jacked when he was in college.   All they had him do was lift weights, and he thought he got a bit too big.   So I'm not sure it tracks."
&gt; it was blatantly obvious that they were playing it in a way that steven adams would use his size to box out other rebounders while russ would secure rebounds.  Lopez is a leading box-outer per 36 as well.
I bet Steven Adams let Russ get those wins
look at Steven Adams boxing out so he can stat-pad again!!
"Why do people hate on Westbrook for his abysmal scoring efficiency when Dray is just as bad, they'll turn around and say well 'Dray's impact doesn't show on the box score', ignoring that Westbrook also does a ton of things outside scoring, like being the best fucking rebounding guard in the league(Yes you haters his rebounding stats haven't missed a bit since he left OKC, so NO steven adams isn't giving him 'free' rebounds), and getting his teammates going with assists?"
"it was blatantly obvious that they were playing it in a way that steven adams would use his size to box out other rebounders while russ would secure rebounds.  and it was smart too, because using steven adams to box meant that rebounds were more likely to end up with OKC which is why they had such huge rebound numbers. and it probably made their transition quicker because westbrook would be the one grabbing the rebound then immediately speeding off, whereas a lot of teams the big catches, lands, and has to stop and refocus on the team to find out who to pass it to which lets the opposition set up."
"As someone who’s watched Adams for years, Gafford is better than Steven has ever been and it’s not close at all. Gaff is a legit elite defender and has flipped Washington from one of the worst defenses in the league to a top tier defense while going 9-1. He’s easily been the most important Wizard since his trade."
"mfs in here were convinced that Steven Adams would be prime Dennis Rodman if Russ wasn't ""stealing"" his rebounds"
He trash talked Steven Adams in the bubble
"If Steven Adams could do windmill dunks and catch alley oops thrown into the stratosphere, yeah"
Gafford looks like Steven Adams but more athletic.   It’s ridiculous what some of these guys can do for other players. Gafford might not have been in the NBA had he not played with Russ.
Steven Adams
And Steven adams. And 2 first’s and 2 swaps. That’s a pretty good trade package and probably the best you could get for him.
"*""Draymond just kicked Steven Adams in the balls again, did you know his nickname is Aquaman?""*"
"Nearly everyone on that team was not the player they became til the minute they got traded. I remember there being a post about players before and after Westbrook.    It reminded me of how people said Wilt only won when he toner his usage rate down.   The triple double stat is bc of playing weak teams  Do you remember the time steph &amp; kd laughed at Russell bc he raged at Steven Adams for missing a shot that would've been Russ' 10th assist in a game that was so over that russ was in while KD and Steph were on the bench?   It was just pure selfishness disguised as an all around game &amp; the harden vs wb argument always felt really one sided. The one thing ill give russ fans is idk what that rockets season would have looked like if harden didn't do two extremely cancerous ""tricks"" to get free throws 5x a game"
Steven Adams approves.
I wish the Pels would acquire a stretch 5 for the bench and let Zion go 5 out with the 2nd unit. That's assuming you're not getting rid of Steven Adams for some reason
i still don't understand getting Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe and wanting to get rid of Lonzo Ball while HAVING ZION FUCKING WILLIAMSON ON YOUR TEAM
"i think OP is being a little disingenuous with his take. i think much of the Westbrook ""hate"" that season was the feeling that Harden should have won and if say Westbrook had averaged 9.0 rebounds and/or assists that maybe the ""OMG triple double average!!!"" wave that got him over the finish line would not have happened. Harden, on a team with a better record, had comparable scoring and assist stats and was not that far off himself in double digit RPG with 8 RPG (plus there was the stat-padding argument many ppl made that OKC's bigs like Steven Adams were deliberately letting Westbrook take rebounds they would have otherwise gotten themselves so even that 10+ RPG wasn't totally organic)  this year is weird cuz a lot of legit MVP candidates have faded due to injury, so Steph only has this late momentum and a smaller field BECAUSE he caught fire at the same time guys like Lebron, Harden, Dame, etc. have faded back - Embiid's time lost also has handicapped his candidacy as well. plus like it or not there is a legit case to be made about Steph's intrinsic value to the Warriors this season because of how much fall off there's been when he's out of the game  absolutely valid that despite both guys being fundamentally polarizing players to segments of the basketball world, Steph is a more beloved figure, particularly to the analytics crowd like Lowe because his value really shows up in the data Moneyball-style... i can totally understand a Westbrook fan chafing at a perceived double standard"
"His haters expect him to play on Kawhi's tier because he got paid, but he still makes less than Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love, and &lt;$1m more than Steven Adams."
"""dragged Steven Adams to the playoffs""  In 2017 he was easily a top 10 center."
Steven Adams
"Oh yeah, the award has always been about narrative though. A lot of people thought that was it for the Thunder, time to tank without KD. But he kicked it up a notch, averaged the first triple double since Big O, and dragged Alex Abrines, Abdel Nader, Andre Roberson, and Steven Adams to the playoffs lol"
We'll be sitting here with cap space ready to take on Steven Adams for the small fee of one NAW.
Steven Adams
"“Russ who are your top 5 teammates ever?”  “Ah, well obviously Brad, James, PG, Melo, and....hmmm...oh yeah Steven Adams”  “Wait didn’t you leave someone out”  “Hmmm...did I?...oh damn you’re right. I’m trippin...I gotta have Ibaka over Steven”"
"Steven adams, kofi Cockburn, enes kantar, Damian lee, Aron Baynes"
I wanna see embiid and jokic fooling around taking full court shorts QB style. Throw Steven Adams in there too
"Steven adams just signed an extension making 17.5 million per year, is 10 years younger than CP3, and is still an overpay for a guy that doesn't add that much.  Embiid+Simmons+Harris combined make over 100 million so there is no way to get CP3 on that sized deal onto your team.  You would have to be paying CP3 like 3/60 to be able to make a sign and trade work and pray that his injury history is a thing of the past but betting against father time isn't wise."
He's leading the Suns to the #2 seed and Steven Adams is making 25...I 100% think a team would do that.....John Stockton was very good in his old age and I think Cp3 is better then him. Id clean out the lockers of Danny Green and Seth Curry to sign him for 4 years 25 mill
Yeah Seriously like Steven Adams is making 25 a year.....Cp3 can easily get that especially seeing how he is still affective as fuck.....Who thought the Suns would be #2 seed
"Well small ball is a proven failure,  but there are always little guys who can get rebounds over pathetic trash centers. Look at Steven Adams in the thunder vs rockets series. So many smaller guys got rebounds over him"
But not Steven Adams? This is a travesty.
Steven adams balls? Idk
Steven Adams
I love steven adams
"Some really bizarre replies in this thread. KAT would make them far better. How is that even a question?  Is it because Steven Adams is a meme? That's rhetorical, by the way."
But Steven Adams probably isn't even a top half most athletic center and is one of the best at it
This team signed steven adams for his defense and that clearly hasn't pan out
"frontcourt is SF, PF and Center. But yeah I kind of overlooked Ingram as he's a good shooter yeah but he also deserves to have the ball in his hands which means other guys who need to provide spacing for him and that's definitely not coming from Zion or Steven Adams lol so it's gotta be lonzo"
"Fox  Lonzo? Ingram  Zion  Towns  2nd unit: Buddy, Ant, Steven Adams, Rubio, Bledsoe/Hart   How many games is this team winning? Where would they be in the west?"
"Lonzo is a distressed asset. He obviously does not want to be in NO. That roster is a mess, Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe provide no spacing whatsoever. I also think the locker room has checked out on Stan."
"David Griffin really put y’all in hell. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams are possible the worst supporting cast that could give to Zion and BI, zero spacing"
Steven Adams going to learn how to shoot in the offseason?
Steven Adams really missed a freethrow on purpose down 3 points with 45 seconds left. this team is braindead
mfs playing Steven Adams over 30 minutes against Jeff Green lmaooooo David Griffin &amp; SVG are fuckin bozos
"Wtf, Irving was literally in front of Steven Adams and yet, he didn't bother contesting the shot  Amazing play by Irving though"
i wanna go back to when this sub was basically all steven adams quotes for a while there
That just proves what we've all been thinking anyway: Steven Adams is the GOAT center in the league.
"Lol kd literally played with Westbrook, Ibaka, a role player James Harden, Steven Adams, and other good players in okc. Miss me with Kd not having help"
I mean as a huge warriors (and Draymond) fan...didn’t Dray kick Steven Adams in the nuts twice in a series?
"I know Chris Mihm, Smush Parker, and Kwame Brown are not basketball scrubs. Any of them probably could 1v3 us.  But if those are starters in NBA, then we got issues. Kwame Brown, for example, specifically told Kobe not to pass to him because he feared that he would mess up.  Also, Oladipo is a lot better than those three, and Andre Roberson and Steven Adams weren't some benchwarmers either."
"Yeah it's obv. easier said than done, but all you need to do to ""stop"" Embiid is not foul him.  He shoots 38% from 3, 52% overall. The foul shots are what make him a dangerous offensive force.   The other night I saw Steven freakin Adams hold him to 5/16. It can be done."
"lol the Pels are not good, as amazing as Zion is the Pels are a bunch of children still. The only guy on that team capable of being a closer is BI. Their defense still sucks and the floor is still low key a mess with all the mish mashed players. You question what the hell Steven Adams is doing there and then you question what the hell Eric Bledsoe is doing there and then you remember out of nowhere that Lonzo Ball still exists and is on there and holy shit this game actually traded away JJ Redick lol"
"Dude, I'm not even a westbrook guy, but he is a very good passer in the pick and roll and got Steven Adams a bag despite him being incredibly limited offensively."
"I agree with everything you said. My argument or question? i guess is that like he’s not obviously better he’s better right now, I’ll admit that Luka is better. But we know he’s better because we’re fans of this granular nonsense.  Obviously better is Gobert versus Steven Adams, I used Collin Sexton earlier. Luka is obviously better than Collin sexton, I don’t really need to make much of an argument because it’s obvious.  It’s just reductive and annoying to see “well Luka is obviously better” at the end of a post that calls into the question whether he even IS obviously better. I think it’s worth reanalyzing that assumption."
"Your question shouldn't be pulling downvotes. The CBA is complicated and this isn't obvious, imo. In a perfect world, them doing right by Dort probably keeps him around longer, so them renegotiating his contract would be in their benefit. People acting like there's no reason for OKC to bump him up are approaching this from the wrong angle.  OKC actually can't renegotiate his contract, but they can just extend it, which is better anyway. http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q58  Dort's contract is kind of weird because it started as a 2 way and was converted, but my understanding is he can be extended this summer. (Two years after original signing, which was July 2019) It may actually be the case that it's the contract conversion that starts the clock, which means he can't be extended until summer 2022. Again, CBA is weird.  I'd actually expect him to be extended summer 2022 either way. Presti will want him long term, so the later he does the extension, the more years they get with him. I'd guess the behind-closed-doors conversation with Presti and Dort moves along the lines of ""Nothing that happens this next season matters. We'll give you the Steven Adams contract - we'll take care of you next year no matter what."" They'll bump his contract up then so he never hits open market."
You can see Steven Adams freaking out as Lonzo goes to defend the layup lol

I think its super hilarious that people said WB is stat padding and Steven Adams was giving him rebounds.   WB goes to 2 different teams and still grabs rebounds like nothing. When are people going to accept that he is this type of player.
About even. Draymond and Wiggins are better than Steven adams and Oladipo by a significant margin. But some of the bench guys like Enes Kanter and Jerami Grant were better than the warriors bench guys.
"I think I remember this same Pels homer early in the season trying to justify the Steven Adams trade+extension and also defending SVG lmao. Not 100% sure it was him but iirc said that the Pelicans were essentially a lock for the playoffs when they are roughly the same place or even worse than last year, despite Zion improving, new coach, new players, etc."
"Honestly not really their fault though. 2 shitty coaches and a bad roster. They got Bledsoe and Steven Adams making a combined like 47 million of cap space, then extended Adams almost 18 mill a year **before** the season even started. Why the hell?"
"He has lost the team. When you have an argument with Steven Adams on the sideline, then there are problems and that team is going nowhere under Van Gundy."
Draymond and Wiggins are better than Steven adams and Oladipo.
"OKC had a garbage roster too outside of Westbrook, Steven adams, Oladipo."
"Ingram and Zion fit well imo. The Pelicans got some serious young talent with those 2 + Kira Lewis, NAW, Hart, and Hayes.  It depends on what happens with Zo. I just think they’ve tuned out Van Gundy already. On top of that, Griffin grabbing Steven Adams made spacing far worse."
"He needs more shooting around him, signing Bledsoe and Steven Adams. (&amp;drafting Hayes). Is the polar opposite of getting shooting"
"Okc  Had Sabonis, Oladipo and Grant before they broke out as good/great players  Kanter is not good defensively  Andre Roberson is a defensive specialist  Steven Adams is good, but you know you’re struggling if he’s your 2nd option"
"Firing griffin would be a good start, everything he’s done so far has been questionable. Hiring van gundy, trading Jrue lol, extending steven adams. If things don’t change soon they’re gonna start losing their young stars to free agency unless they find a way to trade them before that"
"Right, so they're saving 10 million in 2022 and 2023 to pay a center that's a bad fit next to their star.   The point is that either letting Steven Adams go or taking on Horford would have been acceptable but if they were going to pay a center for 3 years they might as well have gotten a good fit."
"I still don't get why the Pels didn't take Horford instead of Adams. Sure he's older than Steven Adams, but he provides you better spacing while still being a defensive anchor at the 5. Plus at his age he could easily transition to a bench role for Hayes if Hayes ever shows enough to warrant it."
Ingram is an efficient 24/5/5 player at age 23...who are they supposed to get that’s better than him and fits Zion’s timeline?   Maybe not having so much cash allotted to Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams would help before blaming a young all star forward.
Steven Adams is gonna make sure nobody watches the Heat Nets game
How do you watch this game and think Steven Adams is the problem with this roster?
Steven Adams has 8 offensive rebounds
Steven Adams has 17 siblings? Did I hear that right?!
"Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Solomon hill contract is still paying dividends though"
JJ Reddick Podcast on YouTube. Especially the Steven Adams Episode the
Steven Adams and Jarrett Allen usually play him well. Even if the stats don’t show it for Allen
"Steven Adams is an average at best player, at least for our team."
"The Jazz on off numbers with Rudy show just how valuable he is on defense. Also yea great offensive are gonna manage to score that's why they are the most coveted players in the league. On top of that there are many examples of players just straight up not attempting shots at the rim just because Rudy is there. And he isn't as bad at switching as you make him out to be, he's not Steven Adams. Rudy also doesn't have a player like Ben as a first line of defense."
Steven Adams play him well

"I mean surely him not playing quite as well during some regular season games is ok, he’s not going to compete for championships if he keeps getting hurt either. Like, he should be able to compartmentalize that to some level, because if he keeps playing recklessly (which is how I’d describe it), eventually he’s going to have an injury that he can’t just come back in 2 weeks from. That knee injury was about an inch away from a total knee blowout and it was because of a dumb, unnecessary play. You’d hate to see him have a career altering fall or some Jamal Murray stuff because of a dunk in a blowout. Especially after seeing Jamal’s injury, you don’t want that.  Also dudes his size can start really slowing down if they accumulate too much of that. Steven Adams is only one year older than Embiid and look at how much he has declined"
Steven Adams.
It kinda looks like Steven Adams is going in to support Russ after and realizes they aren't on the same team
Wait did Steven Adams go to dap him up forgetting that both of them are not on the thunder?
Steven Adams
18/19 playoff Adams was the worst big I’ve ever seen in my life. Kanter was fasting and almost passed out multiple times and still made Steven look like a middle schooler.
"Sabonis would be a luxury glue guy somewhere. Isn’t tasked to score alot, just do all the little things which he’s all-star at. Kind of like a better prime Steven adams."
David Griffin trick y'all man. This dude really gave the bag to a declining Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe.
"Steven Adams is Roy Hibberting. He can't defend a pick and roll or block shots anymore, and has been benched in crunch time for Willy Hernangomez in recent games."
Mavericks fan:  How is Steven Adams doing?
"I think the closes player to Bogut right now is probably Steven Adams.  Adams is way too slow on switches though, man gets torched by every guard.   But he has the screen setting, rebounding, can clog the paint on defense and is an ok passer"
"He’s too good offball for a wall to be built on him the whole, and I’m not sure a giannis type wall will work if the pels could put the right players around him and not Bledsoe, Steven adams, and a two way player shown in the clip. I would be much worried about how his defense will look in the playoffs considering he’s not much of a rim protector and he can’t consistently guard the perimeter. Zion really questionable on that side but he can be a draymond type defender if he ever reaches that high of IQ and play with constant effort."
yeah everyone forgot when steven adams was at his best like 4 years ago. he got that monster contract he was on because he looked like a DPOY candidate.
The Steven Adams embarrassment reel.
Zach Lavine is only 4 months older than Kuzma. Siakim being older than Giannis. Steven Adams feels like he should be older than 27.
"Because he went from looking like a bratty kid to aquaman  Young Steven Adams that would irratate people and throw them out was such a different person, if he shaved is beard and got haircut he'd look younger"
Steven Adams and Siakam are the same age (but Siakam only started touching the basketball  at 26)
"that’s not what i said. did you even read my comment?  &gt;	adams and kanter aren’t hitting those outlet passes to a heavily covered russ sprinting down the floor on a fast break. putting the ball directly in his hands and letting him push the pace puts pressure on opposing defenses and creates opportunities for his teammates.  steven adams or enes kanter can barely pass well in a half court setting. they are not going to make an accurate outlet pass to a speeding russ who is being double teamed running up the floor. russ directly getting the ball isn’t just the best option, it’s also the safest option. there’s a reason his teams average less turnovers as a whole when he’s on the court."
"That brings back memories of Steven Adams' handshake with Collison, and then it got sad when he kept doing it after Collison was no longer there."
"He definately is, but he is still overpaid.  I don't think this sub fully appreciates that he's the 14th highest paid player in the league. He's the only guy in the top 20 that hasn't made All NBA. Him, Wiggins, Steven Adams, and Otto Porter Jr are the only  ones in the top *40* that have never made an All-Star game.  He's been a very good player this year, and is a very positive asset on the floor for the Sixers and could help them win a chip this year. But he is still grossly overpaid"
"2020 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 10 minutes per game. 2019 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 25 minutes per game. They did not have a 'better version' of Terrance Ferguson because he was never good. They just did not have anyone at all better than him to play. I'm sorry, but even if your starters consist of Paul George and Russell Westbrook, if your #7 guy is 25 mpg of Terrance Ferguson you are a terribly constructed roster. Period.  Steven Adams averaged 3 less points, Jerami Grant averaged 2 less points, Dennis Schroder averaged 2 less points, Terrance Ferguson averaged 2 less points, Markief Morris averaged 2 less points... all than their regular season averages. The Thunder lost 2 games by 5 points or less, despite getting 11 less PPG of production from their already atrocious bench outside of Schroder.  2020: Shai lost 3, CP3 gained 4, Schroder lost 1.5, Gallo lost 4, Adams lost 1, Dort gained 6, Bazley gained 1, for a net gain of .5 PPG.  So yeah, I'd say losing 11 PPG of production for the 2019 squad while the 2020 squad lost nothing is a pretty big deal. The 2020 squad was also a fair bit better defensively in 2020 than 2019, and defense means more in the playoffs. The 2019 squad's strength was scoring, and the rest of the squad went cold in the playoffs. Russ and PG13 showed up and did their jobs. The bench didn't.  Cp3's run was very impressive, but ultimately he had a deeper roster and better load distribution among the supporting cast."
I think Steven Adams’ is pretty dope  https://bodyartguru.com/steven-adams-tattoo/
"&gt; &gt;1. **Re-Sign Lonzo Ball or let him walk?**   Let RFA play out. New Orleans has the upper hand in regards to holds. Work out a S&amp;T if the price looks to get to be too much.   &gt; &gt;2. **What to do with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?**   Move Bledsoe as salary ballast for a bigger move as MKE did, using actual assets to offset his poor value on the court. This is preferable this off season but could be pushed to trade deadline.   Adams is... Fine. At 17M he's not a value, but not crippling. Jaxson Hayes or a better acquired C can easily take his minutes as season goes on. Again, could be moved as salary ballast in off season or at the deadline.   &gt; &gt;3. **Keep coach Stan Van Gundy?**   SVG is going nowhere. He was brought in for long term development and stability. Considering the next to no off season and limited practice time this season, the individual development of young players has been fine. Team defense has actually improved as the season has gone on. He's likely not the answer for a contender, but he'll get at minimum one more year.   &gt; &gt;4. **What to do with Brandon Ingram?**   Ingram has already been paid. He is a big question long term if his defense doesn't improve, but they will give him at least another year unless the perfect fit alongside Zion becomes available. He fits well with the city of New Orleans and star level players actually wanting to be here should not be taken for granted. If he regresses in fit/defense this can and will be revisited next off season."
I was excited. Until we found out Enes Kanter destroyed Steven Adams left and right. Billy never adjusted. He didn't trap Dame.  Looks at Chicago Bulls right now lol
"Outside of Westbrook and Ibaka, go on in telling me why the 2014 Thunder were so great.   Was it the greatness of Reggie Jackson? Barely in the rotation Steven Adams who was 20 at the time? Washed up Thabo? Washed up Perkins?  Some of you guys make claims with absolutely zero backing and honestly expect it to stick. The best argument is the fact that Westbrook played half the season, but outside of those two it wasn't a good offensive team at all, it was an awful one."
"Unfortunately, there are issues with every component of Westbrook's triple doubles.   POINTS: In most of those 5 years, he ranks in the bottom 20% of the league in all three shooting percentages: 2pt%, 3pt%, FT%. In spite of his thunderous dunks, Westbrook is one of the worst finishers at the rim in the league. Over the past 5 seasons, he has shot 62% from inside 3 feet. The league average is 66%. He shoots well below league average from literally every spot on the court.   ASSISTS: In 4 of the past 5 years, with Westbrook as point guard, his team has finished in the bottom 5 of the NBA in assists per 100 possessions. The exception? The Wizards this year. But that's not because of Westbrook. Last year, the Wizards ranked 15th in assists per 100 and had the 7th lowest turnovers per 100. This year, with the arrival of Westbrook as point guard, the Wizards have declined to 21st in assists per 100 and have the 17th lowest turnovers per 100. Westbrook is leading the league in turnovers per 100 possessions for the 3rd time in 5 years. The other 2 years, he finished 2nd.    REBOUNDS: In OKC, Westbrook convinced Steven Adams to defer to him on defensive rebounds. Adams became the first player in NBA history to have more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds in a season."
"Luka Doncic, Stephen Curry, Steven Adams, Nikola Vucevic, Royce O'Neale"
Now it’s Steven Adams
"If you want non-vanilla answers you'd probably need guys like paul pearce, lance stephenson, morris twins, lopez twins, steven adams, ibaka etc to do ama's not nba super stars...  What's so exciting about an AD/Melo/Lebron/Harden/Westbrook/Donovan mitchell AMA? Nba super stars are in the limelight and write's will definitely take what they say here for an article."
what are they paying steven adams to do exactly
"People have been doing this for years too lmfao.   I’ve seen a post that was twice as long, trying to prove how Russ wouldn’t get triple doubles without Steven Adams. Didn’t age well at all."
"I’m not really sure what you’re arguing here.  You seem to be mad that they’re correctly not penalizing Zion’s brilliant play even tho the team is mediocre— even tho you’re saying he shouldn’t be penalized for “big numbers on a bad team”.  And they’re not even that bad. They’ve hovered around .500; pretty solid considering basically every team ahead of them in the West standings projected to be a better team at the start of the season. And the Eastern conference is the strongest it’s been... this century?  Not every team can win, it’s just not possible. Also: Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe could not be a worse fit next to Zion. Lonzo and Ingram just barely make it work. And he’s still scoring at ridiculous efficiency. If you put him on a good team with good players he’d be unstoppable. I at first thought: “there’s no way I’d take Zion over butler or PG.” Then I thought “wait a minute, he scores 30 and only misses like 4 shots a game, maybe I should take Zion over those guys.”  He’s insanely efficient, and, like you said, that means it’s not empty stats. He’s not totally out of place where he’s ranked. Like everyone else on the list, you could probably argue he deserves to be both 2 spots higher *and* 2 spots lower."
"Ingram is significantly overrated on this sub.   Frankly with Zion’s efficiency that is just out of this world, all Ingram is doing is taking away usage from him.   It should be Zion playing downhill, a rim protector that’s not Steven Adams, and a bunch of shooters."
This play isn't even nearly as bad as what Adams got. Draymond might as well have been an NFL punter with the motion he hit Steven Adams with
he is the paladin of the NBA. steven adams is a barb.  zon wizard  necro assasin druid spots still available.
It's only because Steven Adams boxes out and let's him get the rebound...
"I don't watch much basketball, but the last time I saw him play steven adams boxed everybody out so that westbrook could get the rebound...kind of made the triple double thing less impressive."
And yet Steven Adams has just as many rebounds on the Pelicans as he did on the Thunder. Go figure 🤷🏼‍♂️
Steven Adams
I haven't kept up with the pelicans for the last several weeks - where is Steven Adams?
Steven Adams clip to the front page?
Noooo Steven Adams you aren’t “Deception” or whatever you just said... YOU ARE AQUAMAN
"Somebody needs to turn this into a movie. But get Jason Momoa to play the role of “Steven Adams: T-Rex Pilot,” since it helps to have people who have acted before."
Steven Adams riding on a T-Rex is a force to be reckoned with.
Steven “My Jewels” Adams.
Never understood extending steven adams if Jax is your big of the future.
Imagine someone legitimately getting Steven Adams angry and he fucking whips someone around with the ninja turtle headband. Shit would be awesome.
Steven Adams making $17 mil/year over the next two years is bad  Stan Van Gundy at $7 mil/year is bad  Luke Walton at $5 mil/year is really bad

Steven Adams
"Steven Adams: 4/$100M is probably the worst non-max, but it's finally expiring.    Buddy Hield's 4/$94M is looking like a wild overpay."
Steven Adams
Oh yes a 6th man and Steven Adams what a roster that is.
"I don't think many people saw it from the right angle. Smart's left arm clearly swings upward HARD into Nurk's Nuts while falling downward on his face. That's not a ""natural motion"" any more than Draymond karate kicking Steven Adams in the balls during a shot.   People also underestimate the amount of force being applied because they are watching a slow motion replay. That was a swift and hard sack tap. Neither Smart nor Brad Stevens put up any kind of fuss over it, which is pretty telling, imo. Surely if it was unintentional, they wouldn't have been so calm about the ejection.   I could be completely wrong, but everything I saw suggests otherwise."
"Last year was a different story. Gallinari, Schroder, Steven Adams too"
"didnt he intentionally bean Steven Adams in the nuts twice during those playoffs? it wasn't an isolated incident, theres no way they were gonna let him keep doing it."
"I don't know how to do that, and I would have thought having kiwi in my username would reinforce that.  But sure I'm not actually a Steven Adams fan, I'm just a Pelicans fans that's so ashamed to be a Pelicans fan that they.... wear a Pelicans flair. You really are a complete twat aren't you.  No wait scratch that, I'm the twat for wasting my time responding to you."
"Funny how you don't even have a Steven Adams flair... interesting 🤔     And also, it's ok for you to be a Pelicans fan lol.  You don't have to make excuses for being one."
I literally just told you I'm a Steven Adams fan not an actual Pelicans fan but okay.
"Did you watch the series? Thunder had a very strong squad. KD and Westbrook at the top with Ibaka and Steven Adams being above-average starters and guys like Kanter and Roberson as good role players. I'm not sure why Steph gets dogged on for playing with good players while other guys do exactly the same and receive their due credit. LeBron's probably been on two poorly constructed rosters the last decade and everyone agrees he's the best player of this generation.   For as good as the 2015-16 Warriors were as individual players, their games all depended on what Steph created on the court. He was the engine of their offense and without him that same team is probably a 5th seed."
"Say what you will about Bryan Colangelo, but he made some great talent acquisitions.   Got Lowry basically for the pick that became Steven Adams."
"I’m pretty sure this is half the reason they picked up Steven Adams. He doesn’t really help them much, but he is one of the only bigs strong enough to not get bodied by Zion in the paint. Pretty sure the front office was just thinking “yeah, but...what if he was on our team?”"
Steven Adams and Bledsoe
"I think it's because advanced stats and the nba hive mind in general are so fixated on scoring that people don't give him the respect he deserves.  Man has literally AVERAGED a TD for 3 STRAIGHT SEASONS now, when someone averaging it for ONE season was UNHEARD OF since Big O did it way back in the 60's.  He impacts the floor in ways that 99% of nba guards can't, and that's why it's so hard for the nba fan base and media to grasp what he's doing; and it makes sense. What other guards aside from WB and Big O have you seen have something like a 20/20/20 statline? It makes sense why people had to come up with weird narratives just to comprehend how a 6'3"" point guard could be getting those kinds of statlines (statpadding, Steven Adams being the greatest center in the world and WB just stealing his rebounds, etc.) and not to mention averaging it over multiple seasons.  That, his leadership, his drive, and his willingness to put his body on the line day in and day out for a W, really are intangibles for how important he was for the teams he was on."
"Yes. people always retort to my comments well how do you explain OKC last year. Well OKC had schroder and SGA. Those 2 with CP3 is quality. that's not to mention Dort playing defense, Galo wasn't washed yet. Steven adams was going down hill but was way better than he is this year. It was a quality team. Even a guy like Abdel Nader who they had and we now have is a quality player who plays his role well for his 15 minutes a game. Unfortunately he has been hurt for a while for us."
Steven Adams and Enes Kanter from 2016 actually
Steven Adams+ Jason Mamoa  Ashton Kutcher = Kyle Korver  Danny Green = Lionel Richie  Tyreke Evans= Chris Tucker  Enes Kanter-= Freddie Mercury
"That's really not fair to the Thunder's role players. Sure they had no stars, but literally every one of their rotation players was probably an above average NBA player.  SGA, Schroeder, Gallo, Steven Adams were all above average starters at their position. And their bench had Nerlens Noel and Lu Dort too who are both showing how good they are this year too"
Why won't this dude stop stealing rebounds from Steven adams?
Yeah and he can do that better than Steven Adams lol
Yea dude I remember that time Chris Paul almost castrated Steven Adams
"i used to see comments all the time saying that steven adams getting the ball and throwing a pass halfway down the court to a sprinting russ not only wouldn’t produce 3 or 4 turnovers a game, but was a more efficient play than letting one of the league’s 3 best transition players, you know, transit. made it easy to tell who wasn’t watching film"
"Yes, many teams nowadays don't even start a 7 footer and if they do, he plays low minutes, Russ's own team does this with Alex Len.  Len plays 15 minutes a game and is their ""starting center"", but most of the time the tallest guy on the court for the Wizards is 6-8 Rui Hachimura. Even in OKC when that wasn't the case, Steven Adams didn't focus as much on defensive rebounding as big mens traditionally do and you can see that by his very low defensive rebounding averages in that span for a guy his size.  With that said, Russ is probably the only player in NBA history that can do what he's been doing, maybe the Big O could do the same in today's game, but it's almost impossible to predict what a guy that played 60 years ago could do now. Neither could average a triple double in the 90s and early 2000s though."
"I always thought stealing rebounds thing was overblown. Russ getting a rebound and being able to run in transition is so much more valuable than Steven Adams getting it, so of course their gonna let Russ get the board, it’s a good thing."
If that was true why didn't Steven Adams average more rebounds after Westbrook left?   I'll wait.
"proceeds to out rebound AD and Andre Drummond combined... ""steven adams ghost must be following russ around boxing out for him"" - zach lowe"
"Zion’s shot happened when it was a 2 point game  I agree, Steven Adams and Bledsoe should not be getting clutch shots   I didn’t hate on BI at all. Zion is just statistically a more efficient player, and I’d rather him get the ball in the clutch   BI can be doing his best and it’s still reasonable to want the ball to go to Zion when it’s a close game. He’s literally more likely to score. I’m not upset with BI taking those shots either, I’d just rather it be Zion   I have not seen a single user in here or in the Pels sub say we should trade BI, *especially* not for “scraps”. That’s absurd.   I’ve watched every single Pelicans game this season, btw."
"IMO, he doesn't fit in a 3pt shooting offense. He thrives in an offense with a big who he can work with, a la Steven Adams. And also, Scott Brooks seems to be a common denominator here... lol dude can't coach Russ"
It's because of Steven Adams.
Pels turning it over a lot. Zion held relatively in check. Facu is a defensive monster. Steven Adams is out with a toe sprain for the rest of this one.
that Steven Adams career arc
Steven Adams still living off that hype and got another extension
He got steven adams 25/a year lmao.
Steven Adams plays guitar
"All the contenders have good bigs now, if you don't have anyone who can match up with Jokic, AD, Embiid, Ayton, Gobert, etc... you're going to struggle in a lot of matchups.    When the Warriors were killing people with smallball they were going against guys like Capela, Tristan Thompson, Steven Adams, not world beaters."
"I think that's what I'm confused about. He averages the smallest rebounding distance for all guards in the NBA, and would often clearly hunt them, even sagging off a 3 pt shot to get the rebound. But to say there will never be another player like him shows he thinks this makes him one of a kind.  The rebounding is the only thing to critique, and when you average 8-9 DRPG and 1.5 ORPG it is a lot less impressive than Gobert, Kanter, Capela and Jokic dominating the offensive and defensive boards. Steven Adams was likely the best rebounder in the game when he was with Russ, and he averaged 4.8 ORPG and 4.7 DRPG lol. He was clearly just giving up 3-4 of the uncontested ones to Russ"
"Thunder also had russ, steven adams, and PG13 to trade for picks, the sixers had jrue holiday, evan turner, and spencer hawes"
"Sga, gallinari, Steven Adams, Schroder and dpoy Dort is way worse that wiggins, oubre, and sea dubs? Okc supporting cast doesn’t sound bad at all"
4x clones of Steven Adams linking elbows to form a human shield wall while Tacko Fall stands behind it and throws Inspector Gadget-range punches. Unbeatable.
"Steven Adams, Russle Westbrook,Ben Simmons,Jimmy Butler, and deandre Jordan"
"&gt;This is a really bizarre way of looking at it. Basically, it sounds like the implication is that each counting stat has a positive impact on winning only if the team wins.  This is literally the opposite of what I'm arguing. My point is that effect of Russ chasing triple doubles needs to be measured by looking at all games, not just the games he succeeds at getting the triple double.  He tries to get a triple double every game, and the question is whether that strategy is effective or not. You can't answer that question by just looking at the games where he succeeds at getting a triple double.  For an extreme example: If Draymond shot 20 3PA every game, his team would have a great record in the games when he made 8+ 3P. But that wouldn't tell you whether Draymond shooting 20 3PA/G is a good strategy.  &gt;Also, haven't enough people already proven that his hunting for rebounds doesn't effect the rebound rate of the bigs on his teams?  I can't imagine how anyone could possibly make this claim. His hunt for rebounds very obviously affected the rebound rate of bigs on his team.   Steven Adams' DRB% (percentage of defensive rebound he grabbed) increased 60% the year after Russ left. Meanwhile, Russ's DRB% crashed when he went to Houston.  DRB% by season:  |Season|Russ|Adams| |:-|-:|-:| |2016-17|28.8|15.4| |2017-18|25.7|13.9| |2018-19|28.3|14.8| |2019-20|18.1|24.0|  Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#advanced) Generated 4/27/2021.  Honestly, I can't imagine anyone even making this argument. Where do you think those extra defensive rebounds came from?"
Yeah dude should have been letting Steven Adams and Andre Roberson initiate some offense. You're a clown
Svg might need to go. And Steven Adams is complete and total garbage. Can't guard anybody.
I used to think westbrook was a stat ladder and that Steven adams would let WB take his rebounds. After seeing Westbrook get triple doubles over multiple seasons on different teams I’m happy to admit I was wrong  This dude balls every fucking night. You see some guys phone it in all the time and this guy just gives you everything. Absolutely the type of bloke you want on your team as a fan.
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
Lol someone’s gotta edit Giannis saying this after Russ runs Pat Bev into the Steven Adams screen
Steven Adams might have been able to handle a Boogie post-up if he'd played tonight but our young center just got spun out the way like a rag doll lol
No worries! Always been a big Russ fan as I liked OKC because of Steven Adams being a fellow Kiwi.
"“Russ, you’ve played with a lot of talent in your career. Who would you put as your top 5 teammates?”  “Ah well it’s gotta be Brad, James, Serge, Dipo...”  “Aren’t you missing someone? From OKC?”  “Oh yeah you right...I’m trippin. Can’t have done this without Steven Adams”"
"Lots of guys could be averaging triple doubles if they hunted uncontested rebounds. Trae Young already has the points and assists, if Capela and Collins pulled a Steven Adams and let him get every rebound while they box out, he could get 10 rpg easy"
"lol Steven Adams, Bledsoe, Herro, and Covington are the ones that put it over the top for me"
or Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams lol the whole pelicans starting five is better than DeRozans according to ESPN.
Idk man. Is he better than Steven Adams? Eric Bledsoe? Tyler Herro? Seems like a stretch to me.
"Yeah, Zion should improve his rebounding as his game develops but regardless being outrebounded by Josh Hart on your team isn't the best look. Although Josh Hart grabbing 8 boards a game is kinda nuts. Steven Adams GOAT box-outter apparently LOL"
"Or maybe we’ll sign Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe to- oh, wait."
CP3 might turn it down for a longer contract like Horford or Hayward. But the best way to get him might to be trade and extend like the Pelicans did with Steven Adams.
That giant lineup featuring Steven Adams and Enes Kanter was just pure sex to watch on the boards as a Thunder fan. I legitimately could not believe Billy was willing to try it in that series.
I’d take him over Steven Adams
Steven Adams approves this comment.
That’s nothing we have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
we need talent  if Zion has to share the starting lineup with Eric Bledsoe &amp; Steven Adams for another season I might request a trade.
"&gt;Steven Adams, and Bledsoe  Tbf. At the start of the season, people said these were horrible roster additions  And they were right. This reddit did not like them in terms of spacing and Bledsoe had a horrible playoff showing.  The nba reddit prob didn't see Randle's jump coming at all though"
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they’d rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I’m not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion’s efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
"Trade Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe , figure out my life with Lonzo and surround him with shooters   Brandon Ingram is a top 10 scorer in the league (averaging 25+ on high efficiency with the worst spacing in the league) . Get 3 and D defenders and you’re a championship contender for the next 10 years . Personally I wouldn’t let go of Lonzo but BI and Zion are a very very very good core . And fire Stan Van Gundy.   I don’t completely blame him as Bledsoe and Adams do put you in a horrible place in today’s NBA but he’s not it ."
"They got a handful of vets that were... meant to be locker room leaders...  J.J. Redick, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe...  And the guys like them but they didn't establish a culture the way Julius Randle has for the Knicks. Or Jimmy Butler for the Heat. Or Chris Paul/The Suns. Conley is that dude on the Jazz.  We just don't have that."
Ingram never gets to the rim ? Maybe cause he's playing w. Zion and Steven Adams.   Ingram specialty is getting to the rim and mid range. And he can also shoot the 3 better than derozan ever did.   Ingram for KP would be the dumbest trade on earth
imho the Pelicans should try trading Steven Adams for Nikola Jokic
Shooters so that Zion can more freely drive and that Ingram actually has space to iso. People were calling him inefficient but that’s a huge part of it  Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe are dogshit fits and are also on trash contracts
Al Horford for Steven Adams /s
I think people would get the picture when they see that the corpse of Steven Adams and Lonzo Ball of all people are the best defenders on the team
"Not Steven Adams clogging the paint for Zion.  Zion works best as a paint beast, he needs either a stretch 5 or he needs to be playing at the 5. They also need reliable shooters around him"
they need to hope some dumbass team takes steven adams and lonzo out of their hands     pelicans need actual paint defense and facilitators
Lmao Steven Adams??
"Zion takes away too many shots from Steph, and who is gonna play defense? Steven Adams?"
Steven Adams
"I actually agree in principle, but my line is much further than KOC's. I probably **would** take him over Steven Adams going into the 2021-2022 season. But definitely not Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Jrue Holiday, or some of the other players in this list.  As a proximation, there are probably 60-90 players I'd take over Stevens. But at a certain point, I'd take him over some player at their contract.  And for a coach like Nurse, it might be closer to 40-70."
Caruso Reddick Ingles Joe Harris Duncan Robinson Steven Adams Olynyk McConnell etc
"Ibaka, Steven Adams, Reggie Jackson, dion waiters is a better supporting cast than most teams with 2 MVP caliber players have. It’s not like they were playing with a bunch of bums"
"I mean, OKC still had SGA and Schroder (back when he was shooting well) and Gallo and Steven Adams. That team was pretty solid 1-6. This Phoenix team is talented, but without Booker they’re lacking any sort of scoring punch."
Harden + Durant for Steven Adams
Ibaka? Andre Roberson? Steven Adams? in 13-14 they were 5th defensively. You’re just flat out wrong.
"He was hurt for a good portion of 2019, but when he was healthy he was putting up better numbers than he did in 2018.  I remember people saying Steven Adams was better than him, and I like Steven Adams and think he’s fairly underrated too, but Clint Capela is definitely better, and in a pretty big way."
If I've learned anything recently its that no contract is untradeable. Maybe you guys could deal him for Horford and run it back with him?  How about a package that brings Steven Adams and Lonzo to Boston for Kemba and some other pieces.
"I don’t understand how anyone can hate on Russ in the 2017 playoffs. Sure, he wasn’t very efficient but who the fuck else was gonna take shots? Should OKC have banked on Steven Adams and pre-pubecesent Oladipo instead?"
he was stealing rebounds from steven adams as usual smh
If you look closely you'll see Steven Adams still out there giving Russ all his rebounds.
Steven Adams was boxing out for him
Steven Adams
"Yeah, the dude literally taught Steven Adams to shoot those overhand. Amazing he's finding ways to play through it effectively."
Bruh what a casual take. I thought I was having an intelligent conversation but you think Steven Adams would have been better than Porzingis. Like do you even watch an NBA game for the full 48 minutes. Adams has no offensive game whatsoever and would get cooked by Reggie Jackson on defense.
I think Steven Adams is too low key for Inside the NBA
All Draymond had to do was not tackle Michael Beasley or kick Steven Adams in the dick that same playoffs and he would've been fine
Imagine getting jumped by Zion and Steven Adams
"Similarly, if Steven Adams didn't nearly kill people with screens sometimes I think he'd be the runaway favorite. He's my favorite player for sure."
"im a big fan of lebron but man, its crazy how separated from reality these nba superstars are. not just lebron but in general, this is a fucking resort, not a war zone. steven adams got so much more respect than he already had after his take about the bubble. yea yea i get it, you are away from your family for 3 months, but its not like they are dying or some shit, its not like youre being held hostage and tortured and youre also getting pain millions for doing it."
Yall remember him trying to push steven adams? Shit was hilarious
Steven Adams?
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
Lmao Steven Adams on a rugby pitch would be hilarious. They’d all look like children next to him. A lot of ankle biting id imagine.
"I'm actually one of the few Knicks fans who has a positive perception of KP(our front office screwed the whole situation up which is pretty clear as day to see), so I'm definitely not looking for a reason to shit on him. Also I don't think anyone is saying he's a bonafide scrub, criticism towards him is being levied when you factor in the fact that he's on a max contract.   Taking all this into consideration his RPM isn't very good, 27th among centers puts him below Jarett Allen And Daniel Theis, he rebounds as much as Steven Adams does while being 4 inches taller but with less offensive rebounds. His shooting splits aren't great, either except his freethrows considering his height and he's totally exploitable in small ball lineups.  KP would be a fine player on a smaller contract but at 32M a season he's not that good."
Oladipo was not that good (he literally won MIP the next season) and sabonis averaged 4 points lol  Steven adams would be like the 4th best player on this warriors team
That team has been been terrible he’s been great. They have Steven Adams playing center
"If we're being real, the ""Win now LAC"" are about to be dead. They're not a top 5 team in the league, probably not top 10.   Their best bet is to blow it up, trade PG/Kawhi for picks, use cap room to assume bad contracts(Steven Adams) in exchange for players or picks. In a couple years they could have a good young team again"
It's like when Steven Adams said guarding the Warriors was hard because you had to chase the little monkeys around or something like that. He meant it as how you would refer to little kids running around everywhere but obviously had to apologise to the guys once he learnt the proper context.
"I’ll give Crowder a pass here. he had a human being fly at him unexpectedly And I think he reacted more to try to protect himself than to try to actually push DS. He had no idea Booker was going to straight shove DS like that, so from Crowder’s perspective a guy who was taking off toward the basket just suddenly re-directed in mid-air right at him from close range and he didn’t have any time at all to carefully consider what was happening and just reacted. It would have been better if he had reacted by trying to catch DS, but not everyone can be Draymond Green saving Klay or Steven Adams saving some guy I can’t remember, some guys are like me: someone lobs a can of beer/soda at me with little warning and I react by slapping it out of the air instead of catching the unexpected object."
I watch the Steven Adams screen on pat bev like 1x a month for this same reason
"&gt;Are you comparing Tim Duncan to Mike Conley?  You realize he retired by 2016 because he got played off the court by Steven Adams?  In 2011 he got annihilated by Z-Bo-MG, he was the 3rd best big on the floor that series.  In the playoffs dudes like Ibaka-Perkins were having games where they shot 18-20, 90% against him &amp; Ibaka had a historical 12-12 100% shooting game.  Please stop pretending this is prime TD from 2004 a decade earlier, its insulting.    Kawhi came alive in the playoffs when TP was injured &amp; Pop was forced to play him, check his stats against Miami.  Like I said nobody was a top 10-15 player, the most productive LA was there was a 23-8rpg player, hardly superstar."
I would like to see Steven Adams run into the stands and beat one of these guys to death.
The lower one to the great chagrin of Steven Adams.
lmao can you even imagine zion williamson or steven adams sprinting at you with a murderous look on their face?  I'd probably die of fright.
Think about that though. They traded one of the best defenders in the league and took back a player that they have to pay another team to take.  They then proceeded to trade a better point guard for Steven Adams and signed him to an extension.  Like did he do anything last offseason that legitimately improved the team?
It would take every pick to get him and unload Bledsoe  So Jrue + Ingram for PG... great moves  But hey at least George Hill became Steven Adams hahahah
"tbf i think he knows he has no leg to stand on if he tries to talk back. he knows his place. when he famously got demolished by Steven Adams on a screen, he didn't complain. he laid on the ground for a second, got up, just acknowledged that he was okay. he knew why he got pulverized."
Something like PG for Steven Adams(terrible/big contract) plus picks or young players would be ideal for them
"I'd happily take a contested stepback 3 over leaving Pat Bev, Reggie Jackson, Morris, etc. on an island lmao. The idea that it's just completely impossible to get over the bone crushing screens by such monstrous brickhouses like Kristaps Porzingis and Maxi Kleber is also funny; they ain't Steven Adams or Zach Randolph bruh."
Steven Adams just had flashbacks.
He kicked Steven Adams in the nuts like 2 times.
Shades of Steven Adams.
"I was just making fun of the Warrior fans that said ""Shooting motion"" when Draymond did it to Steven Adams. Haha"
Of course they brought up the Draymond Steven Adams incident Hahaha
Steven Adams vibes
"Steven Adams was almost unusable defensively if he had to get out of the paint this year. He rebounded good but much like in years past, he floundered about a quarter of the year in.   Kira wasn’t good most nights, but he gave effort every time he was on the floor. But we’re not talking about Kira. The problem is that you had Josh hart and NAW who outplayed Bledsoe most of the year (hart outplayed him the entire year pre injury) yet Bledsoe consistently got the preferential treatment and SVG would go as far as to COMMEND Eric for his toughness and defense. Yet blast the rest of the team any chance he got. So nah man,...it ain’t just guys being coached too hard. There is absolutely more to it than that. You can’t scream one thing and then allow that same shit to go down for your vets just because they’re vets. He’s always been this guy and always will. He wasn’t the right coach whether he’s as bad a coach as he looked this year or not."
He’s Steven Adams fav so he’s my fav
"He shot 68.1 on 326 attempts this season. So even with covid bringing down his numbers, he’s been impressive.   Some guys with more attempts, lower percentage include  Zach Lavine: 65.5 on 388 attempts  Simmons: 65.7 on 364 attempts  Dame: 61 on 359 attempts  ——————————————  Less attempts, lower percentage:  Butler - 67.4 on 307 attempts  KAT - 67.8 on 289  Kyrie - 60.4 on 255  Steph - 64.6 on 268  Harden - 63.2 on 212  Steven Adams: 67.7 on 220  Ingram: 66.1 on 177  ——————————————   Close percentage wise on less attempts:   Doncic - 68.9 on 283 attempts   Embiid - 68.9 on 238 attempts"
Yeah but jokic has never kicked Steven Adams in the balls. That's mvp material right there.
"Wait, you absolutely can, players do this all the time.  Steven Adams would regularly rest his sweaty gross bearded face right on the other guy's shoulder, usually to irritate them into doing something dumb, like shoving someone and getting a flagrant foul.  It's a shitty, annoying thing to do, but it's not anything we haven't seen before.  edit: That said, I think a double tech would have been totally reasonable in this situation as well, esp with how the game was kind of getting chippy.  And I usually hate double techs."
Steven Adams ones sure. But others not so much. Draymond didn't even touch LeBron
Jokic should come back tatted up with long hair like Steven Adams next season. Maybe he'll get a better whistle if the refs are both terrified of him physically and aware he's coming off a MVP season.
That move on Lebron was the final straw but he kinda deserved some punishment after destroying any chance that Steven Adams can reproduce
"I don't defend it. I just accept that players I'm a fan of will do some shit I don't like (Steven Adams excluded so far). I will also say I'm becoming less and less of a fan as time goes on. I still want him to get all time points and 1-2 more rings, but goddamn he makes it tough sometimes lol."
"Enes and Steven Adams are both proven players and not shots in the dark based off some isolated plays at random times throughout the regular season. Way different. What if they play this Gill guy and he just completely shits the bed. It’s a possibility, he isn’t proven. Why risk that, when it also completely ruins what’s been working for you up to this point?  I respect your take but gotta be realistic."
"As with the Steven Adams revenge screen clip, I will be watching this repeatedly."
Steven Adams  Dude is like Korg. Chill Kiwi fella
Blake is literally Steven Adams level athletic out there what the fuck happened man did he get Monstarred
"SOO much better than this.   In his NBA seaason, Westbrook had: a young but good Oladipo, Roberson for defense, Steven Adams/Taj Gibson for interior presence, Kanter for scoring and young McDermott/Grant/Sabonis.   That's a lotta length and multiple iso scorers."
"Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo and Steven adams should be enough to get to the postseason. I'm not saying they need to be a top seed here but how much help does he need.  Pressure should 100% be on zion next season to make a postseason appearance."
"In their first full seasons without Kevin Durant: Westbrook won MVP, averaged a triple double (first player since 1962), and made the playoffs. Curry missed the playoffs.  Westbrook best teammates were Oladipo, Kanter, Roberson, and Steven Adams  Curry best teammates are Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, and Oubre.  I didn’t count last year for Steph as he wasn’t healthy, but he played 65/74 available games for golden state so I’m considering this a full season for Curry."
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion’s? Fit is one thing, but he’s playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"I mean Zion is the better player. He didn't play much last year, but he proved it this year. What he did was unreal for a guy in his sophomore season, but the Pelicans can't put a team together worth shit. The fact that they went out and got Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe this year is atrocious from a team building aspect. You just have to hope the picks they got along with Bledsoe for Jrue pan out to some worth.  All the respect to Ja though. Zion and Ja are both future superstars in this league."
"I mean you’d think with all their talent they’d be able to scrape up something but nope.  Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball as a young core  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, (formerly) JJ Reddick As your vets. A lot of talent on paper."
Adams was and is a good player and Roberson made all-defense that season lol. Curry would've KILLED for prime Steven Adams in place of Wiseman or a real all-defensive team level wing this season lmao.
Russell Westbrook  Allen Iverson  Hakeem Olajuwon  Tim Duncan  Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony  Steph Curry  Dwyane Wade  Steven Adams  Kobe B Bryant  Edit: Toronto Kawhi belongs here too
1. Dirk Nowitzki   2. Steve Nash  3. Rik Smits  4. John Stockton  5. Larry Bird  6. JJ Redick  7. Steven Adams  8. Kevin Love  9. Brad Miller  10. Bill Walton
steven adams posted a pic of a Smothered Mate on twitter last year lmao
"I mean I guess but he gave them 7 years and they couldnt surround him with talent outside of that boogie/jrue/rondo stint so he left, he could have gone about it better but do we really blame him for leaving? many stars have done the same to better teams. Also they got Zion out of it (but tbh, theyre not really surrounding Zion with optimal talent either, steven adams 35m really??) its not like a lebron leaving the cavs situation leaving them in lottery hell. But majority of the top comments were not pelicans fans anyways"
"BREAKING: Lil' Stevie Adams speaks out as a Philadelphia court decides neither of his parents, [Joel Embiid &amp; Russell Westbrook](https://nothingbutnylon.com/joel-embiid-russell-westbrook-steven-adams/), who have been in the midst of a nasty divorce for four years, will have custody of the child.  You want in-depth, hard-hitting, child-exploiting journalism, and Raymond Tortuga delivers it [time and time again](https://nothingbutnylon.com/topic/satire/)."
"There are a lot of bad contracts that could use an amnesty: Kevin Love, John Wall, Al Horford, Steven Adams just to name a few"
Pels Twitter would argue  Steven Adams was number 1  Damn them centres that ain’t stretch 5s
"Last year they had Jrue Holiday, 2019-20 JJ Redick, and Derrick Favors  This year they had Eric Bledsoe, 2020-21 JJ Redick, and Steven Adams"
Where was Steven Adams with the 2 rebounds he needed
"I hate it when reporters do that, Wildhorst does that all the time, says he has a thing to say, but can't say it. Yet, I'd rather them do that than report rumors and unsubstantiated claims.  For Zion though, I get it, that front office has done a pretty poor job with not just trading for, but also extending Steven Adams and trading George Hill but keeping Bledsoe."
I tried that:  Pete Lalich (1 game in 1946-47)  and   Will Magnay (3 minutes this season)      Will Magnay -&gt; Steven Adams (2020/21 Pelicans)     Steven Adams -&gt; Derek Fisher (2013/14 Thunder)     Derek Fisher -&gt; Jerome Kersey (1996/97 Lakers)     Jerome Kersey -&gt; Maurice Lucas (1987/88 Blazers)     Maurice Lucas -&gt; Herm Gilliam (1976/77 Blazers)     Herm Gilliam -&gt; Bob Cousy (1969/70 Royals)     Bob Cousy -&gt; Clarence Hermsen (1950/51 Celtics)     Clarence Hermsen -&gt; Pete lalich (1946/47 Rebels)
It’s crazy this sub had more energy for the Wes and Draymond call than Draymond slapping LeBron’s eye moments prior. The illegal screen literally doesn’t happen if Draymonds tossed from the game.   And the irony here is if it were the 16 warriors you already know this sub would be going after Draymond like when he kicked Steven Adams in the balls.
Muggsy and Steven adams was interesting
No way lol people were saying that during the OKC series too when he couldnt even get past Steven Adams on the perimeter after cooking people all season.  It just got drowned out by all the people who somewhat understandably wanted to see the warriors fail.
"But you love Draymond who poked Harden in the eye twice in the same series, hit Steven Adams in the crotch twice, purposely tried to injure Westbrook, and has now hit LeBron in the eye for the **second time**"
he kicked steven adams in the nuts 3 times in the 2016 playoffs
And kicking Steven adams in the nuts
"Steven Adams, Andre Drummond, Cody Zeller, Mason Plumlee. Those kinds of guys are overhated because they don’t fit mainstream conventions of what a basketball fan thinks makes a good center. Fact is that they come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Not every good center is a floor spacer, efficient scorer, or switchable defender. That said, that does not make them bad players because they all have pretty great talent, it’s just not as visible as it would be with a center who fits into the modern paradigm."
I'm impartial to neither team but Draymond can't jump and he's literally colliding with the freight train known as LeBron James.     That wasn't a dirty play like the Steven Adams nutshot.     We literally saw Draymond try to dunk TWICE this game and he had no hangtime.
"No no, this is the same bullshit as natural shooting motion, when he definitely did not attempt and succeed to kick the balls of Steven adams."
You have other choices to fill out the bench!  Gilbert Arenas - Agent Zero  Steven Adams - Aquaman  Dwyane Wade - Flash  Scottie Pippen - Robin  Andre Miller - The Professor  Harrison Barnes - Black Falcon  A.C. Green - Iron Man  Darius Miles - The Punisher  Xavier McDaniel - X-Man
"1. You base all that on the fact that he relies entirely in his athleticism. You want to believe that because he has a poor shot selection, according to you again, that he has a low BBIQ. But his assists totals completely disprove that.  1. No, most top guards aren't better defender than rw that's just laughable.   1. From the list you make, none of those role players would be hindered by playing with rw. Iguodala main role is running the 2nd team, that's hardly clashing. Yeah slashers role player like aaron gordon don't really fit with rw but there aren't many of those in the league. Sabonis growth is natural, that's called growing into your prime, same for Dipo, I don't see what's unnatural with it.  1. Ofc he ""hunts"" triple double to some extent, who doesn't want a player making 10+ assists, points &amp; rebounds ? Point me a player that's going to avoid making assists in order to not score a triple double maybe ? On the rebound category, first players leaving westbrook don't see an uptick in their rebounding averages : [just look at Steven Adams numbers if you don't believe me](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html). 2nd every team wants russ to make those rebounds because of the fastbreak that results in those. I know it isn't a flashy TS% stat, but fastbreak is still an important component of NBA basketball.  1. You found a total whooping of 1 game where KD carried russ lmao. Congrats on proving how hard he was carried by KD  1. Oh yeah, the spurs didn't have a trio of superstars, the Dirk title didn't have a stacked mavs team and the 2012 2016 warriors had virtually 0 allstars. Thanks for your contribution to the list of team who had playoff success without 2+ allstars lmao."
"LeBron took the same Warriors team to 6 games the year before with Mosgov, JR Smith, &amp; Delladova as his supporting cast. I think he would have been fine with Serge, Russ, &amp; Steven Adams."
Exactly. It’s such a low possibility he gets close to dpoy or an allstar game. This is going to be the next Steven Adams contract.
they should.  if the report is true this is stupid.  reminds me a little bit of the Steven Adams in OKC.  they likely won't be regretting that he's around but it will be pretty obvious that he's over paid.
Memes aside Steven Adams is probably the best in the league at this.
"&gt;Putting Zion together with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe is not good lmao.  This sub fuckin acts like those guys are just immovable lmao  The Pelicans clearly didn't trade for Bledsoe, he was salary along with picks, unfortunately he played way worse than anyone could imagine so he couldn't be moved at the deadline."
"The man averaged 27 on 60% shooting without a jumpshot with Steven Adams as his starting center lmao  Forget BI, Lonzo all of them, wtf were they thinking extending him lol"
Putting Zion together with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe is not good lmao. 2 subpar shooters and non shooting center. Then you have BI who probably wants to be the main guy instead of the robin.
"Reminds me of [Steven Adams](https://youtu.be/c5V-9OZvl1c) intentionally hitting the rim, then giving it to Russ for 3. Amazing accuracy for a 50% free throw shooter!"
"Right check out Steven Adams missed FT (there’s a famous clip of him doing just this). However even in that case, it’s still statistically a bad decision if you do it over and over again, which you are asking about. Keep in mind even if you do get the rebound, you still have to score for it to be worth it (some threshold % of the time)."
Trevor Ariza was supposed to box out Steven Adams idk wtf the other guy talking about
High risk and the best moment anyone pulled it off was Steven Adams to Westbrook. And that was a different situation where the other team wouldn't have been expecting it. And also a lot of fucking luck to pull it off so perfectly lol: https://youtu.be/c5V-9OZvl1c
"It’s statistically not the right decision. You even said it in your last line. Even when Paul George tried to do it (and he’s a decent shooter so he probably can do a better job at aiming where to miss too), it failed both times. So over the long run, it’ll fail a lot more often then it will succeed. Keep in mind even when it succeeds, your team still has to score off of it to be rewarded. Otherwise you were better off just making the free throw. So it makes it even more statistically unlikely in that sense. Sure sometimes you can surprise the other team (see Steven Adams missed free throw) but it’ll be like once every 10 games or so."
Steven Adams had a nice missed free throw in the 2017 playoffs.   [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-9OZvl1c)
If only they had Steven Adams
And Steven Adams
Fuck pat bev. Ayton please screen him like Steven Adams
Steven Adams
"Steven Adams. We’ve only had 3 players to play in the NBA which are Steven, Kirk Penny, and Sean Marks, and of all of those 3 Steven is easily the best. And better than any player currently in our country.   The best player not in the NBA is either Tai Webster, or Finn Delany, and both play for the New Zealand Breakers"
Steven Adams. New Zealand.
"&gt; his contract is extremely valuable  This also drives me crazy! Feels like there are a bunch of great centres (from Jokic/Embiid/AD to Bam/KAT/Ayton [not exhaustive, not in a meaningful order]) and then there are a heap of mediocore-to-ok centres, with a lot of them on bad contracts. We have a rare good centre on (imo) a good contract who can play alongside Giannis with the option to stretch and hit open threes if his man joins the wall against Giannis.  I just don't know who they think is the better option. Outside of the greats it's a sad, sad world full of $29 million Steven Adams and Aron Baynes."
&gt;Draymond ready to kick his feet up when it comes to scoring   *Steven Adams has left the chat*
"I actually came around a lot on CP3 during his season with the Thunder. He could have demanded a trade and ring chased as he *appeared* to be on the tail end of his career at that point, but instead he changed his diet, stayed healthy, and pushed a team most people expected to be tanking to the 5th seed in the west with his best partners being a second year SGA and Steven Adams. I don't know, I respected that in a time where top talent are demanding trades left and right.  Obviously, this season has also helped significantly improve my opinion of him too."
Probably not as [Steven Adams](https://youtu.be/Dy3cmIq6kFQ) felt about them though.
you're looking at steven adams per game #'s for boxing out. that's total number of box outs divided by games played. Adams boxed out 225 players over 58 games played.  225/58 =\~3.9  [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs/?sort=BOX\_OUTS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs/?sort=BOX_OUTS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals)
What was the vision in having Steven Adams at C?
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
"I don’t agree. I think a team’s effectiveness is like 90% personnel and 10% coaching. A new coach isn’t going to magically make Steven Adams any less slow footed and lumbering. He could help with Ingram though, he at least has decent enough measurements and athleticism to be a plus defender."
"Damn, I didn’t know you were a clairvoyant. Can you tell me next week’s lottery numbers too?  Even if they are, that’s good for a rebuilding team. Late firsts spaced out over a long period of time can be used to trade for good role players once they’ve got their core set. They were never getting a top 10 pick or a top-tier young prospect for Jrue in the first place and that’s the only thing better.  They also got George Hill, who had value at the time. They wasted it by trading him for Steven Adams and giving him a fat extension but he was there all the same."
"I mean, Jokic/Embiid/Giannis/Gobert, possibly the four best bigs in basketball, are all foreign. There are also plenty of other quality foreign bigs in the league (Sabonis, Nurkic, Steven Adams). It’s the one position the world has the US beat."
"They should have traded for him back when he was on the Pelicans for Al Horford and picks. I’ve always thought Horford would be a good fit next to Zion, certainly better than Steven Adams"
"Uh. Curry got taken to school by Heurter because he is absolutely trash on defense. He’s a horrible defender.   I swear this sub things points = value.  Simmons is absolutely worth a max deal in the reality of what a max deal means.   Sure there are guys potentially better than him making marginally less, but other max (or near max) guys are:  * Steven Adams * Al Horford * Porzingis * Russell * Wiggins * Harris * Conley * John Wall  If you replace anyone of those guys with Simmons are the 6ers better? I would say file that under “hell no”."
"Extension off the option. As in he picks up the option, and then the extension is tacked onto the option. So next year would be the 44 M, and then the lesser extension would follow that.         Pelicans did something similar with Steven Adams, trading for him on the last year of his deal, and then signing him to a cheaper, but longer extension."
"LeBron missed 1/3 of the season that year. Give him a full year with the current versions of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams and he's gonna make the playoffs."
Where is Steven Adams to lay his ass out.
Or Steven Adams again
i’ll raise you Steven Adams AND Eric Bledsoe. take it or leave it
"That's gotta be a two-way street. From my perspective, Zion seems like he wants to win more than the team does. There isn't really alignment on goals. Otherwise, it's hard to understand how they thought taking a team that didn't make the playoffs, removing Jrue Holiday/Derrick Favors and adding Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams was going to be a winning formula.  The team has more assets to use to build a better team but they seemed relatively content being a subpar team this year. Zion from his side seems pretty intent on winning. This is a guy who came back to play for Duke after a knee injury when he could have easily sat out and still been the #1 pick in the draft. Obviously he's far from a perfect player, but I'm not sure you could realistically ask more from him this past year."
"He wrote “SPG” on his shoes for starting point guard. So yes, over Westbrook. And Steven Adams mentioned in his book how Reggie thought he should start over Russ. Add that and how he beefed with us after he was traded and it’s pretty obvious why OKC fans don’t like him"
"It's a serious problem for him. If he can't shoot, can't defend wings, and needs the ball in his hands, you need to really craft his supporting cast carefully. It's a way more difficult problem than people are making it out to be imo, although anyone who has watched about 5 minutes of basketball could have told you that Steven Adams was a bad fit."
"Keep in mind Curry had Klay and Draymond, while KD had guys like Westbrook, Ibaka, 6MOTY Harden, and some other good role players before joining the Warriors. Zion is doing this with Eric Bricksoe, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Steven Adams as his best 4 players."
"Well, I’m for them bringing back carrying, cuz I see ppl irl and on tv carry every dribble and it’s frustrating as hell. It’s not that much more difficult to dribble correctly. You can still cross ppl over and break ankles. You just have to be faster.  But, back then the shooting percentages were lower and they were milkmen so they missed a lot of shots and the big men feasted. Now everyone makes every shot cuz that’s all they do all day and rebounds go further out cuz everyone’s shooting threes. It’s prob easier for guards to get triple doubles now due to this. Back in the day Oscar Robertson had to go above and around Kareem to get boards. Steven Adams just gave them to Westbrook lol."
Kawhi post 2017  Beverley  Avery Bradley  Rondo  Russ  PG post shoulder injuries  Covington to an extent (some people still think he is good on ball)  Brogdon   Bledsoe  Ayton was underrated but now people act like he is a great defender because he was good on Jokic and AD : he is an elite post defender/one on one defender but still just ok as a help defender  Steven Adams
"All 3 of their salaries combined is equal to what Steven Adams makes. If you’re trading 1 of your 3 best players, who is also your 2nd leading scorer, you’d at least want someone who can step in and make a major impact on offense to help Luka. Not a guy averaging 8 PPG with a limited ability to stretch the floor, which is partially to explain why he’d be available for trade in the first place.  You are also correct about Dallas’ front office. I was referencing their shadow GM who has a different idea for how teams should be built."
Isn’t “average” a little generous to Ben? I swear to god I’ve seen Javale McGee and Steven Adams do more for their teams in the halfcourt
"&gt; As if the mf didn't play in lineups with Andre Roberson and Steven Adams, and go to WCF and Finals with similarly bad spacing.  that was a loooong time ago now though. things were different back then"
"&gt; If you have 2 guys that can’t shoot, your offense is inherently worse.  The amount of times I've seen this for Russ, when people talk about why Capela got traded.  As if the mf didn't play in lineups with Andre Roberson and Steven Adams, and go to WCF and Finals with similarly bad spacing. So while it's great to have, it doesn't have to be perfectly fucking optimized to see success lol."
"You guys also need to figure out a way to get rid of Steven Adams. Having him, Turner and Hayes together would be a mess."
"&gt;made the WCF with the Rockets in 2018  With James Harden.  &gt;carried an OKC tank squad to the playoffs,   With a bunch of players who turned out to actually be pretty good, between SGA, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Dort, Noel.  &gt;made the WCF with the Suns in 2021  With Devin Booker playing at a superstar level and Ayton being one of the best 2-way bigs in the playoffs, and with his competition being the Lakers without AD, the Nuggets without Jamal Murray, and now the Clippers without Kawhi."
"Yeah, because Zion isn't being used as a PG and is surrounded by fucking eric bledsoe and steven adams lmao   Use your brains."
"Just like Zion averaging 27 ppg on 60% shooting next to Steven Adams, its a miracle Embiid is this dominant playing with Ben  He quite literally got locked out of the paint by the Hawks due to Ben. Had to resort to midrangers and he's so good that he makes them but the reason that he gets doubled and even tripled so much is cause of Ben  Also Doc's shitty rotations. Playing 10 guys in a game 7, playing Shake Milton in 4th quarter minutes, and running a Ben and Matisse lineup of course the spacing is gonna be trash lmao"
David Griffin should have some voodoo committed against him if he makes that deal. Imagine Steven Adams next to Ben
"Andre Drummond, al horford, Steven adams, buddy hield"
and Steven Adams. Oh wait.
Im suddenly happy that Steven Adams is flying the NZ flag
"I mean, the Thunder and Suns have the similarity of having good players that were underrated by the general population.   The Suns were the 10 seed as a young team whose 2nd best player missed 25 games, and they were clearly on the come-up by the end of the season. The fact that most people didn't recognize them as a team that was going to do well this season doesn't mean that you can just give Chris Paul all the credit.   Similarly, with OKC, they got rid of Gallo, Schroeder, CP3, Steven Adams, and Noel, and replaced them all with pretty much young/bad/developing players, and were still the 11 seed at 19-24 pretty deep into the season.   If Shai was healthy the whole year and the team hadn't shut down Horford, there's a good chance they would've made at least the play-ins despite actively trying to tank.   I don't disagree that Paul makes these teams better, but so would any All-Star player. Both the Suns and Thunder have very good foundations that the media/general population don't appreciate, so they chalk it up to Paul's intangibles to cover for their misevaluation."
"They really are tbh.  It depends.  Many teams scheme to get their guards rebounds now because it gets the ball in their hands.  Russel Westbrook is not a better rebounder than Steven Adams if they go 1 on 1, but Adams was boxing out for Westbrook more often than the other way because the analytics are changing basketball.  Westbrook running the break, rather than relying on a big to throw a pass is the smarter play, in that offense.    Booker could absolutely be racking up triple doubles, but he does what it takes to help his team."
"Steven Adams started late too. I think it’s pretty common with international bigs, especially outside of eastern europe."
&gt;James Wiseman  &gt;Steven Adams  &gt;John Wall  The slander has gotten way outta hand lmao.  &gt;LeMarcus Alderidge  Dude aint even in the league anymore bruh.
He will probably save it for Steven adams in the second round game against New Zealand
Steven Adams says he won’t play for the Pelicans like harden griffin lma gets a buyout goes to nets for minimum. Nba in 2021
Ginobili.  But shitty FT shooter Steven Adams has nailed the miss/rebound combo at least twice before so it’s really just luck when you’re trying to hit such a specific part of the rim.
Reggie trying to take the accessory crown from Kirk Heinrich.  Steven Adams with a single shooting sleeve.
"We got this. Our boy zion gonna deliver. Supporting cast no joke either, as long as they get rid of bled and or Steven Adams. Got some picks in the vault too."
"Nah, GSW fans have revisionist tendencies regarding that year. Steven adams still has a ballsack contusion from what I hear."
"No. It’s overstated. Most of the bigs in that clip have trash post moves and can’t score on anyone who has Smart’s muscle mass, regardless of height.  Even a guy who’s just average in the post like Steven Adams, would score over Smart 9/10 times."
I've seen a practice video of Steven Adams shooting 3s and he was making it rain.
"&gt; Like what happens if Andre Robinson got cold from deep?  We pull off a series win after going down 3 games to 1 against KD, Westbrook, Ibaka, and Steven Adams."
Steven Adams would've caught Gobert
Back when he was on the Rockets and they had a rivalry with the Thunder. I kept saying I'd rather have Capela over Steven Adams. I might've been wrong at the time but its obvious who's the better center right now. He was always so underrated and overlooked it seemed. Once the rockets traded him away for that small ball team I knew they're title chances were over and a rebuild was on it's way.
"It wasn't a mistake at all. Dude is a bonehead. Ran this idiotic set with Steven Adams getting the ball at the top of the key every possession for the first 20 games or so. Refused to play the young guards and when he did, never allowed them to play through a few mistakes while allowing Eric bledsoe to make countless mistakes"
&gt;Does Steven Adams really accrue that many?  Yes.
"I think they went for surrounding Zion and BI with defense, to create a tough culture. That’s probably why they brought in SVG, a tough defensive coach. The problem was that SVG was too old school and couldn’t reach the players, and Bledsoe massively fell off and Steven Adams regressed a little. Zion and BI also were very bad on defense. The offense was solid, but didn’t fit."
Steven Adams was also a good pick
"We would need a center who can rim protect and hold his own on the perimeter, rebound, and space the floor. Ideally by shooting and being athletic enough to catch lobs.  The problem is that those guys are hard to find. We’re developing one on Jaxson Hayes, but he may be a year away from being ready to start.   We’d need to compromise 1 or 2 of those requirements to realistically find a center who can fit with Zion. Ibaka (If healthy) and Turner would be solid. We may just need to save the assets and roll with Steven Adams, until Jaxson Hayes develops."
I think they’re fine with Zion and Ingram together... They just have to be smarter with what’s around them. That duo would be so much better with proper spacing – which Bledsoe and Steven Adams kill.
"KD was for sure, but Westbrook and Harden definitely weren't no brainers. I specifically remember people saying the Thunder reached for Westbrook and there were other guys in Harden's class getting mocked to the Thunder (Rubio, Steph, Tyreke).  Other notable picks besides Ibaka:  -Reggie Jackson at 24   -Steven Adams at 12 was a great pick considering how trash the '13 class was   -Sabonis at 11 (he basically made the pick for the Magic in that trade)  -Cam Payne at 14 is now looking like it was a solid pick   -Maledon at 34    Presti has whiffed on some late first round guys like Josh Huestis, Perry Jones, and Mitch McGary, but has shown he's pretty solid at evaluating talent when he actually has picks to use imo."
"Kd, harden, Ibaka, Steven adams"
"Pelicans are stuck picks or not they are stuck zion is reportedly unhappy there gm dosent seem to know what he's doing not going to sign a top 8 free agent you don't know what your going to get back for Lonzo and yeah I know Lonzo is still on the team but him and Zion dosent really fit together Zion needs scorers and defenders so you don't know you got players like Eric bledsoe and Steven Adams that are just there and under contract they are literally just there Steven Adams LITERALLY SITS OUT EVERY GAME I tuned in on okc has picks they are literally trading young ""ok"" players because they know they can get 5 Better players at that position so yeah"
Pretty funny how they have such unique but similar bodies and they easily could’ve been playing together in New Orleans   Have no idea why they traded for Steven adams AND extended him when someone like al horford would be a much better fit
Your statement would make sense if they didn’t trade for and extend Steven Adams. That move was senseless regardless of what direction they were going.
"Let me introduce you to the 2011-2016 Thunder.   that 2012 playoff run of Mavs, Lakers, Spurs reverse sweep was the most insane thing, just to lose in 5 to Lebron's Heat, cause Harden used all his good basketball up in the spurs series.  AND THEN WE LET HARDEN WALK FOR SOME BUMS + STEVEN ADAMS"
He’s young as hell . Steven Adams and capella potential . No cap space ?? I thought 20mil freed up and had a dream of Lowry or lonzo
"Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Steven Adams, Cam Payne (lol)"
"Yeah I’m on the low side I watched him play all season. I don’t want another center with zero offensive game who has terrible hands. He’s literally a worse Steven Adams in every way. We’ll see how he turns out but I’m not surprised or concerned that we traded him  Those contracts don’t matter. Thunder will be flipping Kemba, just like we just did with Al. Not to mention he’s like 4-5 years younger"
"He's the stereotypical decent defense, cant score outside of 3 feet from the hoop, amazing rebounder type center. Think Steven Adams/Clint Capela lite, he's very young and has potential to improve but his skill set is fairly easy to replace. He's got starter potential on a playoff team and he'd be a quality backup at absolute worst."
"But make the package bad enough for the kings to still suck  Zion, Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for DeAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy Hield  Also like 3 picks to ruin any chance of building a team around him"
"How solid is Adam defensively when he is a liability as soon as the other team runs a PnR? And he has no offense, what so ever.            Steven Adams honestly has one of the worst contracts in the entire league, people don’t care because he is a nice guy."
He had a short midrange jumpshot and he could make freethrows. He was nothing like Steven Adams or Ben Wallace.
zion is incredibly efficient with and without steven adams on the floor.
"NOP is dysfunctional and we’ve known that for years. I get his family wanting out. Paying assets for Steven Adams, coaching carousel, history of unhappy players, etc"
Which makes the decision to give up multiple picks and George Hill just to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million even more baffling.
"this team had every opportunity to have miles turner and george hill and a TON more room instead of steven adams and eric bledsoe and they screwed the pooch. he seems like a great dude, i don't blame him for frustration"
No idea why they signed Steven Adams to that extension or why they traded Jrue.. They have their work cut out for them.
"He would 100% be a better on court fit next to Zion than Steven Adams is, but that contract of his is much, much worse. Also, I'm not sure the Pelicans should be looking at anyone who's already injury prone, considering it seems like everyone who goes there spends a significant amount of time out with injuries already."
"I mean y’all are the ones who picked up Bledsoe and Steven Adams  Actually now that I think about it you guys haven’t done terrible, you’ve made good moves for the future, surprising that zions camp has already gotten so mad"
"Do the Pelicans really strike you as a team that's on the verge of making a big leap? Really? They very well could lose Lonzo and Hart this summer in free agency, they're stuck with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams on awful contracts and they just fired their coach after one year. Their last star player very publicly forced his way out of town, and their GM has been very vocally criticized by JJ Redick as a liar who is not to be trusted. Zion has to be looking at this like ""what exactly is the plan?""   Zion has only been there for two years, that's true, but the Pelicans have a really awful track record that goes back many years before he even arrived there. I don't at all see what has happened since he got there which would disavow him of that terrible reputation the team has had."
THE TWO AGING VETS??? STEVEN ADAMS IS 27?????
Look its not even about the small market. They’ve had 3 coaches in 3 years. They’ve traded promising assets for bledsoe and a lane clogging steven adams. If they were winning it would be a different story.
"Yep. Porzingis wanted out of New York because the team sucked, not cause he wanted a different market. Anthony Davis wanted out of New Orleans because they'd been horribly run for the whole time he was there. Now the Pels are repeating the same mistakes they made with AD in the way they're trying to build around Zion. I mean, is there really much of a difference between trading for Omer Asik and then signing him to a toxic overpriced contract, and trading for Steven Adams and then signing him to a toxic overpriced contract?   Putting shitty pieces around your star player on unmoveable contracts is a great way to ensure your team is never going to be very good. The Pels gave up picks to get Adams and now they'll probably have to give up picks a year later to get rid of him. Pair that with firing your coach only one year into his contract and there isn't much reason to have a lot of faith in the direction of the team. It's no wonder why Zion might be hesitant about the prospect of spending the first half of his career there, especially given how things played out with the last star player the Pelicans had."
A guy who comes in the league dominating everyone who you put in front of them probably doesn’t care that in three or four years his team may draft a couple developmental projects and get rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams and Stan Van Grundy
"People say AD wasn’t good enough to lead the Pelicans deep into the playoffs but he ran into the Warriors every time and had like one or two years tops with a competent roster around him. Crazy how as soon as they left they did way better. It’s a waste of generational talent to see them rot with shit teams and coaches.   I remember the Pels homer takes on how SVG was a good coach before the season and how some Pels fan told me,”We don’t need spacing with Zion and Steven Adams on the floor.” That was a good one."
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
steven adams was good. the pels are a fun team to watch.
"time and time again proves that you don't pay a rim running center that much money. Steven Adams, DeAndre Jordan. I let him walk, Mobley will likely be better and cheaper for the first 4 years"
"My unpopular opinions for the Pelicans all involve Steven Adams. With the exception of 1.      The first is that Adams presently provides enough spacing even without outside presence by screening and making it difficult to double Zion in the paint.  Could he provide more spacing with high passing, being more competent at FTs and open jumpers? Sure. But Adams is much better than Favors and there were no spacing issues with Favors.         The second is that Hayes and Adams should absolutely be playing together in order to shift Zion to 3 and Ingram to 2 and make their defensive matchups at least somewhat easier. It would also make a nice lineup to have in your back pocket because it would be so hard to guard.        My third is that the Pelicans can’t let Zion hit RFA. If he doesn’t sign the max after next season, the Pelicans should just auction him off. None of this Qualifying Offer/Eric Gordon 2.0 Bullshit."
"He’s gonna need that range after that dumb ass signing. Steven Adams is good don’t get me wrong, but talk about a terrible fit."
You brought up Steven Adams - a guy who cannot shoot and thus only clogs the paint on offense - as a selling point for another big who can't shoot and you're accusing someone else of trolling?
Difference is brook has hovered around 80% from the line his whole career so the potential was there. Steven adams shoots 54% from the line
Put some body weights on ya sloth. Could you imagine a fast Steven Adams? Hey Steven pay me 100k to live in Colorado with you and I’ll train you samurai style(no joke I’ve got samurai boots). I’m a 5’10” white 29 year old and I could beat you man.  I’m not asking for much here. Take it or leave it. What’s 100k to you? Message me if you are interested.
"Meanwhile, our boy Steven Adams says he likes the smell of coach Pop's hair. Of course in a joking manner."
"you can make that argument about every single counting stat though  scoring - took too many shots, chucked your team out the game  offensive rebounds - andre drummond ass dudes, only getting boards cuz you missed a gimme  defensive rebounds - russell westbrook getting free boards from steven adams doing all the work  steals - gambling instead of playing fundamentally sound defense  blocks - goaltending ass dudes like hassan whiteside"
"The fact that it was a 4 team trade was the bad part about it. Giving up George Hill and 2 solid second-round picks for Steven Adams (and extension) was criticized at the time, and doesn't look any better now. They would have to trade one or both of those picks now to get off of Adams' contract if they needed."
Not the most famous but it’s hard to imagine someone more universally liked on here than Steven Adams.
Steven Adams would be hilarious and he has great takes on the game.
"Griffin seems good at shedding vet players for good assets, but when it comes to roster construction his decisions make little sense.   Luke Steven Adams. He's a great player and in the right situation could be a defensive anchor for a team, but he's a terrible fit with Zion."
"Rachel Nichols be like ""The Thunder beat the Pelicans today, Dort had 90 points and Lonzo went 14/14 from downtown, but Tracy, how do you feel about Steven Adams not shaking hands with the OKC assistant calf muscle trainer? Feel free to let your tears flow, should you feel like it, and you should."""
Steven Adams mate
"For big men in 2021 with only limited ability to stretch the floor 12m seems about right. Missed half the season and put up 11/9/3 on 50/40/60 (.8 3p attempts). Steven Adams got 17m (overpay imo) Christian Wood got 13m (underpay, though with limited sample size to justify a larger deal) last year. Feels like Nurk would come in between those 2 if he renegotiated today."
"Brook is going to be really important defensively, too. Casual fans are going to complain about how poorly Ayton is playing, but it'll be because Brook is a great counter to him. Brook can body him, and Ayton won't be getting easy putbacks. Brook is like Steven Adams in the sense that he'll focus on boxing his man out instead of grabbing the board."
Surround Zion and BI with shooters. Go all in on offense. Trade away Steven Adams.
"No, but there's at least some logic behind the moves we make. Pairing up Zion in the front court with Steven Adams was just dumb."
I pretty much agree. It would not shock me if they move Steven Adams and find a really good coach and take the 1 or 2 seed next year
"Steven Adams the pride and joy of New Zealand, tho he's not as good as he used to be,  not the best athelete in his family though his Sister is a mutli Olympic gold shot putter, and another sister who is a world paralympic shot put champion and is going to the Paralympics this year"
"he has steven adams sydrome. too visibly big and strong to have coaches ""waste time"" developing his skills  i wish he'd stayed w the spurs"
Just put Steven Adams on him and be done with it
"Hitting dudes in the nuts is a “normal” foul? Dray had it coming, he had already done it to Steven Adams earlier in the postseason. He should’ve known it’d be a different outcome doing that to a superstar."
Still remember that clip of him almost hammering Steven Adams in the back of the head for no reason other than Steven showing him he's not the biggest guy on the court right then
"Boogie’s starting 5:  G: Rondo  G: Darren Collison  F: Rudy Gay   F: Omri Casspi  C: Cousins  Bench: Willie Cauley Stein, Ben McLemore, Quincy Acy  Westbrook’s rosters have ALWAYS been WAYYYYY better than that.   Westbrook had Oladipo, Sabonis, Jermai Grant, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams, and other great role players in the year he “dragged” them to the playoffs. Later had Paul George."
"I would’ve hired a coach that wanted to run a creative modern offense to see how they could use Zion, maybe MDA. I never would’ve traded for Steven Adams, the fit, timeline, and money didn’t make sense. I’m not going to say that trading Jrue was an awful move but the return wasn’t all that and playing Bledsoe served no purpose at all. No point in trading for someone older than 30. In fact they shouldn’t even roster someone older than 30 unless they were a star, like Jrue.   In my opinion the Pelicans issue was that they wanted to make some sort of weird push for the playoffs with players that won’t be part of their core moving forward. They ended up with bad lottery odds AND fell short of the playoffs. Give minutes to project players that might turn into something, if they don’t pan out you don’t really lose anything at all. In a few years they will need to be good, right now they can afford to be bad as long as they are building. Was hard to watch Bledsoe waste possessions that Lonzo, Zion, and Ingram could’ve used to feel things out."
Just like Paul's teams always seem to play better I love that teams with Lonzo have better ball movement. If his shot was better this could be a really fun team. Plus he's played with Steven Adams before.
"Ok but someone in that organization is responsible for trading for Steven Adams and Eric fucking Bledsoe and it isn’t Stan, no one was gonna make that work, penguin or not"
Steven Adams. Almost to a frustrating degree
Gah Steven adams is the MAN
Lol this is how Steven Adams hit his first career 3 pointer
"I dunno, people keep saying that, but looking at the current max players, he would instantly be among the worst in terms of peak performance/potential prior to getting max-ish contracts.   The only worse ones I see are:  -Barnes  -Hield  -Otto Porter  -Steven Adams  -Parsons  -----------  So, while it's not impossible for Collins to get that contract, the number of max players he'd actually be better than from Day 1 is very small.   Not to mention 2 of those 5 were Kings signings, and 1 of them was a Wizards signing.   It's not impossible, but I definitely think it's a lot less likely than people around here make it sound.   Usually, a guy like Collins gets overpaid because a small market team is afraid of them leaving, but ATL has so much young talent that there isn't really a reason for them to panic at all, and I don't see what team could possibly need his skillset to the point of giving him a max."
Steven Adams only being a year older than giannis doesn’t sit right with me lol I thought he must be like 31 at this point for some reason
Steven Adams
The Steven Adams effect
"I want to see what he woulda done here if he came over in 1986, before all the injuries happened. His injury history would make Boogie look healthy, not to mention they started piling up by age 24.   He had the offensive skills of Jokic, he was as big as Boban, but mobile and coordinated like his son, the strength of Embiid or Steven Adams, elite interior defense, and the hops of Capela. Woulda loved to see such a never-before-seen skillset at his size wreak havoc in the league."
"He cheap shotted Russ and cost us a run at a championship in our franchise's most winning season.  If the shoe was on the other foot, you'd bitch about it too. I wanted PG/Clippers to win.  But fuck Beverly.  The NBA is not looking at this as a singular incident. He injured Russ, CP3 and he's overall just a dirty player. The Draymond suspension was not because of what he did to LeBron. The league took into account the 3 other times he nut-kicked Steven Adams."
I love Steven Adams   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zetZNm2Ahjk
Steven Adams was moving like he was stalking his prey
even before I saw the video I was hoping it was a Steven Adams screen.
I wish he’d try that shit on Steven Adams when Adams’ sister is present.
I don’t follow the NBA very closely but I do enjoy Steven Adams. Immensely.
"And that's when I knew that I would always love Steven Adams, not matter how many times he beat my Spurs"
"I thought it was just a Steven Adams, but multiple times."
That’s incredible. I don’t understand why the Suns didn’t have a few of those up their sleeve for this pest. Makes you admire Steven Adams a bit more.
Silver should just loan Steven Adams out to whatever team the Clippers face on gameday
I still love to watch this once and awhile.      https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/16/15322768/patrick-beverley-flattened-by-steven-adams-screen
I will never understand how someone like Beverly has avoided karma for as long as he has  I know the whole Steven Adams pick a few years back but you would think there would be more than that
"it's Steven Adams. If you see someone like him do something like this, it's because the guy deserved it. And he sure as shit deserved it."
"It's even better too, because Adams clearly drops his shoulder directly into Bev's head. It's about the dirtiest, most malicious screen you'll every see. If Steven Adams didn't have such massive shoulders, it probably would have broken Bev's jaw or something."
We'll always have that Steven Adams screen at least
Steven Adams is a fckin tank. Dudes got HOF screens man.
Same lol like people don’t understand he had Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams spacing the floor and still destroyed everyone on insane efficiency. His athleticism and skill are nuts.
"Shai is better than anyone we had this year besides Steph. Steven Adams is better than any of the bigs we had. Galinari would have been our second scoring option this year. Dort put up 30 in game 7. Not to mention Steph missed 9 games and we went 1-8 in those games and still were 6 games over 0.500. That team was better than what we put out this year.   One championship and a finals MVP doesn’t move the needle on Steph vs CP3, Steph is a much better player and has had way more success.   One guy led a team to a title as the undisputed best player and MVP of the league, the other has been on 5 different teams in his career and isn’t even the best player on his team. Do the math.  Nobody who’s username is “CP3BestPGintheLeague” can be taken seriously in any discussion"
"Whenever I get too fired up watching Pat Bev's antics, I think back to Steven Adams' screen on him (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc) and feel the karma"
When Steven Adams set a screen and Beverly never saw it. Ran right into it and fell like the sack of shit that he is
Somebody call Steven Adams and tell him to set a screen
Somebody link the Steven Adams screen on Beverly plz
They need to get Steven Adams in real quick and set a screen.
Steven Adams got him good once. It was so redeeming
Where's a Steven Adams screen when you need it
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"
"There’s definitely a racial component no matter how you slice it. Another explanation is that a lot of the **universally** beloved players are foreign which, for some reason, makes them endearing to Americans. Look at Tacko, Luka, Boban, Patty Mills, Rui Hachimura, and Steven Adams."
"Or maybe the Pels fan that watched literally every me knows how good one of the top players are.  How good do you think Simmons playmaking would be with Steven Adams and Zion in the paint, and Lonzo and Bledsoe as the spot up shooters with Bledsoe’s man almost completely playing off of him?"
"Besides being an elite defender, he also didn’t take bad shots. In 2017 he took 4 shots a game because the rest of the starting lineup was Westbrook, PG, Melo, and Steven Adams."
"Yeah, paint's going to be like that when you have Bledsoe, Steven Adams, and Zion in the starting 5. The bench's spacing is arguably worse. This team is so ass.   At least Lonzo's making strides.   Id love to see what Ingram can do on a team like golden state"
"He should’ve known we couldn’t do the Bucks scheme with a washed Eric Bledsoe who was one of the worst defenders in the league, Steven Adams who moves like a snail and blocks under 1 shot per game, and forwards who are still learning on defense. And that scheme only works for the Bucks because they have a 6’11 DPOY at PF, a C who is a great shot blocker, and all defense level guards and wings.  And BI has the length to be a great defender, or maybe I should’ve used the word good. I think if he actually put effort into defense consistently he could get to around Mikal Bridges levels in his prime."
"You know what goes a LONG WAY for me, is when people totally own up. If PG's attitude was a very public ""holy shit I fucked up there, idk WHAT I was on. I mean if it's the outcome I wanted I at least could have handled it WAY better."" I like honesty in the fashion of Steven Adams or Evan Turner.  I've had people at work massively fuck up and own up with this attitude and it's so much easier to continue working with them. Much better than working next to an angsty nut who can't make a little mistake without getting defensive and moody."
"Much better is a little bit of a stretch. The year he had PG was comparable to a Kawhi-less Clippers. Russ had PG, Steven Adams, Schroder, Jerami Grant, etc. Losing in 5 to the Blazers was pretty bad. Also Russ played on other teams besides OKC.  I agree though that at times people are overly harsh towards Russ. Dude plays his ass off. But I also get why people get frustrated by his shooting.   PG might shoot inefficiently for a stretch, but at least it’s a player who is a good shooter. Russ has never been one."
[Steven Adams tho](https://youtu.be/h2mPCpV851s)
Yea but you can do that everywhere. To be fair CP3 undercutting Lebron on a FT was a potentially series altering injury. As is him flailing his legs irregularly like draymond green cup checking Steven adams.  https://youtu.be/di2X8utj9Ng  https://youtu.be/Dy3cmIq6kFQ
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R. Smith|43.6|43.0| |Kevin Love|38.5|41.4| |Tristan Thompson|52.7|0| |Richard Jefferson|52.4|39.3| |Iman Shumpert|41.7|38.2| |Channing Frye|59.4|56.5|"
"Just my opinion, I wish he was more like Shaq. Ignoring the footwork/touch skills Shaq had, he would always get great position, get into the middle and get that hook.  I just wish Giannis would learn to get easy buckets. In transition he’s just insane eurodunking on everyone.  Zach Randolph is a bit of a stretch, but if he could pick up those Steven Adams kind of buckets instead of starting at the top of the 3 and allowing then to build the wall. Trickier if he doesnt want to go to the line.  Ridiculous talent, I’m not sure if he gets much better then he is now. 30/12 and room for improvement he’s a beast"
"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/the-truth-behind-steven-adams-tall-blacks-snub/IHTGK7UVXWZDACSOKMHVQ7MPRM/   This article shows why he initially withdrew himself from contention, but the fact that absolutely nothing has changed in the last decade regarding government support has solidified his choice. For example, we withdrew from Olympics qualifying this year because of lack of funding. We're New Zealand, a first-world country, and both the government and Basketball New Zealand don't care about bringing money into the sport, just keeping the status quo"
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
How is Steven Adams the only guy to lay out Pat Bev all these years?
Where is Steven Adams when you need him.
Athleticism doesn’t just mean speed and vertical. It covers strength too and Steven Adams is a legit brick wall.
"same with Steven Adams and New Zealand, though him never appearing for us is a form of protest over how useless our governing body is (TLDR); most NZ basketball fans are okay with that though, because we agree with him.  We have a few guys who have played Summer League or at a high level in Europe, but the only other current player with an actual NBA contract on his resume is Corey Webster who signed with the Pelicans in 2016 but was waived without a game."
Why would he give a fuck what you think lmao. If you seriously think Steven Adams &gt; Gobert you’re already too far gone. No point in arguing.
He also put gobert behind nurkic and Steven adams. Man this sub is basically like Twitter
Peak Steven Adams&gt;Gobert is just flat out blasphemy and Cousins is being underrated on this...no Deandre Ayton isn’t close to better than pre-Achilles Boodie
Yea he’s a 3 time dpoy. I don’t see how Steven adams makes the list over him
Imagine putting Steven Adams ahead of Gobert.
"Steven adams is in fact a good contract, if the pelicans really wanted to get rid of him they could move that contract and get assets back"
Steven Adams has 2 years at 17mil/season left. Hayward has 3 years at 30mil/season left. I don’t think they are really comparable.
"Everyone keeps flaming the Steven Adams move without looking at the fact that he’s actually a useable player. It’s the contract extension and giving up a pick to get him that made it a bad move, he’s not a bad player.   Eric Bledsoe is the one that’s actually worthless on the court."
Pelicans after they trade for Dame and cut Steven adams
PG: Westbrook SG: Harden SF: KD PF: Ibaka C: Steven Adams
"With the exception of actual non-shooters like Ben Simmons or many centers, 90% of NBA players aren’t so bad at shooting that they don’t need to be guarded at all. Steven Adams and Enes Kanter were the only guys on the OKC roster who you could just completely ignore every single possession if they stood behind the perimeter (which they’d didn’t do). The Cavs and Warriors both had players like that too. Every single other person on their team had the ability to hit 3s, as proven by the fact that they…hit 3s. There is your answer. Was their shooting and spacing as good as the Cavs? No. Was that the main reason they lost and the Cavs won? No.  LeBron James, the star player of the Cleveland Cavaliers, played extremely well in 3 elimination games against the Warriors. Kevin Durant can’t say the same. Parsing the difference in their play in these respective series entirely on the basis of the relative quality of their spacing is a false premise. From the beginning to the end, that has been my argument.   If you really believe in your heart of hearts that spacing is what made that gap, more power to you. It’s just wrong though."
"I feel like rather than the Lakers just using a pretty set rotation at center during the regular season, they should approach it with more flexibility based on who their opponent is every night. If they're playing against Embiid or Jokic or even Steven Adams, someone you don't want him ""banging down low with"" all game, then start a traditional big and move AD to PF to start and use him there more sparingly. But if they're playing a team that doesn't have a bruising post presence, then start AD at center and get more of a spread offense out there."
Steven Adams is 7 inches taller and with 60 more pounds in muscle we’re basically doing them a favor
Steven Adams definitely up there
"If they want to accelerate the timeline like that, they have more work to do, ie pawn off Steven Adams on someone and try to get Myles Turner"
"This is exactly what I thought - both teams have what each other want, and Pelicans have the picks to make it happen. If we're being even more optimistic Bledsoe might actually try because they're in a better position to get into the post-season, and Steven Adams will have more to do offensively than be pushed into Zion's way."
"Steven Adams for Dame straight up. That's like two guys put together for one measly normal sized guy, Portland would be stupid not to do it."
Harden was a drunk in OKC. We traded him and got Steven Adams. Later traded for draft picks. At least you traded Harden for draft picks too
He thought [he was Steven Adams. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-9OZvl1c)
"Many centers nowadays aren't very skilled post players or even skilled scorers in general. Guys like Dwight Howard, Steven Adams, and Tristan Thompson aren't gonna back down OG or Siakam and score. Both of those guys are strong enough to hold their own if a bigger guy tries to back them down and many centers aren't skilled enough to finish over them.  Guys who would give Siakam and OG trouble at the 5 spot are big, skilled post players like Embiid, Jokic, Vucevic , and Valanciunas. So really, it depends on the matchup. If the 5 is just a rim runner and bad post player, Siakam and OG can defend them. If the 5 is someone who's bigger and stronger on top of being a skilled post player, Siakam and OG will have trouble."
Dumb. Clearly Steven Adams.
Uh bagley sucks and we got a first round pick next year. Might get an asset out of adams and Bledsoe eventually too but even if we don't I would rather have Steven Adams than Bagley for this team
"PG, Steven Adams, Russ, Schroder, and Jerami Grant. I'll take that team."
Russ has played with big men who clogged the lane before and it wasn't a problem. He had a lot of success with Steven Adams did he not? And it's not like Adams can stretch the court so yea I'm not sure I can agree with you.  And are you kidding me? Covid is known to effect everyone differently. Are you being ignorant on purpose? Harden was fine but Tatum said he needed an inhaler for practice after getting it. Stop it.  The Drummond signing doesn't matter. If AD and Bron were 100% they would have made the finals regardless. I'm starting to feel this is just Lakers hate coming from a Boston fan.
"AD is about to Win MVP, look at the contract of  Steven Adams and look what CP3 did to Ayton in the playoffs.."
Russ made his role players look great too when he was in okc. Look at that 2016-2017 roster. Look what happened to Steven Adams in New Orleans
"Thank you. People are really forgetting the Russ and big man combo. Steven Adams was great with RW and can't live up to his level without. Gafford got elevated so much by playing with Westbrook. RW's passing in a packed lane is also fantastic. So many highlight dimes with Adams. If that kind of chemistry arises and Westbrook doesn't have the feeling he has to carry the team, it's gonna be a hype season. I'm forced to be a Lakers fan rn and I'm all for it!"
"He's a much better roll man than Steven Adams and those two were really good together.  And unlike Adams, AD has a pick n' pop game.  I think they'll be fucking deadly."
And yet he somehow coexisted with sharpshooter big *checks notes* Steven Adams
"I see no-one talking about Russ' ability to team up with big dudes.  Despite his flaws, Westbrook has always elevated centers he played with. Steven Adams was great with Westbrook, unable to do live up to his level without. Gafford wasn't really getting anywhere on the Bulls, popped off on the Wizards. Russ and AD AND LeBron is gonna be brick &amp; lob city. Westbrook can hand off the ball in a crowded lane really well. Guessing that's what they're hoping will happen next season. Russ going for 10-30-10 on 0 threes and AD and LeBron with like 40 each? I guess that's best case scenario.  I don't mention worst case 'cause there's already plenty of people sharing their 'knowledge'.  I'm hype asf for next season, can't wait for it to start. See if this works 'cause it could be one of the coolest seasons in recent years with LA vs Brooklyn."
"I definitely think they’ll still be making moves. I also think the Warriors have made people overrate getting top tier shooters for playoff teams. The Warriors legit had the GOAT 3 point shooters so they shouldn’t be used as a comparison, if you look at other amazing shooters like Korver or Joe Harris, they’ve gone thru stretches in the playoffs where they’re cold as fuck, And then they have such limited value. Jae Crowder is a top tier 3 and D guy and he had a game in the finals where he had 1 point. Getting a player who can run the offense when Lebron subs out will always be good, and Westbrook has dominated in the pick and roll wit Steven Adams, jus imagine what he’ll be able to do wit AD. It’s either Westbrook getting to the basket or an easy mid range for AD everytime. I’m sure they’ll pick up shooters on the minimum or sign and trade Dennis still. Think it was a good trade honestly"
Westbrook made Steven Adams look like a top level Center lol.
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
Having Steven Adams Hayes and Zion as you're bigs isn't super productive for Guards defensive reputation.  &amp;#x200B;  Adams is a great 1 on 1 defender though.
Steven Adams to the Lakers confirmed
"y’all are acting like dude is a ball hog. Russ gets his teammates involved and is dream come true for most centers in the pnr (Exhibit A: Steven Adams, Exhibit B; Daniel Gafford)"
He’s getting traded to Memphis as part of the Steven Adams trade
GRIZZLIES? I want Steven Adams and Dillon Brooks right now
Don’t worry guys it’s just the Thunder filling their Kiwi quota since trading Steven Adams
Kuminga for...Dillon Brooks and Steven Adams lool
"For some reason Pick 13 and Pick 15 have been amazing picks for various teams over the years.  Pick 13: Mitchell, Booker, Levine, Kobe, Karl Malone.   Pick 15: Giannis, Kawhi, Nash.   &amp;#x200B;  Strangely cannot say the same for the other picks from 11-16, just not on the level of 13 and 15.   Pick 11: Shai GA, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller.   Pick 12: Steven Adams, Mookie Blaylock.  Pick 14: Michael Porter Jr, Bam Adebayo, Tim Hardaway, Clyde Drexler.   Pick 16: Ron Artest, John Stockton."
"I know the mavs need good defenders, but wasn’t one of their biggest issues last year their awful spacing from trading away Curry? I’m guessing a mid-level 3&amp;D wing might be better, but Bertans prob wouldn’t be a bad fit if Dallas can also get a good defensive center to plug up some of their defensive holes. Steven Adams is def too expensive, but maybe Nerlins Noel or something?  All i’m saying is Bertans might not be a bad fit, Buddy Hield is prob better but it could def be alright."
bro Russ was putting in work in PnR with Steven Adams and Daniel Gafford lmao he’ll tear it up with AD
The 2013 nba draft is kinda wild. No top 10 picks are any good. But after that you have giannis and Rudy gobert. (Also Steven adams).   I can’t think of another draft where the top 5 players were this bad but was a semi decent draft
Porzingis - magician Ben Simmons - ventriloquist  Jaylen Brown - professor of philosophy Trae Young - actor in commercials for nasal relief products Kevin Huerter - Brooks Brothers greeter Steven Adams - Mamoa stunt double
Kmart JR and Steven Adams for Ben Simmons. Who says no?
"Absolutely! NAW is my favorite Pelican and projects to be a solid NBA role player for years to come. But his success in the NBA so far should not be compared to Hunter’s.  Also, given what we did with the Hill cap-space (Steven Adams), we honestly should have just held on to him"
"They had Jerami Grant, Steven Adams (back when he could move), plus Shroder &amp; Noel providing good punch off the bench in 2019.   Was it a great roster? No, but it was about as much talent as the Thunder ever put around KD &amp; Westbrook after Harden left. And they won 1 playoff game that year.   &gt;PG shrunk in those playoff runs &amp; Russ obviously had bad games too  Russ shot 36% from the field in a 5 games against a Lillard/McCollum backcourt."
100% I can see a deal going down with Steven Adams going to Golden State for Wiseman
"From the trailer he does seem like a thoughtful and interesting guy.  As a kiwi I'm just laughing at the thought of 25 years from now getting a Steven Adams documentary so that we can hear his thoughts on the KD, Russ and Serge era"
"I guess I never worked in business so your point is fair.  Yes I have shit talked competitor companies but I guess the difference is where do you draw the line. If you work in retail and they have employee of the month etc, do you view your coworkers as competitors or colleagues?  Which brings up an interesting point. I truly believe our 2019 championship was won without any trade fleeces. Lowry we got from Houston with the pick that ended up being Steven Adams. Kawhi and Danny we got from Spurs. Pascal we drafted. Gasol we gave up JV, Delon, CJ, 2nd rd pick. Ibaka we gave up T.Ross + 1st rd pick.  Like the comment from below, I guess the expectation as GM is you fleece the other team. But I can argue most of above trades were win win with teams that had different timeline for winning. Am I wrong...?"
If you did an anagram of Steven Adams name it would be Steven's Adam.
"Morey only got Harden for Steven Adams because he was willing to make the ask lol  Can’t get a crazy return without asking for one, the Celtics don’t get all those picks from the Nets otherwise. May not work most of the time but every once in a while it will."
"The Pels have spent this offseason undoing all the shit they did last offseason i.e. replacing the head coach they just hired and spending assets to get rid of the guys they traded for/extended inexplicably last offseason (Bledsoe and Steven Adams)  Before that, the Pels traded the 4th pick which ended up being Deandre Hunter a 2nd and Solomon Hill for Jaxon Hayes (8th), NAW (17th) and the 35th pick. A move that they initially got credit for, but in retrospect doesn't look as good after Hunter had something of a breakout season this year.   Worse, there are rumors that Zion is unhappy with the bleak outlook for the team and poor management and some speculate he could be positioning himself for an eventual exit."
"Smh bro, he was this distraught about Steven Adams leaving?"
"It’s a generational talent on the same team who wants to contend with a gm making mistakes and not being patient enough to build the right way.  You won’t have any extra picks if you keep wasting them trying to cover mistakes.   With so many players coming out after one year you never know what pick could turn into a great player, you can’t just throw them away. Especially when you are a small market. You really have to be as close to perfect as possible, and rushing the process with increase the risk.   The main point is that I think you have a gm who isn’t great around the margins, and he’s going to mortgage the future to protect his job, which will likely create an unattainable future for this team.  I mean it’s just one mistake so far, the Steven adams one, but it’s been compounded by the extension and then the picks to get off him."
We traded away the best player on our team along with Steven Adams for Jonas Vasectomy
"You can…https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1418340159318224902?s=21  “teams CAN S&amp;T more than one player together to aggregate salary. Example: New Orleans sent Zylan Cheatham (S&amp;T, Josh Gray (S&amp;T), Kenrich Williams (S&amp;T), Darius Miller (under contract at the time) to OKC for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe”"
Iranian Steven Adams not having it
"The sooner he realizes he’s a step below Steven Adams, the better."
But Steven Adams is getting paid more money and for more years than Jonas? He isn’t a defensive stopper either. What you’re saying doesn’t really make sense
Steven Adams about to win one next
"Lol oops my bad, I read it as “this ain’t JV” for some reason. I’m dumb. Anyways, yeah JV isn’t Dirk Nowitzki but he is at least a threat at 36% as compared to having Steven Adams out there with Zion."
 Steven adams said Roberson was dam near fouling him on every shot and he still made it lol
What Adams are you talking about?  Steven Adams was 0/3 on 3s last year and 1/13 for his career.    There's no way he's ever going to be a respectable 3 point shooter.  He shot 44.4% from the FT line last year.  He should work on that shot before he moves out any further.

"Legitimate question: who is the best player Presti drafted since Ibaka? He had an incredible run drafting those 4 guys in 3 years, but since then it’s been who? Steven Adams maybe?"
Steven Adams Finals MVP here we go
"If you think his floor spacing and Steven adams’ floor spacing are anything close, then I don’t know what to tell you. You clearly don’t watch games"
Steven Adams leading us to the promised land!!
"Woah, grizz getting steven adams? And for chump change? This could make them a legit contender."
If you look at it from the perspective of last year it is indeed a loss. If you look at it from the perspective of this year it’s a win. David griff took a shot on Steven adams and Bledsoe and it didn’t pay off. Hindsight is 20/20
I'm a Steven adams fan and JV is definitely better. Adams is very one dimensional and I don't think he's going to get much better honestly
And now he traded E Bled and Steven Adams.  Congrats Memphis
keep steven adams far away from here please. love him tho
"The scouts at OKC have some uncanny observation to have had great players like Westbrook, Harden, Durant in the past, Alexander now and Steven Adams too. Man these players would make for a Championship team clearly, and their Finals appearance earlier this decade is a proof of concept to that proposition.  I mean, how tf does an org recruit All Stars ALL the time, only for one of them to win a chip somewhere else and others to be Max players in their new org? But these player scouts are something else than what any other org possesses."
"Morey got Harden for Steven Adams and a bag of chips, of course he’s asking for the 4th pick lol"
"Hey now, one of those picks became Steven Adams…"
"Yeah that sounds like great evidence if you take out the rest of the trade. They also had to move back seven spots in the draft and gave up an additional first round pick. Memphis didn’t do this because they preferred Adams, they did it to move up in the draft and get the extra pick. NO got the better contract of the two centers and it’s not close. JV is much better than Adams and he’s on a cheaper deal. JV is actually what a premiere utility center on a moveable contract looks like. That’s why I like this deal for the Pels despite what they gave up. And Bledsoe’s contract is not as bad as you might be thinking because the second year was partially guaranteed.  Edit: also Clint Capela is a lot better than Steven Adams at this point in their careers."
"This is not even close to true. To try and get KD stay, we were about to sign al Horford. We paid victor oladipo. We overpaid Steven Adams. We paid Paul George. We paid Russel westbrook. We paid Carmelo. We were in the luxury tax for years after KD left."
Whoever is responsible for trading a 1st round pick and other valuable pieces to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million is a moron.
"Ja triple double season incoming? Steven Adams and a slashing guard, name a better duo"
"whats so chad about this, you just traded for steven adams, he doesn't fit your team"
"They basically took a step towards climbing out of the hole they dug for themselves last year. Basically everything they did with Steven Adams before today should have been fireable offenses, but they partially recovered today. Probably."
AD was the second best player on his team.  Jrue Holiday was the third best player on his team.  Steven Adams will be the Grizzlies' fourth best player in a championship run???
"I don’t think JV is the player you think he is. He’s better than Steven Adams right now, but he doesn’t solve any issues you would’ve had with SA."
Pretty difficult for Zion to develop when he plays most of his minutes with Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams. Reminds me a lot of giannis when the bucks always played a slow center and a questionable point guard.
"Season ticketholder of 30 years, Dubs are a big part of my life and my work. Obviously wouldn't do that deal if Beal becomes a real option, and if Beal isn't an option I'd ask for Desmond Bane in the above deal but that wouldn't happen.   I love Wiggs but the reality is (and has been) that he's more valuable to the Dubs than he is to anyone else. There's a reason he's only considered a ""salary match"" in suggested trades - he's a positive asset for the Warriors but a net neutral or negative for most other teams bc of his salary.   My original post was an immediate spitball reaction that admittedly would need some fine tuning, but the general goal remains: Steven Adams. He's undervalued atm and also a perfect fit for the Warriors (which has also been the case for years). This is the first real opportunity to get him.   Also 7-10 in this year's draft is pretty negligible in available players, unless Kaminga or Bouknight drops, both of which are projects that are better suited for rebuilding teams than the contender-hopeful Dubs.   It's not a final trade proposal but it's a decent staring point for a deal."
"Bledsoe is essentially an expiring contract, and Steven Adams is on a two year 35 million dollar deal. So only Adams contract is for multiple seasons and cost roughly 18 mil in salary next year than it is off the books.  Bledsoe contract is only partially guaranteed (3.9mil) next year so it could be a valuable trade chip during next years off season. He can be traded as filler to match salaries and then be cut for cap space by said team. The contract doesn't become fully guaranteed until June 30th 2022"
"Yeah the Pelicans are looking to make short sighted moves to start working towards a winning culture.  Grizzlies looking long term (upgrading the pick) and not worrying about eating Bledsoe’s bad contract which is only 22m guaranteed over 2 years, and Steven Adams contract who is an expiring deal they can use next year to acquire a longer term asset.  Seems fine both ways. Grizzlies aren’t rushing to get veteran talent while Pelicans are (and kind of need to)"
"&gt; What does Steven Adams bring other   Rebounding and screens.    &gt;than being an overpaid back up to a hopefully healthy JJJ.   JJJ is better at PF right now anyway. As Memphis can afford to overpay vets, we have heaps of players on very cheap deals.  &gt; and get the 10th pick where they can get the Center they need (probably Kai Jones from Texas)  They're giving the 10th pick TO memphis."
"Why are people so negative on the Grizz with this one? They moved two picks up in the draft and got an extra one in 2022 for a center swap. Steven Adams is going to be the perfect P&amp;R partner for Ja and JJJ is already an amazing shooter so they're not in dire need for spacing. Also Bledsoe's contract is non-guaranteed after this year so they've effectively swapped expiring contracts and in the process added Steven Adams, A 2022 first round pick, and moved up a combined 18 spots in this draft."
"Wiggins + 7 pick for Kyle Anderson, Steven Adams, and 10 pick"
the true winner of this trade is steven adams. he's gonna get his russ 2.0.
He's a good player but he presents the same fit problems Steven Adams did.
Guys that can actually defend  If Zion can average 27 points playing next to Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe then spacing shouldn’t be their priority over actually being able to defend properly
"i mean they arent getting kawhi but you can always fill holes if you have money  im just sayin steven adams is mid, a clear downgrade from Val. they better really love somebody in this draft! cuz that draft pick next season is at best a late lotto pick!"
"I think he'll take more this following season. if Steven Adams was talking of working on his 3 ball next to Zion, then JV is absolutely doing so as well."
"Steven Adams with a good point guard is a threat at the post. Not a bad pickup for Grizzlies. And for them to take this trade + Bledsoe, I’m pretty sure they are shooting for a specific player with the #10 pick this year."
"Bledsoe will probably be bought out.     Steven Adams will be great in screen action for Ja &amp; Brooks moving toward the basket as well as screen hand off action for Bane, who looks like he could be a steal for them.      Moving up 7 picks to add another player to their core as well as timing the expirings of Adams/Bledsoe for when their young core will start moving off their rookie contracts makes it a good move IMO."
"&gt;  they are further along in their rebuild than new orleans is.  Because Mem actually manged their assets smartly while Pelicans handed out bad deals.  &gt; they acquired these 2 guys expecting them to produce on the court and win games and make the playoffs again  Bledsoe will likely not even play and Adams will be marginal. This is not a win now trade, its a asset accumulation trade.  &gt; steven adams is a good player on a very reasonable contract  Its a terrible contract, as everybody pointed out when he was signed. And guess what, all GM agree as they had to attach assets to drop it."
"Love Jonas and appreciate all the work he put in for Memphis, but damn did we just rob them blind. So stoked to have Steven Adams!"
"when your evidence of kuminga showing more than basic vision is him throwing a single outlet pass that i've seen steven adams do multiple times mean nothing lol. But ok, agree to disagree"
"Obviously we should have gone with embid, jokic, gobert or maybe gotten a stretch 5/4 like porzingis. Boban would have been nice in the olympic setup. Steven adams just for toughness perhaps. If we wanted someone younger maybe zubac? If none of them work, then we can just take any big that answers the phone and is willing to come on a few days notice to play in japan during a pandemic. Oh...so just javell then?"
"Is he worth his contract? Absolutely. You're right absolutely right that he doesn't help his teams much in the playoffs. But a healthy Ben Simmons can get you into the playoffs. He can make players better, he can shut down the best player on the opposing team. Not a lot of players at or around 30 million a year can. Not Kevin Love. Not Tobias Harris. Not Steven Adams. Not Wiggins. Not CJ. Not DeAngelo Russell. Not Otto Porter. I'd argue not even a healthy Kemba Walker because he can't defend. So even if Simmons never improves I'd take him gladly over a lot of the higher paid players."
Ex : Steven Adams
"This sub talking about Steven Adams like he's Miles Plumlee.  Adams is overpaid but he's a perfectly respectable starting caliber player who does all the things you want out of a traditional C. He converts his looks inside the paint, rebounds, screens, and plays strong post defense. I think he fits in well next to JJJ who is essentially a SG, and provides them with needed interior presence."
"thats probably not memphis' reasoning for making this trade, they are further along in their rebuild than new orleans is.   they acquired these 2 guys expecting them to produce on the court and win games and make the playoffs again  steven adams is a good player on a very reasonable contract, it's not bad by any stretch.  bledsoe gets clowned a lot but maybe he can have a resurgence"
"I kept saying the steven adams contract is valuable and the pels could trade it whenever they wanted but nobody here believed me  It is not a bad contract at all, bledsoe maybe is.  But the pels didnt even sign him to that one   Its just big market team fans here who want pels to be incompetent and signing bad contracts to get zion to LA or NY.   Other league executives don't consider that contract to be bad or a mistake"
"For the first few seconds, I read this as ""memphis...to send 51 picks to New Orleans for Steven Adams..."" was like dammmmm can they even do that."
So Memphis did this entirely for the picks right? Cause there's no world in which I'd think they prefer Steven Adams to JV
"Brooks, Allen, and Anderson were all starters last year. So who are you saying are their starters??  Bledsoe and Steven adams certainly are not starting quality anymore. I had to google Tillman. Oh, the big throwback PF. He might not even be an nba caliber *player* let alone a stater. Their roster is gross lol  And as far as ‘they’re not competing right now’ thats how franchises lose stars. They just traded  with, and helped make a batter team of, a team on the same tier as them!  Nola is younger than them and they’re goin in. Look at what Atlanta did before this season. Grabbed win-now vets. Look at Phoenix, before the CP3 acquisition Phoenix and Memphis were about equal.    So just watching teams walk—-run—-by them is not good. And that ‘we have time’ mindset is outdated. If guys are coming in the league as almost all-nba caliber, you can’t expect them to wait 4,5 years to start fielding playoff caliber teams. Look at Dallas they’re already in scramble mode to win now, which is good.   New rules man. Contract length means nothing. All it takes is the star to say you know what, I don’t like it here, and boom your time is up. They better hit a home run with that #10 pick"
"Steven Adams has only played in the south central triangle of OKC, NOLA &amp; Memphis."
They got rid of Bledsoe and that is probably worth the JV trade but that in vacuum is not helping. Steven Adams or JV is the same clog under the basket. If they don't do anything else on top its a waste.
One does not simply avoid Steven Adams
Instead they'll pay Steven Adams a couple years.
Better than Steven Adams
Wow Memphis fleeced them. Bledsoe underrated since leaving bucks. Steven Adams is a durable rock.
"Wow, NOLA actually got rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams! And they just had to trade the 10th and a potential mid to late Lakers FRP? Also, they got Jonas and the the 17 FRP? What the fuck lol"
"The idea is that it'd be baked into the Memphis trade, so you'd still have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams counting as outgoing salary"
"That's going to become a thing of the past pretty soon. If this free agency has taught us anything (and also 2019 with KD to the Nets and ESPECIALLY Jimmy to the Heat) it's that sign-and-trades are the name of the game now, and anyone can basically create cap space to aquire talent if there's mutual interest. Moreover in the age of everything from players to picks to cap space being an ""asset"" (and GMs who may not be in line for championship at least looking to ""stockpile assets"" just in case it becomes their turn to trade for a disgruntled star or absorb some salary in a sign-and-trade) you'll be able to find 2, 3, even 4 teams willing to jump in to make a convoluted deal happen. Look at the Harden trade, look at the Jrue Holiday/Bledsoe/Steven Adams deal. The Russ/Dinwiddie/Etc monstrosity is only the latest. We're kind of in a weird new era where the GMs have caught up to player empowerment, and it's gonna be easier than ever to dump ""bad"" contracts and get the talent you want no matter how over the cap you are. There's no such thing as an ""untradeable"" contract anymore, so long as you can attach ""assets"" or get other teams involved. Wall, Wiggins, Russ, CP3; they've all been traded, and it wouldnt be surprising to see them get moved again."
Pretty sure Steven Adams is currently 1/1
"Steven Adams is surprisingly good at the intentional miss back to him, not sure how many times it ended with a make but i know a few times he did it with a quick pass out to Westbrook for 3"
These guys made one before Steven Adams has? Blasphemy
Which he’ll decline to either get more money and stay with another extension or leave. These player options only really get picked up if someone is on a Steven Adams level ‘I can’t believe you offered me this’ type deal
hehe been had   You're so urban dear redditor. Looks like you're a Steven Adams influenced Kiwi Thunder fan.
He's probably eating hamburgers. Steven Adams probably coaching him up.
Sign Steven Adams to push him in a wheelbarrow during fourth quarters.
Then number 3 this year. Lol. That's seven top 5 picks since 2011.  I wonder what magic Presti could have worked with those? All joking aside... as an OKC fan we were quite spoiled to see our only picks that landed top 5 become MVPs (plus trading for Jeff Green).  I want to see if Presti was just lucky or really skilled. Giddey at 6 this year was the closest we've been to a top 5 pick since Steven Adams was the 12th selection in 2013. I want to see Presti have more cracks at the top 5 to see what happens.
Steven Adams
"&gt;actually they were very busy working out  Some of them were.  Many showed up to Orlando out of shape -- just like beginning of each season.  &gt;and the bubble was grueling  What on earth are you talking about?  The bubble was 8 games over 2 weeks.  One-quarter of the league wasn't even invited.  That was followed by a playoff season with no travel, which for the Lakers and Heat meant 21 games over 7 weeks.  So the players stayed at Disneyworld for around 10 weeks -- with full access to the facilities -- and played up to 29 games.  That's a typical schedule, and they didn't have to travel once.  Did some players miss their families?  Sure.  Did some miss partying every night?  Sure.  Did some not?  Absolutely.  None of that is physically grueling.  &gt;they played around july's end to october, then again from december.  A few did.  Most didn't.  &gt;you think you know what they are going through better than them?  You are being naive.   &gt;Don't count Steven Adams among the NBA players who will be complaining about bubble life. ""Let's be clear: This is not Syria. It's not that hard ... We're living at a bloody resort,"" Adams told reporters Monday. ""Everyone is going to complain, everyone has their own preferences, nothing too serious. Just a bit of dry food here and there.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2900917-steven-adams-on-living-in-nba-bubble-this-is-not-syria-its-not-that-hard"
"I love D Rose but we also had a rather talented squad around him too.Prime Westbrook was the first year without KD and he carried one of the worst playoff teams of all time. His roster was putrid outside of Steven Adams and pre all star Oladipo.  His playmaking, rebounding, durability, shooting (Westbrook was league average from 3 whilst prime Rose never was) were all better than prime D Rose with Rose being more efficient inside the arc and maybe a better defender."
"Not ""sure-fire Hall of Famer"" but I thought Steven Adams was going to be a perennial top 5-7 center"
"Bruh, why would you not use Aquaman(Steven Adams) for an ocean expedition"
"Nah the OP is right. Despite Ibaka being more impact than Adams overall, he didn’t have any hands. Russ got more production out of Steven in the PnR, lobs, etc."
Steven Adams has lots of siblings and his sister was an Olympian
"There's no logic to this but I'm going to put in Malcolm Brogdon because he's the Prez and he's constantly managing his charity.  I'm also gonna put Steven Adams. He's just smart about how the world works. I don't know if it's smarts or being savvy about the world.  Jeremy Lin, Draymond, and LeBron are a bit more obvious."
Definitely not suspended but he shouldn’t come out smelling like roses. I forget that that kick in the nuts even slow down Steven Adams?
Fuck that Draymond should’ve been suspended against OKC for kicking Steven Adams in the nuts. Not suspending him then was a bullshit move. Him getting suspended in the finals was from a culmination of all of the dirty things he did in previous games 🤷🏾‍♂️
Steven Adams is a really good chess player apparently
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
Instead they gave him Steven Adams.
Draymond and Steven Adams
I was rooting for Steven Adams that draft.   Maybe LMA would have stayed if we had Adams instead of CJ? I dunno
"and then traded their second best player for what’s left of Steven Adams, &amp; Eeyore, now they got rid of their best shooter for cookies and no ones asked the question."
"Steven Adams is a household name amongst NBA fans, but he's not the superstar level free agent people refer to when they talk about big name free agents"
"He ain't bad. He's certainly not Steven Adams. Griffin must be on a real tight leash these days, how much longer do you give him before you ask for his head on a stick? Are fans still pissed at AD for wanting out after seeing how Zion may potentially be squandered? What's the word on the street Pels bro?"
Draymond and Steven Adams
Jrue asked to be traded and they did him a solid by sending him to the bucks. Holding on to Bledsoe and shipping out hill was the bad part of that deal. The Steven Adams trade and extend was bad as well.
"Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee)  How is that great?"
"You gotta offer him big money for him to turn down big money. It seemed like they were pretty willing to watch him leave. As for requesting a trade, that doesn't mean you have to make a bad one. Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee) are bad players and bad picks."
"Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee)  They got some bad picks and two bad players/contracts."
"Steven Adams: ""Mate"""
"He barely played with Lebron, the same one who said he was going to activate playoff mode and got kind of lazy instead. The Zion point made no sense either. Zion is great offensively but fucking awful on defense, you can’t pair a bad wing defender with a bad front court defender especially back in 2020 during the bubble where just no one on the pelicans played well.    2021 Ingram had no spacing, between Bledsoe’s “I don’t wanna be here” useless ass, Zion and Steven Adams, how was he ever going to truly do well when he’s always going to be more contested on his shots than most players in the league? You can argue that Zion did well with poor spacing but like...Look at him, he’s a behemoth of a man compared to the twig Ingram is, he just bullies himself into the paint for an easy lay up"
"Worst part of it is, Presti has a terrible track record over the last decade of drafting outside the lottery. People act like he's a genius for securing all the mid and late first round picks, but he hasn't nailed one of them since Reggie Jackson about 10 years ago. Roberson was a decent pick, but even that was like 8 years ago.  He has actually nailed his lottery picks though (Steven Adams is probably his worst one, and that was an above average pick), so hopefully Giddey isn't a bust. I'd love to know how many first rounders he offered Cleveland for #3.  As the number of picks we have coming in is way more than the number of upcoming roster spots we have available, I would've offered #6, #16, #18, Phoenix's 22 first rounder, Clippers 22 first rounder, and an all you can eat buffet of 2nd rounders. Wouldn't have thought twice about it either."
The pick trade-down was David Griffin undoing his own mistakes (which is kind of a crazy waste of assets) but I do think Jonas is going to be a *big* upgrade over Steven Adams. Mans averaged 17ppg and sometimes got doubled.  With Devonte' it sounds like we had other plans that fell through to be the trade piece to grab him (Josh Hart for Graham) and then we traded the pick for some cap-related reasons when we couldn't do that.  Neither a great look or inspires a lot of confidence though lol.
"I know we aren't big winners, but this dude literally says we lost the #10 pick (Zaire Williams) and then mentions that we lost two firsts...  Like we didn't fucking draft Trey Murphy!   Nope, just...lost that draft pick. Gone, nothing to show for it but a guy who shot 50/40/90 in college last year, who we probably would have drafted at #10 anyway. He's also got Fred Vinson coaching, the guy who made Lonzo into a good shooter. But yeah. OK man.   We added fucking shooters, which is what we needed, because Steven Adams and the wisp of Eric Bledsoe reaaaaalllllly didn't help with the spacing.   We've also still got a good bit of picks/swaps, one of which we get from an old ass Laker team 3-4 years from now. That might be in the middle of a rebuild, and I know too well that AD, while an incredible player, doesn't have the mentality, or structural integrity to be a the guy that elevates his teammates and leads them to deep playoff runs.  We got a really young ass core as it is, we can sacrifice some picks. Jaxson, NAW, and Zion all going into year 3. Kira going into year 2, and now Trey Murphy. I like all of them.   Though, unless Willie Green works a miracle, we are gonna fucking suuuuuuuck on D. Gonna drop like 130 a game though, so, at least should be fun. C+ so far."
"It’s not just superstars that have their best seasons when playing with Russ either. Just off the top of my head, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Dion Waiters, Danuel House, Anthony Morrow, and Thabo Sefolosha are among the role players that were at their best when Westbrook was passing them the ball.   He had literal G-Leaguers looking like somewhat competent role players during his MVP season, and he got Kyle Singler a 5 yr/$25 million contract, which could be argued as being the most impressive achievement in the history of basketball considering how ass that dude was."
Here in New Zealand. It's goes. 1. Steven Adams 2. Jordan 3. Shaq (magic)  4. Rodman 5. Lebron This is going off the shirts I see people wearing. For non Basketball fans it's MJ and Shaq.
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Yes, but... They could have extended him at the start of the season. They could have made better moves than Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. They fucked up with JJ. They fucked up with Van Gundy. They didn't get value for Jrue. They should have made the playoffs.   If any of that had gone better they probay could have kept him. Even if he wasn't in their long term plans, they had a chance to buy low and sell high, but they passed.   When Zion walks, those mistakes are gonna hurt a lot more."
I like Williams who they essentially got in the trade by moving up. And Steven Adams is a downgrade but I think he’s going to return to form to some extent this season. He’s always played well in the pnr and ja is a pnr virtuoso
nobody except Steven Adams and Melo....?
"loooool r/conspiracy  is that way  if Westbrook's own teammates Steven Adams and Melo said it and you still don't believe it, I can't help you"
every russ post you say the same thing over and over again...... he averaged another triple double with the wizards without steven adams so whats your excuse then? jesus get a life
"Tbf they made shit hard on themselves with CP3 and AD. Sure they got AD boogie but the one time they finally get their guy his second all star it goes terribly, but that's the problem they aren't known for surrounding their guy with good talent. They overpay for mediocre players then cry ""see overpaying never works"" so instead they don't pay at all lmao. Their biggest fuck up was the beginning of Zion's career. You had the perfect rebuild already almost fully completed with lonzo, Jrue, BI and Zion. Somehow that ends up with Bledsoe and Steven Adams starting with Adams getting such a shit contract extension (at least they traded those two guys). Like why. Just why.   Yeah you got a shit ton of picks but truly what was the point when you already had the perfect retooling post AD. You legit just had to give it 1-2 seasons. To finish up the roster surrounding that core with solid role players."
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
I bet everyone shitting on the Pelicans this offseason was also shitting on them last offseason for not signing Aron Baynes instead of acquiring Steven Adams.
Post Steven Adams 2 Pointer you coward
"I'm gonna keep it 100 with you, as long as Bledsoe isn't shooting that shot, I'm fine with anyone, Steven Adams included, taking it contested or open."
"This idea that you don’t need all your picks is insane and why this team won’t work out. The war chest isn’t for fixing mistakes or trying shit out like giving one away to overpay Steven adams. It’s for building a fucking dynasty around Zion. You need to be almost perfect. You at least need to have a near perfect process, the results may come down to luck, but the process is important. You can over value the wrong player at the wrong position and fix those holes by gm giving up picks.  You never know what pick is going to turn in to a star or land you the perfect player or turn into a 3rd overall pick in a few years then you happen to add a young star on a rookie deal to help out a now contending Zion and ingrim team.   You can’t afford to be reckless with picks even if you have a lot. You still have to use them judiciously, if they are wasted then they might as well not exist.  I don’t see how or why you would justify what Griffin has done.  He’s Like Jerry col Angelo stepping in for hinkie and blowing it but he’s doing it to himself."
"The only good defender the Pels had was Lonzo. Steven Adams would constantly get burned, Bledsoe might of been one of the worst this whole year and tried in spurts I guess. BI and Zion are just not good and lack awareness on that side. You have a few guys like Hart, Naji Marshal and James Johnson that hustle on the defensive side but it's merely not enough to cover all the holes on that end."
"The biggest issue I personally had with Lonzo was his unwillingness to drive into the lane. There were stretches of games where he just didn’t shoot any free throws at all or really attempt to be aggressive at all. He did become a much better 3 point shooter however. If he could develop some more assertiveness to try and get to the line, he could be an allstar player in my mind. I’m just not sure if the Pels are willing to take that gamble considering how much it would take to bring him back. This team needs something more to make the playoffs. Graham may not be it, but there’s flexibility there to make other moves if the opportunity presents itself. The Pels have locked themselves into lots of bad contracts during the Demps era just for the sake of making moves. Maybe the strategy of small moves is a welcome change. Strike when they see a chance instead of giving fat contracts to Omer Asik, Steven Adams, and Solomon Hill."
"Grizzlies just took on Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe's contract, took Iggy's contract before that. That doesn't mean that they aren't trying to win, they made the playoffs last season, and were really close the year before.   Their cap situation is just very healthy thanks to a ton of the younger players having team friendly contracts. Once SGA/Ja/JJJ extensions kicks in, they will stop taking bad contracts."
Watched the Pelicans all year long my guy lol. Why y’all continue to attribute all the problems to last year’s teams to Lonzo when Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams are in your starting line-up will never make sense to me. Graham is a worse Lonzo in every category except free throw percentage and pnr. But you got it lol. Y’all be easy.
They haven't been very relevant unfortunately nowadays other than Steven Adams and former Duke Assistant HC Jeff Capel. There is Justin Champagnie on a 2-way deal with the Raptors but that's about it
The point I’m trying to make is that he’s simply not missing all that often for his rebounds to come from putbacks (JV &amp; Steven Adams are at 56 and 54 respectively and we don’t talk about them the same way)
I think Jonas was better than Kyle Anderson this year. Sure he’s a post-up guy but that’s a massive improvement over Steven Adams who I genuinely believe was scared to shoot layups this year.   The Vucevic move was considered an overpay because they gave Orlando a pretty decent pick and a pick that was an uncertainly as we don’t know if the bulls were/are really gonna be good in 2023. The lakers should be good next year barring major disaster though in my opinion which makes giving up their pick passable for me
On god I need him to try this with someone like Metta or Steven Adams
"Which is ironic because Pelicans fans upvoted me when I said it months ago (probably bc they were on a losing streak if I'm assuming) but now I get downvoted in all the Pelicans thread, even when it's way less harsh than anything I've said about trading for Steven Adams."
"Checks out, huge individual rebounding numbers but his teams were average overall rebounding wise - reverse Steven Adams (although Russ inflated this insanely)"
"Griffin traded for Steven Adams, gave him a huge extension, and then promptly traded him away after 1 year. What is a prospective free agent to think about that? I think players know that the Pelicans FO is aimless and rudderless right now, they have no idea what they’re doing or where they’re going. I think the Pels just need to focus on improving the players they already have instead of trying to find the answer elsewhere. They still have some nice young players in Ingram and Kira Lewis to put around Zion and I think Willie Green will help coach some cohesiveness into them."
"The first coach was here for years. It wasn’t a surprise he was fired. The mistake was hiring SVG who couldn’t connect with the players. The only trade mistake we made was signing and extending Steven Adams. I didn’t like the move, but I understood why he did it. Both of those has been fixed and the roster is clearly better right now with more moves happening in the near future.  I’m talking about the current team, not the AD Pelicans. We have a totally different FO and owner since 2018, so the organization that caused the AD era to be so bad isn’t the current organization at all.  If the Spurs got a new owner and front office, the old dynasty era would be disconnected from the new era."
"This is a chicken/egg thing.  Is LA attractive to free agents because it spends and then the free agents make the team better and then LA becomes a destination?  Or is it that LA attracts free agents which earns the team money and then allows it to spend on free agents?  Its been like 50 years since Dr. Buss moved the team here, so it doesn't matter which one it is.  But it always annoys me when these other markets cheap out on free agents, don't pay their own guys to stay competitive, or refuse to overpay for a marquee name in the rare instances where they would come to your team and THEN cry about how the Lakers or Heat are getting everyone.  PJ Tucker was an important piece to the Bucks' championship, they should have handed him a blank check and said ""write a number"" and paid it to stay good.  OKC traded Harden (while he wasn't the MVP he was now, if you know you're a small market then you overpay for potential) to save a little cash and look where that's gotten them.  Tillman Fritata cheaped out on Ariza to save some cash which pissed off Harden and was probably one reason why their coach, GM, and star player left.  There are loads of other examples over the years, and it usually has to do with money.  If a team doesn't spend, then I don't feel sorry for them when they can't get free agents.  You gotta commit to making your team attractive.  If its simply about the city and the weather, then Dallas and Houston would get more free agents than they would, Clippers would be rolling in players just like the Lakers, and the Knicks would be a perennial power house instead of being ditched by Durant who said the Knicks name is garbage and didn't give them a meeting.  I mean, look at what's going on in New Orleans right now.  A bunch of guys let go, almost a brand new roster, trying to remake the team with Bucks draft picks and scraps to surround your generational talent?  If they didn't have someone who's better than Lonzo already committed, then they should have signed him.  If they weren't going to rebuild, why the hell did they get Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?  You can't blame the Lakers and big markets for taking away free agents when you sign clearly bad ones to try and compete for the 9th seed, that's not our fault."
They keep trading Steven Adams. So Ive been following the nets  because of Sean marks.
"I feel like this is kind of missing the point though.   * Last offseason was a disaster, they've already lost assets just trying to undue the Steven Adams deal, which was a weird, questionable move at the time. * 3 coaches in 3 years. * Zion somehow not even having a top 15 selling jersey because nobody in NO gives a shit about the team. * Free agents clearly leaving money on the table to chose other markets over NO even though you would think the idea of playing with Zion would be enticing.   I don't like when the media tries to force stars out the door but there is plenty of reason to speculate about this."
"Yes absolutely. International fans don't feel geographically tied to a team, so end up attached to teams usually via the players. With player movement through trades and FA I've ended up an OKC and now Grizzlies fan thanks to Steven Adams, and am also an old Lakers fan due to watching Kobe growing up."
"Plus NAW from Va Tech, James Johnson from Wake Forest, Steven Adams from Pittsburgh."
I'm betting on Steven Adams. He can most definitely catch sharks with his bare hands and won't be seen as a strategic threat.
Did you see what Russ did for Steven Adams? He pretty much got him a max contract because he gave him so many easy buckets. Russ is the king of the dump off and floater lob to his bigs. AD will absolutely feast. Adams is nowhere the shooter or finisher AD is either.
Yeah I wish we got Fournier with all the money we got getting rid of Steven adams and Bledsoe
Yeah agreed he made a poor trade for Steven Adams
"Presti leaked this so Oklahomans would get off his case. He's [no Steven Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afv1NxeFZDw), that's [for sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8FMAwZDAw)."
"They aren't really stacked with picks though.  They have one more pick from the Lakers in 24 or 25.  Then two Bucks picks in 25 and 27.  Rebuilding teams shouldn't be giving up 1st round picks for role players.  It's dumb.  They already wasted two on Steven Adams, so they should know better."
"Lmao are you good? In what world is Devontae better than Lonzo? Hell, Graham shot better on three than on the field(37%). He’s not a huge threat to shoot, and therefore has no gravity for Zion. Although Jonas is better than Steven Adams, I’m not sure if he balances out well with Zion. I would say the team is about equal though especially with Willie Green as their coach"
"Man you really buy into the “team targeting player” nonsense that’s built up by agents to increase their contract offers.  They had the cap space to sign Dinwiddie for way more than the wizards if they wanted to. You guys are also way overvaluing Lonzo. He’s a 3&amp;D player who thinks he’s Jason Kidd.  All said, currently they added Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte Graham, Tomas Satiransky and Garrett Temple while losing Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams.  May not be remarkable improvement but hard to say they’re not better. Adding JV and shedding Bledsoe is huge."
"I agree with the struggling to create and penetrate, but I disagree about him having a hard time making passes out. Really there's almost no pass he isn't capable of, he even makes passes off tip rebounds.    The problem is in man defense when there's nobody open he's useless with the ball in his hand. For example, PnR numbers with Steven Adams aren't bad but they're not great. With Zion though, they're through the roof. Lonzo fits the Bulls as PG because between Vucevic and Lavine somebody can create in half court off-ball. Both players also lack playmakng Lonzo has."
"&gt; I think the issue is that it seems like the Pelicans don't have a plan.  See this take I have no problem with, because a lot of the moves don't really pick a direction. The Steven Adams stuff is a good example, as does trading Jrue but then trying to bring in Lowry in the same year. That said, I think if the 'contend or Zion will leave' is loud to us it must be deafening to the front office - and they're in a position where they have to rebuild to win, but also have to win now. I think that's some reason why recently a lot of the moves are a little contradictory.  I think it's fine if in a couple of years Zion feels the F.O. isn't able to deliver and decides to go somewhere else (everyone says New York, but let's be real if he's trying to escape historically incompetent F.O.'s it's not a good place to go). The conversation about Zion leaving happening now, however, at this volume *absolutely* makes the F.O.'s job more difficult. The natural option for the rebuild is suck another year, cash in on the draft, then build around your young core. But they can't do that, because if they do that then everyone says Zions leaving. So instead they have to build a team on a bizarre timeline that basically plans on leaving them without assets or good players when Zion hits his prime. They have to win now with the least good version of Zion, without any option to experiment or test players alongside their franchise player. And at the back of the mind is 'If this doesn't work we've screwed ourselves for the next *X* years and also lost Zion'.  I honestly think the Pelicans might be trying to rebuild, while bringing in win-now guys. And it's not a good strategy, but both the others are pretty dangerous."
"Again, Jrue requested a trade *because he knew the Pelicans were on a different schedule*. They literally did the Jrue thing perfectly; they traded away an older vet for a shit-tonne of picks to help them rebuild. They didn't end up keeping Lonzo, but they still got Brandon Ingram - who is a great match with Zion and they have been developing alongside him - and a shit load of picks *for the rebuild*.  &gt; and other assets are shipped out just to get rid of the self inflicted Steven Adams extension.  Oh, that horrible trade that cost them... One first rounder, and moving down 7 places, in exchange for ditching Bledsoe (who had to be attached to the haul of Bucks' picks) and getting a centre that fits them better? Extending Adams was dumb, but is this that shipping out of assets that appears so far to have actually been a good trade?  We're literally coming off the back of a championship won by a guy drafted into a small market who the media told to leave over and over. We literally had five years of Jason Kidd head coach like decisions way worse than not expecting your young guy to get a $85 million contract from another team and matching the offer not being within the plans for the cap-space.  The stuff about Zion forcing his way out is just complete hysteria that completely contradicts the cycle of NBA teams between contending and rebuilding."
Point is they’re following the text book for how to lose Zion.  Making the worst of their highest stakes moves and biggest bets so far.   Started with AD/Jrue and slowly shitting things away as guys like Lonzo are gone for nothing and other assets are shipped out just to get rid of the self inflicted Steven Adams extension.
"I mean, you hired an awful coach whom you fired one year in, Steven Adams extension was god awful, and trading for Bledsoe was god awful. David Griffin hasn't done a single good thing in NOLA since the AD trade."
"No it's even worse than that. They didn't have to attach a useful player in George Hill and a draft pick for Steven Adams. Then even worse, extending Adams when you're not sure he would fit with Zion. None of this is playing the result either, these were bad ideas at the time. Dell Demps at least traded for Jrue. Griffin's two best moves have been trading for Kyle Korver and trading Waiters for JR Smith and Shump. What a fucking disaster of a GM.  [“And I was the one on campus at UNLV,” he added. “I’m the one who got sold the bill of goods and I bought it hook, line, and sinker. You f— up sometimes. But I feel bad [ex-Cavs GM] Chris [Grant] took it for that, because Chris was the one guy who wasn’t sure.”](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/david-griffin-admits-f-up-drafting-anthony-bennett/404567) How do you let this fucking idiot run a  billion dollar enterprise is baffling."
Last year's pairing with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe was mind boggling.
"As a long time pelicans fan, this is the most obvious move motivated by money I have witnessed. Being a kiwi, it was easier to deal with the Steven Adams deal. I respect the way Jrue holiday was looked after he definitely deserved the championship. But you toss away an amazing asset who has improved every year and give us Satoransky. Its hard to be a loyal fan to these small markets."
Why isn’t Allen worth 5/100 when Steven Adams got 4/100?
Steven Adams bad
"Steven is MUCH less athletic than Allen, and much older too. The Adams contract was for like 25 mil per year (when there was a lower salary cap), and only looks bad today because New Orleans foolishly extended him for 2 more years. OKC got maximum value for that contract during Adams' best years and thens till received a 1st round pick for him when they traded him."
Steven Adams is 27 and has fallen off a cliff
"Agreed, I watched him a fair bit after the trade to Cleveland and he and Garland were a really fun tandem to watch. Ran the pick and roll to perfection. People thinking he’s another Steven Adams clearly haven’t seen him play."
"Can't lie, I saw that number and thought about Steven Adams, who many Thunder fans were highly connected to....but that contract didn't make sense then and it didn't make sense a year later or a year later....  ....and even after getting traded he got ANOTHER bag."
This kind of feels like the Steven Adams deal all over again.
I'm so confused because Steven Adams got traded the other day yet the trading window isn't open?
"Most ring chasing role players on big market teams with 2/3 super maxes*  If guys like Steven Adams can get $18 mil a year playing for a small market team, there’s no reason the average 6th man on a contender can’t also get paid this much"
"How much of that is SVG’s fault? Also Bledsoe and Steven Adams were terrible fits. I don’t think Lonzo was the issue, he makes sense as a floor spacer and secondary playmaker next to Zion."
"You give little description about this ""worst spacing in the league"", which would be the interesting part. You just say it was.  Well I would say it wasn't ""the worst in the league"".  Let's say you got 5 guys on the court. Westbrook is obviously able to power through to anywhere, and he was also shooting threes. Durant is known as top shooter (very ineffective from distance in 2016 playoffs for that matter, but doesn't matter). Roberson also was shooting threes. Ibaka was great distance threat for a big. You have a lot to guard, and also you have to commit people to Steven Adams, who is quite a threat to get a ball at the place where he just has to put it in.  It really didn't look like the worst spacing for me. In the end, OKC's game plan was mostly to just have Durant and Westbrook do plays alone, and get enough to win a game with great defense and rebounding, but the spacing itself was not so bad. Ibaka, Roberson, Kanter, Adams, Waiters etc. were getting quite good shots."
Difference between spacing and being a good 3 point shooting team. The Bucks had great spacing around Giannis all 4 guys were a threat outside the arc  Combine that for the 2016 Thunder when his starting backcourt was Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson? And Steven Adams as his starting center? Forget about it
"I've watched almost every Pelicans game this past season and it sure is weird when you claim a guy can't play in the half court when you delegate him to the corner and the first thing asked of him when passing half court is a handoff to Steven Adams 3 feet above the 3 point line.   Am I saying Lonzo is some CP3 esque half court offensive mastermind? Absolutely not. But it feels weird when all these Pels fans shit on him when he literally didn't have any offensive sets using him except to sit and wait to shoot.   His PnR numbers would be drastically higher if Adams or Jaxson knew how to finish at the rim unless spoon fed 2 feet from the rim. Adams had no touch, Jaxon just got bodied on his way to the rim."
"The league changes so quickly.  Ben Simmons has a poisonous contract that scares most fan bases.  It’s like a 4 year contract though.  When he has a good season this year, we might all change our mind.  Kyle Lowry is so old.  He’s probably the most coveted free agent this offseason.  If he starts to have a bad season, his contract will suddenly be terrible!  Mike Conley had a terrible contract before and Chris Paul!  And now they’re highly coveted!  It makes you wonder what will happen with guys like Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Al Horford.  The players are people and people can change, they can fully return from injury, fit in a better system, improve, etc. and we all just have to react to it and change our perception"
"Griffin is an impressively bad GM, first move after signing zion was damn near maxing steven adams and hiring an outdated coach"
Steven Adams wears lifts.
I don’t even know if KD is that tall. Steven Adams measured 6’10.75” and is noticeably taller than KD. Kd is probably around 6’10” flat or a hair under. 6’11” with sneakers.
"hear me out (or dont), steven adams is crazily overrated. Most people have him as a decent starting calibre center when in reality at best he should be a 2nd or 3rd stringer C. He honestly is just not very good any anything. I think russ made him look really good around 2016, but the dudes only 28 and has regressed already. So he's overrated in the sense that he's not rated *very* highly but for where he is rated it is too high"
No one is saying it but it’s because of Steven Adams defensive rebounding mentality. He’s said it’s slower for him to pass after getting the ball so he’d rather just box out for a guard. Hence why his offensive rebounding numbers are so good.
He shouldn’t have hit Steven Adams in the groin so often and he wouldn’t have reached the tech limit.
Went from 6.5 rebounds per 36 as a rookie to 5.2 his second year to 10.1 this past year next to Steven Adams the most unselfish rebounder ever
Steven Adams is the common denominator here
Steven Adams works really hard for Hart's rebounds
Yeah our ball movement and spacing and therefore offense was pretty damn good between 2010-2017.  But you know what's way more interesting? The flimsy looking clean shaved dude who's guarding Duncan is Steven fucking Adams. Every once in a while I look at his transformation (both body &amp; face) to add a little joy to my day.
"Morey also got James Harden for Steven Adams and Kevin Martin, same as Ainge got Tatum, Brown, and all those Nets picks for aging KG/Paul Pierce.  Not saying this was handled exactly correctly but you have to ask for ridiculous deals to get them which does happen from time to time. It has shaped the future of franchises many times.   Also, knowing Morey’s negotiation history his position was probably that he didn’t want to make the team worse and move off Simmons unless someone blew them away.   Otherwise he can always take one of the lesser offers later if that’s the only option; what, the Pacers will suddenly not want Simmons anymore because Morey asked Golden State for more picks?"
Trying to think outside the box here:  Alperen Sengun with John Wall speed and athleticism  Ja Morant with Steven Adams strength  Deandre Ayton with CP3 handle/playmaking
The thing is it’s hard to build a decent team with an incompetent FO and being near the bottom of the free agent destination list. It’s one thing to trade for players but this is the same front office that extended Steven Adams to another huge contract before he played a single minute in a Pelicans jersey. They made middling moves in the off-season. They aren’t gonna do anything substantial while Griffin is their GM.

Yeah he's definitely improved his image since kicking Steven Adams in the nuts repeatedly.
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
And since Gasol is always out/always hurt?  Now the Lakers have a guy who can come in and run a little bit with Russ in a way like Alex Len or Steven Adams used to do.
"If the Pelicans only got rid of Eric Bledsoe they'd win this easily. They also made a much needed upgrade at center with Jonas Valanciunas over Steven Adams. Have 6 different young players who will show growth in Zion, BI, Jaxson Hayes, NAW, Kira, and Naji Marshall and drafted players who can play d and showed out in summer league Trey Murphy (all summer league) and Herb Jones. Also Murphy looks like a sniper which is much needed."
And Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
"Mixed feelings I suppose. We’re all sad to see jonas go but I personally have somewhat high hopes for steven adams. Ziaire Williams was an odd move over a guy like moody, imo. Other than that, everything is oriented toward long-term development so theres nothing to scream about yet."
"The Pelicans got a great return for both AD and Jrue Holiday when they traded them, but it's just reality that they've already squandered a big portion of what they got, and it started almost immediately. The Lakers gave them the 4th pick in the 2019 draft, which they could have used on DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland, but instead they traded it for Jaxon Hayes and NAW. They've now let Lonzo go with an extremely questionable return, and they traded away another first round pick they got from the Lakers to unload Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. This was after wasting picks and other assets to get Steven Adams in the first place, of course. They're a poorly run team so it's no wonder their star players always want out."
"That analogy is completely way out there. AD wanted out of New Orleans because they were wasting his prime years. He gave them heads up of where he wanted to go and where he didn’t want to go. He wanted to play ball for the Pelicans but the Pelicans insisted on benching him so he didn’t get injured and tank his trade value. Pels trade AD to the Lakers, they get a great return. They now make dumb moves like trading away Jrue Holiday, acquiring Eric Bledsoe or sign Steven Adams for a long term contract, or fail to re-sign Lonzo. Now Zion isn’t pleased and we’re close to square one,"
"No offense to Ja but if Westbrook and CP3 couldn’t get Steven Adams to higher then 14 ppg then Ja won’t be able to either.   Although I do think Ja could score an efficient 23-25 because of his floaters coming off Adams screens, and get a higher assist number because of JJJ spacing ability."
"Yea when he was in a more used role in Memphis' system. JV wasnt abusing people in Toronto like he did here, look at the numbers. Steven Adams will have a more used role in Memphis (especially since we have no true C other than him) than he did for NO or for OKC. I hope I am wrong because I loved JV here, but I am confident his numbers will go down and not look as good as he did here, and Adams will have a career year."
Steven Adams is not the post player JV is. JV was abusing the hell out of mismatches.
"You meant to say Nicole Kidman or Rupert Murdoch or Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe or Jacinda Ardern right?  I'll even accept that Jemaine Clement and Steven Adams aren't very Australian Australians, or even Richie McCaw or any of the people on the North East or South East island aren't tru Aussies, because they don't say feesh and cheeps correctly.  Anyone who works as a mechanic and has to deal with Jason Donovan on an Aussie soapie is pretty Australian-Australian though.  Edit: also pretty sure Kylie can hit a damn free throw."
"All talking heads for their markets are the same, they say knowledgable stuff but do not have an honest feel of the team 100% of the time. I've even spoken to Chris personally a few times, he is a nice guy but I dont think anybody here will tell you his opinion on the Grizzlies is the best or even 100% accurate.  All I can say is watch this season, you'll see JVs numbers go down with no good PG to set him up (good luck Graham) and Steven Adams will improve drastically (similarly to when JV left the Raptors). I'm ready to eat my words if not. If JV was the MVP of the Grizz as others are saying, his numbers will continue for NO and Ja's would decrease since he lost his presence and guy to pick and roll with."
"Kyrie is going to become an activist.  LeBron is going to be a GM, business mogul, actor, producer  The real question is, WHO BECOMES A SHOW HOST?!  How great would it be if Kahwai was a host.  Imagine him with Klay Thompson or Jimmy Butler or Steven Adams just shooting the shit on an NBA show."
And that argument would end quick for anyone who watched games. Morant set up a lot of the action JV was doing on offense. I guarantee this season Steven Adams excels and everyone will act shocked.
I don't know if you're kidding but that's Steven Adams
He was absolutely giving it to that Steven Adams/JVN hybrid
Steven Adams.  His victims stop existing.
"Dreymond, CP3, Jimmy Butler, Steven Adams, Collin Sexton"
He's gonna punch Steven Adams in the face again now that's he's in grizz gear.    This is well deserved. That series vs SA was amazing in '11. He killed it.
*Today* it isn’t because he isn’t making 23M. He’s making what? 15?  That Steven Adams contract wasn’t bad either until it was…
Is this the 2021 version of the Steven Adams extension?
"I have. Which is why I know AD will love playing with him. As does every single roll man who’s ever played with him. Steven Adams, Ibaka, Daniel Gafford, Kanter, even Nick Collison. If you’re a big who can roll, grabs ORBs and especially catch lobs you feast with Russ."
I'm aware. My point was just that it doesn't mean jackshit how good your shot in the gym is. Even Steven Adams can look like a 3pt threat there.
Steven Adams?
i'd pick the pelicans. they used to have steven adams and he probably went to australia a couple times growing up in new zealand.
Steven Adams
Steven Adams might one of the stronger dudes in the nba and really could never shoot.
"It would take some time to find it, but when Harden got traded the Rockets forum was pretty pissed about losing the Toronto  pick that became Steven Adams.  There were plenty of people who would rather trade for OJ Mayo and keep the pick. Yeah, that didn't age well."

It’s called having a thin frame. Your frame is what determines your max weight along with diet. If you have a skinny frame you can’t just get big like steven adams. It’s mainly genetics.
Steven adams.
Steven Adams grew up poor. I'm not sure if that was the case for all his siblings but unless Steven supports her financially she might have had to get outside support
"Steven Adams, the Gasol bros and the Lopez bros are all super wide. Mobley can't be that but could be like Dwight with smaller shoulders. He's skinny because he doesn't eat enough to gain weight. There is very little variance in people's ability to process calories."
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
Nurkic always ate Steven Adams lunch.
"fun fact, they have a grove of redwoods there and because of the volcanic soil they grow 3 times faster than the ones in the US.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, Steven Adams is nasty."
"that just means they're not eating enough or burning too many calories. if he eats what steven adams is eating and does the same physical activity as steve adams, he's not going to magically be skinnier than steven adams."

"You should edit the parallel video, ""Mobley humiliates Steven Adams 1v1"""
"Damn r/NBA really be down bad with these posts sometimes.   This is a 30 second clip from a full video posted a few days ago. A video which has a lot more content and context than a 30 second video. The difference is OP made a 30 second clip of like a 10 minutes video and literally just added a clickbait title to it. The full context of this video shows both players scoring on each other from multiple spots and too be honest, mobley was taking harder shots and is in a worse matchup for this type of drill. Yet OP, takes 30 seconds of Steven Adams scoring and turns it into a Steven owning a rookie post with the clickbait title  Edit: I guess my point is if OP was really trying to spread quality NBA content he could have posted the video or at least a longer segment. Instead, he clipped a 30 second video and made a clickbait title to be a karma whore"
"On an unrealated note, Steven Adams' older sister just won a Paralympic medal in shot put, one month after his older sister Valerie Adams won her forth olympic medal.  One strong family."
"Steven Adams if he were actively aggressive scares me. The man's normally a quiet soul, imagine if he had someone like Chris Paul's antagonistic personality, or Kobe's constant drive. That's what you call a true god among men."
"I only found out yesterday that Jabari Parker was like half Tongan. I think him, Steven Adams and James Johnson are the only polynesians in the nba (all mixed tho)"

Valerie Adams is an Olympic shot put champion and she has a brother Steven that plays basketball in NBA.
Quite the story about Steven Adams dad
"People tend to think that because Steven Adams is a nice guy off the court and the Draymond incident that he’s a nice guy on the court. He’s actually a very dirty player, and is annually voted as one of the dirtiest players in the league by the NBPA."
Billy Donovan playing Steven Adams full minutes against the micro-ball Rockets
"I think Mobley’s got another couple of years before he can play the 5. Like, the dude’s a stick figure. He’s quick, but until he puts on some muscle to be able to score inside against good centers, he’s gonna be settling for a lot of pull-up midrange jumpers, and he doesn’t make those at nearly the rate to make it work.   I think having him get minutes at the 4 next to Allen and spot minutes at the 5 against bench bigs might be the move, but NBA centers are going to kill him at first. Like, he was getting absolutely bullied by Steven Adams in that video that came out a while back, and while Adams ain’t a scrub, it’s not like he’s a top-tier scoring big."
David Griffin. Pelicans botched the jrue holiday trade when they decided to get Steven Adams for some reason.
"KAT’s definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there’s definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don’t know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who’s better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That’s 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I’d put above him but are debatable"
"Oh gimme a break. I’m so over hearing about how tough and brave Jokic and his cocaine riddled brothers are. Maybe if Jokic did that tough guy stare down shit to someone who wasn’t nearly a foot shorter than him. You people wouldn’t celebrate a 6”1 dude standing over some 5”4 dude. Would love to see him doing his corny stare down to a Joel, or a Mitch Robinson, or a Steven Adams. Even Lebron or Giannis or a bigger forward OoOoHhHh he pushed Devin around, damn tough guy."
Steven Adams is mvp of it
Now trade for Steven Adams too
"…… okay.   Plenty of players do embarrassing shit. MJ had a gambling addiction. Dwight Howard had that press conference with Stan Van Gundy. Gordon Hayward had that weird Player’s Tribune article come out after his Celtics signing already leaked. Kevin Durant’s twitter burners. Paul George (just him. All of him).  And yet, AD got exactly what he wanted. The Lakers obviously got exactly what they wanted. And the Pelicans got an amazing package which would look better if not for random Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams trades.   So… I think your point that it was a mess is just asinine."
"Steven Adams does a ton of little things that don’t show up on that stat sheet. He’s one of the few players in the league who doesn’t have an ego.    He doesn’t care about padding stats, how many touches he gets, or anything like that. He does whatever the team needs him to do."
I wouldn’t call that cheap as it’s a top 80 salary. And the dude did just get out of jail. That’s not a valuable trade piece. It’s not untradable but he isn’t gonna get value in a deal unless it’s another role player who averages around that contract like Bertans/Rubio or Steven Adams or a distant 1st.
"David Griffin is a good executive. He got good value back for AD, and look he was able to get rid of Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe!"
"I agree that Team 1 wins, but…Steven Adams over Capela? Dude"
woah i usually stay quiet but i know you ain’t say Steven Adams was better than Capela cmon man
"The Cavs were a more stacked team, and Steph even having an injury, they still won 3 games. He rightfully got a flagrant with Steven Adams, but that is irrelevant to this."
"He really should've been suspended immediately after kicking Steven Adams in the nuts though.     The Cavs benefitted from Draymond getting suspended but OKC didn't, even though Draymond's most egregious infraction was against the Thunder.     We probably still lose the series but hey you never know."
"Warriors should've won regardless of the suspension, but they didn't. If we're going back, Draymond should've had a harsher punishment for kicking Steven Adams in the Nuts and OKC would've gone to the finals"
Yeah well he deserved to be banned from the playoffs for the kungfu kick to Steven Adams balls a few games prior.
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
"&gt; Lol y’all literally forget how bad that thunder squad really was. All of them are bums now except brook.  Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Steven Adams...  Wtf are you talking about?  Sabonis was literally an All-Star *this year* my guy."
"Be honest, how much of a difference does JV make that Steven Adams did not? I think the Pelicans are probably still a lottery team. If he's better than Steven Adams, it's only very slightly. Definitely not worth moving down in the draft and trading a lottery pick for him, especially when JV will probably just leave in free agency next summer."
"What ""increasingly bad Jrue trade""? The Pelicans still retain two unprotected firsts and two pick swaps from that trade, and just turned Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams into Jonas Valaciunas.  All for *one season* of Jrue Holiday – after Holiday asked for a trade specifically to a contender (so Griffin more or less had to trade Jrue, and only to a relatively small number of teams).  Under the circumstances, that trade was, and remains awesome for the Pelicans."
Yep. Everything involving Steven Adams most reminded me of everything the Pelicans did years ago with Omer Asik. Someone should list out every assert the Pels got from both the AD and Jrue trades and compile what the Pels have got with those assets so far. Cause they turned Lonzo into Garrett Temple and Satoransky and they used two picks getting and then getting rid of Steven Adams. I feel like Griffin got this stockpile of assets from those trades and he's been steadily throwing them away ever since.
"You're saying ""Griffin got played"" about an awesome trade that has overjoyed every Pelicans fan. The Pels dumped both Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams for Jonas Valanciunas, who is better than either and cheaper than both. The Pels also traded down in the draft – but ended up picking a guy at 17 (Trey Murphy) who should have gone in the top five.  So, in other words, of the three established players and two rookies exchanged in that trade, the Pelicans got the best player (Valanciunas) and also the best rookie (Murphy) – both on cheaper contracts.  If that's ""getting played,"" sign me up for more."
Congrats on getting someone who managed to be better than Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. Quite the achievement.
Steven Adams was never the untradeable contract everyone made him out to be.  Lonzo Ball on 25M averaging 14/6/6 is a lot harder to trade imo unless you’re happy to throw first round draft picks around.
"steven adams got traded, nothing is impossible"
It's neat because 'Steven Adams' and 'Moehau' are also the names of mountains.
Allen's rebounding average last season is better than every single season from Steven Adams.
To be fair Steven Adams is an elite rebounder and Jaren and Ja both were aggressive in getting on the boards
Steven Adams averaged ~5 offensive rebounds during the pre-season and had 6 last night. He's good.

"The Grizzlies are hoping this will be a stepping-stone season between the back of the playoff hunt and title contention in the near future. In other words, they hope to be a solidly above average team in the Western Conference. The big question on the team is the recently extended Jaren Jackson Jr. If he is what the Basketbears hope, they could compete for the 6th seed and avoid the Play-In tournament. Other players to watch include De’anthony Melton, who will see his role increased after the departure of Grayson Allen, and Steven Adams, who looks to improve on a dreary last season in New Orleans. If he looks better than his last campaign, it could be a sign that Morant has genuine ability in making players around him better, something very exiting for the Grizzlies from their third-year star."
&gt;right now  Your own words you can’t even name one currently.   Comparing Mike James to Steven Adams is nowhere near comparing them to Jokic lmao. You’re absolutely clueless. Jahlil Okafor is more talented than Pat Bev yet Pat Bevs in the league.
"Name one? Dirk. Also, I don't see how that relates to the original point. Small pgs are inherently going to be much much more talented than bigs. Someone like Mike James is at lest 5x more talented than Steven Adams; whose your average NBA big, yet he's out of the league."
Lol Steph’s team was better than what Westbrook had in OKC for years but okay. Russ’s 2nd best teammate was literally Steven Adams the last couple years. Steph still has Draymond and Andrew Wiggins. FOH
Replying again instead of an edit so you see it.  Ayton is STRONG. I've seen Jokic back down Steven Adams. When Jokic tries to back down Ayton it's like hitting a brick wall.  Ayton might legitimately be the strongest player in the league.
"Mordant, JJJ, Kyle Anderson, Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Melton there you go"
"Grizzlies won the trade - Steven Adams fits their system better, in my opinion at least"
Steven Adams on a buy out? Derrick  Favors?
Pride and joy of New Zealand before Steven Adams joined the league
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
"He’s 22 with tons of potential and is a better scorer and rebounder for all 3 of years in the league than Adams has ever been in one, and I love me some Steven Adams. Also, he’d be a 20-22ppg scorer if the offense went through him, but he plays with cp3 an book. He went from 18ppg 2nd year to 14ppg last year and got more efficient, crushed at the role they asked of him, an the team went to the finals where for one half he was absolutely lighting the bucks up from midrange and looked unstoppable until he got a couple tricky tack fouls called on him very late 2nd quarter. He’s absolutely closer in talent level to a guy like embiid than Adams.  Embiid at 22: 20ppg, 8 boards, 2 assists, 2.5 blocks, a steal, shooting 46, 36, 78 on 14 shots, 8fts  Ayton at 21:18ppg, 11 boards, 2 assists, 1.5 blocks, .7 steals, shooting 55, no threes really, 75 on 15 shots, 2fts  Ayton at 22:14ppg, 10 boards, 1.4 assists, 1.2 blocks, .6 steals, shooting 63, no threes, 75 on 10 shots, 2fts   Embiid is clearly better but it’s possible that it’s closer than it seems. In a couple years with the offense flowing through him more Ayton could look like a legit 25ppg star. I don’t think he has the potential to reach that 28-32ppg make the 2nd round every year no matter what team top 5 type player that embiid is though.  Damn I got too much time on my hands."
Nazr Mohammed played till he was 38 (played with Iverson and Steven Adams)  Anthony Carter played till he was 36 (played with Tim Hardaway and Derozan)
"About 50%. You know basketball is a team sport though right? The majority of Westbrook’s losses post-KD have been to much better teams so it’s really not saying much. Westbrook’s teams since 2016-2017 have been mediocre. He has had great sidekicks but it pretty much ends there. His 2nd best teammate each year in that timespan has been Steven Adams, Steven Adams, Steven Adams, Covington, and Hachimura. That’s a pretty piss poor supporting cast if you ask me. Curry’s 2nd best teammate each year in the playoffs is a 1st ballot hall of famer.  Also you can talk about playoff success but how about the fact Westbrook carried his team to the playoffs last year and Curry didn’t? It’s the nonsensical Skip Bayless mentality of ‘losing in the finals is worse than not even making it to the finals.’"
could’ve been Steven adams but they traded him   “gotta slim down u fat cluck”
"That's possible, but hell no would they have accepted Steven Adams and Bledsoe for Turner or Sabonis. I'm a Pelicans fan and even i'm not that disillusioned to think that would happen."
"Steven Adams. ""Hey you fat cunt, why don't you stop with the fried foods mate? """
Basketball players lie about their weight all the time. Like Steven Adams for example is listed at 250lbs. There is no way he's under 300lbs. Guys huge. Look at mma heavyweights who are much much shorter than basketball players. They all weight between 240-265.
Grizz traded him for Steven Adams and 2 first round picks.
Myles Turner is being paid 18mil and is probably not even available. They certainly wouldn't have gotten Myles Turner for Steven Adams and Bledsoe.
17m for Steven Adams was fine in a vacuum too. Until it wasn't.
I wonder if they hoped Steven Adams would be that guy?  People always expect him to be meaner than he really is lol.
Steven adams?
Watching those Kendrick Perkins highlights: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/06/kendrick-perkins-steven-adams-silverback

LaMarcus Aldridge, $24,000,000           Look me in the eye and tell me that maxing a center doesn't come without risk."
Steven Adams was 23 when he signed his extension with OKC in 2016
Losing Valanciunas definitely hurts them. Steven Adams isn't anywhere near the offensive threat JVal was. However Jaren Jackson missed most of the season and he adds another dimension to their team. I know expecting him to stay healthy is a stretch but the potential is there. Ja is still a killer and they have good role players like Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson
Steven Adams made $29 million last year.
"Ayton just doesn’t have the offensive ceiling to warrant a max contract. He is not Embiid, Jokic, AD or KAT. And defensively he isn’t Gobert. And if you’ve got SGA on a max, and you might have to max one of Poku or Giddey (or both which is crazy but not impossible) and you max someone we draft in the next two off seasons, do you also want to max Ayton at $35m or would you rather have Capela at $18m or Steven Adams at $18m?"
Steven Adams. I want him to take me to his farm
steven adams
A lot of Celtics teams so I'm gonna put 08  PG: Ben  SG: Klay  SF: Tatum  PF: AD  C: Steven Adams
steven adams vibes 😤😤😤
"Oh yeah, if you ignore everything in between Steven Adams and the hope for Josh Giddey, they did FANTASTIC at letting the Pacers develop Sabonis.   You just decided to take a stand and are just saying whatever sounds good after that no matter how little sense it makes when actually thought about for a second. But tell me about facts you totally have as I guess you’re Presti’s burner or something. Don’t worry, saying “take the L” first totally scores points with other people as smart ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\s as you."
It’s absolutely ridiculous tho.  If you’re a top 30 player you get a max.    He willl absolutely get one.  He is worth one now although he’d be on the lower range of the max players.     But if he improves even a little bit he’s worth it.   Some of the top 30 paid nba players ayton is better than   Steven adams/kristaps/Wiggins/Ben Simmons/siakam/love/conley/wall/westbrook    This isn’t even including the debatable ones like gobert.
"I am part of a minority of Grizz fans that really thinks we should focus on Jaren as a stretch 4 first, only playing him at Center in certain matchups. I like having a traditional 5 on the roster.  Bigger Center? Throw Steven Adams at em. Playing vs the Hornets or a small ball lineup? Then we're free to play smaller with Jaren at the 5 if that makes sense."
"You're underselling it. If his efficiency is only because of CP3, why didn't DJ, Capela, or Adams put up similar numbers? Or any other center with a great PG in the playoffs?   I've watched Ayton since college, if you think he can't create on his own you haven't watched him enough. He's not Embiid on that end,  it he's not Steven Adams either.   And again, no defense against mobile players? He's one of the best mobile big men defenders in the league. His perimeter defense is what separates him from Gobert and other slow footed centers. I honestly don't know if you've watched him play more than a couple games."
"He’s not significantly better than guys like Steven adams, brook lopez, etc…."
"The cool thing with Capela is that he *grew* his game in response to the competitive demands of the league. He was unplayable in at least one postseason I can remember, just like Steven Adams became, just because he kept getting switched on and played off the court by quicker guards. Adams didn't adapt well, but Capela did."
I don't think Russ and Giannis is as bad if a fit as it seems. Jrue was shooting the 3 almost at Westbrook's career level throughout last playoffs. Westbrook had his best years with Steven Adams.  Something like Westbrook Hardaway Bridges Giannis Wood would be good imo.
"Harden under the bus? He was great. He was only there one of those 4 times though. That's a fact. IDK how that's throwing him under the bus.  And Ibaka is good but he's never been close to an all star game. He's a good starter. It's like mentioning Steven Adams (also a good starter).  &gt;totally ignoring Kevin Durant who is for sure top 40, 30, arguably 20 or lower into the teens?  I mean... No duh teams THAT successful for an extended period of time usually have multiple top 100 players on them."
Steven Adams did it better -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5V-9OZvl1c
"The second best player on that team was Steven Adams.   Semaj Christon played 15mpg.   No shade on Lillard because he's a great player, but you put him on that team and they're not making the playoffs at all."
"This is like when Steven Adams says he plays the guitar he loves to do a an awesome classical song but no one likes it, so he busses out some hip-hop which he says is easy asf and everyone goes wild lol"
"Debating between Steven Adams, Desmond Bane ans De'Anthony Melton.  A defensive big for Ja and JJJ, a shooting guard/wing, or a utility guard that can rebound, steal, defend and shoot 3's."
Steven Adams &lt;3
And Steven Adams has got to be a Pewterarm!
"Lonzo was safe here. Calculating trajectory throwing the ball off Steven Adams is basically the same as a brick wall, I assume."
"Box out Joel Embiid, Steven Adams, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, etc for 5 possessions and lmk how you’re feeling"

"Before this offseason I’d agree with you, but the organisation has made some extremely questionable moves since the lottery balls rolled their way in 2019.  They let Lonzo walk as a RFA for no reason whatsoever. They made his replacement a guy who has never shot above 39% from the field in his NBA career and a massive downgrade on defense. Overall they paid more draft compensation in the two deals than they received while simultaneously receiving the worse bundle of players both now and five years in the future.  My grievances with this team don’t stop there. They traded for a non-shooting big in Steven Adams knowing full well that their star’s main offensive weakness is perimeter shooting. They gave up George Hill, a first and two seconds in that deal. They gave up *Jrue Holiday* of all people for Eric Bledsoe, Hill, and a bunch of picks. They had the option of taking De’Andre Hunter and instead flipped him for Jaxson Hayes (again, not a bad player at all, but still a non-shooting big next to a guy who attempted 14 threes his whole rookie season) and some guys who immediately got flipped for seconds. As an OKC fan, I know all too well the importance of hoarding draft picks as a bad team, but *the Pelicans were not a bad team*. They finished 4 games out of the play-in spot in the bubble, were only 2 games out last year, and I guarantee that their 23rd-ranked defense would’ve improved if they had someone who made the All-Defensive 1st Team playing next to another All-Defense caliber guy in Lonzo in the backcourt, possibly enough to even lift them out of the play-in group. Long story short, the Pelicans have had plenty of chances to make the playoffs since Zion landed in NOLA, and they have capitalised on almost none of those opportunities.  To be clear, **I don’t believe Zion is nearly as unhappy as the media make him out to be in New Orleans, but there are certainly lots of reasons why he wouldn’t be totally happy with the team that drafted him**."
Yeah its all about the accent. That's why Steven Adams gets on the top of r/nba for saying 'mate' (seppos can't tell the different in the accent).
Bro and think about what he did to wholesome 100 kiwi Steven Adams? Yelling at him to get the fuck out of the way on every rebound smh
"They got rid of a terrorist in Bledsoe, and also Steven Adams. They'll definitely be better to watch this season"
"Yup, easily learnable skill. I heard Steven Adams has been in the lab working on it. Should expect promising results soon."
I'm glad other people are also thinking about Steven Adams balls like I do. SMH took the league long enough.
&gt; He's never played with a big like AD.  I still remember when everyone was ready to put Steven Adams at that level when he played with Westbrook. And people will still tell you that Westbrook doesn't make his teammates better.
"I saw Steven Adams working out on a mountain in Sedona, Arizona last summer with his girlfriend and their dog (which could literally run up and down almost sheer cliffs, that was almost more impressive than seeing Steven himself). Was unreal, and people were trying to get in his way as he was almost running around the edge of the paths to ask for pictures. Was a nut case scene."
"I saw Steven Adams in vegas and his height really makes him stick out, even in a masked culture, the tattoos and height are a dead-giveaway.  Super friendly to people, but I didn't go up to him or ask for a photo, he actually asked me a question if 'I was in line' I was flabbergasted because he's like 1.5 feet taller than me"
I've noticed Steven Adams does this almost every screen.

"Wouldn’t necessarily say I’ve met NBA players but, I worked at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee before they tore it down around 2016-2017, and where I had to clock in was right next to the Bucks locker room where all the bucks players and away players would pass. I walked right pass Russ, Jimmy Butler , D Rose, Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Brandon Ingram and much more. I saw Giannis and waved to him everyday lol (dude is fucking huge!). It’s so weird seeing them that close in person. My cousin was also the security guard for the locker room so he stood right outside. He was my ride to and from work so I had to wait for him to be done to go home, and he had to wait until all the players left the arena. The cooks in the arena would make food for the away team, and at the end of the night I got the left overs shit was great. Best job I ever had!"
Klay seems like the coolest dude. Shoutouts to Joe Ingles and Steven Adams though
"That's what happens with literally a whole goddamn team of franchise ISO players. Now everyone's got cold hands.  The only problem Westbrook is having is that he can't jack up 20 more shots and even out his stats. It's not like they'd feed Steven Adams in the post, but those other validated franchise players need touches too. You can't develop a guy like Adams or anyone else on that team. They don't make talent, they just fucking recruit it. There's no investment, it's just selfish and in the end self defeating bullshit. This style of basketball was never sustainable and is only viable in a noncompetitive league where they have a massive talent advantage and nobody plays defense.  The league is slowly changing. I'd like to see a Warriors and Nets final. Forget the Lakers. It's embarrassing Lebron has never or rarely blown anyone out in a finals game let alone a regular season game considering his teams have had the most talent since 2010. A whole fucking decade of having half the ratings in your pocket, basically being the GM and the coach, and a bigger budget than every other team with more talent and he still has a losing record and scrapes by. It's fucking garbage. KD had every reason to leave OKC, people really still butt-hurt about that shit.  Steve Nash and Steve Kerr know good basketball, that's where it's going to be the world of the difference when you FINALLY get teams that can compete and match up talent wise. I'm tired of pretending like the Warriors had a stacked team when they made all stars out of physically mediocre players in house. It's because they're well coached, play defense, and execute. Bunch of sorry dumbasses simping for Lebron and the Lakers. They're all garbage and a disgrace to the game."
"I just started following grizzlies for my boy Steven Adams - is their best one that teal/cyan one? Been wanting to get a jersey this season, as i never bought his OKC one or the pelicans, since pelicans kinda sucked last year lol"
Yeah wasn’t there 2 nut shots in the wcf with Steven Adams or something before the one in the finals?
"I only started to get into the NBA say 2-3 seasons ago, when big kiwi Steven Adams was getting popular (I'm a kiwi obviously!) After about 6 months of watching the big names like james harden etc sticking their feet out on the 3 point shots to draw fouls or jumping up even when no shot is makeable but milking a foul, jumping backwards into running players (like the comments about CP3) it really put me off. As a fairly casual fan it made it very unwatchable. Being from new Zealand we are very anti to the 'Hollywood/flopping' type behavior, being from a tough rugby nation lol, hence Adams is the toughest in the NBA but plays hard and fair. I honestly hope these calls fix all the offensive players changing their lines, milking fouls etc. as defense basically seems pointless to me.  It's simple for me; whoever instigates the actual contact is at fault"
Steven Adams &amp; Jarrett Allen too. And maybe JV.
"Honestly for me it comes down to who else is a free agent, and who can be acquired in a trade. Both occupy a somewhat rarefied space right now; Ayton is a very good C and you need those to compete at a high level, Bridges is one of the best wing defenders in the league and shoots 3's at a high level.   If there's a C available in the Brook Lopez/Steven Adams/Nurkic range of ability that you're confident you can get then keep Mikal. If you can't get a decent replacement in, then Ayton has to stay."
Steven Fucking Adams and it's not even close
"&gt; I mean they had Steven Adams starting with Zion last year and replaced him this year with… Valanciunas?  Is replacing Adams with Valunciunas a bad thing?   &gt;And downgrade from Lonzo to Graham.  Ignore all the context to the decision to let Zo go.   &gt;Meanwhile draft 3 point guards.  Wtf are you talking about, how does this have 60 upvotes?   You're clueless."
I really think it’s because they’re stupid. I mean they had Steven Adams starting with Zion last year and replaced him this year with… Valanciunas? And downgrade from Lonzo to Graham. Meanwhile draft 3 point guards. IMO Zion is going to be out sooner than later bc the pelicans look a lot worse this year
"17-18 is when they had Paul George and Melo. They also had Jerami Grant, Roberson, and Steven Adams."
I had a friend who met Steven Adams at a college game once. I think he described it as “the man literally blocked out the sun. And it’s not every day you meet someone who blocked out the sun.”
"Yeah the Steven Adams pairing works so well with him, especially since Adams was so successful with Westbrook and Ja has a similar playstyle"

"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
It doesn't help that we have no one to guard him or muscle him for position on defense or for rebounds. Even if we had Plumlee he's not doing much against centers like Steven Adams.
"Feel free to save this and make fun of me later if it's wrong, but I think Steven Adams is a far better fit for this team that JV ever could be. Don't get me wrong though, JV is a better player by a very good margin. Adams is a way better passer than JV and isn't glued to the paint. I think that Adams was just a bad fit in NOLA and he will thrive again being placed next to Ja who plays a whole lot similar to Westbrook. Anyways, go basketbears."
Steven Adams has 14 rebounds at the half...
"Welcome! It's pretty solid, and the Steven Adams one is my favorite."
Jesus christ the way some of yall talk about jv is ridiculous. Like he's the second coming of Hakeem. Steven Adams will give us like 75% of what jv did lmao it'll be fine
"Jaren missed almost all of last season. If he plays well, they could be about as good or even better than last season. Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Jaren Jackson, Desmond Bane, Steven Adams, and Brandon Clarke is a decent core. Definitely not great and they could miss the playoffs pretty easily especially with the warriors presumably being better but they're a decent team."
JV was their best player last year by a wide margin. Before he ankle injury it was debatable but after Ja was gimped for the entire year it was 100% JV. They've also significantly downgraded in replacing him with Steven Adams.  Adams at this point of his career should be a backup C on a good team because his legs are 100% gone
I knew who Valerie Adams was before Steven Adams cuz I used to follow track and field (still kinda do). Yeah she’s literally the shotput GOAT.
Y’all been watching those workout runs with him and Steven Adams and sga and stuff? Exciting stuff. That pass was nasty. I rewatched that like 5 times.
Anyone else Remember the preseason game where Steven Adams AND Boban both hit 3-pointers?  Even crazier is that same day Ben Simmons hit one
Yeah I agree. I'd say he started to really get hated for the Steven Adams nut kicks lol
"lol, I think thats also a combiantion of the ncaa being so exploitative now it would be common not to play through injuries or even just spend the year training. LSU made a lot of money off of him, got on national tv when they wouldn't have, the coach and all probably made big cash. Simmons got to be 'showcased' when he would've been a no one pick had he not set foot in LSU.  Definitely can rargue abotu his headspace, but college basketball is a sham for these top top recruits. STeven adams even talked about how he was curious about college and they wouldnt even let him take real courses, he was essentially an employee to produce basketball.  T-macs criticism may be more valid, but its also an 18 year old who may not know how to act as well.  The real criticism is the mental hold up or lack of progress on his shot thats apparent and culiminated in the playoffs last year.  I give him credit for take ownership and pride in his defense, the least celebrated part fo the game and finding ways to contribute as he did in that  game, but ultimately that shot and his inability to get over that hump for wahtever reason will shift his trajectory from star to more aroudn draymond green, an all star level player who finds ways to contribute to winning with the right peices around him but not someone you can build around."
"You didn't specifically mention it, but referred to it. I call it ""man strength"". Those mid 20s do a lot to develop and mature the muscles. Look at the difference between young Steven Adams and now Steven Adams; or young Giannis and now Giannis. Those boys got big and filled out frames.  It's why no college team could beat an NFL team. The linemen are too big and too strong. Even the winless Lions or Browns would have crushed the CFB Champion."
He still was though.  Big fan of Steven but young Adams was the type to throw elbows a bit far when he thought he could get away with it...little bit of extra shoving going for rebounds and loose balls....and then immediately raise his arms in innocence once he got a reaction.  Probably annoying as fuck to deal with
Looks like they like Steven Adams but they're scared of him at the same time lol
"Imo Steven Adams was always meant to be on the Grizzlies, just look at him!"
I have never hated Steven Adams.  I have disliked a lot of the teams he was on though.
"If I could be friends with just one NBA player, that would be Steven Adams."
Definitely Steven Adams. No one destroys people like him on screens
Bledsoe/Lowry   Fuck knows   LeBron   Not sure   Steven Adams
Steven adams
"He’s been the best plus minus the first four games, in fact they were winning when he was in. Terrible minus when he was out and over all lost   Doesn’t fit the narrative that somehow his  rebound out of no where isn’t a “real” rebound, did you see that assist for an open em3? He was scowling at his teammate to shoot that for a dirty empty stat!  Zach Lowe really made a point when he called Steven adams stats a victim of Westbrook’s stat stealing ways except never mentioned his rebounds never went up after   Anyways carry on we gotta have the heroes and villains and in2020 that changes every 24 hours"
We just gonna forget how he stole a round from Steven Adams 4 years ago?
"Yep, John Stockton wasn’t a winner? Malone wasn’t a killer on the court? Cmon. The fact is the ring is just scarce and every year 30 teams in the most elite league in world don’t win. Paxton rims out the three? Kerr goes short on the Utah shot, Derek fishers shot rules not in time, valde decides to slam the ball to the left rather then back to horry.  Luck and timing injuries so many facets of it. But the guys who fought year in and out and performed are odd ones to blame but that’s the media for ya and a enjoy the drama some will buy it just like Tillman fertitta pocket boy Tim McMahon writing that the guy who never sits out or takes load management while doing high minutes and insane useage while also changing and adding to his game yearly is the last one who can’t commit and is out of sjape(game one of this season he played 40 plus minutes and points-should everyone get fat?)  So the narrative can hinder just enjoying the greatness of it and part of why I try to tune away from ESPN or tmz, they’ll have you believe basketball is played 1-1 and so if I can avoid their screaming gimmicks and just respect that Westbrook is a maniac on the court and elite and unique, Steph is the assassin we’ve never seen, harden is a quiet wizard and not worry where Steven a loud moth thinks he is in the irrelevant top 25. Sucks those guys vote on players paychecks with all nba, Zach Lowe would have you believe that Westbrook just was stealing seven adams rebounds(adams never did average more after he left)"
"&gt;He has his flaws as a coach, definitely not perfect but you're greatly exaggerating it.  What exactly did I exxagerate? Are you saying that he does coach defence? That he has made playoff adjustments? That his offensive coaching is varied and flexible?  &gt;He put russ in a position to succeed, at the very least offensively, and he couldn’t do so.  How have you come to this conclusion? Russ was not in a position to succeed offensively. He's a player who thrives in transition and at short hand off passes to big men at the rim. D'Antoni was asking him to create offense out of slow pick and rolls with stagnant role players out at the 3 point line (basically to do what Harden and Chris Paul are good at).  &gt;We got rid of our center because westbrook couldn’t do shit with the center in the paint, nobody cared about how many assists he got, we wanted him to score efficiently with an open paint or pass out to a more valuable three. And he still couldn’t do that.  I'm sorry what? You didn't care if Westbrook got assists by providing easy buckets for the center and they only counted if the assist was for a 3 point shot? Providing easy buckets for the center is Westbrook's bread and butter, so why were you surprised that it hindered his game to take that away? He is not known for being an efficient scorer in the paint, and providing efficient shots for teammates near the rim is one of the main ways that he usually helps his team run an efficient offence.  Also how exactly does getting rid of your own center make it easier for a player like Westbrook to score at the rim? With no center of your own on the floor, the opposing big men are going to be less able to drop off their man and protect the rim when facing a driving Westbrook???  Westbrook played great with Steven Adams for years, and to be honest he played pretty well with Capela too. I have no clue why you are denying this and defending the rationale of having no center for him to play with.  &gt;There’s no difference between the center getting the rebound or russ getting it.  Yes there is. The offence moves more quickly in transition when Westbrook gets the rebound, leading to a more efficient offence throughout a game. Not everything shows up in the box score, and you would have to compare what you were watching in the playoffs with film of Russ in OKC doing what I'm describing.  &gt;That should have no effect on his scoring efficiency.  So players don't score more efficiently in transition? Leave alone the most athletic point guard in the league. Seriously?  &gt;And lmao, what are you saying. I’m not saying you have to do dantonis job better then him, I asked what he should have done to put Westbrook in a better position to succeed since you blamed him being trash on dantoni. Reading comprehension isn’t hard.  Lol ok nice. You're not saying that I have to do his job better than him, I just have to be able to tell you exactly what he should have been doing to do his job better. You really think that distinction is significant enough that it shows bad reading comprehension on my part hahahaha.  Anyway I do not have to provide you with this information to validate my point, and it's pointless to ask that of me. The truth is that changing anything would have been good. Running any plays in the half court other than pick and roll or iso would show an attempt to adapt. All of the really good coaches in the NBA (eg. Stevens, Nurse, Popovich, Rivers or even Kerr) would have been changing something to try and fix the problems."
What was going on with Steven Adams letting Kyle in front of him
"Well you didn't disagree with any of the things I said about D'Antoni, so should I take it that you agree with me? He's the most inflexible coach among any succesful NBA coach in the modern era.  Not all of it was D'Antoni. Much of it, like I explained in my previous comment was the absolute lack of any center or even athletic/rebounding power forwards on the roster. If you take a look at Westbrook's assists throughout his career, I'm sure you can see a pattern concerning which kinds of players he was assisting. I'm sure you will also remember the whole meme that Steven Adams boxing out for Russ became in OKC? Aside from being a stat padding meme, those rebounds for Russ enabled them to move into transition offence more quickly. Russ and quality big men like Steven Adams are an almost perfect compliment to each other, so of course having no true center on the team is something that will hinder his performance.  While we're here most of Houston's role players forgot how to shoot last year, even before the lockdown. Maybe Russ is partly to blame for this because his passes aren't always as clean or accurate as they could be, and his style of play can be unpredictable- contributing to a lack of rhythm and consistency for shooters. However this is more the coach's responsibility than any other player's, and ultimately each player has to be responsible for their own shooting and shot selection.  Ah yes, thankyou. Thank you for presenting me with the age old ""you must be able to do X's job better than them in order to criticize X"". I'll raise you there, tell me what you would have done in Westbrook's position to succeed?"
I feel like Scott Brooks just tryna copy Billy Donovan last year OKC play with 3 point guards on the court at times  But instead CP3 Shroder SGA he got Russ Neto Ish Smith which is a terrible defensively.  Bertans plays the part of Gallo and RoLo plays the part of Steven Adams. So far they haven’t run any Spain PnR or horn set tho
"That's a weird way to describe Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Dennis Schröder."
Just clicked on Steven Adams' page and had a look. There are a hell of a lot more categories being tracked than I thought.
Steven Adams literally body checked Vanvleet in front of the refs and the refs swallowed their whistles
Best part is Steven Adams not even trying to box out because he knew BI would make it

I miss Steven Adams
Steven adams/Bledsoe could potentially fill a lot of it
Steven Adams or someone similar
how else do you explain boucher literally reaching in and touching steven adams on the chest? This was like the most publicized rule change in the last 20 years and he doesn't know it lol. I guess raptors fans don't know it either.
"Exactly, Russ is a great teammate despite the rockets  scapegoating him, guys like oladipo, pg, jerami grant, steven adams, all day russ played a role in some portion of their game because he worked so hard and cares for his guys so much."
"When you're up against Zion, Lonzo and Steven Adams, its actually a fairly viable strat."
"Hindsight syill says no but siakam has been bad. Fvv is on a good tradable contract. If steven adams can get traded for a first round pick at 25 mil, fvv an elite shooter can get traded for at least a first round pick."
Steven Adams has the strength of a deaf man. What a monster
FVV in a challenge of strength against Steven Adams. Lol
"I'd take Aaron Baines, Kanter and Steven Adams  over Golbert."
Chris Boucher more points than Zion and Steven Adams combined lmao
"Fun Fact Chris Boucher is older than Steven Adams.  Boucher: 27 years January 11, 1993  Adams 27 years July 20, 1993"
I remember when r/NBA said the Pelicans were fucking stupid for not handing Baynes a deal instead of trading for Steven Adams
"Robin Lopez is the classic Scott Brooks ""let's play the washed up vet over the unproven young guys"" like playing 40 years old Derek Fisher over Jeremy Lamb and Kendrick Perkins over Steven Adams"
Steven Adams wearing slides in the snow
"There aren’t many players that can raise the floor like Westbrook, but you live and die with him doing it and somehow he’ll have to find away to take his intensity aggression and make it cohesive with his teammates. He has been to the finals with a high useage rate, he’s led terrible teams to playoffs. His stats aren’t empty Steven adams didn’t get more boards the next year. But we all see he also runs himself in the ground and has to diversify. Dude was money from a free throw pull up and a 80 percent free throw shooter and now can’t hit the ocean some nights, what happened?!"
"Cause three years later Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Martin and a couple late first round picks (even one that becomes Steven adams) looks weak compared to the leading scorer in the league. So they’d rather wait it out and maximize the return"
"Not exactly a darling, but I see that Steven Adams rarely being talked in a bad way   Or maybe because he's barely being talked at all idk lol"
I’d say Steven Adams probably gets more cuts per game but yea Steph gets mauled.
Backup center.  When Steven adams comes off the floor the pelicans kinda fall apart
I don’t know if there is a right answer here. But Steven Adams defending Shaq is fun to think about
Probably Steven Adams or Joel Embiid
For an individual center I’d say Steven Adams or Drummond?
"Bro Russ had Victor Oladipo, Damontis Sabonis, and Steven Adams in 2017, what are you talking about ?"
"I really hate when the ball handler goes around a screen and immediately flails into a jumpshot resulting in three free throws. Obviously there are exceptions and obvious fouls but some of it is just bogus.   [Patrick Beverley Gets Rocked By Steven Adams' Screen! Thunder vs Rockets R1G1 April 16, 2017 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc)  Things like the tail end of this play which was called on Roberson. Lillard tends to do this a lot as well I find. Half the time they are not even trying to score."
Oh no I said shit that a circle jerk disagrees wit? I MUST BE WRONG. Just like when a million Laker fans were demanding I apologized for saying the Heat wouldnt get swept in the finals.   I mean a common conception can’t be wrong right? Like when every pundit agreed Anthony Edwards was destined to be an inefficient player or when every pundit agreed that Steven Adams would ruin the Pelicans because of spacing. I mean people are never fucking wrong right.
My point is that they were good enough to go up 3-1.  And THEN Draymond was suspended.  And in THAT game that Draymond missed Bogut and Iggy got hurt.  We absolutely still could have won and I give Lebron and the Cavs credit for doing something amazing.  But let’s not act like it was the same kind of choke-job that OKC had just pulled.  There are very obvious reasons why that series turned around.  If Steven Adams had gone down for the rest of the series in game 5 I wouldn’t be sitting there like “Lol Thunder choked!!!!”
Could you imagine if he needed to miss an event and sent Steven Adams as his double?
"In that case, I had to force out a real Steven Adams earlier. Ever hug your knees to your chest just to add a little more torque?  Thought it was going to crack the porcelain getting flushed."
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
Wonder if Steven Adams will be a guest.
So when people do make contact and it hurts tf you want him to do. You want everyone to be built like Steven Adams? Are you really trying to say AD is not a top 5 center today?
The anti Steven Adams
"It's definitely the right attitude, but Lonzo hasn't taken a ton of heaves: 11 in 4+ seasons.  Ingram and Steven Adams took more heaves on the Pelicans last year, and Lonzo took as many as Naji Marshall."
Maybe he was shitting from his mouth. Steven Adams did say Stan's breath smells like Sulphur.
F in the chat for Steven Adams.
"It's all fun and games for normal people until they see a superhuman rushing them at full speed. With any luck, you pass out before the pain of taking a shoulder charge from Giannis or a screen from Steven Adams."
They’re working just as hard as Steven Adams did on those rebounds he didn’t get.
"&gt; I also feel like there are way more uncontested rebounds now so it just depends on where the ball bounces off the rim, anybody can grab it, so it really doesn’t matter who does.  But you also said this:  &gt;The thunder were the first to realize that having Westbrook get the ball to immediately push was more valuable than having Steven Adams grab the board and pass to Russ.  So my existential question for you is... does it really matter then because you said it doesn't but you've provided information that also said it does matter."
"Individual rebound numbers have been misleading for a solid amount of time. The thunder were the first to realize that having Westbrook get the ball to immediately push was more valuable than having Steven Adams grab the board and pass to Russ. Team rebounding is still a valuable number but individual rebounding numbers should really be evaluated situationally. I also feel like there are way more uncontested rebounds now so it just depends on where the ball bounces off the rim, anybody can grab it, so it really doesn’t matter who does."
"The type of rebounding is huge but because it's a stat that leads to (/defines) a possession another big aspect is who is getting the rebound and what they're able to do with it.    The best example of this is probably Cleveland.   * Tristan Thompson grabs the defensive rebound, hands it off to one of LeBron/Kyrie who walks the ball up the court for a standard offensive possession = 1 rebound.  * Kevin Love grabs the defensive rebound and is [an immediate threat to initiate one of the most unguardable plays in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C34bBtDz0gc) = 1 rebound.   Those two rebounds are very different in terms of value but they're both counted as 1 defensive rebound. Both were good but a Kevin Love defensive rebound was generally better for the team than a Tristan Thompson defensive rebound.  It's the same with the Russell/Wilt rebounds. Yes those two were grabbed a lot of rebounds, but they were both able to [push the ball up the court immediately for easy buckets/assists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2AlFrOj5Mc) (not to mention the famous Russell/Cousey outlets). Not only do they have guys like Drummond beat in rebounds per game, but their rebounds were more valuable.   And that same logic can be applied to OKC. Do you want Steven Adams getting the rebound and then handing the ball off to Russ or do you want Russ doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPvYSN0wtUw) and [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cod-G0cyWE0)"
This is asinine. Everyone knows some rebounds are more important than others. But also a 5 and a 1 arent comparable in their rebounding ability. Of course the bigger stronger guy will get more quality rebounds than the smaller faster guy. Comparing steven adams and westbrook in rebounding is like comparing ray allen and yao ming in 3 point shooting.
"after Westbrook got traded from OKC, Steven Adams DREB per 36 increased 62%. in every season since, Adams has had a 20%+ DREB%, a mark he never hit once with Westbrook"
Steven adams /s
"He did, indeed, post up Steven Adams"
"At one point, Beal and *checks notes* sharp-shooter Steven Adams were the only players with 100% FT (on &gt;2 FTA/game).  Hassan Whiteside was in the mix too before he finally missed one."
"I just hate all the gatekeeping with trash talk.   Let’s say Steven Adams talked shit to Jokic. There’s gonna be multiple highly upvoted comments saying, “Adams can’t say shit to the reigning MVP, he’s trash compared to Jokic.”   Trash talk doesn’t have to be some factual statement, though it helps when it is. It just needs to sting, that’s it. If it stings, whether it stings the player or it makes others go, “Ooooooo shit!” then you have good trash talk and I’m absolutely for it, whether it’s from a player or an overweight fan sitting courtside. Any and everyone should be allowed to talk shit if it stings. All this “he can’t say shit, he’s trash” is just bullshit gatekeeping to the point where only Giannis, KD, Steph, and Jokic are the only people who can talk trash."
"pick swaps are useless when you are a perma dogshit team vs a contender with a 26 y/o 2 time MVP...  so they got 1 washed Bledsoe and 2 first picks, if you wanna look at it that way and not include Adams, which prolly makes it look even worse as they either gave up RJ Hampton or a Nuggets first round pick and 2 second round picks... For that fucking contract. Just fucking unreal..  The only thing that might have value in that trade is the 27 Bucks draft pick (or ofc they somehow luck themselves into a good late first round pick in 25, which is unlikely as their best draftee (outside of the obvious pick Zion) in recent years is NAW lol)  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
"I really don’t think trading jrue was that bad. Lonzo looks bad but I think we should still wait to see how Chicago does with a larger sample size plus see how lonzo does. The Steven adams deal, passing on deandre hunter just to draft 2 busts (as of now) are the 2 biggest offenses I think. Kira Lewis jr also looks like a whiff but will see."
Steven Adams shouldn't be in that group lol
"i don't think anyone's writing off most of those guys as future all-stars. Steven Adams, yeah probably"
Steven Adams was picked right before him and he’s better had a better career than Olynyk
I honestly don't ever see him playing the 5 full-time.  Fouls too much (especially for a player you want to protect the rim) and also doesn't rebound well for someone his size. Luckily he's a hell of a floor spacer and I like his pairing next to Steven Adams.
"That's why he looks so massive on the court. He is legit big boned lol. Kinda like Steven Adams, some players just look different on the court. Like they are bigger, stronger and more physically imposing than others even with similar height and weight."
He’s the most inefficient ball dominant guard ever. He only averaged a triple double because he played behind a selfless center in Steven Adams who could care less about stats so he would clear the paint for him and grab the boards. I’ll take a solid role player over Russ any day.
"&gt;same for Steven Adams  He's a top 10-15 center and makes winning plays, idk if he's overpaid"
"John Wall is on a supermax and next time he'll play in an NBA game it will be his 41th game in 3+ years.  Have to mention the other guys who have given their teams NOTHING for a max deal this season, so Ben, Kyrie and Klay.  Have to keep an eye on MPJ, he's been hurt, but considering his injury history it might be worth keeping an eye on him.  Still hate the CJ deal because I think paying a small guard who can't really play the point and kills a defense that much kills your ceiling.  Mason Plumlee's contract continues to be ridiculous, same for Steven Adams, not a surprise that both of their teams have been so bad defensively.  Russ has to be mentionned of course still even if it's just 2 years now.  &amp;#x200B;  Have to wait to see what contracts end up like Russ in the ""well he's worth a supermax NOW, but 4 years ?"""
I honestly think Mobley is 7’1”. He’s had pics with Steven Adams and he’s noticeably taller
You can’t be offended by people thinking a dude will be an average NBA center.  That’s Steven Adams level.  That’s a good player.
Whoever got Steven Adams
"I feel like the highlights of Steven Adams intentionally trying not to get boards so Russ could characterizes my feelings about Russ’s career—I didn’t think he was ever gonna be the guy on a championship team, but he will be a stat packer on mid tiers and the league will anoint him MVP for it"
"The things where they were chosen to be on your team.  You had Lonzo and Zion, 2 players with unconventional styles but fortunately those styles mesh well together. The goal should have always been to build around those 2 + Ingram but Griffin doesn’t understand basketball at all so he decided to have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams on his team, 2 players which are the antithesis of Lonzo + Zion"
What Eric Bledsoe thing? Where we got an extra pick to him on because his salary was needed to match with Jrue's? The Steven Adams thing? We sent a protected first for him and used a pick swap to turn him into Jonas. That is an overpay but it's not franchise ruining.  Injuries have done more to kill hope than anything and he doesn't control injuries. His biggest critique is how dishonest he's been around the injuries but no one outside of New Orleans fans actually cares about that and that had 0 effect on last season.
"Not ones lead by David Griffin that’s for sure. A rebuild is supposed to give hope for a better future, but all he’s done is ruin that hope.  I love New Orleans so the Pels have been my second team for a while, but it’s just so frustrating seeing what he’s done with he’s had, the Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams things were just so stupid it still makes me mad"
I got my money on Steven Adams vs KAT next

Steven Adams still boxing out from Memphis
"Graham really isn’t a downgrade from Zo if you have eyes. Also Griff isn’t the one who isn’t taking care of zions body. Fair for Steven Adams, but we traded Adams for Jonas, who is playing like a top center right now. And 4 for 8+17 is a good trade for a team without much young talent (like us in 2019), it just sucks those picks didn’t work out. So it’s like a half knock on him, half not imo."
"Jax and NAW aren’t 0. NAW just had a really slow start to the season. I’m kinda losing hope in Jax though.  Also it’s gonna be 2 seconds for Devontae, and we got JV back along with giving up Steven Adams.  And BI is easily a positive asset lol  And Zions still has a lot of value too, idk where you got that idea from"
"Obviously they have some assets. But it really is a fraction of what he inherited.   - Zion's value rounds to zero, compared to what it was when Griffin started.  - Ingram on a max is barely a positive asset, if at all - Gave up a 1st round picks for Steven Adams - Gave up a 1st round pick to get rid of Steven Adams - Gave up a 1st round pick to downgrade Lonzo into Graham - #4 Lakers pick turned into Jaxson Hayes and NAW - rounds down to zero"
"I think last year's roster was loaded but it just didn't work. I mean lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Zion, and Steven Adams. That's a pretty good fuckin starting lineup. When do we start to look at coaching and offensive schemes? That team did not play up to what they could have"
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
Damn hes strong.  Hes probably stronger than Steven Adams.
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
Steven Adams
Steven Adams.  No one dares to challenge him. He's taken some massive hits and doesn't even flinch.
"Steven Adams. But he's the type of tough guy you only see when someone stupid kills his dog, then you best get your ass to Antarctica otherwise Big Steve is gonna send you to the afterlife."
"Steven Adams is legitimately a tough guy, but afaik he only uses his toughness for good."
"I'm not saying it for upvotes.   I'm just sick of the ""tough guy"" bullshit. Let's be real. If you're tough, it's gotta be mental, not just physical. Anyone can be physically tough. But to be mentally tough, and physically tough? That's something to celebrate.   That's why I look at guys like Steven Adams and think ""he's tough"", because he isn't letting emotional responses run the show. He stays calm, even when guys try to start shit with him. In reality, he could probably end most guys in the league, but because he has the mental toughness, he doesn't have to prove that to anyone. That's respectable.   I don't care about how people in Detroit do it, or how people wherever do it. I get it. You do what you have to do to survive. We all adapted to survive. Some people have to adapt in worse ways (like getting in fights and violence in general). But once you leave those places, which should always be the goal, that's when you have to step up and change your way of thinking about things.   Just my 2 cents."

"My top 5     Boogie, Steven Adams, Nikola Pekovic, Jimmy Butler, Russel Westbrook"
This is the biggest take away. Steven Adams grew up with like 16 brothers/sisters or some shit and grew up on the street. The man is an absolute giant and you would be a fool to try to test him. Its a testament to how chill he is that he keeps his cool and is good with just playing ball.
"Personality doesn't really fit that tough guy mold, but I feel like Steven Adams is a fucking stud who should not be messed with. I'm sure there's a reason why you never really see him in many fights/scuffles. He will make the other person back down instantly."
I don’t know if Steven adams agrees
Steven Adams
"Steven Adams, he doesn’t have a tough guy persona but on the court he’s as tough as it gets."
Steven Adams
"Larry Bird, Barkley, Jokic, Steven Adams, Ron Artest."
"Artest, Kobe, Steven Adams"
"I guess it really depends on your definition of tough.   To me, tough is being stoic. Tough isn't having dramatic reactions to things that are frustrating. That's emotionally volatile, which is the opposite of tough imo  I'm gonna go with Yao Ming who, at 7'6 and well over 300 pounds, played on a broken foot for the Rockets. THAT is toughness.   I'll throw Steven Adams in the mix, as well as Kobe, who played through countless injuries."
Steven Adams
Steven Adams.
"While I don't disagree, if they called all the fouls he commits then he would play like 12 minutes a night.  He is too slow to guard pick and rolls but he is allowed to foul the ballhandler.  He would get torched on the perimeter otherwise, which would make him unplayable.  So the NBA allows him more leeway on defense, but gives his opponents that same leeway while guarding him it seems.  He is not the only player that this happens to, I first noticed it with Steven Adams on The Thunder.  He would be allowed more contact while defending at the rim, but he would just get his arms hammered while going for dunks and they wouldn't call it."
"The only guy I think might be able to handle Jokic is Steven Adams, but if the Jokic brothers are there, Adams deserves to have his sister there."
Like the pat bev steven adams screen lmfao
I’m picturing Steven Adams walking up to Draymond in the middle of the game and just kicking him in the dick unannounced for all the previous times.
Neither rather watch Steven Adams set screens.
"I think there's a few reasons you're seeing lots of people defending him.   1. Retaliation vs Instigation. Most fans have an experience where a player on their team gets screwed over by a dirty player, and most of them would love to see some retaliation. Imagine if Steven Adams punched Draymond after the nut kick. A Cav wrecking Kelly Olynyck after he pulled out K Love's shoulder. I think alot of fans feel like the instigators get away free too often and they want some vigilante justice.   2. Famous vs Infamous. Jokic is on the path to the HoF and has made a name for himself as an incredibly skilled basketball player. His fan base is ever growing and people love his consistent honesty at the podium.  Morris hops from team to team as a role player and gets by with his hustle and toughness. He has only been on the heat for like 3 months. It also doesn't help that he shares a name with another perceived dirty player. In other words, fans were already backing Jokic and hating the Morris Brothers before this incident. Whether you see that as more fair or unfair, good luck removing those perceptions from the fouls.  3. Honesty vs Playing Dumb. Jokic came out after the game and said he felt Morris crossed the line and that's why he retaliated. He also said he regrets losing his temper. We'll see what Morris's statement is since it hasn't come out yet. If he's honest, he might gain a few fans. If he acts like he did nothing wrong, the hate will grow.   4. Perception/Opinion of Severity of Fouls. This one's a doozy. Both fouls were cheap shots. Period. Now, everyone has their own interpretation of how cheap/intentional/dangerous each hit was and this is where alot of the different opinions come in. If a shoulder tackle in the back is the worst thing ever, then Jokic has no excuse. If a star player getting body checked while crossing half court with both arms up while passing the ball (its uncertain if he saw the hit coming) is the worst thing ever, then Morris has no excuse. I think part of the perception of the severity of Morris hit does come from Jokic being bigger. If a guard/wing took that hit, I think more people would be crying bloody murder on Morris.   Side Note: There are alot of people pulling the race card on this one. I'm not gonna sit here and act like racism doesn't exist. I have no doubt that there are people that side with Jokic because he's white. I do think the reasons I listed are plenty for people to form their opinions about these 2 players and this incident disregarding race.  I'm not saying these are good or fair reasons. I'm just trying to break it down for the people on either side that just can't understand how the opposing side can defend each player. And I do think that if you wanna argue with someone about how justice should be served, you should understand that everyone is looking at this through their own lenses."
I think Steven Adams is the only nba player I would take in a fight vs jokic.
I am not saying it wont be but I agree with what people have stated if he didn't react it would have likely been a common foul on Morris. People get away with hacking and assaulting big men all the time but because they are big they are supposed to deal with it. The moment one reacts people freak out because of how strong they are. Steven Adams is my favorite player and people will literally hit and elbow him and 99% of the time he doesn't react and certainly doesn't flop. If we just have a NBA purge one night with no rules I think a lot of players wouldn't try this shit if people could retaliate.
Jimmy ain't THAT crazy lol. I'd want no smoke from Jokic unless I was like Steven Adams. If only cuz of Jokic's crazy ass brothers who would probably go full hitman for their brother lmao.
"&gt;By chance are your three favorite players Euros? Might have some bias in the convo brother.  I mean unsurprisingly my favourite player is Giannis, and he's european although he never played in the Euro league. Then off the top of my head Idk who my next favourite players are? Maybe Dame and Steven Adams?      &gt;Retaliation fouls aren’t better for the sport  Never said they were, I was just pointing out that your scenario wasn't true. Also I think you miss the difference between ""good for the sport"" and ""not unjustified"". I only claimed that Jokic's foul was the latter (and even then I said ""not **entirely** unjustified""), not the former. Like I said, Jokic went too far and should be suspended for 1-2 games because it is bad for the game if not. But that doesn't mean it wasn't entirely unjustified."
Yes you are. Don’t worry I backed up Draymond on kicking Steven Adams. It comes with being a fan. Just letting you know this push was so blatant. Morris deserved a flagrant and a tech. Nobody is arguing that.. but Jokic deserves to be suspended
He called Steven Adams “Stevie Adams” the entire Grizzlies game.. so incredibly annoying and stupid.
Yeah I’d migrate to another country if Steven adams comes my way
What happened with Steven Adams? Looks like he got completely cooked
Steven Adams would be great right now
"They match us pretty well when we try to play fast because they have the length and athleticism to keep up with us so they always seem to make us turn the ball over.  They do a really good job of isolating Ja on Steph a lot and he’s so athletic he can drive past and Bane/Melton/Anderson have made us pay on threes when he has to kick the ball out.  Finally, we struggle a lot with physical centers since we lack traditional size playing Looney/Bjelica at the 5 so Valanciunas last year and Steven Adams this year have killed us on the boards, primarily offensive which is just a killer. So pretty much their size and athleticism seem to be a bad matchup for us, would not want to see them in the playoffs at all tbh."
You know your team is fucking gigantic when Steven Adams looks small in comparison
Im surprised no one said Steven Adams. I don’t remember him being this brick wall in his early okc days. Maybe it’s the beard
Damn even Steven Adams looks a bit small amongst the trees
Just like Steven adams right

"That's probably just you at the time everyone undoubtedly  had at least the warriors (the old superteam gsw) rockets(harden and cp3 they just came off a season winning 65 games and taking the warriors to 7) And thunder (prime russ,PG13,Jerami Grant and Steven Adams) and a lot of other people had teams like portland and the jazz ranked in front of them.  Most people had the lakers finishing 4-6 and a small percentage had them finishing 8th. The west was considered super deep back then it was back when the west was the west. I was online  a lot on forums,YouTube comments,discord at the time and that was what people were saying at the time"

"Can we stop this narrative that Russell Westbrook plays hard all the time? Just because he wears a mug face 100%, dunks to the rim and screams everytime doesn't mean he plays hard.  He only plays hard when he has the ball in his hands. He has terrible effort on defense, doesn't move offball and even if he plays hard, he goes 2nd gear, passes it to the ghost of Kyle Singler from the 2nd row.  Its Curry who plays hard all the time. Last year, the team was down terrible and showed up on all the games he had to. Yeah his frame is bad defensively but he's good at navigating screens, good at rebounding (without Steven Adams boxing out for him), better at gambling for steals."
"I've really enjoyed watching him so far. Has a lot of confidence in himself, I love it!  Side note: Steven Adams killed him with a screen Vs the Grizzlies and I couldn't help but laugh at the bone thing guy basically running into a wall! Credit to him he got up tho!"
"Westbrook doesn't box out, he expects everyone else to box out so he can get the rebound.  But Dwight, DeAndre and AD have each spent their entire careers being the primary rebounder for their team. They aren't suddenly going to just turn into Steven Adams or Brook Lopez when it comes to boxing out instead of chasing the ball, you can't break years of habit that easily."
"Rockets turned Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, Mitch McGary, and Kevin Martin into Oladipo and a few picks ;)"
you said nothing but defends who couldn't score so I assumed you were talking about the great Westbrook Steven adams duo the okc had going for 3 yeara
"Drummond isn't even 28. He's not old at all, he's younger than Steven Adams by like a month.   Drummond is overpaid but he might have 8-9 years left in the league, and perhaps he's right about to hit his ""prime.""   Allen is 22 though."
You can add Steven Adams.
Steven Adams doing well for his relatively short time in the bubble or even just downplaying how hard it might have been isn't really relevant.to what I said or the fact that other players didn't have an easy time in the bubble.
"One of the biggest failings in 2k (well, all nba games) is how poorly the lateral movement mechanics work.  There’s no reason I should be able to put Steven Adams out on the perimeter to guard James Harden and he doesn’t get blown by every single time. Tall long players in the game are just cheat codes basically."

"He’s just tone deaf. It’s like that “wholesome” post Kardashian made about how she flew her circle of friends out to a private island so they could party normally like in the pre-COVID times. There’s nothing wrong about his human struggles, everyone has them regardless of wealth, but there’s something obnoxious about publicly proclaiming how hard you’re struggling because you’ve been forced to live, for about two months, the way normal people have been living for a year. And he still gets to travel, socialize with teammates and staff, play basketball and on top of it, get paid millions to do it, while there is actual financial struggle happening all over the world. For those people, not having a social life during the pandemic is the least of their worries, as they’re literally losing their livelihood.

he didn’t have the “perfect team” because he had another ball dominant star on it.  westbrook is a poor mans lebron james who needs a good center (steven adams) who he can drop the ball off to when he drives and the rest of the team be catch and shoot shooters.  to say the rockets was the perfect team for him is pretty ignorant.

[I mean its not completely anti-Steven Adams...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFfKrDXX8k)
That's definitely an assist to a wide open Steven Adams
U really think russ passing to Steven adams at the 3 point line with 10s on the clock is to stat pad? If anything that's the opposite of stat padding bc u know he'll never shoot that in a million years
The [anti-Steven Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmWT9gb0WA).
you're paying Steven Adams $29.5 million this season to average 8 PPG and anchor a bottom-3 defense
Steven Adams would’ve caught him
"People with money and fame have power, who knew?  LeBron James revitalized an entire city's economy by just winning games in Cle. If athletes weren't paid millions of dollars and on tv everyday, and that money went to say, teachers, they would have the power and Steven Adams wouldn't be getting interviewed about his opinion on athlete worship lol"
"Let’s run it back.  &gt; lmao, russ was not the reason the rockets lost the playoffs  This implies he had nothing to do with it when he literally had the **most** to do with it.  And lmao, “simply isn’t true”. Teams were hard doubling harden and forcing westbrook to beat them 4 on 3 and with capella teams got away with it because they know westbrook isnt and even worth guarding past 10 feet at most. They thought that making it 5 out would increase our chances and russ would be able to beat 4 on 3s that way (like any other REAL star guard would have done) but unfortunately, he couldn’t.  And actually, I agree with you. The teams shit construction *is* why we lost. And that construction is really russ. I don’t know why the fuck they thought he was going to be a new player at age 32. So yeah, the rockets are pretty dumb for that in hindsight.  &gt; westbrook has been on teams more successful  Like the 2012 thunder? Yeah, they had better players and westbrook was better back then. The NBA also wasnt as advanced as it is now so players like westbrook did better. Not sure why that’s relevant. Russ and steven adams got shitted on in the first round 4 seasons in a row even with Paul George on his side.   My point is there are about a 100 players who would have produced better then westbrook did for us in those playoffs and I’d a ton of them make the series a toss up too. You’re ignoring that even with westbrook the swries was really close to being 2-0, it legit was winnable a good chunk into the 4th.   But guess what? Russell Westbrook shot 4-15, had 10 points, dished out 4 assists along with 7 turnovers. That’s 15 shots to 10 points, 4 assists to 7 TO. There are 200 players who would have impacted the game enough for us to win. Lakers fans sighed relief when he checked back in after we made a run while he was sitting. I can’t believe you don’t remember this lmao  That is absolutely g league fucking level of basketball, I don’t care if he averaged 19/5 a bunch of low end players would do that if the other team refuses to guard them and they said fuck efficiency.  His TS was in the 40s.  Half our team was not worse then westbrook, you think just because he put up 19 PPG he was somehow good? Our players who stood still and shot open threes at a respectable clip and At least tried on defense had way more of an impact.  So what the fuck is so hard for you to understand? Westbrook wasn’t good, he held the team down, he was the main reason we lost and tons and tons of players would have done way better and I’m willing to say a large number of players would have won us that series since we’d be up 2-0 if not for that G League performance by Westbrook.  I don’t need to digest shit, **you** do. You’ve yet to produce a single valid point lmao and you’re acting like you have"
Steven Adams definitely not lol
Everyday my respect for Steven Adams grows.
"i really hope that the USA can restore trust with all the various communities that currently don't believe that the government or ""elite, corporate non-profits"" can help them :( because, as you say, they do such great work. but at every point on the political spectrum, people distrust these entities for various reasons...it will take so much work, and involve changing how we talk to each other about issues (civil discourse), etc....otherwise, as steven adams points out, people will continue to place more faith in athletes because all they see are celebrities doing good work in public, covered by the media, etc. (not to imply it is bad for them to being doing acts of service ofc)"
Copying my boy Steven Adams I see.
with steven adams and zion yall would do well in rugby.
"Steven adams, ganks for durant, ganks for harden, ganks for westbrook but they all claimed jungle diff."
Yeah Steven Adams replaced Favors on the pels
"I don't care what he says, Steven Adams looks like the kind of dude who will tell you which gas station in town has the best hot dogs."
"Teams like the Nuggets and Mavs with playoff hopes but shitty defense would be willing to give some picks and young players for Smart. I could easily see a MPJ for Marcus Smart swap.  If we wanted to get crazy, I think Smart + tons of picks could land the Celtics Christian Wood (ik Rockets fans will crucify me, but you’d rather have 4 first rounders, trust me). I also think that picks + exception could get them a guy even as good as Kyle Lowry (not this exact player but a guy of that caliber and circumstance).  They could also benefit from a Steven Adams/Clint Capela, but I don’t know how realistic those options are.  Honestly, as long as the Celtics have two All-NBA level wings they will be competitive, but I doubt they could beat a defensive team like the Bucks or Sixers."
"I probably wouldn’t go to athletes on the issues like cyber security, or climate change - but would I go to a Black athlete  who’s been  on all rungs of the socioeconomic ladder on matters of the conditions of race in our country? Doesn’t seem naive at least.  I mostly agree with Steven Adams, but I would think LeBron is as a reliable source on matters of race as any other non-academic - certainly as reliable as some cable news pundits from which many people source opinions.   But as other people pointed out, the only reason we need voices like LeBron is from a lack of public leadership on and institutional backing of the needs of many people in the US. If governments acknowledged and addressed the pervasive and present history of race, we wouldn’t need SJW athletes."
"Wiggins. Take away his ridiculous contract and he's a solid player. TJ Warren, JJ Redick, Steven Adams."
He would basically just be a smaller version of Steven Adams
Steven adams is so real
"Tell me where I said he's a better player?? Im arguing the fact that you're saying he's easily way better which is just stupid. You don't even know what's going on lmao.  And oh he leads mediocre rosters to playoff births? Like when Lowry led a lineup of him/DeRozan/Luis Scola/Demarre Carroll/Bismack Biyombo to the ECF where they took the champion Cavs to 6 games while Demar shat the bed consistently? Or like last year when he took Toronto 7 games against Boston's big 3 by himself while Pascal did his best to lose us every game? Or like how he's led Toronto to be one of the most successful franchises over the last decade regardless of who he plays with? Like oh god I'm CP3 led Schroeder, Dort, SGA, and Steven Adams to a first round exit what an untouchable god lmao.   Before last year's playoffs started Kyle was literally first place over a 5 year span in clutch shots hit in the playoffs. You're spewing nonsense."
Exactly my thoughts. Like WHY wouldn’t Steven Adams classify as white? It’s not like he us Blake Griffin.
"Steven Adams is a weird choice for the ""white"" category"
Half Tongan Steven Adams you mean?
Mark Eaton for former player and Steven Adams for current?
Steven Adams talks like your bud that hypes you up every time
"One of the reason why I'm a bit reluctant to say Presti is really one of the top2/3 GM in the league, perfect job before they were contender and almost even better since KD left, but during the years they were contender, very few of his moves workes besides the Steven Adams draft. And I'm not even talking about the Harden trade since I will never buy that HE was the decision maker on that one (well can blame him for the package he got tho)"
"*You load into the map, top lane is two brazilians swearing in portuguese, mid lane is a feeding russian cyka blat and you are bot lane with Steven adams on his planes shitty safelite wifi*"
Okc fans are the best.. our sub proves it.  Followed by whatever teams Russ and Steven Adams are on
Pretty cool five. mine would be   Pg: Westbrook   Sg: AI  SF: Melo  PF: KG  C: Steven Adams
"Unfortunately, shit hurts. Lots of young guys that are too hesitant, can't create on their own.  Beal is great but we need more defense and he needs to involve his team more to get them going. They're better with westbrook on the floor from the eye test but he's not enough to carry anyone. Definitely regressing in places. Bertans is literally only good for 3s but didn't make enough.  And holy shit they keep doing this run along side the ball carrier thing with their hands up to not foul but still somehow run into the shooter with their bodies and still commit a foul.  Robin lopez at least looks a bit better on offense but that s a minimal upgrade from where he was. Alex fuckin len, idk even know. Like 1/20 of what Steven adams is.  And yes all of this is scott brooks fault"
It’s such a great episode honestly Steven Adams is such a delight
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
Steven Adams is such a chill dude
"Oladipo literally immediately turned into an All Star the moment he got away from Westbrook's ball dominant offense and Sabonis got a lot better too.   Steph would take either of those two over Juan Tascno Anderson, Kelly Oubre, Brad Wanamaker, Damion Lee , Mychal Mulder.   Oh yah and we haven't had a single center for 6 games, so yah I'd take Steven Adams right now, who was a far better offensive player on that team then any of our currently centers even when healthy. (yah yah yah I know Wiseman has more potential than Adams but he is so young and inexperience understandably that he hasn't been a good offensive player this year)."
"My favorite player is definitely Steven Adams. I'm going to go a different direction and go by personality. Adams is one of the funniest guys in the league. So, im going with the funniest guys (also a big man lineup to counter the small ball lineups)  Adams (favorite)  Jokic  Javale  Rondo   Jingles"
"I'm commenting on the relative nature of the word ""easy"". He might feel bad about it, and I would say he definitely shouldn't be ashamed of his position and should get help if he's struggling with it. But I'm also pointing out how, relatively, it is extremely easy to be in his position.  Much like Steven Adams comparing the NBA bubble and Syria, I'm saying that yes, there are certainly emotional and mental struggles that come along with LiAngelo's current situation, but let us not pretend he's in dire straights.  Also, I think it's fair to say that a portion of his situation is pretty self-inflicted. Rich kid overseas steals shit and gets caught. Excuse me while I do not share sympathy towards the outcome of that situation."
"Steven Adams has been so overrated for such a long time. He sets hard screens, that's about all he can do."
"You act like he’s suddenly going to be hobbled at 34. If you watch him play, he’s still easily top 5 most athletic in the league. Sure his athleticism will decline but not THAT dramatically. It’s pretty sad you believe he will be a bench player in 2 years, the dude was an mvp a few years ago and you act like his athleticism is his one redeeming quality. And what’s this nonsense about rebounds not being that important? A defensive rebound is a defensive rebound, not sure how position changes anything. It’s not like he still has steven Adams setting screens and getting an open lane, he is doing it on his own with basketball IQ, intuition, and athleticism. And WB is a decent midrange player, his issue is shot selections particularly late in the game. Don’t act like he averaged 30+ by bullying his way to the rim every time. The dude has glaring flaws but to reduce him into just someone that is nothing but athletic is ridiculous."
"I still don't get what the pels were thinking giving assets for Steven Adams when guys like Jakob Poeltl, Derrick Favors, Christian Wood, and other centers were signing for cheaper than the extension they gave Adams in free agency"
"Steven Adams: I didn’t think I would get drafted. I just wanted free food and nice hotels  JJ Redick: You went 12th overall, why would you think that?  Steven Adams: It was the Anthony Bennett draft."
Knowing Steven Adams is a fan of One Piece it was funny hearing him talk about players getting to “gear three” lol
"As a person from a small country like NZ (spoiler: it's NZ) I can tell you it isn't a big deal.  Do people think she's awesome? Hell yes. Kiwis are extremely proud of Valerie. But nobody cares at all about shot put unless the olympics are on, and people certainly aren't making a big deal out of her, treating her like a celebrity or ignoring Steven Adams. The tv news in NZ acts like Steven Adams is LeBron, they'll have stories saying ""Adams led the Thunder to a playoff win tonight, with 6 points and 8 boards. Meanwhile, Russell somebody had 35 points, 12 rebounds and 15 assists in a decent supporting effort"""
Actually steven Adams did not get signed by the Mavericks.  True story.
One game away from getting traded for steven Adams !!
do you’re gonna put steven adams out there guarding zingus?
I still don’t understand the Steven Adams extension when he doesn’t have an impact or even touch the court late in games
Steven Adams has been sitting a long time. Probably smart.
Yeah true but it’s like... everyone knew Steven Adams and Westbrook were boys.
"In the case of Steven Adams’ dad, the love of his life was five different women, but same idea."
"Considering Steven Adams had 18 siblings and was the youngest, she probably wasn't the only one kicking his ass"
Javale top 20 in the NBA when? Gobert must be a the best scorer in the NBA. Why doesn't Steven Adams just dunk it vs everyone every possession? Boban should just tippy toe and get himself 50 every game.
"I love me some Steven Adams, such a beast on the court. Strongest guy in the nba. I remember he got elbowed in the head once from I think Vince Carter and didn’t even flinch. Also got Zbo to kinda punch him on the playoffs which led Zbo being suspended for a game or two.   Always great for a quote, and for some more fun you should check out his only made 3 point basket in a nba game....also the full court dime to Schroeder last year."
Probably my favorite episode so far. Steven Adams truly gives no fucks at all.
"Is Steven Adams even good anymore? He seems to do nothing but top of the key handoffs, then dives to the hoop to clog the lane. On defense, he’s a wreck.   I just don’t know how he fits with this team."
Steven Adams said the same thing a few months back
"Steven Adams is a delight to listen to. It's not just about the mate this mate that. He has a humility about him that's genuine and really endearing. This was one of my favorite interviews on JJ""s podcast."
"I mean the guy has a -8 downvote history with me so I know he spouts some genuine bullshit. But it feels stupid to keep up this convo trying to find different ways to attack this guy about his work.    He works hard, he makes decent money and he likes what he's doing. He believes he can retire early with this job and has been at the company for a while.    What is there to make fun of? Disagree with his point about Steven Adams. The people looking more like children here are the ones ganging up on him trying to make fun of him at every possible angle."
"""Mate my penis is huge, why should I sweat the small stuff"" -Steven ""Big Penis"" Adams"
Lmaooo he said that ?! God I thought it wasn’t possible to love Steven adams more but that’s cap
Imagine him having to box out Steven Adams every possession.
Reminder that Steven Adams looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/6axUuNr) on draft day.
Steven Adams is pure
reminds me of that reporter that asked steven adams how hard it was for them in the bubble and he was like slow down there this isn't syria mate.  it's a bloody resort
Steven Adams is a team first guy.  Why would he oversell himself?   No need to justify who he is to some coach that had little interest in drafting him.
"Dipo wasn’t the player he became after playing with the Thunder yet. He even said himself that playing with Westbrook slowed him how to lead a team, hence the all-NBA season in 2017-18. Steven Adams is one of the most overrated player in the league, and he couldn’t do a damn thing without Russ setting him up other than offensive rebounding. And Andre Roberson? Really? You just listed three players that couldn’t create offence to save their lives at the time. Just look at what happened to their leads whenever Russ went to the bench, especially in the playoffs. Grant and Sabonis were both rookies, so I don’t even see the point of mentioning them considering they barely played and weren’t good yet. Mentioning them would be like me saying a few years from now that the 2021 Warriors were actually really good other than Steph since they have James Wiseman. Peak Kanter means practically nothing, dude couldn’t guard a cardboard cutout and once again, couldn’t create his own offence without Westbrook.   I never once said that Russ was better than Curry from an efficiency standpoint. But Russ outplayed him in pretty much every other area of the game.   And like I said, Sabonis and Oladipo would both later go on to credit Russ for helping them improve. Besides, if the offence was “all about Russ” and if he didn’t raise his teammates when he was on the Thunder, tell me why almost every player he ever played with had their best (or at least one of their best) seasons playing beside him? Paul George looked like an MVP candidate for the first (and only) time in his career. Ibaka is a better offensive player now, but he probably peaked with the Thunder since his defence was so game changing. KD was the runner up MVP like three times playing beside Russ, and then won his only award in 2013-14. You said yourself that Kanter and Adams peaked beside him. He also made half that awful roster look like semi-capable NBA players, and now those players are completely out of the league. I don’t think most of this Warriors roster will be out of the league in just a few years. Shit, even James Harden had a monster season last year and Bradley Beal is also playing his best ball right now."
"But Steven Adams man what a class act, all he is interested in is balling not any of this drama stuff"
[Steven Adams for Isaiah Thomas](https://streamable.com/674dq)
"Garbage team with garbage players such as, *checks notes*, Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams, Andre Robertson (one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA before he died or whatever happened to him), Jerami Grant, Sabonis, Enes Kanter. Adams and Kanter were at their peaks. The rest were obviously not as good as they are now, Sabonis in particular was basically a scrub, but they also improved significantly once leaving WB's shadow, Oladipo immediately so. I'd argue playing with him made them look worse than they actually were because the offense was all about WB, all the time. What he accomplished that season was impressive, but basketball is about winning championships, not dragging people to the first round before promptly getting your ass kicked by a Houston team with the guy you beat for MVP surrounded by a slightly better roster. As for Steve Kerr, yes, I'll give you that one but WB has proven that he's not quite the most coachable fellow in the league. I don't want to take away from that point tho because it was super impressive what WB did. It just wasn't championship-level good. Personally, I didn't think he deserved the MVP that year, Harden did. And since then, triple doubles have become mundane, which kind of takes the shine off what he accomplished because to me, it's clear it's as much a factor of the insane pace of the league nowadays as it is a testament to his greatness (which it still is, don't get me wrong).  As for the efficiency argument, yeah, you're right. It's not the end all be all. However, it is when you have two guys averaging about the same amount of points, lol. Please don't tell me you really believe that Westbrook was ever close to Steph on that front, it will break my heart how far education standards have fallen if I need to explain why a guy who regularly flirts with 50/40/90 is better that a guy who never got past 35% from deep. I think you're too smart for that, nobody who could read my smug, annoying arguments and keep going could be otherwise.  We are literally watching Steph play on an equivalent or worse team than that OKC squad and average numbers equal to the greatest offensive season of all time. He is clearly miles ahead of Westbrook. The only reason it might have been kind of close if you make really charitable arguments and ignore the eye test was when Steph first had trouble playing next to KD. But he finished that season tearing through the Western Conference and the playoffs. Yeah he had a better team. Now he has a much worse team than before and he's playing just as good. Yes, he is in fact dragging a sorry-ass team the same way WB did. Have you seen Dray's numbers this year? Only difference is Steph's doing it on a minutes restriction. Anyways, sorry for yelling."

Throw in Steven Adams and you got a deal.
Steven Adams? Really?
Most surprising one for me is Steven Adams getting 10+ assists
"Yup, nothing like letting Deandre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Steven Adams, all offensive juggernauts, have good games against you"
"I think the idea is that players like Drummond get their rebounds through height and athleticism, which is fantastic for individual stats. However, on possessions where he doesn’t get a rebound, he plays lazy D and doesn’t box out. Meanwhile, players like Brook Lopez and Steven Adams box out every possession, and won’t even jump for a rebound if their teammates have got it. When Lopez was on the Lakers, his rebounding numbers were abnormally low, but when he was on the floor, you saw a huge spike in his teammate’s rebound numbers. Point is: there’s more ways to impact the glass than catching the rebound."
"I know Rudy Gobert and Steven Adams watch One Piece, Rudy has had some kicks with Luffy on them in the past."
Steven Adams got a $17m contract and I don’t think Drummond is that much worse than Adams. I think he’ll get 10-15m
"Without Steven Adams, Westbrooks triple double seasons don't happen. I hope Russ got him a nice watch or something."
He catches the rebounds while Steven Adams boxes out  every single body in the arena
"man, can we just just have Kyrie run into one really hard Steven Adams screen? or would that knock more nonsense loose?"
"Having big numbers != extremely good. What he did was super impressive, but his supporting staff wasn't as terrible as WB stans would have you believe. Andre Robertson was a lockdown defender, Steven Adams was a high-quality big man, Kanter was, well, Kanter (that's a whole 'nother discussion), Taj Gibson was still decent, Oladipo, Sabonis, and Grant were all not as good as they came to be, obviously, but still gave them something (and all three really got better once separated from Westbrook IMHO but I won't make that part of my argument). How could we forget Thunder GOAT Nick Collison? But really, that's a pretty mediocre roster, sure, but not exactly the 2011-12 Bobcats like some would have you believe. Russ had an amazing season but he didn't deserve the MVP. That should have gone to Harden or even Kawhi, in my opinion. Westbrook was just not on their level. He was close, but it surprised nobody when he flamed out in the playoffs against Harden and the Rockets, who by the way, did not have a wildly better supporting cast (although now that I look at it, D'antoni is a far, far better coach than Donovan so I could surrender that point).  The fact is that everyone knew that Westbrook wasn't in the same tier as the best players, but they gave him the MVP because of the triple doubles and all the amazing things he did that year. That's fine, but I'm not going to pretend that he was actually ever a truly elite, all-time talent at any point in his career."
Does anyone know what happened in that play where the refs called a foul on Steven Adams but did not know who was supposed to shoot the freethrows.
Zion is SUPER THICC.... he makes Steven Adams look malnutritioned.
Steven adams the first center to average 5 orebs per game and not average 10 total reb per game over a season
"Josh ""Steven Adams"" Hart"
Proud Steven Adams on the sidelines lol
"How about him driving into the lane, had a wide open dunk or layup and deciding to throw it to Steven Adams at the perimeter? Btw he got his double double and needed 10 assists to get his triple dub"
"Thanks for the explanation, do you know what the deal is with grizzlies games though? Because if you look at Steven adams gamelog he does actually have games where he has heaps of rebounds (15+) but then he had 2 in 30 mins v the grizzlies"
Can someone explain to me how this type of thing happens? I noticed that Steven adams only had 2 rebounds in 30 minutes against the grizzlies last game. What exactly is happening for centres to not be getting rebounds v grizzlies?
Did you know we got him and a 1st in the Steven Adams Trade?
"&gt; All post game show interviews with other players are professional, except Ingles, who only jokes.  steven adams  it's an aussie/kiwi thing. sarcasm is ingrained. when we leave here and go to europe/america we regularly get in trouble for being too sarcastic and people getting offended lmao"
"I mean, there's a lot going on in your reply here man...   &gt;There are several groups of people, including pacific islanders and Maori who would not be classified as white, but also white New Zealanders (the ones who people mistake for Australians).  Correct.  &gt;I was asking more, is the primary group in power and population in NZ white?  The majority of the population on NZ is white, but by majority we're talking like \~70% here man, so there's millions of ""non-white"" people. I'm going to leave the ""in power"" question alone here because I'm not sure of your framing.   &gt;Just like you can say America is white.  I personally would never say that.   &gt;Reason it is relevant is because, if someone like Adams is half white and from NZ, which may have a lot of white people, and also looks white, then he will be classified as white.  In NZ this would absolutely not be the case.   &gt;(Again, like Obama is black even though he's half white as well)  This contradicts your framing about Adams. If Obama is half white in a white country then why wouldn't you ""call him white""?   Steven Adams is a kiwi and Tongan. I'm not sure anyone from NZ would say he ""looks white"" lol."
"Steven Adams also isn't white, but your point still stands."
"We do that crafty/sneaky/lunch pail thing here on r/NBA as a joke about every white player. But there are obviously white guys who DO look like they'd fuck you up on a screen. There's nothing sneaky about Steven Adams. He's a big scary mf, what you see is what you get, unlike Stockton."
Steven Adams woulda got that TD
Steven Adams is a leading MVP candidate now?
"He did it on Yuta, if he did it on Steven Adams, I'll slow clap."
"Very entertaining and interesting. He edits his material well, has solid research and even throws in some humour. You get to see things in his content you don't very often. Some of the better content going around. Like a video version of Bill Simmons' Big Book of Basketball. There are lots of great biographies of players that go beyond numbers on the court stuff too. Like obv Bill Russell, Jerry West and Larry Bird bios were all great but Steven Adams and Caron Butler were surprise gems"
"KD was a stack of twigs when he entered the league, and so was Steven Adams (relatively speaking).   But put a guy on the OKC diet for a few years and they come out yoked"
"In no particular order Zion, Kawhi, Lebron, Taj Gibson, Steven Adams."
1) Steven Adams  2) Zion   3) Jokic  4) LeBron  5) Herro
Zion LeBron Steven Adams Giannis Jimmy Butler
Here before this post gets bombarded with “Steven Adams”
"Boban, steven adams"
"If wiseman can't start over my guy Juan T, fuk yeah I'd rather have Steven Adams"
I’m gonna assume Steven Adams. Or maybe NAW?
"Trade Steven Adams, NAW, Bledsoe and a pick for LMA and Patty Mills."
Load up the team with shooters and don't spend an off-season trading for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?
I would not have given up assets for Steven Adams or pay him lots of money lol
The Pels also received Bledsoe and Steven Adams.
"Bledsoe was an All Defense last year Lonzo is supposed to be a high end defensive versatile player Steven Adams is supposed to be the veteran hustle  interior presence tht always communicate and anchor the paint Ingram brings the bone, Zion brings the meat... Stan Vangundy is severely underperforming on both ends, offensively you can say it’s roster construction and weird fit but defensively he has no excuse to be this bad when his starting 5 has great on ball perimeter defense and a good paint presence... the other 2 stars just have to fill the gap if the coach can put together a scheme properly"
and that’s with steven adams and back to the basket bigs off the bench clogging the paint all 48 minutes
"i guarantee that among basketball fans in cameroon, embiid jerseys are doing well. same with jokic in serbia. how do i know this? i live in nz and we've got all the regular jerseys - lebron, wade, kyrie, kobe, antetokounmpo - and then you've got the parade of people rocking okc steven adams jerseys lmao"
That’s not Steven adams real full name. I can’t find that anywhere on the internet so it must be fake (unless OP knows Steven Adams personally or has asked him themselves)
Steven Adams truly is a king
"If you were to drop prime Shaq into today's league it would completely shift the meta.  All the top contending teams would have to acquire bigs that can play low post D, and now that everyone shoots the three Shaq could just collapse the d and kick out to all the three point specialists we have now in the league.  You would HAVE to find players that could somewhat slow him down 1on1 on defense. Right now how many bigs could slow down Shaq?  Maybe Embiid and Steven Adams?"
"He’s far worse then Steven adams as we see him right now. I would agree he had the potential to be similar to Adams if he changed his game up a bit and gained some bbiq. I can see him being a good piece for a team but he needs to change how he approaches the game and some of that can be done w good coaches and teammates, so I do view it as a possibility.  If u just take how he has played for the last 2 years he’s definitely not as good as at least adams"
"i would honestly trade Wiseman for Steven Adams and try to maximize the remainder of the stephs career. Steph is the best and the dubs love an awesome center who can set screens and run to the rim. plus, adams is intimidating as fuck"
"As a Thunder fan, I remember this being talked about constantly in 2017 during Russ’s MVP year. You can probably go look at any OKC postgame thread and see people accusing Russ of stat padding and Steven Adams giving up rebounds, followed by Thunder fans defending him by saying that Russ grabbing the board to jump start the possession was a cornerstone of our offense. I’m no bball expert myself, but it seemed to be a popular talking point."
"The thing that bums me out the most was that Spurs vs Warriors was hyped up for three straight years and we could never quite hold up our end of the bargain:  2015: After our dominant championship, the Spurs slept-walked through most of the season, came on strong late as Kawhi got healthy and emerged as a stud, but we dropped from the 2 seed to the 6 seed on the last day because we lost like 6 winnable games throughout the season (DAE Portland 4th seed??). Lose in a first round series for the ages against the Lob City Clippers  2016: Win 67 games and Kawhi emerges as a bona fide MVP candidate, have a better net rating than the 73-win Warriors and have everybody saying “the WCF is the real finals this year.” Shit the bed against OKC because Steven Adams and Enes Kanter are mean while Tim Duncan lost his good knee, David West was old, and Boris Diaw was fat. Also that KD fella was pretty good.  2017: Kawhi’s still doing MVP-level shit and the Spurs win 60+ in B2B seasons for the first time in franchise history. Finally make it to the WCF to play the Warriors. Shit’s going groovy in the first half, and then Kawhi gets Zaza’d. Spurs play it cautious with his health and hold him out for the series, get swept. Then we basically never see him again lol"
"[Imo Steven Adams is right, but people do it anyways](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ljyklu/steven_adams_on_athlete_worship_in_america_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  &gt; “The athletes here are held really high, and a lot of players should be, once they reach a certain level. But it kind of goes across everything. Some people look at them for political guidance. Moral guidance. It’s just like, maybe just maybe just for the sport, look for this dude. But for some other things go to some of these other guys”"
"He destroys Steven Adams every time they play, so that was not surprising"
He should call the agent of Steven Adams
"I miss Jrue so much. Can’t believe David Griffin turned him into Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams and a few middle schoolers smh"
"As usual this sub overreacts in a heartbeat. Just read a bit above, people are calling Steven Adams washed at 27. But it's true that Porzingis has lost a lot on the defensive end, mainly because of injuries. It does not help that Carlisle doesn't utilize him properly. He's pretty much a 7ft3 SG nowadays who is a net negative on defense. His numbers are good tho."
"Yes, I have watched him play a ton.   I have watched him fling up bad shot after bad shot.  I have seen him make turnover after turnover, and he does both of things even more in key spots.  I have also seen snatch rebounds out of his own big men's hand to pad his stats.  I have seen him monopolize the ball.    I have almost never seen him move without the ball or set a screen.  Steph Curry sets more picks in one game than Wesbrook does in an entire season.  Can you imagine how effective a guy with Westrook's build could be setting picks?  Westbrook does do some nice things on pick and rolls, setting up big men, like Steven Adams.   He can also be effective when he gets in the lane and scores around the basket or dishes to open shooters.  But, he does far too little of what he is very good at and way too much of what he is terrible at.     He should have been a guy who took maybe 12 shots a game, almost all near the rim.   He could have had a statline of something like 17 ppg, 52% FG, 13 APG, 7 rpg, while playing great D (instead of the subpar D he plays) and have been the evolution of John Stockton.    Instead, he has decided to chuck up way too many bad shots and neglect defense to pad his rebounding stats, play hero ball and chase stats.  I loved Westbrook when he was young and thought he would become an all time great PG and win multiple rings with KD.  But, he squandered so much of his talent, by playing to his weaknesses instead of his strengths."
Why are the pelicans trying to put Jaxson Hayes and Steven Adams next to Zion? I like David Griffin but I don’t think that makes sense. I think they’d have been better off keeping that fourth pick and grabbing hunter while still getting Lewis this year.
"Russ really is the best kind of leader imo bc unlike some guys, he will take all the blame even if it isn't his fault or entirely his fault. He will always say ""I gotta he better"" and he always holds his teammates to that standard. He won't slack off bc he's the star. He will work just as hard as the last dude on the roster fighting for a spot.   A good example is the 2017 playoffs. Anyone watching that series could see Russ was the only reason the games were close and as soon as he sat the rockets would outscore us like crazy. His on/off splits were insane. But when Tramel tried to bait steven adams into saying ""we suck"" by asking why the team was bad when Russ sat, Russ told steven not to answer and that, they win a lose as a team."
Steven Adams might be the oldest 27 year old of all time.
"It's a shit take that people in this sub shit on Russ? What...? They do it all the time. Talk shit about having Steven Adams box out or him chasing rebounds when that's literally the point of any Russ lead offense. He's a high motor player than can run the floor. Boxing out for Russ and allowing him to rebound is the best way to get your offense started. But most people in this sub have actually never PLAYED basketball in their lives and just see it as Russ stat padding.  Say what you want, but the Russ hate is real in here and on the internet/media in general. r/nba is like reading hundreds of thousands of Skip Bayless takes and like, maybe a few hundred actual basketball discussions. That fucking All-Star thread when Zion's ""voice cracked"". Like...people really couldn't tell he was just fucking around. Because that's what ball players do with eachother...."
"I love Steven Adams. He's better than Serge Ibaka, and is invaluable on the Pelicans.  It is almost like /r/nba has no concept of defense and how it is played. Adams is probably the only guy on that team committed to Defense, and he doesn't use a lot of shots. And is still an automatic bucket if you play off of him in the pick and roll.  It's people like this who grow up to become Eastern Conference GM's."
Reggie Jackson but that is enough of a story that it has its own section in Steven Adams book.
"I mean steven adams is one of the best big men in the league. This deal looks like a steal. He was always better than russell westbrook and paul george at OKC at playing winning basketball, he just doesn't put up a lot of counting stats.  If you watched games you'd think this was a bargain."
"Steven Adams, Rudy Gobert, Kemba Walker, and Russell Westbrook."
Steven Adams at 17mil/year for the next two years really isn’t a big deal
Are you wrong about Steven Adams? I'm not sure.  Are you wrong to order it points/assists/rebounds? 100% yes. It's always points/rebounds/assists.
remember when people were so obsessed with the idea of westbrook stealing rebounds from steven adams? even though adams has averaged about the same number of boards for the past two seasons
"&gt;And the Wizards are 26th in defensive rating.  My guy, the Wizards have started Alex Len at center for a while now. Do you think any team would have a top 25 DRTG starting Alex Len?  &gt;I don’t get why we need to be so precious about Westbrook’s transition opportunities when he isn’t even efficient in transition.  His FG% in transition is 58%. That's 4% less than Giannis. That's higher than Fox, Harden, KD, Booker, Curry, Kyrie, Mitchell... the list goes on. The only players with high who are more efficient are LeBron/Giannis.  &gt;He has played with good rebounders post Durant who had their lowest amount of defensive rebounds per possession of their careers playing with Westbrook chasing triple doubles.  Literally only Steven Adams and Harden. Capela for a short time."
"I feel bad for steven too because him playing through ankle injuries and shit like he did in this game are why he's like washed at 27. I still give LMA credit because it was on ridiculous shot making regardless of who was on him, but Adams was playing through a lot of injuries at the time of this game so I like for people to know that since he's such a nice guy lol"
"I'm just blown away by this. I'll always remember and love him for dropping the fifty burger on steven adams head and dragging is to the playoffs when the nephew wouldn't come back. he was such a fun if occasionally frustrating player and I'll always love him for choosing us. man, I just can't believe this is happening as soon as he went to chase the ring; I really wanted him to get it.  here's the 56 points with no threes game from a couple years ago. I miss him already :(  https://youtu.be/voDH2q0t0TM"
"I saw LMA drop 56 pts on Steven Adams 2 years ago in person, it was an insane game and performance... hell of a career."

"Westbrook, Wall, Kemba, Kevin Love, Steven Adams, Wiggins, Porzingis, DLo, OPJ, Horford"
"No because you can actually see a viable way out for them due to their tanking, He has like 20 something high draft picks to change his franchise and has drafted 3 hall of fame mvps, serge ibaka, steven adams, and even immauel quickley who appears to be a very talented rookie. Now if they were to botch all of those picks over the next 4 years then maybe."
"He’ll get more wide open passes coming from BI and Zion.  Plus that will give Zion more space rather than Steven Adams man standing directly under the basket.   Also it will help out everyone else a lot more. We’ll have a lot more driving lanes open if the Center has to rotate to help, rather than already being directly under the basket."
He’s also out-rebounding him 12-6. Very weird to see Embiid getting clamped by DeAndre Jordan and Steven Adams
I'm wondering if that is a trend when he faces stronger defenders like what happened with Steven Adams. I'm gonna keep an eye on that moving forward
"His screen setting ability has nothing to do with his bulk. Hes not a good screener cause he can wall off a dude like Capela or Steven Adams, he's a good screener cause the guy guarding him his so focused on staying attached to him that they completely forget to switch. Look at the play from the end of the last Dubs-Bucks game where Wiggins gets a free drive and dunk in the final minute. Jrue Holiday was on Steph allllllll game long and on this play Steph just momentarily blocks Middleton from the play and Jrue doesn't even think to switch. That's where his ability comes from and tbh nobody else in the league exploits that specific situation as well as he does."
Justice for who? Steven Adams should have gotten that justice not Lebron
Yeah hoping this doesn’t become a situation like when anytime Steven Adams said mate it hit the front page.
Jrue - 17.1  Lu Dort - 12.6  Mikal Bridges - 13.2  Lemickey - 25.4  Steven Adams - 7.7
"It's not like they're getting blown out. They could easily be in the playoffs if they didn't choke in the clutch, which partly is due to being so young.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd run it back, but:  \- Trade Bledsoe + picks for a 3 + D. Duncan Robinson would be nutty but his D is meh. I'd like a tough guy who can be vocal, a better James Johnson (who's been really great, but his place is on the bench).  \- Trade Steven Adams + picks for someone like Myles Turner. I love Adams but the extension he signed is atrocious and Hernangomez can be a lite version of him, which is more than enough in today's NBA. The fact that you have to take off your 20m$/yr guy because he's getting outplayed is unacceptable.  \- I'd resign Lonzo to be honest. He's got the right attitude, he's improving every year, his chemistry with Zion is nuts and he's a layup package away from being an elite role player. His defence is there, his 3 is there, his playmaking is there, his midrange is there, even his fucking Free Throws are there. He needs to get to the rim. That should be his assignment for this offseason. Even though his 3pt% might not show that, he's taken his 3p to a new level from last year. Last year he would be really good from 3 as a catch and shoot. Feet set, wide open, etc This year he's hitting stepbacks, shooting off the dribble, getting plays run for him  \- The bench is getting stacked in hustle guys (Hayes, Hart, James Johnson) but the Pels need someone who can get buckets. Someone like Lou Williams. Kira and NAW are nice, we'll see their development.  \-Maybe trade BI + picks for a superstar that complements Zion (if the opportunity presents itself)."
"I like Josh Hart a lot too, but the main issue is he’s not a great 3 point shooter. That’s why I prefer him as the 6th man and he can of course play a lot of minutes and he’ll play the important defensive minutes. If Hart could ever improve his 3PT%, then he’s a great option at SG. But if Lonzo leaves, they can try to make a bid at Duncan Robinson with the cap space, but the problem is Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams’s contracts for the next few years will limit mobility to sign FAs. I think Zion thrives the best when playing with pace and space (so a lot of 3+D guys around him). I think C is a bigger issue than SG though right now. Adams absolutely hurts Zion a lot."
"one of the best passers ever, dude is like a damn quarterback who is always tracking the tight end. He made some of the sweetest passes ive ever seen to Steven Adams."
Myles Turner would've been nice but I bet he's off the table now.  Too bad had your chance I guess but Steven Adams was too enticing.
Trade Lonzo and Steven Adams for Myles turner.
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he’s too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he’s probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it’ll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He’s already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
Lot of organizational memory about Steven Adams
"like the time steven adams caught mason plumlee instead of letting him die, but it cost him 2 points  that should be standard."
"If you, at any point thought JJ Reddick or Steven fucking Adams were better then DeMar... I have no idea what to tell you.."
"He's behind Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball"
What does Steven Adams do that you can't get from a C that makes less than 10 million a year
The hell was steven adams doing with those tips? He was literally giving the ball to the spurs.
The Steven-Adams’-Nuts-Kicking era. Really takes me back.
2016 wasnt kd era. thats when he was kicking steven adams nuts
He wanted the inner Steven Adams to be represented. Aquaman wouldn't do him justice.
"Depends on the coaching I think. Wouldn't they basically be a slightly better version of the Pelicans except with Randle instead of Zion? And right now the Pelicans are talented but super inconsistent for some reason.  I guess they'd also have Clarkson, Kuzma and D'Lo instead of Steven Adams, but D'Lo's injured right now so isn't really contributing."
"I've only watched a handful of games but my impression is that Zion is a star, BI and Steven Adams are quality players, Lonzo has promise, and the rest of the team needs a ton of work.  Eric Bledsoe might be a good player but the games I've watched have made him look like a bumbling idiot."
Steven Adams and Bobby Portis
almost every center needs someone like Russ. Just look how Steven Adams has been playing without him or how the three centers from Washington faired before with different pointguards
"How does that even make sense? How could you possibly be a good playmaker without being a good passer. Yes he has stints where he gets to his head but he analyzes plays extremely well and exposes mismatches created elsewhere on the court by getting the ball to them. If he had Steven Adams again, or any competent center that played more than 30 minutes (Gafford barely ever plays), he’d make them look like all-stars."
empty boards. steven adams boxing out for him  smh
I have a question - the Westbrook haters used to say that the only reason he got those triple doubles in OKC was because Steven Adams let him.  Does the same argument apply to Washington and with Robin Lopez?  Or will they just admit the man is incredible?
he only got them because steven adams let him
"Its like Steven Adams and ""mate"" about 3-4 seasons ago. Every single time the guy said ""mate"" it got posted even if it had nothing to do with basketball."
"&gt;I don't buy this at all, if it was that valuable, other teams would be doing it.  1) The Wizards lead the league in transition points. When he was with OKC, they regularly were at the top of the league for transition points as well.  2) The Wizards are also one of the worst teams in the league for 3PT shooting. So creating opportunities in transition gives them a chance to make up that gap by going after high percentage shots like dunks and alley oops.  3) ""Other teams would be doing it."" That implies that other teams *can* but choose not to. Westbrook is very much an anomaly. It's not like you can just say ""hey Trae go get boards"" and have it happen.  &gt;Any capable NBA player should be able to hit a guard with an outlet pass that would travel faster than the guard would be able to if they were under the basket  It's not the passing, it's the bbiq. Steven Adams can throw the ball downcourt, but he doesn't know when to push it up himself, when to throw someone open, or when to let the play develop the way a PG does. And if he knows that the PG is grabbing the rebound, he can immediately head down court - which also drags the opposing center with him. If you watch most traditional bigs, they'll grab a rebound then take their time coming down the court. If they have to rush back, that's more energy exertion to tire them down."
Can't believe OKC benched him for Steven Adams
"Watch Westbrook getting pestered by PBev, and then getting PTSD from a Steven Adams high screen."
Zbo had really quick spin moves and got up for his hooks really fast. He didn’t LOOK athletic but he’s nowhere near the bottom.   Steven adams. Marc gasol. Patrick Ewing  John stockton.   I want to say the mailman too as he wasn’t super athletic but he’s not the bottom so I’ll just leave it here for thought.   Andrea bargnani
Best: Jaxson Hayes  Worst: Steven Adams
Wdym by Steven Adams gave him those rebounds?
Milkman era vs Steven Adams gave him those rebounds. Who would win?
"Me too. That’s why I think they should move him while his value is high. He’s definitely in the way in NO.   NO needs a pass first point guard who can defend and space the floor (Lonzo). They need to run their offense around Zion who deserves even more usage than he’s getting. Surround him with Danny Green and Mikal Bridges like defenders with a low usage rim protector who can preferably space the floor like Myles Turner so the paint is wide open for Zion.   Alexander-Walker can come off the bench and score and still play thirty minutes. Kid has the talent. And then a decent scoring big who plays better defense than Willy.   That’s a lot of work, but it would fix them. Trading Ingram is the easiest way for them to get some of those pieces.   Like imagine if they had Boucher instead of Steven Adams clogging the paint. Would you trade OG and Boucher for Ingram?"
"I’m a Pelicans fan, I just like the Suns.  Defense is a obviously a big problem for us, but we also have no consistent offense outside of Zion and BI.   BI needs to become a better defender and he still can because he’s only 23, but he’s far from the problem on this team.  We have horrible spacing and our roster underperformed this year. Our young players were bad until all star break. Bledsoe has been completely garbage. Steven Adams has been bad in pnr coverage and rim protection. Our guards aren’t good at going through screens, and we’ve had no wing defenders for most of the year.  I’m just saying that BI is far from the problem for us."
let’s ask steven adams what he thinks
People don't understand but Noel was doing this in 2018/2019 for the Thunder.  He outplayed Steven Adams against Portland.
"15-16 OKC, just trot out the Girth Lineup (brodie, kd, ibaka, kanter, steven adams) and send all 5 to crash the boards and hunt offensive rebounds. Transition defense will be unneeded when 100% of the game’s total rebounds belong to you."
hes stealing Steven Adams rebounds
"Pelies have to be disappointed with this season.   I hate Ingram and Zion together. I hate Steven Adams and Zion together. Lonzo isn’t worth what he is going to be asking for. Their defense is an abomination. This team needs to drastically rebuild their roster. Zion is the cornerstone, get Adams out of his way and get Ingram somewhere else. Lonzo is not the answer at PG. I’d start there."
"Steven Adams [missing](https://youtu.be/c5V-9OZvl1c) a free throw, getting his rebound and passing out to Russell Westbrook for a long three   It was just beautifully designed and perfectly executed"
"Would he be that much different than Gobert? An underrated thing here is that Ben was super undersized in his era. His strength alone would make him one of the most annoying centers to play against today. Imagine if Steven Adams was actually the best defender in the league more or less.  He would be setting screens nonstop and locking down the paint and pick and rolls. He would have to learn how to be a better rim runner probably, but I don't think elite rebounding and defense is ever going to go out of style. Look at what capela is doing this year.  The shooting was really rough though, you would have to account for it like the Jazz have all these years (and having a one-man defense allows you to punt a lot of positions that other teams can't)."
Steven Adams one of the best
"What pisses me off is that r/NBA during his MVP year said he was padding his stats, you can’t pad assists. Steven Adams doesn’t help you pass. Truly a remarkable player. I love hungry Brodie."
"It's different...  It doesn't even seem efficient...  If anything, it's an injury risk for Trey. God forbid be tries to do this to a player like Steven Adams."
I hereby forgive Draymond for Steven Adams' balls
Pretty sure steven adams played rugby. That’s a BIG mofo for rugby.  He’s a tough son-of a bitch too
I’ll say two things   1. Give a coach time   2. The fit with Zion and Steven Adams or Jaxson Hayes or Derrick Favors doesn’t work
"That doesn't make it a good trade for the franchise though. They got Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe back, who also don't fit the timeline.   They may have screwed up Zions first 4-5 years in the league. That is also not good for the future of the franchise."
"This dude has really barely played a full season of games and is already bitching about losing. People have got to stop gassing these kids before they actually do anything, the entitlement is absurd.   Zion's out there with Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Steven Adams, etc. Compared to some of the absolute bums that some of the league's stars started their careers playing with, how tf are you really complaining about that. Even SVG and Alvin Gentry, for all their faults, are at least legit coaches.   I get wanting to hold the FO's feet to the fire, but if he's actually already fed up, he's nuts."
"Full disclosure: I think he'll remain in New Orleans for a long time, I think this is mostly just noise after a frustrating season where the team went with Van Gundy and Steven Adams.  But I do wonder, who will be the first rookie to take a qualifying offer just to get out of having to resign with the team that drafted them? If Zion is unhappy, take the QO and be underpaid for a year and then chose where you want to go. That is an option if you play your cards right."

No you’re right he’s not. Steven Adams as far as pure iron is what we’ve got right now but that’s about all he’s got in comparison to Shaq. I saw a report a long time ago when Zion first got to practice even he was surprised how strong Adams was.
"&gt;I mean Adams is better than any of those players?   I think that's highly debatable, but it's not even a question when you compare what those guys cost. Would you rather have a 1st round pick, George Hill and Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard for $5 or $3 million, respectively, or would you rather just have Steven Adams on a 3 year deal for $65 million? That's a no-brainer.   &gt; What can you get for 10mil?   Did you not see the part above in the OP's post that said:   * ""The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.""   Wasting that kind of money is *always* bad, which is why it's now being reported that the Pels are looking to dump him. Don't be surprised if it costs them more picks to do so.   &gt; Nobody is coming to the pels unless you overpay.   Wrong, the Pels could have easily traded for Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, both of whom were on expiring contracts (so they wouldn't now need to be salary dumped), and both of whom were eventually bought out. The Pels probably could have got a couple second round picks or possibly even a first to take either of those guys on. That would have been far better than paying what they did for Steven Adams."
"Griffin chose Steven adams and Bledsoe over horford and hill  “Good” defense over competent defense &amp; floor spacing (plus horford’s playmaking)  ….in 2021  Not to mention they wasted the 10th pick on a non shooting big last season   …to pair with Zion  …in 2020  It’s not the the results are bad, it’s that the process was so fuckin nonsensical.  Shot creation &amp; floor spacing have won the last 10 championships and have been getting more important every year.   Pelicans deserve this energy. They earned it."
"Even if you ""overpay"" for someone like Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard, what does that look like? $7 million per year? That's far better than giving up multiple draft picks and George Hill just to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million. The Pelicans probably could have received a draft pick to take on Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, considering both guys eventually got bought out.   The Steven Adams trade and extension were just utterly stupid all the way around. Sorry."
"He gave up multiple picks and George Hill to acquire Adams on an insane $30 million contract, and then he extended him another $35 million over two extra years. Meanwhile if Griff just wanted a traditional big next to Zion he could have made Nerlens Noel, Dwight Howard, Bismark Biyombo or Mason Plumlee an offer and grabbed any one of them for a fraction of the price. Or hell, he probably could have *acquired* a pick to take someone like Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond on, considering both were eventually bought out. Who in the hell looks at Steven Adams making $65 million over 3 seasons and thinks ""he's worth giving up quality rotation players and picks for""? That should have been a fireable offense, especially when coupled with the SVG disaster."
"&gt; If you're smart  This is really what separates franchises. The Nets have done a great job.   It always gets turned into a big market vs small market thing, but in reality players don't want to play for stupid franchises.  25 mil to Steven Adams makes NO a dumb franchise."
"The Steven Adams deal was just…what the fuck was he thinking? In what world is that good value, and how the hell is Steven Adams a good fit with Zion?"
More Griffins fault than coach. Gentry didnt do it either. Paid a boatload of money for steven adams and traded away holliday for woefully bad shooting bledsoe?
Good luck trading Steven Adams.
"I'm not sure how to articulate this as well as I should but in my opinion I think people are a little unfair when they dismiss bigs like that.  If you compare to a mid-level 3 and D player like IDK Jae Crowder or Robert Covington or Patrick Beverley or something like that I think the comparison makes more sense.   They can hit open shots and they can have a 20 point game when they're feeling it,  but they're not guys that can put the ball on the floor and create offense reliably on their own.   If you're relying on Jae Crowder to be your 3rd best offensive player you're going to be very sad when he goes 1/5 from 3, but if he's the 5th guy on a well-constructed roster with playmakers it's an awesome skillset.  The valuation is kind of weird because you're obviously expecting your big to influence the defense in a way that perimeter players can't, but I think from that perspective it makes it easier to understand why people would want that.   If you have a good point guard and if Steven Adams is going to be a one-man defense that takes the pressure off and gives you roster flexibility to play guys that aren't a good fit defensively I think that can really have a much bigger impact than just his individual skill would suggest."
Signing Steven Adams to a ridiculous deal is a dumbass move tho. Moves like this have long lasting ramifications that snowball
And Booker would’ve been 100% justified in criticizing the FO if they gave Steven Adams $35m without playing a single game.
"How much more can the league do for small markets? They've already restricted rookie contracts and added advantages for teams to retain their talent, is the league supposed to step in and stop teams from hiring dogshit GMs? Are rookie contracts gonna have to last a decade now because small teams can't help but give Steven Adams pricey extensions?"
"Well no, cuz Simmons doesn’t shoot. So Westbrook would have a faster/better Steven Adams who can dribble and pass."
If they think that pairing zion with steven adams is a smart plan then they may never figure out how to make it work. So why wait?
"David Griffin really ducked up and it was honestly obvious at the time. Bledsoe i actually thought would be good, but Steven Adams was so clearly not the move, and the move was Al Horford, who was literally on the same team they traded with"
"Fr? I didn't realize that.    I agree that its useful for a rebuilding team to think more about value contracts than fit, but I dont think Adams on 17M is a value contract. A contender can't shed 17M in salary for Steven adams and still be a contender. I think he's a valuable contract at 10M, and 14M would already be kind of pushing it.    He plays quality defense and grabs boards. You can get 80% of his production for half the price."
Steven Adams is a wonderful player but I can't imagine a worse fit for the guy. Every other team in the league seems to understand that you can't have multiple non-shooters on the floor and there are definitely teams with 4 shooters and no bigs who would benefit from Adams' rebounding abilities
"Idk Jim, signing a center like Steven Adams who can stretch the floor with a reliable jumper says otherwise. Oh wait"
The new FO just brought in Bledsoe and Steven Adams to be key starters for most of Zion's rookie deal
"It's literally the same trade, lol.      The Adams thing is way overrated anyway, people misunderstand that because it made their roster a little weird.    He's on that high salary for this year, which was useful to them because they had to match salary and because Zion can't play defense. The extension is only like $17M which is a fair value for Adams.    If people think less about roster fit and more about value I think it makes a lot of sense, like when the Warriors signed D'Angelo Russel. Steven Adams in his prime on a fair contract is an asset. If they can't figure out the fit  they'll be able to move him pretty easy."
"Yeah, the Steven Adams thing never made any sense."
"27-year old Steven Adams is an ""aging veteran"""
"In a pretty random order and from the top of my head I’d say:  Derrick Rose   Luka  Brad Beal  Kelly Oubre  Gordon Hayward  Kevin Love  Steven Adams  Zach LaVine  D’lo  Kemba Walker  Russ (despite my flare this isn’t biased I swear, I’m just attracted to that man, his body and overall intensity is 🔥👌🏻)"
"Why on earth isn't the team that was bad enough to get a #1 pick 2 years ago, then have that #1 pick miss half of his games for those 2 year, elite yet?! I just don't understand! /s  The Steven Adams extension was a clear miss, but come on..."
"Team needs to trade everyone including Ingram and build around Zion, Zo, Hayes, Kira. Griffin deserves a lot of blame too signing steven adams whe nobody in the league wanted him"
And also trading quality assets for and then extending Steven Adams to that insane contract. David Griffin has really been a disaster down there.
"Everyone in this thread is mad at zion, but it was david griffin's dumbass that traded jrue for a bunch of future picks and Bledsoe and extended Steven Adams"
"well they felt their hand was forced so they shipped out jrue for bledsoe and let randle walk and overpaid steven adams  we have to win right now, so we are gonna just shoot for the moon right now because it's our only chance to keep our star"
"Well, they got Bledsoe and Steven Adams for salary filler, so, yeah..."
Steven Adams is literally a single player. They had Ingram already and hart and lonzo.
"&gt; The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.  Why the fuck did they give Adams that extension then lmao"
"Everyone is dogging on Zion's family here, but does anyone disagree with them?  Who here thinks Zion has the right pieces around him to content for a title?  Do you guys expect these generation type players to just suck it up and be happy when teams get players like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams?  How much time should Zion be required to play on a crappy team before he voices displeasure with the situation?"
A tad off topic but Steven Adams is aging? He’s like 26-27 isn’t he?
Maybe if they would be better talent evaluators they could see what type of players work around his talents. Everyone knew Steven Adams was a bad fit. Look at the Grizz with Ja or the Hawks with Trae. You build around your star with players that complement them.
Steven Adams is 27 and they called him an aging vet lol poor guy just looks old
"Extending Steven adams was not a bad move. We got a cheap, experienced and CONSISTENT center to train the young guys Jaxon and willy. Now we can either trade a gritty veteran or keep him around as a leader in the locker room."
If you have a Zion on your team with a Brandon Ingram and can’t realize that you need a floor spacing center along with wing defenders on that team to be competitive then you don’t deserve to have a Zion.  From the moment he was scouted Steven Adams shouldn’t have even been on the radar.  You are supposed to know these franchise level players skill set.  Wonder why we don’t hear about this with Memphis.  Because they were competitive and built a good team around Ja from the moment they got him.  Even their bad moves in hindsight like the Winslow trade was made in the effort to build a better team around him.  Hell even the Mavs with Luka realized that they have to build a playoff team around him immediately.  Can you imagine drafting Luka and punting on years to get extra lottery picks and build through the draft.   That almost never works ever.
Then they should build a good offensive club if they’re not going to get their roster to defend  Build around your star or lose the star  Wait nvm they’re paying Steven Adams and Bledsoe in 2021
"Yes you can blame them because even at the time everyone knew it was a horrible move, both the trade and the extension. There was never a scenario where Steven Adams and Zion together was going to work and now the pelicans front office is going to get punished for their incompetence."
"This is ridiculous. He has a good young PG and all star caliber SF in Lonzo and BI. That’s a really solid core. Throw in some good role players like Steven Adams, and Josh Hart and that’s a solid foundation. They can’t compete within these 2 years anyway with Nets, Bucks, Clippers, Lakers and Philly running the show.   Should stay out and develop the team to be the next home grown super team like the 05 Warriors."
"&gt; Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams  Still mystified why they made these trades in the first place. Or hired SVG. David Griffin is a trash tier executive"
"&gt; The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.  In what world did they think both of those players on this Pelicans roster would make them better? I could at least see Steven Adams but then you gave him a 2 year extension instead of seeing how it would fit first. And Eric Bledsoe... how does he fit into anything for the Pels?  Awful roster construction; it's a good thing they have picks but it's not a Get Out of Jail free card unless they know how to use them right."
The guy who got voted dirtiest player in the league Steven Adams
Steven Adams looks like he doesn’t wash his hair that often which you could classify as dirty I guess.   In a good way tho like a jason momoa type
"JV, and sometimes Steven Adams"
"Steven actually fit pretty well with Zion. Adams doesn't need the ball beyond open dunks. Screens, grabs offensive rebounds for 2nd chance points, pulls off double teams with paint presence. Essentially Adams was double-downing on Zion's strengths. It was the backcourt that was the problem, not Adams."
"Send Steven Adams to WASH to be with Westbrook and Beal, they need help"
I thought this was a win for the pelicans. You’re really switching firsts and second rounders and you’re only losing a protected lakers first which isn’t a great asset because the lakers will probably be good next year   Pelicans now get rid of Bledsoe and Steven Adams which is a win for them
You mean steven adams 2.0?
"&gt; but it just seems odd  It is odd, because the Pelicans are giving away draft capital just to get out from self-inflicted wounds sustained less than a year ago.  Paying 1st rounders to get Steven Adams then paying cap to extend him to a ridiculous contract then paying more draft capital just to get off him. AWFUL.  The Pels are screwed, time for Zion to demand a trade lol."
I haven’t checked but did Steven Adams not sign a massive extension? And Bliedsoe is on one of the worst contracts in the league. That kills their cap for the future
If only there were some way they could have avoided Steven Adams' contract situation!
Valanciunas couldn’t have been much worse than Steven Adams last year
"this is interesting, dont really know what memphis can really do with bledsoe or adams though, they have ja and steven adams is just a worse version of valanciunas. im guessing they try to manuever the two of them in another trade or two since i dont really see how both of them (or at the very least how bledsoe) fits in. id rather see them experiment with jjj at center than just throw adams in there also."
"Why is everyone acting like Steven Adams is a bad player now. He was very good on the thunder with a all star PG, last year had to play with a point dominant PF. valanciunas was seen as a meh player when he was traded to memphis"
"I'm really optimistic for the Ja-Adams pairing. JV and JJJ are ok, but Ja has never played with a PnR big or rebounder (as good of a rebounder as JV is) as Steven Adams."
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"This is a bad trade for the Grizzlies. What does Steven Adams bring other than being an overpaid back up to a hopefully healthy JJJ. I don’t see where Bledsoe fits with the grizzlies either.   However Pelicans probably do well with this. They get a solid player in Valuncianas, and get the 10th pick where they can get the Center they need (probably Kai Jones from Texas). However that team still has no shooting.  And they have the cap space to resign Lonzo."
"Valanciunas &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steven Adams. Bledsoe doesn’t fit well next to Ja, unless the FO really likes someone around 10 this is kinda shitty for you guys imo."
"JV was good for Memphis! Hopefully we can see a bit of a return to form for Steven Adams and he can look great next to Morant  If memphis gets adams and Bledsoe from this past season, then yes 1000x they got swindled but hey at least they’re making moves"
"Bruh JV is 20x better than bumfuck Steven Adams, what is Memphis doing"
"10th pick, they can afford Steven Adams on offense in the paint with JJJ being a decent shooter from the outside, and Bledsoe could be good coming off the bench (if motivated). Good deal for Pelicans, too"
If they bring in Ben Simmons to play alongside Zion and Steven Adams I think I'll actually puke.
&gt;	Russ needs a stretch-5 and a bunch of 3&amp;D guys around him. Guess what? Every other team is looking for those types of players too.  POV: you didn’t follow basketball until after 2019  he won MVP playing with Steven Adams and zero shooters. yes he’s a worse player now but the idea that he “needs a stretch 5 and shooters” to be successful is bullshit
"It was the same transaction they just announced the full details later.  Milwaukee had to match Holiday's salary so they sent Bledsoe to NO and Hill to OKC. OKC got a pick, an asset in Hill, and got off the Adams contract.  NO took Adams on was basically them giving the Thunder cash via Steven Adams, as they had been looking for the defensive minded center and it didn't really matter he was overpaid since they knew they were going back under the cap this year."
There is no hype for Steven Adams right now lol
"Eh, love Steven but I'll believe it when I see it.  He's a career 55% FT shooter who saw a pretty big decline last season (.444 from .582 the season before :/).    Generally when you see a big develop an outside shot, they were a solid FT shooter all along (e.g. Brook Lopez who averaged ~75-80% for years before starting to shoot the three), it would be pretty unprecedented IMO if Adams started knocking it down from deep.  Would love to see it though."
"Yeah let’s blame the media for signing Steven Adams to a big deal when Zion should see lots of time as a small ball center. And it’s the media’s fault that the Pelicans took on Bledsoe in the Jrue deal and they are looking to attach picks because they are being cheap. Explain to me why they took on Bledsoe if they are going to give up assets to move him. It’s not the media, it’s the plan that is the issue for the Pelicans. Don’t act like the media was screaming that the Pelicans need to make the playoffs year one of Zion. That is the Pelicans completely screwing themselves again. Ask any fan and they would have all said that it was smart for the Pelicans to build slowly around Zion. And out the right pieces around him. The Pelicans are poorly run and made dumb decisions. That’s not on the media and has nothing to do with market size."
"I agree, I get why teams do it. Really good players become really expensive fast. So if you need vets to start to move the needle before the players are off their rookie contract. Examples being Conley with the Jazz, Milsap with the Nuggets, CP3 with the Suns, and the hawks this year.  Pels are still in good shape with the picks but man that Steven Adams contract was dumb."
"&gt;can someone explain the reasoning why they let holiday go?  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, 2 first round picks, and 2 pick swaps.  There's your answer. It's the same reason the Thunder traded Paul George even though he's really good."
The fact that this team was designed for Zion to share the floor with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams is a sin against basketball.
Probably everything related to Steven Adams.
"We traded Jrue because he requested a trade, and we traded him to the Bucks dude hats where he wanted to go and we wanted to send him where he wanted to go.   That package was also pretty solid, and seen as an overpay by the Bucks at the time. We got picks and Steven Adams. While I don’t like the extension we have Steven Adams, he’s still a good center that made us go from one of the worst rebounding teams to the best."
Eric bledsoe and steven adams with Zion....What a shitty gm...looks like sabatoge !!!
"Absorbing bad contracts is good if you don't have people you want to build around already. It's not the case here. Also you shouldn't extend bad contracts, yet here Steven Adams is"
"But I guess it comes down to doing that well.  Minnesota has been trying to keep KAT happy for years by getting him into the playoffs, and that's just spiraled downward. I think anytime you talk about keeping a guy this young happy, you've gotta remember how long they have him under contract. It'll be years by the time Zion can hit unrestricted free agency. So the litmus test would be this: if adding a veteran helps them make the playoffs, but significantly restricts their chances at being a contender in a few years, it's not worth it. Hence, Steven Adams and Bledsoe being the wrong kinds of players to devote a lot of money to."
"The point is that they could have better utilized the ~40m of cap space than to sign Favors/Redick/Melli. Even if they just absorbed Crabbe+Iggy, at least they'd have 2-3 extra first round picks right now.   Sure, they needed a center, but they didn't need to spend $18m of cap space on Favors, plus a first round pick and $60m+ on Steven Adams.   You could just get a random run-of-the-mill center like Mason Plumlee for $8m/year. Or even better a budding star like Christian Wood for $13m/year."
“Steven Adams” and “mobile” do not go together lol
"I don't think anyone is expecting them to be immediate contenders. They've had a ton of assets and cap space, and the team is still not that close to being that good, I think it's fair game to critique what they've done with it:   - Trading a first round pick for Steven Adams and extended him, now looking like a negative contract.  - Haven't really found valuable players in the draft outside of Zion. Hayes, NAW, Kira Lewis are all pretty meh.  - Got pretty bad mileage out of cap space. Gave big contracts to Redick and Favors, instead could have gotten juicy assets in exchange for absorbing salary dumps.  - Not too great at picking coaches. Fired SVG a year after hiring him.   Obviously, they did some good at some things too:  - Got good value for AD and Jrue - Good player development for Lonzo and Ingram"
Asik was almost immediately unplayable and it was apparent at the time that AD was best at center. Steven Adams is still a capable player and fills a role no one else on the team can
Dumping a first round pick for Asik feels fairly similar to dumping a first round pick for Steven Adams
"Porzingis as well. Although I doubt anyone thinks of him as good. Also Jusuf Nurkic, Steven Adams, the Gasol bros. Bam technically could have opted to play for Nigeria too."
Steven Adams
Shaved Steven Adams looks like a 17 year old
Steven Adams?
But Blake was shooting from 16 before then. Same with Brook Lopez. I'd expect guys like Boban or Steven Adams to be more realistic at getting there too since they've shown good touch on shots from that distance.  There aren't guys who went from not even shooting FT length jumpers to shooting 3s at a serviceable percentage
Steven Adams with Zion Williamson
Steven Adams being only 27
And then you get people like Steven Adams who grew his hair out because haircuts were too expensive.
He had one in place with the Thunder if Steven Adams wasn’t on the board IIRC
"What the fuck was Steven Adams and his 25 million to lakers!!! This is the worst deal lakers would ever make and palinka would be fired the day after...   Lakers will lose a pg who is decent in shooting and without him, lakers will only have lebron for handling the ball...    Also, lakers are desperate for a good shooter and they get fucking Steven Adams for 25 mill and he won't be on the floor during playoffs.   And lakers get buddy hield for kuzma? Kings  would like to say hi to your noggin with their fist... And how would that even work? Kuzma makes 13 mill and buddy makes 23 mill...   You gotta admit... This was a pretty shitty post and you have the gall to fucking argue."
Steven Adams to the lakers? That’s horrible.  Taking on 20+ mil for some shit center when Demar is saying he would go there on a pay cut?   Also kuzma starting over Bagely?
"James Johnson and Steven Adams. Also UD, I think he's the last OG enforcer in the league"
Steven Adams because I know my life could end [if I accidentally ran into him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y3m0te_Tdc).
"Steven Adams, super nice guy but I don’t wanna be around him if he’s angry"
that would’ve been fun  plus the name “Nerlens Noel” fits New Orleans like a glove lmao  he might sign with them this offseason if they don’t keep steven adams… he’s an incredible defender
Well that should hopefully end that nonsense. The Kings should focus on a Bagley and Buddy Hield for Kristaps Porzingis trade or that same package for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams.
"What is this comment?  https://youtu.be/S3OCx3JIsFo  Ayton is 3 years into his NBA career and is incapable of doing this. This was wiseman’s 3rd game.  https://youtu.be/Lp3SXDCk4-A  0:28, this mobility and body control is something ayton can’t do, this is his third basket in the NBA.  He’s absolutely using those handles on the court, your argument about Steven Adams is idiotic lmao. Is he crossing guys up every play? No, of course not he’s played 30 games and is a center. But he’s a much more versatile player on offense and when he learns positioning he’s got just as much if not more potential on defense. Who gives a damn if a coach is calling plays for him to handle the ball, the point is he can do more than just sit on the block and be a lob threat. Ayton doesn’t dribble the ball unless he’s on the low block.  Ayton is a better defensive player, sure, but wiseman is basically making the jump from high school to the NBA and had no preseason, no summer league, had bad luck with injuries all year, and was expected to come in and learn an extremely complex system. Jordan Poole looked absolutely terrible until he had a year and a half in our system, idk why you expect a 19 year old to be any different.  How the hell are you gonna say he’s got no skills other than being tall, just shows you don’t pay attention. He’s raw, everyone knew that. He gets a ridiculous amount of blame for his advanced stats when the entire team was terrible for the majority of the year. The team turning it around at the end of the year has infinitely more to do with curry going nuclear, Poole blossoming, and oubre being out than it does with wiseman’s injury."
Imagine Steven Adams with a Richaun Holmes floater
"Ayton averaged over 20 PPG on 60+% shooting at Arizona; came right into the NBA averaging over 16 a game with basically no plays being run for him whatsoever (still kinda is that way lol); there is no basis for arguing Wiseman over him offensively, and of course literally zero avenue on defense. Wiseman's handles are better in the way that Steven Adams 3 point shot looks smoother than Dwight Howard's in empty gyms in the offseason; he is nowhere near utilizing that ""skillset"" on an NBA court and no coach is drawing up a play asking him to do that anytime in the next ~5 years so it's a moot point.   Ayton was one of the most dominant college centers in years. Wiseman played literally 3 games and has no skillset or archetype as a player other than being tall. He's not even a particularly outlier athlete for his height the way that Ayton and AD are. There is no comparison; Wiseman's ""opportunity shares (WTF?? lmao) were nonexistent because he contributes nothing positive on either end of the floor at this point in his career."
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"This. 2 lottery picks and last years number 1 pick is a better offer than 2 Bucks picks and 2 pick swaps, plus Steven Adams."
Pelicans are not gonna make the playoffs till the move bledsoe and steven adams facts
"Ehhh it’s an ugly draft but not the worst. Produced a true superstar in Giannis, all star and possible HOF talent in Gobert. Fringer all stars in Oladipo and CJ McCollum, plus some decent depth guys in Steven Adams, Schoeder, and Olynyk. By no means a great draft but pretty decent in depth at least"
Hot take: Steven Adams will come back next season as the best 3-pt shooter in the NBA and lead New Orleans to a championship
"Man. The NBA did not bother scouting that draft. CJ went 10, Giannis 15, Steven Adams 12, Schroeder 17, Gobert 27, and Olynyk and KCP were also in that draft. KCP was the highest pick of them all at #8."
And Steven Adams. Basically the guys in this draft needed some development
Steven Adams is not a wuss like Ben tho
"Steven adams is one of my favorite players. The guy does not care about stats, he does all of the dirty work that doesn't show up on the stats sheet"
if steven fuckin adams is shooting more 3s than Simmons next year then Simmons needs to straight up retire.  sixers should put a shock collar on him and zap him if he goes any lower than the 3 pt line during practice
Oladipo (minus injuries) and Steven Adams too
"the Spurs Thunder game 2 of the 2016 playoffs, as a Thunder fan so much happened in the final 13 seconds, all the fouls not  called , Steven Adams shutting down a 3 on 1 break and then getting held back by a fan as he tried to get back on the court. It set up the series win."
If Steven Adams can make three 3-pointers a game on 40% shooting how good is he?
That Pels team was hampered by Stan Van Gundy and a poorly designed roster. Steven Adams is in the way of Zion on offense. They also need a coach on the floor who will tell Ingram and all to keep feeding Zion if he has it going. Can’t remember how many games we watched last year where Zion is killin’ teams in the third quarter and he never gets touches in the fourth.
*The MLB has fined and suspended C Steven Adams for use of foreign substances on the ball*
"I’ve seen Steven Adams be Kyrie Irving in an off season video, I’ll believe it when I see it."
"Thats cuz theres almost no situation where youre drawing up a 3 for Steven Adams. Either way, he knows that Zion needs to be surrounded by shooters, so at least he's trying so that he can at least stand in a corner and still draw a defender. Cant blame him for that. Other players mightve just made Zion change his game to awkwardly fit around them."
Who the fuck says “shooting the snot out of the ball” lmao. Like are they implying that Steven Adams is a tissue?
"Given no injury issues, they have 2 MVPs on the floor at all times. So offensively they’ll be great. Defensively they won’t survive without better forwards, but the biggest thing is Embiids replacement. Give them 2 from Steven Adams, Jarrett Allen, Rui, Millsap and they could do 65 wins, even with LiAngelo starting."
Steven Adams has never flopped a day in his life. Nor do I think he ever will
Sabonis no but Reggie Jackson and Steven Adams
"Luka, Klay, Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Steven Adams  I think they would be pretty ok!"
Derrick rose - Luka Doncic - Zion Williamson - Giannis Antentoukounmpo - Steven Adams
7 for Steven Adams and 10.  I’ll see myself out
I mean Dray should’ve been suspended for the whole series against OKC after he kicked Steven Adams into his nuts
The conversation really flipped when Draymond kicked Steven Adams in the nards
Fine take Steven Adams and give us Buddy
Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for Tobias Harris and a future second
"I think you’re being a little hard on yourselves. I don’t think anyone expects Zion to jump ship (not anytime soon at least). I think there are real questions about what the hell David Griffin was thinking last year with Steven Adams and others, but that can be tweaked."
"Pelicans fan first, but I was rooting for the Bucks because of Jrue. As much as people praise his defense and all-around game, he’s honestly even better as a person. Happy the trade worked out! Now who wants to trade for Eric Bledsoe and/or Steven Adams? Preferably for a bunch of future firsts. If you trade a ton of draft capital for a Pelicans player chances are you’ll end up winning the championship. Worked the last two seasons!"
w/ Pelicans   Alex caruso for Steven Adams.  Especially if Lakes resign Drummond
"they replaced him with kevin martin, and other role players stepped up also like Ibaka, Steven Adams, and etc. If KD is already thinking about if i had harden back in the day, i woulda won meanwhile he c hoked a 3-1 lead to 2016 Warriors. He has already lost the fucking battle. Not like the FO didn't fill up his roster with talent, KD had talent. Bron had hot garbage in the first stint in CLE."
I'd take Steven Adams over Oladipo tbh
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"1. Giannis : No need to explain why  2. Healthy victor : Otherwise, he's 5th.  3. Rudy Gobert (Have to give some love to a multi-DPOY)  4. CJ : He nice &amp; nicer than the rest.  5. Shroder : Headache at time, but still worth it compared to the rest  6. Tim Hardaway  7. KCP  8.Steven Adams  9. Otto Porter  10. Trey Burke"
Giannis   Oladipo   CJ   Steven Adams   KCP   Noel   MCW   Porter   Olynik   Len
"Their coach was Scott fucking Brooks,Westbrook was not MVP level yet,and the rest of the roster was really bad,can't expect to win anything when you are starting Andre Roberson and young Steven Adams."
"Lakers fan here hopeful of some big moves. Maybe a 3-team trade involving the pelicans.   Schroeder, Harrell, KCP, THT, and the first pick   For Lonzo, Steven Adams, Josh Hart"
"Time to trade Khris Middleton for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, and Steven Adams because you can't be a luxury tax team in a small market."
Show some faith in the franchise guy and try to acquire some higher end talent. Easier said than done of course but this is essentially what Milwaukee did. Giannis wasn’t necessarily proven on the big stage going into this season but Milwaukee recognized that the talent+mindset was there and that they’d slip back into mediocrity if they sat on their hands for too long and pushed Giannis to want out through complacency.    Milwaukee also had a handful of picks and traceable salary to maneuver that other teams don’t necessarily have. Portland has one or two enticing players to trade and some salary but not many picks. NOLA I think has picks but they also have to figure out how to appease Zion with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams taking up so much money and garnering reputations as bad contracts.
"Ayton's biggest problem has always been mental. The dude isn't aggressive enough at times. He wants to be Hakeem so badly when there is only one person in the entire league that is definitely stronger than him in Steven Adams. I hope that in the coming year he can train with Shaq, he needs to emulate more of his bully ball"
"One Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and a Kevin Martin rental"
"Who did they attract? They went out and traded for Jrue, if that's who you're talking about.  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
The team to get Steven Adams will win the chip next year.  Pelicans are just a championship feeder team now.
Steven Adams
"Well TBF he's a great guy. Very lovable. Can't see why anyone could dislike him, even if he takes 35 shots and is a Steven Adams boxout merchant.  /s"
No more JV to cook us in the paint this year. Though I love Steven Adams.
"It was an approximation, let me actually calculate it:  - They traded a 1st round pick for the right to extend Steven Adams - They are letting Lonzo walk for nothing for the right to max Lowry - Grizzlies trade is more complicated, breaking it down in a sub bullet:   - They traded down from #10 to #17, which is around a late first round pick in value. Like, you might typically get back #17 + #30 for #10.    - They also traded a 2022 Lakers pick, which is likely to be in the #25 range. So call it 2 total late firsts.    - The purpose of the trade was to offload $22m remaining of Bledsoe, and $35m of Steven Adams. Let's say half of the value was for Adams, so 1 total late first round pick to offload Adams.   So in total, they'll end up giving up Lonzo and ~2 first round picks for the right to max Lowry."
"I'm honestly fine with not overpaying Fournier    When people complain all the time about bad contracts like Steven Adams - this is the exact moment where you *don't* want to give him $20M over 4 years. He'll contribute to whichever team he's on, but he doesn't make us that much better to be worth the reduced flexibility"
no way Steven Adams is going to memphis and JV is gonna be playing with Zion and Lonzo and BI?? man i hope New Orleans is dope
Wonder if she'd be friends with Steven Adams' sheep wife?
"Bro IDGAF how old you are, I will gladly call an 11 year an idiot over how much Steven Adams should be making any day of the week"
"Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Steven Adams"
Wait didn’t they get two first round picks for taking Bledsoe and Steven Adams? They also got two pick swaps.
Steven Adams hit draymond foot with his genitals and didnt even get a foul called   smh
"Well, you can say that, David, but it doesn't mean I'll believe the guy who gave away picks and George Hill so he can extend Steven Adams for $35mm..."
"&gt; point is it's a bit far away from now and that's what makes it your best asset, but it's not some kind of gamechanger.  Well it could become a game changer if the bucks are a lottery team in the year 2027, no protections on that pick, those picks the pels gave up in the steven adams trade and the JV trade probably won't be gamechangers because not only are they protected (lottery protected to denver/top 10 protected to new orleans) they're also based on the performance of good teams that are more likely to not collapse in 1/2 years rather then the bucks in 6 years."
"&gt;The Pelicans dumped a 1st round pick to trade for Steven Adams and the right to extend him for $18m/year. Then they paid another 2 first round picks to get off Steven Adams and Bledsoe.  They paid 1 first to get off both, moved down 10 to 17 and up in the 2nd round. Worth mentioning that the pick they traded is the lakers for this coming season, and they guy they    wanted was on the board at 17 still anyway.     &gt;Absorb bad contracts (like Bledsoe/Adams lol) in exchange for 1st round picks   Sign random veterans (like Favors/Redick) to big short term deals  These are stupid ideas"
"God why do people always frame these picks in the worst possible light? Pick given up for Adams (protected) and from a good nuggets team, Moved from 10 to 17 and still got a guy we were high on, The other pick is a top 10 protected lakers 2022 pick, so most likely a late round pick. Its so fucking dishonest to just leave out the context of these picks. No we didn't fucking 'pay a price' its a projected late round 1st round pick, thats not that bad windy u fucking idiot. We still got a guy who can immediately impact winning at 17. Even if the lakers do collapse we still have the top 10 protection. ""another 2 first round picks to get off Steven Adams and Bledsoe."" God u win an award for the most dishonest framing of the day."
&gt; they paid another 2 first round picks to get off Steven Adams and Bledsoe.  ...we dropped back 7 and got a good player we needed and lost what could very well be pick 30.
Was something up with steven adams or is he a kiwi?
"Steven adams used to backup perkins nough said. But Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Montreze Harrell, looney and bell on the warriors lol I just wanted to say random ones"
Same day Steven Adams hit one lol
"Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were clear attempts at trying to win now. Going after Kyle Lowry was another win now move. Griffin clearly wants this team in the playoffs, which is fine, but these types of moves are not going to get the team closer to a championship ceiling. He’s playing checkers, not chess."
Difference is that Steven Adams kinda sucks
How tf did Steven Adams and Evan Mobley become bros? Lol
UFA Jordan Bell + Cle's frp &gt; Steven Adams
"Extremely hesitant to trade Brooks, but if Cleveland wants to entertain the insanity of Nance + decent pick for Kyle I'd do it in a heartbeat lol, even factoring in how much I love Slow-Mo.  I have zero idea why the Cavs would do that, and the Steven Adams hypothetical makes even less sense."
Ya this is who I was thinking. Steven Adams is one of the nicest dudes in the league and I feel like he keeps that same energy on the court.
Does Steven Adams count?
"&gt;“He’s (Tim Duncan) not really crazy athletic but he still destroys you, and he’s a nice guy. That was my biggest mistake as a rookie. I was like hitting him all the time and he was having trouble with it. And then he came over and talked to me a bit. He was like, ‘Hey man, how are you?’ And I was like, ‘Oh, what a nice guy.’ Then he just dropped 20 from there on. I told M.B. (Mark Bryant), and he was like, ‘That’s a vet move. Don’t do that. You can’t be nice.'”  -Steven Adams  [source](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/thunder-steven-adams-tim-duncan-nice-guy-story)"
2-pointer by Steven Adams
 2-pointer by Steven Adams
I don’t think so honestly. Also don’t count Capela as young core lol. Steven Adams just turned 28
I wanna see game speed before I get hyped for him.   A lot of guys are ballers in practice. I was watching Steven Adams have a workout with Evan Mobley and dudes footwork looked like a way lesser version Duncan at some points and he was hitting freaking one legged fade a ways. Practice is just that. Practice.
Whelming 2 pointer by Steven Adams
"That is, in fact, a two point bucket from Steven Adams."
2-pointer by Steven Adams
"there a few obvious ones but id say the grizzlies  u have a great leader and pg in morants along with a rlly solid big man secondary in jaren jackson  i think brandon clarke is also quite underrated, and add the beast thats is a 28 year old steven adams and thats a rlly solid young core"
Westbrook always wanted to fight with Steven Adams on his team. Adams and Westbrook are no longer teammates. Westbrook has since calmed down.
Steven Adams... I mean he's still alive after Draymond's kick
"Or maybe, MAYBE, hear me out.... maybe Zion saw how Nola wasted years and years of CP3 and AD prime and is worried about that happening to him too. I hope Nola focus on improving the team instead of playing the small market victim all the time. Big markets didn't trade for bledsoe and Steven Adams."
Steven Adams. Watch his interview with JJ
"11. Steven Adams says ""mate"""
"&gt;I don’t really see it as a critique. Just the truth of the business.   None of us really knows if that's true. Just because Ethan Strauss says it doesn't mean it's true. My whole point is that he has an axe to grind with ESPN, so his analysis of who they are and what they do should be taken with a grain of salt.   Personally I think the idea that ESPN, the Knicks and Zion are all working in lockstep together is silly. The idea that Zion (or any player) has no real agency on his own or personal desires and instead would just do whatever CAA wants, I think is a ridiculous idea. He hired CAA, they didn't bless him with their representation and he now has some debt to them. If he ever does try to force some trade to the Knicks (big ""if""), then it will be because it's something he wants, rather than because he's trying to appease Leon Rose, Stephen A Smith or the corporate overlords at CAA.   At some point the Pelicans need to take some ownership for the poor moves they've made and the shoddy manner in which they've run their franchise. They absolutely are at a disadvantage by being in a small market, and as such they need to be nailing everything on the margins. It's not like the Lakers who can make a big misstep and recover gracefully. The Pelicans can't afford to keep screwing up the way they have with guys like Omer Asik and Steven Adams. They need to be *much* better about how they do things down there."
Steven Adams
"Rodman, idk, idk, DRose, Steven Adams, Shaq?, Gobert?"
*Team Cancer*  **PG** * Damian Lillard * Ben Simmons  **SG** * Bradley Beal * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **SF** * Kawhi Leonard * OG Anunoby  **PF** * Bam Adebayo * MPJ  **C** * Rudy Gobert * Steven Adams  **Reserves** * Patrick Beverley * Danny Green
"NAW seems like a poor pick based on the current state of the Pelicans roster.   Zion and BI are going to play 34-36 MPG, fully staggered, at ~30% and ~28% usage, respectively.   Additionally, the Pelicans jettisoned their lowest usage starter, Steven Adams 13% usage in 28 MPG, and are replacing his minutes with JV and his 19-23% expected usage.  I would be very surprised if NAW significantly outpaced Lonzo's 14.6ppg/5.7apg in 32 MPG.   My maximum projection for NAW is 18.2ppg based on an expected pace of 105, 34 MPG, 24% usage, 11% tovr, and 54% TS.   Those figures would represent a pace increase of 1 possession per game for the Pelicans, and improvements for NAW of 12 MPG, .8% usage, -1.4% tovr, and 2% TS.   For me, the best places to look for a MIP will be the teams with the most roster/playing time uncertainty and the teams with the largest usage and minutes voids created by known injuries or free agency/trade departures.   For those reasons, I would start with the Wizards, Spurs, Nuggets, and Clippers and then move on to the Cavs, Magic, Pistons, Thunder, and Rockets."
"Everyone in the world should take your opinion over mine cause I self admittedly dont watch that many Pels game, and I agree he had some dumb rotations from what I did see but I'm really not hot on your FO and the team they put together last year at the least. I don't think SVG will get another head coaching job but I just think its unfortunate because he went from being considered as one of the most innovative coaches to people now acting like he doesn't have two brain cells to rub together. Telling a FO to ""Go out and get some shooters"" is easier said than done but I dunno how you look at your roster and go ""ooh boy lets pay Steven Adams a lot of money"""
I am confused? Where is Steven Adams made up entirely of Adam silvers?
"Currently, Ben is the most talented Aussie playing. But that's not the question.   And maybe Steven Adams isnt? I wouldnt know, but maybe thats a question that local New Zealanders can answer. Making the NBA doesnt mean your the country's GOAT.  Notable exemplars are Juan Carlos Navarro (argument for Spain's GOAT), and Oscar Schmidt (Brazil)."
Ben Simmons is far and away a better player than any other Australian. Saying he isnt the GOAT Australian because he doesnt play for the national team is like Steven Adams isnt New Zealand's GOAT.
"&gt;Kawhi's DPOYs came with the still-strong Spurs  By 2015-2016 Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter &amp; Steven Adams were outscoring Tim Duncan, Manu &amp; Parker in the playoffs.   It's so dishonest to pretend the Spurs were some kind of dynasty or the big 3 were superstars when they were on the verge of retirement."
A fan of any team can and should appreciate Steven Adams crushing Patrick Beverly

"you speak like a middle schooler but besides that it’s not like they got Brandon Ingram next to him, a fresh dependable coach, and flexibility going forward. you couldn’t be more wrong but okay. And yes NAW is going to step up huge. JV provides spacing and offensive capability unlike Steven Adams. Trey Murphy is a ready shooter. Graham is replacing the spacing Zo gave. Guarantee we’re better this season than"
"I agree the cost of losing him is higher than the cost of the max to keep him, but its close.  In my opinion, I put Ayton in the class of Steven Adams and Whiteside where you give them max or big money and they can't live up to it. He's hyper dependent on others creating or being a huge threat and never is dominant vs opposing bigs.   Outside the pick and roll, his offensive skill set is very limited, and defensively well, Williams hid him from Drummond, Davis, Cousins RD1. Later Ayton couldnt slow down or touch Jokić. In the finals for everyone to see Giannis took his heart and soul.  In my opinion, if you have to give him a max deal, do it with two eyes closed and a prayer.  Remember this is one of the 3 guys who, in the bubble, missed taking a covid test- literally the only thing you had to do outside of practice and games."
Steven adams playing with westbrook again.
I don’t think Steven Adams was really a star
Steven Adams
"&gt;This allows for his big to focus on boxing out, and he gets the ball immediately to start a fast break- no need for the big to pass it to him and eat up time that way.   I've never understood this mindset.  Basketball 101 (and also just the laws of physics); it's faster to pass a ball up the court than for _anyone_to run with it.  If we were to time how long it took Steven Adams to rebound and then hurl it up the floor to a wide open westbrook it would 100% be faster than westbrook rebounding and running.  What you're giving us is simply an excuse Russ camp uses for his blatant stat padding."
Steven adams rookie year was KD’s 7th year so I’m thinking this has to be after any growth spurt
You really think you need to be Yao ming size to push around Beverly in the paint?  I'm not asking kp to bully Steven Adams in the paint.  Besides my argument was against this center of gravity excuse and Yao king fits the description and Yao at 7'3 probably had the highest one.
Memphis and only because I see Steven Adams being a better fit offensively to both Ja and Jaren than Valanciunas.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
didn't steven adams only look like this in his rookie season?
I like how KD is still listed at 6’9” while standing even with Steven Adams.
Steven Adams.
"Naw, Steven Adams is looking down with a smile alongside the prophet, Brandon Jennings."
"Three thunder legends, Steven Adams, Nick Collison, and Lesley McCaslin."
"A team with dudes like Ja Morant, Curry, Chris Paul, stand up. Just to look over and realize they are playing Steven Adams, Zion and the Lopez brothers"
Steven Adams: I mean the man is just a complete ledge.
Chris Boucher is 6 months older than Steven Adams
"I mean, I don't have to try very hard to cast AD as a poor shooter. He shot 26% last season from 3. He's 31% for his career. He's objectively not a good shooter on long 2s and 3s. If he's taking 4 or 5, 3s a game because no one is guarding him and he is spacing out for Russ and LeBron the Lakers team building has failed.   Passing and playing defence like Dray is a good thing, shooting like him obviously isn't. You see anyone guard Dray at the 3 point line? You see anyone close out to him? Teams will be more than happy to let AD bomb 3s and soft double LeBron on the block. Maybe he has a great shooting year and I'm wrong. Maybe he shoots somewhere between his career average the 26% he shot last season.  Russ has never been a good pick and role player. Be it Steven Adams, or Capela or Gafford last season who is a pretty decent roll man. The role man is not the issue. Teams go 5 feet under the screen and Russ is prone to pulling up from 3 and mid-range, or driving into bodies and turning it over.   Russ was legit one of the least efficient half-court scores in the entire NBA last season. He scored .79 PPP in the half-court. The league average is .96 for context. So I don't the Laker's half-court offence is going to get a huge boost, and I think the defence will take a hit.   The Lakers were the 19th best half-court offence in 2020 when LeBron and AD were healthy. Worse last season obviously. Does adding Russ, Monk, Ellington, Nunn and Melo for KCP, Curaso, Dennis and Kuzma make them better in the half-court? Maybe, maybe not. It makes them worse defensively for sure. Both things can be true. They could be the 15th bet half-court offence in the NBA which is still not good and be the 10th best defence instead of best defence.  IMO this team ain't designed to get the best out of AD."
"Steven Adams too is 28, and younger than Bradley Beal"
Anthony Davis is older than Steven Adams. AD still seems to me like a young guy coming into his prime while Adams has seemed like a vet presence for years
Steven Adams is younger than Kyrie
"I was going to write that Steven Adams turned 28 this summer, which still makes him the oldest Grizzly. However, according to Basketball Reference, [Shaq Buchanan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/2022.html) is an eternal being."
I like putting money on James Johnson or Steven Adams
"Tbh if the only thing you look at when making comparisons is ""can he shoot"" ig it would make sense.   Could also use midget Bam or midget Steven Adams in that case."
Steven Adams would go far.
Steven Adams
Under the radar bets for me:       Steven Adams   Boogie Cousins     Grayson Allen   Zach Lavine
Im going Steven Adams with Kawhi Leonard second because of how sneaky he is
Steven Adams was my first thought. Australia seems like a fine place to train for the games
"I haven't seen the show yet, but I'm pretty sure the answer is Steven Adams."
Steven Adams.
Steven Adams. His jaw and nut definitely got something that attract bopponents to hit those area.
Steven Adams or Jusuf Nurkic get the most blows to the head and are lunch pail type old school bigs.
&gt; Vuc has very good shot contest rate. He doesnt rack up blocks but is a Steven Adams level deterrent.   Steven Adams id actually overrated as a rim protector. Vucevic has similar DFG% as other bad rim protectors as Jokic and Kanter. He has the 3rd worst DFG% among center that defended more than 5 attempts per game. He is a bottom 5 starting center on defense.
"Those helpside blocks he gets will be harder when Steven Adams or Rudy Gobert are deliberately standing in his way and Chet is no longer reaching around a 6'7""-6'9"" 210lb teenager.   He will take time to adjust on defense imo"
"Vuc has very good shot contest rate. He doesnt rack up blocks but is a Steven Adams level deterrent.   Williams and Ball are both situated perfectly. Ball/Caruso are statistically excellent point of attach defenders and Pat Williams looks like he can become a Robert Covington like forward who is versatile both on and off the ball on defense.    2 great defenders, 1 solid rim presence  and then you have your two you can hide--- just like every team has to hide someone or another.    DeRozan will be subbed for Caruso a lot, but its not much worse than any other team imo. We also had much worse players and athletes last year playing guys like Lauri and Denzel Valentine and Billy Donovan still ended up with a top 10 defense rating"
Even Steven Adams?
Do you even know who my sister is bro - Steven Adams ... probably
Steven Adams is a tree.
Or kicking Steven Adams' penis.
"What kinda person you have to be to look at Steven Adams and think ""i'm gonna mess with him""?"
The more I hear these dumbasses come out with their asinine thoughts the more I am losing actual interest in the nba. Its breaking the illusion that these guys are actually people we should even entertain in their thoughts concerning important matters. How the fuck can lebron be coming out with this wishy washy bullshit when he is a role model for literally millions?  I think what would allow me to just be ok with this is just watch the nba and imagine all of the players as meatheads who are good at basketball and thats it. Too many of them are fucking stupid.   Except KAT and Steven Adams and anyone who had a spine concerning the vaccine. I like those two
"It's still only Steven Adams, five years ago."
"Steven Adams is such a brick, but in a good way"
"Let’s say instead, Philly drafted the player that was immediately picked after their pick. Would this be a better team? Ben McLemore Steven Adams Aaron Gordon Zach Lavine Kristaps Porzingis Brandon Ingram London Ball"
Steven Adams is without question the best
Some Pels homer during the preseason was trying to tell me the Steven Adams contract extension was a good idea because SVG was an excellent coach and that “spacing wouldn’t matter” because they would be an elite defensive team with Adams and Bledsoe. LOL.  Couldn’t be further from the truth. I got downvoted for it.
Valanciunas for Steven Adams
"Steven Adams can literally fuck anyone in the league up, he just chose to be chill while players like ZBo screams and cries acting like they won the exchange."
"Young Adams was the type to swing elbows when he could, going after loose balls or rebounds.  Then immediately put his hands up like he didn't do anything and make it seem like other dude (zbo here) is picking the fight  I can understand both.  Steven just doing everything he can physically as the rookie big man role but not actually fighting.  But also Zbo for reacting to it.  Just sucks the suspension happened"
"Imagine having Don Nelson, Jerry West, and Travis Schlenk and turning that into Kirk Lacob and Mike Dunlevey.   Reminds me of OKC turning Harden+Durant into Steven Adams.   Joe Lacob is the Sam Presti of owners.   Lacob is the Sam Presti of owners."
"Bogdan Bogdonavic, Steven Adams"
"The Thunder traded Harden for for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, a pick which became Steven Adams.   In 2016, they had a lineup of Westbrook/Roberson/Durant/Ibaka/Adams"
"&gt;  but they are not willing to go to war publicly with NBA stars on their stances for obvious reasons  discussing one's one journey to taking the vaccine is not a war with other stars in the case of Luka. A war would be demanding other players condemn other players or taking punitive actions(outside of paying them) against them for not taking the vaccine(outside of stringent protocols to isolate the unvaccinated).   &gt;why are you acting like people are pizzagaters  b/c there is absolutely no evidence Luka was told not to talk about his vaccination, when we have seen other stars comment on the matter Karl Town, Nurkic, Steven Adams to name a few. There is no NBA policy to not comment, mofos are making up BS to cover for their golden boy Luka being hesitant to talk about it( either luka doesn't want to start beef with a teammate who didn't get vaccinated, or he is himself a reluctant vaccinated person like dwight who got vaccinated but didn't want to talk about it.)"
"Obviously they wouldn’t let Simmons run the offense they would use him like draymond green. A secondary play maker and defender    All this is not going to happen anyway, but if it were it’s not as bad you’re making it out to be. Durant almost beat the warriors with multiple shit offensive players like Andre Roberson and Steven adams clogging up the floor. Harden hard carried teams with zero ball handling and playmaking outside of himself. Simmons would actually fit on a team with players like Durant and harden who can score at will even with cramped spacing"
Steven adams is awesome
"Steven Adams isn't afraid of needles, needles are afraid of him!"
"MEM is very much my second team so I'll try to explain a bit what the Grizz fandom sees in JJJ  So first let's start with the good. He's already a great 3 point shooter when healthy. KAT(39.9% on 7 3PAs per game the last 2 seasons) is understandably considered the best 3 point shooting big man in the NBA, but JJJ wasn't that far behind at all in his sophomore season(39.4% on 6.5 3PAs per game). He's also shown some signs of a dribble drive game, and some secondary passing ability, not to mention the defensive potential as well.  Now the bad ofc is that right now, outside of the 3 point shooting which I think is legit, JJJ is nearly all potential. The defensive highlights are great, but his relative lack of strength for a big man as he's obviously still very young(he only just turned 22) has resulted in a lot of dumb fouls. It's why MEM has invested in both JV and now Steven Adams to be the Center even though long-term it's where hopefully JJJ will end up. Injuries have also really hampered his overall development.  To me that's not quite a max extension worthy player, but his ceiling is still incredibly high, and at 22 it's not like his strength is likely where it's gonna be for the rest of his career, although personally I think JJJ is gonna end up as more of an AD type where you want a more traditional Center to take on the regular season punishment and save JJJ playing the 5 for the playoffs. It's not hard to see why Grizzlies fans are still high on the guy if he can just get in a mostly healthy season."
"Big time screen, COVID is down.. a 3 by Roberson!  COVID just got *rocked* by Steven Adams!"
"It sucks for us as a country because it's always hard to keep global stars contained in tiny old NZ yet fact Izzy remained here all this time, along with the other CKB who don't have as big of a profile but still one that has outgrown NZ traditionally was pretty huge. Awesome for the sport here and just cool in general that they continued to make NZ home.  I definitely agree with them though, our rugby and cricket teams get preferential treatment with coming back and forth here (have to complete two weeks quarantine in a hotel and  spots are limited) but CKB is NZs biggest profile sporting team globally and Izzy is probably one of the biggest stars we've produced ever - they should be the ones getting the priority really.   And now Izzy's given up his dream of bringing a title defence to NZ which would have been insane.  Big shame, big loss.  Alot of NZ public are indifferent though as Izzys confident personality rubs them up the wrong way. We are a nation of ""humble"" people. Think how Steven Adams comes accross he pretty much personifies the average NZer. Izzy's confidence and bragdocious attitude is rare and uncomfortable for the general public."
"It's not an easy lob because with 1:15 left in a close 4th quarter, he's never going to get called for a defensive 3-second, so he might as well cut off the passing angle to Steven Adams while staying in the paint instead of going to the post and giving PG the idea of getting to the rim."
"I’ll have to check with my meme guy, he’s a little backed up with newly acquired meme of a human being Steven Adams"
Here you can have Wiggins to bang against Steven Adams
Steven Adams is a real one.
"Man it still feels weird to hear ""Memphis' Steven Adams"".  In my head he still plays for OKC, idk why."
"People just think Steven Adams is adorable so a mildly funny quote from this big lug goes a long way, even if he kind of fucked it up. I thought the same thing as you about it not making sense but I just smirked and moved on."
"If I'm voting for someone to represent my professional interests I want the smartest shark available, someone who understands the importance of health, money and social impact if I'm in the NBPA.  ""Catching a guy"" is not an important qualifier. Steven Adams caught Mason Plumlee, is he the next VP of the NBPA?"
"In my other comment I said that Curry was better in 2014-2016, but not outside of that in my opinion(also, it's not like Curry didn't have his own worst moment of his career in those playoffs as well)  Also who is going to win with that spacing  I just looked at the OKC lineup for game 6  The other players: Westbrook, Roberson, Ibaka, Steven Adams  You might as well have multiple Ben Simmons's out there for how much the defense is going to guard them on the perimeter"
"2011 - Vuc -&gt; Shumpert  2012 - Maurice Harkless -&gt; Royce White   2013 - MCW -&gt; Steven Adams   2014 - Embiid -&gt; Aaron Gordon  2015 - Jah -&gt; Kristaps  we'd be god awful, man.  Any scenario in which we don't draft Embiid and this team is essentially the Kings"
You’re just a clown man  Letting Disney narratives run wild in your head lol  Actual experts rate him top 30 in the league and you’re calling him worse than Steven Adams based on your feelings. Delusional
Ben Simmons   Micheal Carter Williams   Micheal Kidd Ghilchrist   Anthony Bennett    Steven Adams
Hey leave Steven Adams out of this
"zion: ""hey, griff. i think we need spacing?"" griff: ""how about steven adams and eric bledsoe?""  zion: ""we disagree."""
It’s absolutely a knock on Simmons. Embiid drew so much attention that the paint was crowded. Simmons is limited offensively so all he can really do is attack the rim to generate offense.   Simmons needs a Steven Adams type of big where he can pick and roll. A big that’s looking to score from Simmons pass versus creating his own shot like Embiid.
Stephen Adams and Steven Curry
"While I don't agree with the take, that's well explained/reasoned.  With Trae I would be interested seeing him on a different defensive role in future. In fact I would argue it's extremely likely that it will happen given that situation allows for it.  That would follow the trend with some other short (or relatively short) guards like Lowry, Curry and Paul who all started their career trying to defend point of attack and then transitioned to either helpers or chasers later on. With young being worst PoA defender in NBA by large margin I'd expect that change sooner rather than later.  With Jokic I'm not totally convinced that he's all that doomed. He had particularly bad year defensively 20-21. However before that he had 3 years where he was much better defensively and 15-16 season he was actually one of the better centers defensively (within top 10 or so).  To me the fact that his defense suffered a bit while he basically doubled his offensive effectiveness is more than understandable. His offensive responsibilities will always be limiting factors for his defense in future and I don't think we will ever see defensive performance like 15-16 from him again, but I think 17-18 type of performance would be very manageable and if he can do that with the type of offensive output he showed last season I think that would be enough. It would basically put him as slightly above average center defender in his defensive role. So along guys like Steven Adams and Dwight Howard for example."
"Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz, Mavs, Suns - they should be in Play-offs   Blazers - if Chauncey Billups won't turn out excellent, I think this is the 6th seed   Warriors - they should fight for 6th seed  or even better(how good Klay will return and if young pack will be fine)   Clippers -  with healthy PG and this roster they should be in play-in, maybe even fight for 6th seed   Grizzlies -  we can't underestimate them, despite I am afraid of Steven Adams instead of JV   We have already 9 teams that should be play-off/play-in teams   T-Wolves with Simmons / Kings'Pelicans for 10th seed.   If Minnesota, even with Simmons, will be better than Grizzlies and any of Blazers/Warriors/PG-led Clippers ?   I doubt to be honest"
Westbrook's gonna force them to watch Steven Adams footage Clockwork Orange-style
"Neither am i  Steven Adams is a very good starting big man  Likely will never see an all star game, but still really good at what he's asked of"
As a pistons fan I would be absolutely ok if beef stew was Steven Adams tier lmao
"He'll be better than people think but i only see him being a really good starting C (like a Steven Adams tier).  He's got the strength, good defense already, a good inside game, and has shown he can hit open 3s here and there. Only thing against him is that hes about 6'8-6'9"
"Myles Turner I can jive with to an extent. Though you have to wonder why he's been floating in trade rumors for years at this point... either the Pacers want too much for him or us nephews have a different view on him than front offices in the league do.  McGee is a bench player and Wood is shit on defense. Like, worse than JV.   &gt; If Zion get doubled every time he’s in the paint it’s gonna be very hard going for him  You do realize Steven Adams was the Pelicans center last year, right? Not exactly an ""athletic rim runner with the threat of an outside shot"" (or an inside shot even) ... and Zion put up a highly efficient 27 PPG. Sure, having a center that can space the floor could help give Zion space when he's attacking in the paint. Or you could have a center that absolutely eats up space and does a good job of sealing his man. Adams did that very effectively last season for the Pels and even though it's yet to be seen, I have no doubt JV will be able to do the same. Plus JV actually has the ability to score both inside and outside of the paint to an extent.  Point is, finding an athletic rim running center who can defend, rebound, and shoot the ball well is not exactly easy. We're talking about a handful of guys who fit that criteria to any extent, and *maybe* one or two who would be able to be acquired realistically."
"Steven Adams... very clean player... lmao. OK, /r/nba."

My boy Steven Adams is low key getting the job done. He’s averaging almost a double double of 9.4 pts and 9.1 rebs almost 3 ast and 1 steal. We’re  early in the season but grizzlies have a solid team.
The dude was literally complaining that Steven Adams isos weren't efficient lol.
"Just like Bruce Lee mastered the ""one inch punch"", so has Steven Adams harnessed the powers of the ""one inch screen"""
Steven Adams only being 28 is mind-boggling
Steven Adams: Looks clean to me.
I am going to admit I was one of those people but the Steven Adams move was perfect for his screens alone. I have seen like 3 Grizzlies games this year and over those games I saw like 10-12 instances where Adams has a perfect screen where neither the center or the person guarding Ja/Slow Mo can do anything to get over the Adams screen leading to an easy layup for Memphis.   People who say screen assists mean jack shit have never seen Adams/Rudy/Jokic/Marc Gasol set smart screens which lead to easy points for their teams. Also the fact that you don't have to run a lot of plays for him means more shots for Ja and the rest of the young core
This one actually is natural though as opposed to when Draymond straight kicked Steven Adams in the nuts twice
Steven Adams rubbing his hands right now lmaoooo
Steven Adams sends his regards
Steven Adams is (15/15) at the moment.  Really hoping to see another 3 pt shot this season!
Fuck i love having steven adams on my team.
Steven Adams being perfect from the free throw line after 8 games is not something I thought I’d hear
"There are few things more pleasing to me than a firm, wet Steven Adams screen."
"death, taxes, and steven adams death screens"
We need a stat for this so we can officially say Steven Adams is the best pancaker in NBA history.
"Loved him on the Grizzlies, but he gets cooked on defense regularly.  Outstanding player nonetheless, but in the few games so far, Steven Adams looks like the better fit for the team.  To give Jonas all the credit he deserves though, there is no way the Grizzlies would have made it to the playoffs last year without him.  He anchored that offense so many nights.  Anytime the shooters were in a rut, they could always feed Jonas in post and he'd get a bucket."
Nah'Shon Lee Hyland = Bones  Steven Funaki Adams = Khal Drogo  Got it. Thanks.
Steven Adams is such a cool dude.
"Steven Adams destroyed Bones.  Bones first died on a adams screen, then got blocked by him twice"
"&gt;The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to trade Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, their 10th and 40th picks in the 2021 NBA Draft and the Lakers 2022 first round pick (top-10 protected) to the Grizzlies for Jonas Valanciunas and Memphis' 17th and 51st picks in the 2021 NBA Draft.  From an article about the trade. Grizz flipped Bledsoe to the Clippers after"
"I like Wood, but it looks like he sets the worst picks in the league. If he could learn that skill from Dray or Steven Adams he would be a monster"
"How Jrue wanted out? Jrue not wanting to go through a rebuild or play with guys 10 years younger than he is? What to do with Steven Adams? The guy played well last year. The mess with hiring SVG? Who didn't vibe with the players because he was too old school and disciplinary like? Not like we haven't seen any problems from Zion with regards to self discipline. That's absolutely ridiculous that you can straight up excuse a 21 year old who is watching his contemporaries pass him up NOT be enthusiastic to be on a basketball court. I call horse shit. Maybe a more ""competent franchise"" can make him take himself more seriously? Complete horse shit."
"Luka isn't even one of the more attractive white guys in the in the NBA.  Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love, Ricky Rubio, Steven Adams, and Chandler Parsons wash him easy."
"To be fair, the Pelicans have been one of the most poorly run teams in the league for quite some time. Most of that predates Zion's arrival there, but he doesn't need to have witnessed it all first hand to know how bad it is. He no doubt heard all the stories about why Chris Paul and Anthony Davis were so eager to leave (as well as other guys, like Eric Gordon), and then he's seen himself how they've handled him along with JJ Redick, how Jrue wanted out, how Lonzo wanted out, the mess with hiring and firing SVG, everything to do with Steven Adams, etc.   You can't really blame Zion for having a lack of enthusiasm for Pelicans basketball. His weight issues may be something which was going to be inevitable anywhere, I don't know, but it's possible that a change of scenery with a competent franchise might motivate him more than he's been in New Orleans. I feel like it's just a matter of time before we find out which it is."
Its been 17 hours and no-one as linked the screen on Pat Bev yet? Its mandatory for any Steven Adams thread.   https://youtu.be/-y3m0te_Tdc
"&gt;**and** also taking on Bledsoe.  Which cost them an additional pick to unload. That makes the ""haul"" certainly less of a haul when you factor that in. Same with how they also used some of those picks to acquire Steven Adams."
"Yeah but they immediately used a couple of those picks to get Steven Adams, which was a waste, and then they had to include more picks to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe. With the Pelicans you shouldn't just look at any one aspect of one trade in a vacuum, you need to look at everything in the aggregate."
Steven Adams and Bledsoe were an insanely good fit next to BI and Ingram huh
Steven Adams is about to start launching 3s
As an honest Oklahoma City Thunder fan I have to admit they were holding Steven Adams back from reaching his full potential
"Steven Adams is a 7 foot, gloriously mustachioed steph curry."
I have Steven Adams in Fantasy; he has shot like 13 total free throws. Give it some time.
I kind of wish the Thunder still had Steven Adams.
"Just like New Zealand is Australia's little brother, Steven Adams is Andrew Bogut's lil bro. Oym a set a moving screen on ya ya cunt"
I legit love Steven Adams screens. They're just things of such raw beauty
"It's because he doesn't play within himself and can be a black hole on offense. And he gets butt hurt when he doesn't get his. He pretty much refused to play for the Cavs when we traded for Allen last year.   Tremendous defensive player. The Cavs were nasty on defense last year with him and LNJ. His problem has always been between the ears.  ETA he is also HORRIBLE at setting screens. One of those guys who is ""too good for it"" apparently. With his body and mobility he should be at Steven Adams' level."
"Steven Adams shot 44% from the line last season, and is shooting at 100% so far this season. Don’t take my comment seriously and tell me that an isolated instance is a fallacy, just thought it was a fun fact that goes against the narrative"
"Steven Adams has already learned what happens when he tries to body up Jokic. Not only does he get backed up anyways, but Jokic loves to spin move off of pressure for easy layups. Adams is doing the best he can"
the script ft. steven adams
try running into steven adams at full speed and reconsider what you said
"&gt; the Warriors mostly played Steven Adams off the floor that game  Steven Adams is one thing, but Gobert, Jokic, Ayton, and AD are another.  The odds the warriors will play one of those 4 teams in the first round of the playoffs is very high.  As their team stands right now, the warriors lose that series, they have no answer for the size on those other teams.  They can compete for a game, perhaps two, but over a seven game series that size will wear them down.    Steven Adams was able to bully the warriors in the paint in the first quarter, and Zubic was able to get his shots in, but neither of them were good enough to truly exploit the warriors biggest weakness.  Jokic, Ayton, Gobert, and AD are more than good enough.  There's no way to advance in the west without dealing with those giants.  The warriors do not have a plan to do that right now.    That's why the drafted Wiseman.  He doesn't need to be great, he just needs to be good enough to tilt the matchup just enough."
"Steven ""Immovable Object"" Adams."
"Both the Yeti and the Apology were up for bags we couldnt give them. And both deserved those bags. The financial cases for trading them are obvious.  Grayson Allen was not much better than Bane offensively. And Bane is better defensively. Bane is also on a rookie deal for 4 years since he was the 30th pick.  JV needed too many touches, touches freed up with Steven Adams. See the Rudy Gay ​trade for Tayshaun Prince. That freed up touches for Zbo, Marc, and Conley. JV was also exposed as a defensive liability in the playoffs. So Steven Adams should give the Grizz what they need."
"Yeah I dunno about all this - the Warriors mostly played Steven Adams off the floor that game.   I do agree we could use another big body to soak up minutes during the regular season, but I’m guessing we’d rather go small against the big teams in the playoffs anyway.   If we’re relying on Wiseman hanging with Jokic in the playoffs, I’d be pretty worried."
"Watch some of the warriors' games this season, it's obvious where Wiseman will play.    The warriors one loss this season, to Memphis, the turnovers were a big issue, Steph being triple teamed in the fourth and no one else being able to step up was a big issue, and Ja Morant being damn good at basketball was a big issue.    However, Steven Adams logging 10 first quarter points by BULLYING the warriors on the interior was a huge issue too.  The warriors struggled against the Lakers' bigs; did you see JTA trying to body AD?  That was ugly.  Zubic got what he wanted when the warriors played the Clippers.    The warriors, right now, have NO answer to big bodied 7 footers.  You know who you have to figure out if you want to win the western conference?  Jokic.  No one can stop him, but you need to slow him down.  Right now, with the warriors defense the way it is, they have zero answer for any of the huge bodied big men on other contenders.  You know who won the west last year?  Phoenix, the warriors have no answer for Dandre Ayton right now.    Wiseman doesn't have to win those matchups for the warriors to be significantly better, he just has to be better than Kevon Looney, whose giving up ridiculous amongst of height and reach to the behemoths of the west.  I love Loons, but he's not built to defend bully-ball centers, he's built to defend the Clint Capellas of the world.  Rudy Gobert, the center for the 5-1 Jazz, is way out of his paygrade.    Wiseman isn't developed enough to stop any of those guys either, but it will be harder to physically out-muscle a true 7 footer in the paint.  He just has to be able to do enough to tilt the outcome of the game a little.  The warriors are good already, it won't take much, but there's no way they are beating a team like Denver or Utah in the playoffs unless Wiseman is can play."
"oh man if only he would actually let our good FO help him out. We have the best shooting coach in the NBA, rebuilt our medical personal, rebuilt every part of our FO. The GM isn't the only member of a Front Office, sorry to break it to you. Not sure if you understand that but just putting it out there.  Oh wow so you're saying he broke his foot by getting fat as fuck in the offseason as revenge for a bad Steven Adams signing? Damn I didn't see that 4d chess coming from Zion. What a mature response from a player, didn't like that trade so I'm gonna injure myself. In this world you made Zion really is a mature reasonable adult.  Or he could... stay in shape... play well... do his best. But no damn that's on the pelicans. Dude is so PISSED that we didn't win CP3 a chip that he keeps injuring himself. Dude's so loyal to a guy who played for the franchise 15 years ago I gotta respect that."
Steven Adams should be Steven Wall.
i’m assuming you mean cause of the salary rules but surely they could’ve used that godawful steven adams contract as filler
"I have over 10 plays where AD does not box out Poetle, Ayton or Steven Adams..."
"Okay, let me play the Ad Hom game with you here LOL  &gt; It’s comical that y’all think players like looney (who sets a shit ton of screens for steph) are getting preferential treatment. Steven Adam’s? Yea he does it. Gobert? Yup him too. That OKC game was ripe with moving screens on both sides. Several times I saw hip checks and asses sticking out forcing players off their line. Same shit everyone does.   SAME SHIT?  lol  Okay, then... where's Steven Adams interview, like we see here from Draymond? And where's Gobert's video, where he's talking like Steph Curry is here?  Exactly.  When you are guilty of being among those players who caused the new rule change, then you look like a fake fool now, if you dare to go talking like Steph and Draymond are talking here. That is the reality which your mental capacity could not grasp here re: what I focused on."
"I’d rather just roll with what we have than trade PJ *and* Kai. Kai obviously isn’t ready to contribute now, but he’s got crazy potential. We’re playing really well this season, but we’re not a Myles Turner away from being a championship contender. Next years the point where I’d feel comfortable trading future assets for win now pieces.   I could maybe be convinced to do a deal around just PJ, but Oubre would basically have to be included to match salaries. I feel like PJ + Oubre + the Pelicans Pick for Turner is a pretty decent offer, especially since Turner has some injury concerns and has been on the trade block for years.  I’d probably prefer to find a smaller trade for a decent enough center though. Ideally we’d want to keep PJ as the backup center. My dream trade was gonna be Oubre + Plumlee for Steven Adams, so that the Grizzlies could clear cap space, but he’s been killing it with them. Another target might be Nerlens Noel, since Mitchell Robinsons has improved a ton this season. Naz Reid would also be a big upgrade over Plumlee. Maybe the Timberwolves would want both McDaniels brothers (and other stuff)?"
The best stat is the team rebounding percentage with and without the person on the floor. Some bigs like Steven Adams impact that a lot without it showing in row numbers
People need to tune in for Memphis vs Denver.  Jokic usually feasts on Steven Adams and I hope he does that today as well.

"Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: The #12 pick in the 2013 draft is one of the most important threads in modern NBA history. That pick originally belonged to the Toronto Raptors. They traded it to Houston in a package to acquire Kyle Lowry.  Houston then sent that pick to OKC in a package to acquire James Harden.  OKC were holding on to that pick and had their eyes firmly set on Steve Adams in the 2013 draft. Meanwhile, Masai Ujiri was making a big run at trying to get that pick back from OKC. The reason: He was desperate to draft Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Had one of the 11 teams picking before OKC nabbed Steven Adams, chances are OKC would have accepted a trade to send that pick back to Toronto, and Giannis would have been a Raptor.  One innocent pick in the middle of the draft got Toronto the greatest raptor of all time in Kyle Lowry, got Houston one of the greatest Rockets of all time in James Harden, and secured Milwaukee one of the greatest Bucks of all time in Giannis Antetokounmpo."
Dude I completely agree. And while we’re on this topic Steven adams was the best point guard in the league last year too.
I’m watching. The Memphis vs Heat game and the ref called a shooting foul on Steven Adams but they challenged it and they were successful as Steven Adams didn’t even touch the person and now the don’t have another opportunity to overturn a referees bad call
"With all these fouls on our bigs, Steven Adams is going to eat us alive on boards and paint points  EDIT: we've got PJ at center, ugly lineup"
"He might actually be the most underrated player in the league. Very Steven Adams-esque, does all the dirty work needed to win."
"He's boxing out for DeJounte Murray who is averaging 8.2 defensive boards, he's doing what Steven Adams did for Westbrook  Anyway they get useless rebounds mostly to pad the stats for star the point guard"
steven adams screens are a force of nature
"&gt;it’s meaningless   I just explained it’s meaning. He gets the ball faster and takes off before the defense can react or close him off.   I also just explained that outlets take skill. Who is throwing these outlets full court to a sprinting Westbrook? Was bertans or gafford on the wizards supposed to throw a full court dime every single play? Was Steven adams an elite passer capable of hitting someone in traffic at a dead sprint? Also what if the defense closes off the passing lane? It’s also a  lot easier to keep someone from getting the ball than it is to stop one of the most explosive players with elite handles in the open court    &gt;it would be much better for his team if he pushed the fast break   He is pushing the fast break. He’s getting the ball and going lmao now you’re contradicting yourself. So you agree fully he should push the pace, and I’ve now explained multiple times why the game plan is for him to get those boards. 4 separate nba  coaches and teams have now taken advantage of Westbrook getting the board and taking off. Maybe there’s a reason various coaches and teams are doing this? Probably because it works?"
Steven Adams.
It’s pretty amusing that Steven Adams wandered back into another Westbrook
"BIG THIS, sure turnovers were prolly the worst factor in this loss but he usually plays curry around 6:30, and the game is a 1-2 possession. Iced his best player smh, but Grizzlies legit tho, steven adams bullied in the paint and Ja Morant is dancing everywhere"
Steven Adams should have gotten more minutes.
Steven Adams really hurt the warriors in that crazy 2016 thunder series.
"why are people always ragging on steven adams, he seems good"
"Steven Adams laying out people on screens, lol."
Wow Kyrie is older than Steven Adams
"Steven Adams is going to bully Looney, I'm calling it right now"
"I’m not that biased, they traded for a worse version of Jason Richardson. It was mind boggling at the time!   How good is Brandon Ingram right now? You wouldn’t think itd be stupid if Luka Doncic was traded for Ingram and Steven Adams right now? Ingram is arguably better than Eric Gordon right now too"
"Ah yes westbrook is so bad as is harden, ibaka, steven adams, reggie Jackson. Lol clown."
Steven Adams is not a star lol
"""Westbrook played 194 minutes in the series’ five games, of which Houston won four. When Westbrook was on the floor (for 39 minutes per game), the Thunder outscored Houston by 4.9 points per 100 possessions. Taj Gibson (plus-13.7) and Steven Adams (plus-7.7) posted even better net ratings when they were on the court.  When Westbrook wasn’t on the court, Oklahoma City was even worse than you probably thought. The Thunder were outscored by 51.3 points per 100 possessions while Westbrook watched from the bench, for a total of 46 minutes during the series. That’s about one full game, scattered throughout five games, of total ineptitude."""

"No he does not  He was great, he did as best as anyone can do carrying a team but many players did and never won MVP with that manyn wins, the narrative switched because he got uncontested rebounds set up by Steven Adams   He gets 2nd or 3rd in voting and that's a pretty great achievement in itself"
That game 7 last year was fine.  Dort had his coming out party and we made some dumb decisions down the stretch (Steven Adams reviewing the inbounds pass 30 feet from the basket on the last possession?!?!?) but we massively exceeded expectations by getting it to 7 anyway
20 isn’t a huge contract anymore. Steven Adams is getting 25
