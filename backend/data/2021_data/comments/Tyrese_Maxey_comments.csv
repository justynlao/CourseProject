"In no particular order it's probably Quickley, the top 3 picks, Haliburton, Desmond Bane has been shooting super well, Pritchard had some great games and should be getting back from his injury soon, Tyrese Maxey was kinda balling when the sixers needed him to step up, Patrick Williams seems solid, and then Precious Achiuwa seems good whenever I see him? Idk I'm probably missing someone, but sure is 10 good rookies"
You dare disrespect the float GOAT Tyrese Maxey?!
Idk about his floater game being better than Tyrese Maxey he doesn’t miss a floater.
Immanuel Quickly still getting disrespected.  Also Tyrese Maxey is the only one basically putting up the same stats on a contender.
Its most definitely Tyrese Maxey
"2020 was the supposed ""quiet"" draft but it's really produced a ton of great rookies  the top 3 all look solid Tyrese Maxey  Immanuel Quickly  Tyrese Haliburton  Payton Pritchard  That's at least 7 solid NBA players with some of them showing star potential. Then there are still dudes like Cole Anthony, Deni Avidja, Desmond Bane. Like 10 players that might make a career is a pretty good draft. It's definitely no 2018 but the potential still has yet to fully reveal itself."
Tyrese Maxey went 21 if you consider that late as well. We got Msttise Thybulle at 20 the year before. Picks are important. George Hill being on a contract next year is a key part of his value though
"Covid, load management account for pretty much all 6. I mean you watched that game probably. It was Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, and G leaguers out there. No point in risking injury"
What Tyrese Maxey gotta do to get some love around here
"The top 3 guys look like they could be all stars. Anthony Edwards has been unsurprisingly inefficient from long distance but he's a great finisher that has the tools to also be a good defender. James Wiseman is already one of the most fluid 7 footers I've seen. Lamelo is a great passer already and seems to be gaining confidence as a scorer.  Tyrese Haliburton is great, too. The guy has so much poise for a rookie.  Okoro looks like a good defensive player already. Not the type of guy who gives you flashy defensive highlights but the guy who can contain scorers for long stretches.  PWill was definitely a project coming into the draft but he looks already like an NBA starter Sometimes he goes a little mental, though, and shoots ill advised contested middies. Quickley and Maxey deserve a shout out too because of surpassing expectations."
first: IQ Tyrese Hali Wiseman(ROY) Lamelo Pat Will  Second:  Devin Vassell Desmond Bane Tyrese Maxey Cole Anthony Xavier Tillman  Just missed: Payton Pritchard(would be in it if he wasn’t hurt) Precious Achiuwa Ant Edwards Saddiq Bey Isaiah Stewart Mason Jones
Don’t worry dude they have Tyrese Maxey!!!!

"Every time Tyrese Maxey scores in a Sixers home game they should play an audio bite from the Goofy Movie where Goofy yells ""Maxie"""
Every time I see Tyrese Maxey I get frustrated at 2k’s terrible version of him
"Now he has Ben, Joel, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey"
Tyrese Maxey and Seth curry
"Trade Lavine for Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton and the Sixers first has entered the chat."
The Tyrese Maxey and Isaiah Joe show will be lit in a couple years.
Tyrese Maxey came to play today 💪🏻💪🏻  0 points 😎😎🤡🤡  2 Assists 🙀🙀  2 Rebounds 😤😤  2 Fouls 😡😡  0 Blocks 🤔🤔  0 Steals 🤪🤪  0/4 FGA 😈😈  0/1 From 3 👌👌  Rookie of the year? 💀💀💀💀
Tyrese Maxey and Tilman Fertitta’s fragile ego are the reasons this team exists
"1. Tyrese Maxey 2. Tyrese Maxey 3. Tyrese Maxey’s Hair 4. Tyrese Maxey’s Smile 5. Tyrese Maxey’s Dogged Enthusiasm 6. Luka 7. Tyrese Maxey 8. Tyrese Maxey 9. Ja ‘not Tyrese Maxey’ Morant 10. Zion ‘not Tyrese Maxey, but Fatter’ Williamson."
I'll take one Tyrese Maxey please
"Tyrese Maxey is a fun, quick guard who has some crafty moves to get to the basket. Doesn't draw many fouls as a result, though. His three point shot is inconsistent but at least he takes them. He's small but tries hard on defense and has been navigating screens well. He also works hard and genuinely seems to want to be in Philly. I'm just worried for him that he'll be compared to Harden for the rest of his career because the trade never went through.   Isaiah Joe's shot definitely translated from college, he just needs to put on more weight. Despite this, he's another guy who tries hard on D. Korkmaz should take back his spot in the rotation but since he's an expiring contract, I don't think we've seen the last of Joe.   B-ball Paul Reed still has to get it out of the mud. Other than in games where the Sixers are forced to have a 7 man rotation, he's usually only in for garbage time. He fights hard for rebounds and has a nice skyhook but is obviously still kinda raw. Hopefully he can get some more seasoning when the Blue Coats start back up."
"I Kinda doubt this since ""league sources"" is often just a way to cover your ass or like its some other team trying to cause friction with Ben Simmons and the 76ers FO. That being said, IDK if I do that deal anyway.   One thing is Ben Simmons is locked up til 2025-2026, Harden is this year/next year and he's got a player option for 2022-2023 which he'll definitely take to get his last max. That gives you this year, next year, and after that Harden can go wherever he likes.   Then the question of ""are you the best team in the E if you do this trade""? With the Nets is at least starting lineup wise pretty clear cut, with the 76ers losing Simmons gaining Harden is a definite plus but its still pretty competitive.   What can you get for 3 picks + Tyrese Maxey in the league currently (that you can afford?) What if you throw in Harris? Is keeping Simmons + whatever you can get for TMax/3picks better or worse than 1.7 seasons of Harden?  The biggest reason to do the trade was to avoid having the Nets get ridiculous, but I think there are a few interesting cards for 76ers to play anyway and Morey's not exactly bad at playing them."
"You can enjoy it, but you can also admit that not trading for a player that is at a BARE MINIMUM Top 8 in the sport because of Tyrese Maxey, was foolishness.  James Harden averaged 29/5/7 on 66% TS against LeBron and AD's Lakers last year, he did that while getting doubled in literally every possession because his co-star couldn't hit a shot outside of 10 ft. You don't miss on a talent like that because of fun/chemistry."
"Yeah I agree they are tough decisions. Framing it as ""morey didnt trade for harden because of Tyrese Maxey"" is not really accurate because you do have to draw a line somewhere, trading every asset you have is not a viable strategy. If he put maxey in then it would be another pick or shake or something."
Right but 5-7 years from now? If those firsts turn into players like tyrese maxey then the trade was a bust. I’m saying the nets are most certainly not hoping for players of maxeys caliber in 5-7 years with those picks. But yeah I misread my bad. The early picks fine. But there’s definitely an argument the later picks they hope to get someone better than Simmons. Like if they got what the Celtics got with the jays then the trade is a success and that’s not a bad gamble at all. Especially if you don’t think Simmons is gonna improve much.
No the nets are not hoping their future firsts from bkn end up as players like tyrese maxey. That would mean the trade was a bust.
"Most people thought that Simmons for harden was the trade even tho harden wanted Brooklyn.  I think the 76ers will regret not trading for harden even tho their team has improved from a year ago with doc, Seth curry, Danny green and tyrese maxey."
"""So based on the fact that only Malik Monk and James Young are really the only busts on this list the way Keldon Johnson, Tyrese Maxey and Immanuel Quickley are playing you pretty much have a 12/14 chance of drafting a high level rotation player or better you draft a Kentucky guard I have figured out.""   Yup. Thats how statistics work."
Harden would've been in Philly if you guys included Maxey lmao. Imagine not trading for Harden because of Tyrese fuckin Maxey 😬
"&gt; it was reported that the Sixers offered a package centered on Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and draft compensation, but would not go so far as to include rookie Tyrese Maxey, whom Houston wanted.   Though, it does go onto say that the more believable theory is that Tillman refused to trade with Morey. So, I suppose it’s just all hearsay at this point."
I’d like to see Lou back in Philly but I doubt they need to pull that trade given Tyrese Maxey can grow into a similar role
"I don’t think the Sixers trade Simmons for anyone who’s not a Harden or Beal level player and as great as Lavine is he’s not that. Also, parting ways with Tyrese Maxey might start some riots"
"&gt;  so how exactly were we overvaluing them when the rockets thought the same thing just tilman said nah because we have morey?  Oh the problem here is that you're so sure this is what happened  Are you one of those people who only read the title of [this reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ky490f/pompey_the_sixers_thought_they_had_a_deal_for/)?  Because this is the content of that Pompey article:  Title: &gt;Did the Houston Rockets use the Sixers to secure the Brooklyn Nets’ best deal for James Harden?  Content:  &gt;After analyzing the information surrounding the Harden trade, yes, the Rockets did play the Sixers.  &gt;Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta did not want to make a deal with the Sixers due to Morey leaving Houston to become the Sixers president of basketball operations, as reported. And if he made a deal, Fertitta was only going to make it for Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal.   The last sentence is hilarious. Reminds me of the fans that are hesitant at the thought of giving up Maxey too to get ""a guy who insists the game revolves around him and has never put it together in the playoffs"", as one sixers fan put it."
"Tyrese ""He had a dozen or so good games as a rookie so we gotta overreact and hold onto him"" Maxey"
Tyrese Maxey took the final shot and he's a PG
"Fucking hell, I can’t believe we didn’t trade for James fucking Harden because of Tyrese Maxey"
Reminder the sixers chose Tyrese Maxey over James Harden
Yeah but is he better than Tyrese Maxey?!?

"Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks sounds reasonable.  Curry, Green, Harden, Tobi, Embiid with Shake, Kork, Scott, Dwight is still pretty good. They could probably find some defensive wings or four."
"The article leaves some room for the Rockets making the trade.   “And if he made a deal, Fertitta was only going to make it for Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal.”"
&gt; Tyrese and Shake  I prefer Maxey Milton
Mabye because they are some of the best scorers in the NBA. Nobody is calling Tyrese Maxey one of the best scorers in the NBA. Scoring 37 points on upwards of 50 percent shooting from the field is still very good.
I understand why they're doing this but I don't want to watch Tyrese Maxey vs Dante Exum.   Sorry.
Congratulations to Tyrese Maxey for playing more games than the 3 people below him lol
Why are you bringing up the kings? I think he was talking about tyrese maxey
"Sounds like a sound strategy, a list of UK players who have flashed or are showing flashes of being great in the past 5 years.

Tyrese maxey will just have to settle for ROY as a consolation prize
Only if the Hornets also want Tyrese Maxey
Why did Tyrese Maxey fall to the Sixers again??
Tyrese Maxey
ROTY Tyrese Maxey
One Tyrese Maxey please
"I was gonna make a thread....lol @ Tyrese Maxey being the difference between challenging for a title vs having a team that will never be able to win your own division.   My goodness Philly. If separation anxiety was a basketball team.   And I’m not even a Harden fan. But the minute it became clear the only other suitor was Brooklyn, you have to make that trade. Ben Simmons just had 5 points in a game full of G leaguers. You make that trade. You’re trading for not only harden but you’re also trading for ‘not to have harden in Brooklyn’."
Well said. Tyrese is a 20 year old overflowing with confidence and all-star potential  I was okay with Ben + Tisse + picks   I was not okay with Ben + Tisse + Maxey + picks *at all*
Sixers really missed out on harden because they wanted to keep Tyrese Maxey
you put kyrie over tyrese maxey?? smh
"He’s saying, “Imagine what the reaction would be if Ainge didn’t pull the trigger on a trade for a player of Harden’s caliber because he didn’t want to give up a player like Tyrese Maxey (no disrespect to Maxey, kid looks legit)"
Was Tyrese Maxey really worth not getting James Harden?
"Yeah I'm thinking we got fleeced. Everyone they draft with those picks will most likely be ass. I can't believe the 76ers couldn't throw in Tyrese Maxey to solidify the deal, insane."
You didn't want to throw in fucking Tyrese Maxey and now your championship window just got flushed down the toilet. Enjoy your perennial first and second round exits.
They're hoping to draft the next Tyrese Maxey with those mid-20s picks.
Philly fumbles the bag over Tyrese Maxey lmao. Poverty franchise.
Morey gave up a ring for TYRESE MAXEY?
"According to the reports, the Nets are willing to include anyone but Durant while the Sixers are trying to keep Tyrese Maxey out of the deal. Nets are trying to go all-in but the Sixers have more chips to play with."
Bro wtf u mean this is TYRESE MAXEY we’re talking about we gotta pull the trigger
"Yea why would anyone want to trade for a former MVP in his prime coming off like 3 seasons straight averaging 35+ a game. Better to keep the young guys like Caris LeVert and Tyrese Maxey, they might get a whole all-star vote or 2 once in their careers LMFAO"
But it’s up to Houston. They have James Harden. If philly lets tyrese maxey be the dealbreaker their fans will shot on them.
1) Tyrese Maxey
"You will get Simmons, Thybulle, and a plethora of picks and you will like it, damn it! Stay away from Float God, Tyrese Maxey"
If the sixers miss out on harden because of Tyrese Maxey that'd be fuckin hilarious
Someone in this thread said they'd rather give up 3 FRPs than fucking Tyrese Maxey.  Fans get way too attached to their young players.
"No chance you can give up rookie Tyrese Maxey cause of 35 year old expiring PJ Tucker man, that's fucking crazy.   It's way easier to find a wing guy thats decent than one Maxey"
"If Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey are included, I’m not sure there’s a better deal out there."
Tyrese Maxey is literally James Harden
Sixers fans really gonna squabble over Tyrese Maxey with an MVP on the table?  How greedy can you be?
He’s always turned the ball over a lot. He’s a little too obsessed with being a distributor rather than using his top tier athletic ability to score the basketball. He needs lessons from Tyrese Maxey.
One Tyrese Maxey please
You’re seriously complaining about giving up *Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey* in a trade for James Harden? Seriously?
"Except Simmons is NOT a star and he proves that with each passing year.  Let's be real, the only reason people think he's a star is due to him being the Number 1 Overall Pick.  If he were drafted in the late first round I feel people would look at him for what he is.  A solid role player who is great at defending a multitude of players and running the fast break, but is nowhere near a build-around piece.  Tyrese Maxey has a much bigger chance of being a true build-around player despite being drafted later.  Houston should accept nothing less from Philly than Maxey/Shake/Thybulle and at least 4 picks.  Picks are indeed gambles but they can still make use of them, especially since the Rockets effectively have no way to properly rebuild their team otherwise.  Even if the picks don't turn out to be all-stars proper drafting will still give the Rockets a decent foundation of role players to work with.  Trying to take Simmons who right now has an overinflated ""worth"" would be a net negative for Houston."
"Kyle Lowry, Matt Thomas, McCaw for Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Tyrese Maxey"
"poor mans tyrese maxey, donovan mitchell was on fire"
"&gt;Tyrese Maxey isn't an unearthed precious mineral recovered from the depths of the earth, needing hours and hours of intense labor and hundreds of degree of heat to take form and value. He is a cracked-screen industry-setting next generation phone released 5 years early, akin to an iPhone 6 in 2011. The shards have their bite and it's uncomfortable to use but the daybreak of a new era is only a tempered sheet of glass away. That screen, that window or barrier to the greatest works of humanities brightest minds is a corrected his hip sway. It throws his jumper off and leads to inefficient numbers. The Kentucky coaches helped him keep his feet together. I don't see how the Sixers' shooting coaches could be a downgrade."

"Both teams are losing key starters, there shouldn't be any conclusions here aside from fuck the refs for hating Tyrese Maxey."
Tyrese Maxey posted on snap that the last few days he’s been having the time of his life... so you may be right!
Look. There are always going to be the rare cases of true late bloomers who looked like total shit out of the gate and then came around.   But people for the sake of being nice too often don't call it like they see it. Killian didn't just look bad. He looked atrocious.   I see Tyrese. I see Maxey. I see Deni. I see Wiseman. I see guys who can play. These are guys with tangible ability right out of the gate to play in this league.
Tyrese Maxey really reminds of De'aaron Fox in so many ways. Explosive speed good floater.
Are we gonna trade him for another Tyrese Maxey?
"I think my all rookie team right now would be Ball, Halliburton, Deni, Patrick, Wiseman  Tyrese Maxey is making a real case for himself though. If not G/G/F/F/C then he replaces Deni"
Tyrese Maxey though  The only positive from making the sixers play (fuck adam silver) is his development
they only have legit NBA ball handler available and that's rookie Tyrese Maxey. They're even playing diwght and Embiid at the same time cause 3 of their 9 available players are centers lol
Tyrese Maxey dropped 38 pts a few days ago.
But the Seven Sixers had to play tyrese maxey as their best player? Huh?
I promise you those 7 players who are playing aren’t complaining especially not Tyrese Maxey lol stfu Embiid
At least they had the chance to discover that Tyrese Maxey is a stud.
Tyrese Maxey is a higher IQ Terence Davis at the current moment.
"At least throw Zubac in there. He’d actually be valuable to the Raptors, just not as valuable as Tyrese Maxey 👀"
"Zubac isn’t a star or anything but if he can’t be the centre piece of a Lowry trade what makes you think Tyrese Maxey or Precious can? Like I’d agree with you if Lowry were still 30 because his impact is obviously greater than either of them by a large margin, but the fact that he’s 35 this year and expiring lowers his value."
"Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, and a 1st"
"Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Top 20 Protected 1st"
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he’s taken some spectacular leaps)  I’d say the last few years we’ve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I’d say we’ve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"It sounds good for the 76ers but now that the raptors are good again, how does this help them? What do they get for him, Tyrese maxey and picks? Shouldn’t they be trying to win"
I can’t remember the last time I saw a Knicks fan talk about Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey, not Maxi Kleber"
Tyrese Maxey
"Never heard of him. What team is he on? On a similar note, is he related to Tyrese Maxey?"
"Tyrese Maxey (born November 4, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats."
"Yes 76ers are definitely winning because of Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle. Yall are winning because of your best players, which you won't give up, so the record is irrelevant. I suppose Nets have a lot of assets to give up too by that logic"
"He's from Philly, if he's asking to be traded here there will be an understanding he'll re-sign. Tyrese Maxey is a bit of a project and Joel Embiid is a superstar in his prime. Timetable matters here."
"Sixers Legend Kyle Lowry, welcome  Raptors All-Star Tyrese Maxey, take care"
"Like Danny Green and Tyrese Maxey?  I'm not saying he'd be a godsend and the fact his dad is the coach factors in, but we could use another ball handler next to Shake and Curry in certain lineups."
"shake milton, tyrese maxey, and seth curry all take minutes at the 1-2"
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
"&gt;Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he’s playing just isn’t logical. He’s in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  Except what happens when someone offers him 20 mill, you willing to match that? Because I'm still not, as much as I love Fred, Norm, OG and Siakam, that core taking up pretty much the entire cap is not a recipe for a championship.  &gt;We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  Except we do, everyone saw the Woj tweet and were like ""see he didn't do anything wrong"" but he actually had a plea deal to drop the charges, he still very likely did what he was charged with.  &gt;Even then we’re comparing two players who don’t necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  wtf? You are way overrating Zubac man, come on. He can play decent interior defense and catch lobs, that's it, Maxey is a rookie who has shown flashes of shot creation, which is hard to find in the league.  &gt;The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  Where? I gave you a ton of options that give you what Zubac can do, most of them would be cheap, a player that young and showing promise like him is not cheap, that's literally why they were so hesitant to trade him for fucking James Harden.  &gt;The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Schroeder I'll give you, except he'll most likely get 15 mill, Lonzo is an RFA, you are going to overpay to get him, Graham too, but go off.  &gt; trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird.  dude, like I said, you are overrating the shit out of Zubac, one of these players was the breaking point of a Harden trade, one of these players was dumped for no reason, which one is more valuable/talented? Idk you tell me"
"&gt;it's almost like Norm might be gone next season, and would not be surprised if we just don't bring TD back.  Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he’s playing just isn’t logical. He’s in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  &gt;I was specifically talking about a Lowry trade, give me talent over fit 100%, we are not in win now mode, especially if we are trading Lowry, missing out on Maxey + a first most likely just because Zubac is a center would be the worst thing you could do.   Even then we’re comparing two players who don’t necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  &gt;You can find exactly what Zubac does in the 2nd round of a draft.   The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  &gt;You could go pick up Holmes as a FA. You can just take the salary filler that you get from a Lowry to Sixers trade and go get Mo Bamba or Birch, or Whiteside.  The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Lmao @ Whiteside.  I get our fanbase has a weirdo hate boner for the Clippers because you think they “stole” our players, but taking worse fitting packages and trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird."
Neither is Tyrese Maxey in a vacuum. If our goal is winning this season we wouldn’t make either of those trades. If our goal is building for the next season around FVV/Norm/OG/Siakam then Zubac is a better option than Maxey.
Giving up Tyrese Maxey was too much!
Worse. They were fine with losing Simmons. It was because the Rockets wanted Tyrese Maxey too.
"You don't understand, man. The Rockets wanted Tyrese Maxey. There's no way the Sixers could part with him for a fat washed James Harden."
Y’all gonna give up fucking Tyrese Maxey for him or nah?
"How does Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green and like 5 late firsts sound?  Irresistible, I know"
And that’ll be the end of Tyrese Maxey backup PG minutes for quite a while
Sixers didn’t want to give up Tyrese Maxey!!!!!
Tyrese Maxey: 4 time league MVP  Isaiah Joe: 4 time All-Star.
giving up Tyrese Maxey was too much!
Mfs didn't wanna include Tyrese Maxey to get this guy 💀
all because y’all wanted tyrese fucking maxey
Look at Tyrese Maxey that man is happy as a puppy when he is playing
Make that Tyrese Maxey instead of Thybulle and the Sixers can keep their 2nd rounders.
"My guy you apparently want Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Mike Scott and picks for Kyle Lowry on an expiring with the hope that he will take a discount to resign.   You can take that nonsense elsewhere."
"Of course, I don't know anything beyond the reports, but what I said is the most likely outcome. ***No one*** **exactly knows anything beyond reports outside of the people directly involved in the talks, which is a couple people from the Sixers &amp; Rockets**, so of course all these talks are speculative.  My tone is admittingly arrogant, but it's due to all the disrespect of Harden (and all superstars) I always see from fans &amp; even front offices who genuinely believe the average role players they have are worth more than taking the risk for a superstar like Harden. It's not even mainly Sixers fans; Heat fans were even worse.  If Sixers fans are so sure I'm wrong, then correct me. **What part of the story am I off of?** Do you *really* believe Tillman, despite how shitty he is as an owner, wouldn't have done business with Morey even if Morey handed over the whole Sixers team for free? Or is this is a coping mechanism with the realization that you guys propped up Tyrese Maxey so much he wasn't worth adding into the offer for Harden?"
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
Does Tyrese Maxey live in a maxeypad?
"Anybody who thinks this is controversial should watch just one Sixers game without Ben Simmons. Obviously Kyrie is a lot better than Shake Milton or Tyrese Maxey, but the team looks so unbelievably lost without Simmons out there for 30+ minutes every night. Offensively and defensively, Simmons *is* the Sixers.   I know every fan base overrates their guys, I'm guilty of it myself, but with Simmons, I really think more people ought to watch full Sixers games and they'd appreciate just how impactful he is on both ends of the floor."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"Could have had it too, but Tyrese Maxey and the Rockets owner's pettiness stood in their way"
"due to the construction of our team and the lack of any traditional point guards Ben is still more important than Tobias.  No one else on the team can handle the ball or playmake, our 2nd best point guard is Tyrese Maxey who is like 19 and barely plays because Doc hates young players."
Y'all really let Tyrese Maxey be the reason you didn't get James Harden lmfao. Wild
"Doesn’t the fact that you’re using one guys lack of minutes played as an excuse for why he has shown literally nothing in his career and defending a 6 foot rookie who will get run off the gym in the playoffs kind of make my point for me? Like comparing that to the sixers main guards off the bench of shake Milton, Thybulle and George hill whenever he gets here is a stark contrast. Like tyrese maxey and Isaiah joe aren’t even in the rotation and they’ve both shown more than Langford as rookies"
76ers didn’t want to let go of fucking tyrese maxey cause he scored 40 3 days prior
Tyrese maxey but they both kinda suck
Wait until you find out that Tyrese Maxey was the deal-breaker.
"That's because Harden didn't fit team culture or just wasn't a good player, not as good as Tyler Herro or Tyrese Maxey that's for sure. And there's only one ball so clearly Harden would wreck their team's chemistry. He might even trick the clean young naive rookies into becoming regular strip club patrons, and who knows the catastrophe that would bring.   But Aldridge, he's clean and wholesome. He's an upstanding, morally upright Christian man. I guess idk. Just trying to give you some ideas why."
Philly shut their own title window shut the moment they decided to keep Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey over James Harden and let him get traded to their biggest competition.
"Doc is amazing at handling his stars so Harris doing better is no surprise to me. The most credit for your current season however goes to Morey who bought in Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey. Also, Dwight and of course the GOAT Danny Green.  Also, Embiid was a different beast than any other year, he personally elevated his game a bunch and i dont know how much credit Doc gets there."

"Close game, if the Sixers had Harden it would've been Sixers blowing out Nuggets.  But it makes sense now that they didn't because they would have to give up leading scorer Tyrese Maxey which isn't worth it."
"Speaking from experience as a Sixers fan(I went thru the entire process getting my hopes up about pretty much every player) you have to take their performances on a bad team with a grain of salt.   MCW was rookie of the year on our terrible team, remember? I haven’t seen a ton of tate, but my assumption is that if he plays on a borderline playoff team even, his minutes are cut significantly(as it would be with pretty much any rookie, see Tyrese Maxey) and therefore his stats/impact aren’t as big.   Players overachieve on bad teams is the memo here. I did vote Wood for all star several times being he’s a great story(and a former sixer), but I think that’s about where he maxes out, seeing that even a big like AD needs the best player in the world to succeed.   When it comes to KPJ, he is a pure scorer. How many pure scorers are all-NBA players? Mitchell(hasn’t even made one yet), Beal and that’s about it. I do like the guys but just temper your expectations, hope it works out for the best for y’all though.   Still fuck Fertita from my side lol"
"Tyrese ""[future MVP](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349453856569253889), [refused to trade for Harden](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1349519348747145222)"" Maxey"
"&gt;Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.  And what were Philly ACTUALLY willing to give up?"
"Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.     So let's say you removed Maxey and Thybulle and even a 1st rounder, the Raptors should've done it. Green could've been flipped or even ride out the rest of the season since he's a free agent anyways.     Instead the team will walk away with absolutely nothing to show for Lowry staying with the team for the rest of the season."
"Lol you’re just mad i’m right.  News Flash: Raps are 11th in the conference, so continue adding to my point that they should have dealt there players for young assets, and begin the new era (all while still in 2nd place) completely and fully knowing that there was no chance at a repeat in the first place, LMFAO.  Get young assets in playoff situations early in their career with an already blossoming young squad is the dream. Not holding onto Vets and watching them leave for zilch.  Are you seriously gonna attempt to even justify that you would rather watch Kyle Lowry walk, instead of having Tyrese Maxey ? Duncan Robinson ?  Holy Moly"
Would you take a package centered around Tyrese Maxey and a first?
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I’m not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
Tyrese Maxey😤
"At least that makes more sense than Tyrese Maxey or Tyler Herro being ""too much""."
It's Daryl's fault. He made a team in his conference a powerhouse because of fucking Tyrese Maxey.
"Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, Tony Bradley and 2 firsts and two swaps"
"Weird that Lowry is on the trading block given how much he means to the org and fans.  While Bosh, TMac, Carter, Kawhi or others may have had a higher peak nobody contributed more to the Raptors winning games over their careers.  Then you see these piss-ant reported trade packages headlined by Will Barton or Tyrese Maxey or Donte DiVincenzo and maybe it makes me wonder how little it's worth to Toronto to keep Lowry around in the middle of a playoff hunt."
"Just Tyrese Maxey, Anthony Tolliver, and Isaiah Joe playing in the second quarter of our potential 1 seed clincher. As we all expected to start the season"
Tyrese Maxey.
Tyrese Maxey in the city jerseys is basically AI.
Im sorry Thybulle was the hold up for Lowry while fucking Tyrese Maxey was the hold up for Harden lmao
"We’re not the best but I’m honestly just happy that we’re in the conversation now after years of having the most painful bench in the planet.   Shakes become a legitimately good 6 man when he’s put in an offball situation.   George Hill plays exactly how you want a bench Pg to play.   Thybulle is as elite as it gets on defense and should be on the 2nd team for All Defense.   Korkmaz seems to have finally figured it out with a bit more consistency and can catch fire from deep while also handling the ball surprisingly well recently.   Dwight is having a historically good rebounding season by minutes played. Has finally been the guy who can somewhat hold down the fort when Embiid is out.   Tyrese Maxey isn’t needed for big minutes, but when the game gets sluggish, his pace of play has provided some awesome moments.   Tolliver can be a body when needed. Wont bring much to the table but won’t actively hurt the team.   Scott sadly has taken a step back and seems to be cooked.   Paul Reed was Gleague ROTY and MVP and has been electric in garbage time lol  And Isaiah Joe’s shot has translated and should be ready to take on more minutes next year assuming Korkmaz leaves for more money.   Combo of smart signings, trades and draft picks have given us our first legitimate + bench in a very long time"

"I don't see him going 8, but I believe he'll be one of the top players out of this draft. He showed star potential in highschool, had a mediocre college season, and will slip in the draft, but eventually show he belonged near the top. Similar to Tyrese Maxey, great highschool career, decent showing at Kentucky, went late in the first round, and is showing he should've gone top ten."
Any sources on this? Do you really think Tyrese Maxey was the missing piece that Morey wouldn't attach to a Harden trade?
"Multiple firsts were needed from Philadelphia who offered Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green and Mike Scott, Toronto held out and demanded multiple firsts. Lakers couldn’t have put together a package that Toronto would’ve found acceptable"
Our offense is pretty  balanced after Joel and Tobi  Ben Simmons - 14.6 ppg  Shake Milton - 13.3 ppg  Seth Curry- 12.2 ppg  George Hill - 10 ppg  Furkan Korkmaz - 9.6 ppg   Danny Green - 9.5 ppg  Tyrese Maxey - 7.5 ppg
"It’s definitely possible he could develop into that. Im just saying that the player that Tyrese Maxey is right now is not exactly what they were looking for to complement Simmons and Embiid. Honestly, he is kind of the opposite of what they’re looking for."
Tyrese maxey is a walking DNP-CD.  He has about as much star potential that the Flynn dude on Toronto has.  Nobody is trading an all star for that lmao.
Tyrese Maxey isn’t scraps. Dude has real potential to be a star one day  Plus Masai apparently had a team lined up to flip Danny Green immediately
Marc Stein reported you guys pulled out because of fucking Tyrese Maxey [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2021/01/14/philadelphia-76ers-were-wise-to-pull-out-of-james-harden-trade-talks/?sh=4ee4c2eb2c7a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2021/01/14/philadelphia-76ers-were-wise-to-pull-out-of-james-harden-trade-talks/?sh=4ee4c2eb2c7a)
who the fuck is tyrese maxey  i look him up on basketball reference and it's some dnp-cd magnet with 51ts% and -3bpm  must be someone else?
Wouldn’t be that shocked. All it takes against us sometimes is for a couple of random guys like Mike Scott or Tyrese Maxey to catch fire from 3.
"and he’ll get that by bullying tyrese maxey? lmao he needs a jumper, not confidence"
"Still pisses me off that we lost that game vs Golden State because Doc trusted Matisse at the start to guard Curry then after Curry made 2 3’s he didn’t guard him again all night. Seth, Danny Green, freshly-returned Hill and Tyrese Maxey all did worse. Not to mention Curry gets so many 3s off just out of your fingers with his quick release, Matisse would have been much better."
If we are talking floaters. Tyrese Maxey can only score floaters.
"Sure, Steph Curry is amazing. Doesn't excuse the Sixers. Played like ass, and they're only in this because Tyrese Maxey tried to wake the team up."
is tyrese maxey the fucking goat???
Lets not forget that loss to the nuggets the sixers had with that loaded roster led by Tyrese Maxey
Don’t forget Tyrese Maxey
THT been averaging 13/4/4 since March   THT&gt; Tyrese Maxey
I think the Sixers should start Tyrese Maxey too  - Totally not a Nets fan
"tyrese maxey, matisse thybulle, ben simmons, and multiple first round picks is pretty ridiculous compared to what they ended up getting."
They don't get their pick this year if it's outside top 3. They won't go far with Ben as their best player but they won't be bad enough to land a top 3 pick. That's the worst. Let's wait what pick they get this year before judging.  &gt; Fertitta had a deal in place for Simmons and then called back for a ridiculous price just to be petty and fucked over his entire fanbase.  I wouldn't call Tyrese Maxey a ridiculous price.
"Spanked? Should've given up Maxey buddy, the second we got Harden is the second you guys have no shot at making it out of the East. Imagine allowing Tyrese Maxey be the reason you let the already loaded Brooklyn Nets get James Harden lmfao"
Lmao Morey literally missed out on Harden because of Tyrese Maxey. Don't talk any shit
Even if Lowry walks for free I don’t think Masai loses any sleep over not taking the Philly deal which was basically one super late pick and tyrese maxey.  Maxey is a good player but finding and developing role players like him is probably the single thing Toronto does best so I don’t really think they value him that highly.
It wasnt worth giving up late first round picks and tyrese maxey /s
There was also a poll on Twitter on a Heat fan account and like 51% didn't want to trade Tyler Herro for James fucking Harden lol. Also i remember looking at the Sixers sub back then and most people were fine with trading only Ben Simmons for Harden but pretty much everyone disagreed if Tyrese Maxey or Shake Milton was included lol

Tyrese maxey if he gets the opportunity
Tyrese Maxey
Her name is Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese Maxey happened
It won’t matter because it is not possible to lock up Tyrese Maxey
Wrong team. Did you mean tyrese maxey lol
Why would they sit Tyrese Maxey?
Actually that was just Ben and Tyrese Maxey.
"Tyrese Maxey is someone I've been a massive fan of since college, and he's shown a lot of potential since getting drafted. I really think he could blossom into one of the best guards in the league, and I think Philly's a great organization to develop him."
Terance Mann and Tyrese Maxey gotta be related
Not convinced Terrence Mann and tyrese maxey aren’t the same person
Tyrese Maxey is horrible tbh
The Hawks are just raining threes here but imagine your second best player taking fewer shots than Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey in a playoff game lmao
Midway through the season Tyrese Maxey wasn't getting regular playing time. He's a very good rookie player right now.
Tyrese Maxey
"Idk that's what Celtics fans say about deals that don't fall through, at some point you realize it's posturing from the front office to make them look better. Probably the same case for the Sixers as well.   Most people were reporting that you guys didn't want to include Maxey in the trade, which is crazy. And it looks like Tilman valued having more picks compared to players. If you guys had thrown in more picks I think Harden would be in Philly.   &gt;Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle were even informed by their agents on Wednesday of a potential trade, according to sources. A league source said the Sixers were going to send Simmons and Thybulle to the Houston Rockets in exchange for the three-time scoring champion. Houston also asked for Tyrese Maxey and draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal."
"I think you need to attend to the definitions of these terms that people provide. You've taken ""replacement level"" to basically mean ""unplayable"". That is *not* what the makers of BPM used the term to mean.  [From their explanation](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html)  &gt;-2.0 is a bench player (this is also defined as ""replacement level"")  AKA they are saying that a very good g-league player/overseas player is capable of stepping into the role of the average player that comes off the bench and sees minutes. -2 also serves as a CUT OFF, with everything below that falling into a replacement level group. Replacement does *not* mean unplayable, and they demonstrate that by saying:  &gt;Below -2.0 are many end-of-bench players  AKA NBA teams all have a few of these players and they're typically the benchwarmers.   &gt;Zero wins doesn't mean that a player isn't hurting a team -- it means that they're a substantially liability when they're on the floor  Based on what? [Read how wins are estimated and calculated](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html). A player that does not get a share of the win does not mean the player hurt the team. That's what negative win shares are for. Because again, it would make no sense statistically or practically to assume that all players coming off the bench are hurting their team. If only we had a word that could communicate when something isn't significantly impacting something in one way or another....oh yea...neutral.  &gt;if the worst guys in the league who sometimes see minutes by necessity are neutral,  But as BPM states,  what you've described here is the replacement level group that falls below their replacement level cut off. You're assuming players *at the cut-off* should be described with everyone in the group. This isn't the case. It's why players at the cut-off are assigned neutral cumulative value AND why the person who helped to identify a replacement level group in the NBA identified that the players at the margins are always the issue. It is not meant to be a sharp cut-off at which players at the level contribute no value, and the author struggled with this because several players that were clearly contributors were falling into his replacement level group at the margin.   Because of this, a replacement level player, especially AT the cut-off, is capable of contributing to an NBA bench according to BPM. What you're confusing is the cut-off with end-of-bench level/deep into the replacement level group. Those players have *negative* wins added because they are *detrimental* to a team.   Replacement, especially at the cut-off, doesn't mean *this player shouldn't be in the league*. [Again, the person the cite for their discussion on replacement level  just did it by taking an arbitrary group of bench players are declaring them replacement and then played with the numbers post-hoc until he identified an acceptable group](http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/what-is-a-replacement-level-nba-player). Replacement is a concept taken from baseball used to assign the relative impact of a presumed player, in this case from the g-league. So statistically we know that replacement isn't set at the ""this player shouldn't be in the league"" or ""this player is actively hurting the team"" but rather ""another professional player could likely contribute this for the league minimum"". Which is why *I said* considering his role (bench) and salary (minimum), his impact was neutral at worst. That's *just* going off the impact and ignoring [chemistry](http://philipmaymin.com/papers/Maymin%20Maymin%20and%20Shen%20-%20NBA%20Chemistry%20-%20IJCSS.pdf), which dictates *why* the majority of teams will still have young guys and/or veterans that seem to be at replacement level in their rotation even during the playoffs.     It's because of this we can do a real world test and see most of the playoff teams have/had a player at that cut-off that is a part of their rotation: Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Solomon Hill, P.J. Tucker,  etc.   &gt;You should just name names for ""many of them"" because there are only five reputable all-in-ones, being generous to RPM, and they disagree about how to turn plus-minus into wins even though they're all designed to approximate RAPM.  I think part of our issue is I'm not sure you're interpreting replacement level correctly and I'd love for you to cite where *you're* getting your interpretation from."

[They initially didn’t even want to trade Kyle until the deadline was nearing](https://www.tsn.ca/josh-lewenberg-kyle-lowry-shows-rare-emotion-after-possible-final-game-with-raptors-1.1613208)   [Was also reported multiple weeks prior in this report that they telling inquiring teams they weren’t moving him](https://www.tsn.ca/josh-lewenberg-would-the-raptors-consider-moving-red-hot-norman-powell-ahead-of-trade-deadline-1.1609888)  [It was reported that KCP, Trez, and Dennis were available for trades](https://mobile.twitter.com/jakelfischer/status/1374803501298122754?lang=en)   &gt;I don’t care about this point enough to continue   This confirmation bias beating your ass right now lol. This wasn’t an article about popularity, it was an article about influence. You also picked an article based on the opinions of one person. This is embarrassing.   You’re going to need to include sources, because one article is saying that average ticket price for a Raptors game is $179 (according to Yahoo Finances on November 2019) and another is barely over $101.   But yeah, the Maple Leafs franchise as a whole is more popular than the Raptors, but that has little to do with the players and more to do with the love the city has for hockey. You can make the argument that Matthews is more popular, but otherwise this  is the equivalent of saying those garbage players on the Lakers in 2015 (outside of Kobe) were more popular than Clayton Kershaw. Just a weird hill to die on.   You’re talking about trades, I’m talking about the Lakers giving him a new contract. You already said his contract was un-tradable, but the Lakers willingly gave him that new contract when they never had to. Pay attention.   Man Trez has struggled to stay on the floor for two straight postseasons.   There’s all the evidence that suggests Masai was willing to keep Lowry, even if he would walk for free in Free Agency. You can willingly ignore it and draw your own conclusions from it but it’s there. There’s no evidence of Masai just taking *any* offer just because they’re the only ones. There’s no evidence of Masai even having much interest in any of the players offered in these trades even dating back to his Nuggets days, and that includes Tyrese Maxey who they never had any sort of contact with.   And Maxey was surely in his draft range, at least more than Jalen Smith (who the Raptors met with), who was selected way higher than Maxey and their draft selection.   &gt;Caldwell-Pope has way more value that Rodney Hood, and more to the point, way more value than Kyle Lowry   Oh my God, I should’ve known I was arguing with an idiot. Aye man, just because people having been teasing the Lakers about not trading for Lowry doesn’t mean you have to say ridiculous shit to justify the move. Hope you can recover from this, have a good day,   One thing I will say is that we will revisit this when Lowry gets his money in FA, remind me."
"Probably not. We have 3 or 4 guys on our bench who are better or equal to him in how they impact the game. (Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, George Hill). I might trade Korkmaz for him (though that’s close because I REALLY like Furkan) I would trade Shake Milton for him with no hesitation."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
I share a birthday with Derrick Rose and Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese Maxey is gonna be a star.  Has already showing glimpses of what he can be in these playoffs
- Anthony Davis - Julius Randle - Devine Booker - KAT - Rajon Rondo - Nerlens Noel - Tyler Herro - Bam Adebayo - Jamal Murray - Tyrese Maxey
"Yeah without Embiid I do not trust the sixers offensively outside of Tobias Harris and apparently Tyrese Maxey. If I’m being optimistic, without Embiid it’s sixers in 6.   Also with how great the Hawks have been lately, they’re not gonna be easy to lock up in the slightest."
Robert Williams and Tyrese Maxey
"Definitely the same casuals who make ""Imagine not trading Tyler Herro/Tyrese Maxey for Harden"" comments."
CJ for Tyrese Maxey maybe?
"First you need a team... I recommend the Philadelphia 76ers! They currently have the greatest player in the NBA on their team, TYRESE MAXEY!!!"
Tyrese Maxey is the greatest player of all time and there’s never been someone better in the history of the league.  In all seriousness you got into the nba at the best time possible. Playoffs are like the champions league.
"We don't really have any other lead guard playmakers on this team (besides Tyrese Maxey who is a rookie and still pretty rough around the edges). Seth curry, Tobias, Shake, korkmaz are all secondary playmaker types. I mean, we had Danny Green bringing the ball up the floor at one point this season with Ben and a handful of other players in the COVID protocol. George Hill should help with that but he is not the player he used to be. In a way we still have a Markelle Fultz / Jimmy Butler sized hole in our roster from a perimeter offensive initiator perspective"
I don’t understand how Tyrese Maxey fell to us in the last draft. Didn’t have the best jumper in college but was a clear lottery talent from a blue blood program.
Tyrese Maxey is the Matisse Thybulle of the 2020 draft.
[just a picture of Tyrese Maxey](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nba/players/full/4431678.png)
Look at Tyrese Maxey gettin' those big boi minutes!
#Tyrese. Maxey.
TYRESE MAXEY IS THE MOTHERFUCKING TRUTH.  #MAD MAX
Crazy that the two best players in the NBA (Tyrese Maxey and Robin Lopez) have to face off in the first round.
Neither do you.  It’s said that Sixers and Rockets were seriously engaged in talks.  Up to the point where Simmons agent was telling him to pack his bags.   Morey didn’t wanna give up Maxey according to Marc Stein and other reporters  https://hoopshype.com/rumor/sixers-trying-to-keep-tyrese-maxey-out-of-a-james-harden-trade/amp/
Tyrese Maxey would like a word with you
Can we get a game thread specifically for Tyrese Maxey?
Tyrese Maxey is gonna be who we wanted fultz to be
Joel Embiid who? We have Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey, the prince that was promised."
Tyrese Maxey vs Matisse Thybule  Who has the coolest name?
If the MVP Tyrese Maxey gets 30 minutes yes
you guys ruined the Tyrese Maxey game I hope you're proud
I seriously doubt Ben Simmons on a 40 million dollar contract can get us 4 good first round picks  Also we probably wouldn’t have gotten Tyrese Maxey as that was the tipping point for the sixers
"If you don't know about Tyrese Maxey, you're late to the party. This kid is SPECIAL"
TYRESE MAXEY. SAY HIS FUCKING NAME
1. Michael Jordan 2. Tyrese Maxey  I won't hear otherwise.
TYRESE MAXEY
# TYRESE MAXEY
I'm going to be so bummed if Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey go off this quarter
Is Tyrese Maxey actually Albanian or is Wikipedia just fucking with me?
Yeah. How about Giannis for Tyrese Maxey?
My fault for not watching more out of area games but MAN..Morant is an impressive scorer. I feel like we have a small version of him developing in Philly with Tyrese Maxey
"Paul reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tyrese Maxey all in one draft."
I'll raise you a Tyrese Maxey acrobatic layup
Tyrese Maxey is a future all-star. It's criminal that we don't play him more often. He's better than Shake in any situation
"Tyrese Maxey is the truth. Make note of this kid, he's going to be a seriously good talent"
YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THE NAME TYRESE MAXEY
Tyrese Maxey doesn't play like a rookie
TYRESE FUCKING MAXEY.
All this just to lose to Tyrese Maxey
harden &gt; tyrese maxey
"Thats like saying the Sixers could trade Tyrese Maxey for Trae Young. Sure it CAN happen but that would be absolutely fucking stupid for Atlanta, the Lakers physically could have traded those pieces but the Raptors would be FUCKING STUPID to take that deal."
A banner awaits you in Philly for giving us Tyrese Maxey.

I still can't believe they got Harden for virtually nothing outside of Kevin Porter Jr. The equivalent of this would be like the 76ers getting Giannis for Tyrese Maxey and scraps.
"[First of all, I won't let anybody say ""Tyrese Maxey"" without the title Sheikh](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/393/025/90c.jpg)"
You just lost to Paul “skinny Joel embiid” Reed and Tyrese “Ben simmons with dreads” Maxey
"tyrese maxey plays similarly to what we thought fultz would be. Developed solidly all year. Think the off-season will be HUGE for him given the direction he has moved in.  His major question mark in the draft was his shot from range, and its gotten better and better."
I constantly keep getting Tyrese Maxey and Terance Mann mixed up. They look and play identical.
"Benefits of keeping Lowry outweigh the risks of him deciding to leave in the offseason.  AND  Benefits of keeping Lowry - risk of losing Lowry &gt; benefits of tyrese maxey +late first.  That’s as simple as I can put it man, sorry if you can’t understand"
"Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, and two first round picks for Dame Lillard"
Tyrese Maxey has a big future
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
I hear Tyler Herro is available. Might even be able to get Tyrese Maxey in a 3 team trade. With one used Ben Simmons added in.
"recency/nostalgia bias.  for recency: calling a player underrated/a top 5 whatever after one good game. ex: collin sexton getting MIP talks after a good run early in the season, after which he completely dropped off the radar; tyrese maxey, who dropped 39 and promptly got shoved into the ROTY conversation, etc.  nostalgia bias: when people have a top whatever list that they REFUSE to change, no matter what young player is starting to rise. ex: people saying giannis isn't top 25 after 2 MVPs, a DPOY (during the MVP season), one of the best finals runs ever, and a possible ring. also people who definitively say that luka will NEVER be better than MJ or Lebron no matter what he does."
"Portland would probably want one of Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle and a pick, Philly would probably want a pick. The problem is Philky can’t take the contract of Lowry and CJ at the same time, so you could do  Dame + first round pick swap 2023-&gt; Toronto  Lowry + Gary Trent Jr + Toronto’s 1st rounder from 2022-&gt; Philly  Ben Simmons + Tyrese Maxey + Philly first rounder 2023 -&gt; Portland"
"Now I understand what other fans feel like when I'm irrationally hyping up Matisse ""Australian Gobert"" Thybulle and Tyrese ""Literally AI Reincarnate"" Maxey"
"I like your takes.  Question: As a Celtics fan would you trade Jaylen Brown to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey and 1/2 unprotected 1sts?"
Lillard to Philly  Simmons to Minnesota  Picks + Young players (mostly from Minnesota but also Tyrese Maxey) to Portland
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"Right, those are guys you’d want on the team with Simmons not to replace him.   There is also the issue of our roster has exactly one good passer and that’s Ben Simmons, whose going to be our playmaker if we trade him for Hield, Cov, Bagley? Sophomore Tyrese Maxey? George Hill?  We desperately need another ball handler with Ben Simmons, how do we get rid of him without bringing at least one back?"
"Yea and you guys wasted it cause fucking Tyrese Maxey, Thybulle, and a guy that passes up open dunks in game 7 are more important than a superstar in your FO’s mind. This is hilarious I can’t believe you’re acting like not trading for Harden was a good idea. But be a huge Simmons stan."
"There may well end up being a bigger steal than Saddiq Bey, he's just arguably not even better than the dudes who got drafted around him (Precious Achiuwa, Tyrese Maxey, Imm Quickley) because he entered the draft age 21 and was more ready."
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."
Tyrese Thybulle or Matisse Maxey
Tyrese Thybulle &gt; Matisse Maxey
Mavs got Marcus smart Julius randle tyrese Maxey
That is Tyrese Maxey lol
"Dude, CJ Miles was never relevant to this discussion. That's why no one has been talking about Mike Scott, even though he would almost certainly have been included in the Lowry trade too.  Lowry demanded more valuable contracts because 1) he's a way more valuable player than Gasol and 2) because trading to an in-conference, in-division rival is going to require more grease on the wheels.  Guess what? They're not getting Lowry for Green because HIS CONTRACT EXPIRED and now the 76ers have to throw in a contract like Curry's to make the deal work! Which is way more valuable to an actively contending team than late firsts and prospects! That's what this whole thread is about!  Whatever, I'm glad Morey could feel good about not letting himself be swindled out of an extra #28 pick and Tyrese Maxey while watching the Hawks piss all over the value of one of his max players while his injury-prone MVP candidate ground away the cartilage in his knee trying to carry the team, all to just get knocked out in the second round in humiliating fashion. There's always next year, right?"
"Lol, catching strays from a Suns fan for no reason. Here's why I think you're off base.  1) Tyrese Maxey was drafted 21st and Thybulle 20th, both of which are equal to or later than JV and Delon. I admit, I thought Thybulle was drafted 22nd, but at this point we're splitting hairs, right? Meanwhile, CJ Miles was drafted in 2005 by the Jazz and primarily included in that trade as salary filler, so I'm not sure why he is even relevant.  2) Again, you're looking for a 1:1 comparison like these 76ers fans. That's not the point. The point is there are two teams, the 2019 Raptors and 2021 76ers, that had issues that they needed to fix by the trade deadline in order to take the next step into contention. The Raptors gave up their long-time starting center and an important reserve, i.e. functional depth, for a player that also happened to be a past-his-prime former All-Star that the front office recognized could help the team win a championship. (And if you think the fact that Marc Gasol's $26m player option at 35 years old added value compared to Lowry's expiring + Bird rights, I'm not sure what to tell you.)  Just to be clear, I have absolutely zero prejudice against the 76ers or their fans. I thought they had an excellent shot at the championship even without doing the Lowry trade, and I didn't think it was that bad of a decision for them at the time. But now that we've all seen how things worked out, do you REALLY think Morey made the right decision keeping Maxey, Thybulle, Danny Green and some late 1sts when it meant sacrificing a year of Embiid's peak and like half of Simmons's trade value to the 2nd round meatgrinder? If so, why?"
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."
"Im sure you think that because your gm said that to make your fans feel better about missing out on a great player thanks to tyrese maxey lmao.   The other offers were terrible, a lakers package around THT was the asking price which isn't expensive at all. But sure lets run with the ""ridiculous asking price"" narrative because that helps your fanbase cope with missing out"
"My breakout list is...  Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton, Johnathan Isaac.  &amp;#x200B;  My fall off list is...  Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic."
Tyrese Maxey and it’s not even that big of a stretch
"Is there a three way trade to be had between the Wolves, Sixers, and Pacers where they all come out on top?  How's this for a three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcom Brogdon  * Malik Beasley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Pacers get:   * Ricky Rubio  * Tyrese Maxey  * Jarrett Culver  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts   Brogdon moves into the Sixers starting lineup as a hyper-efficient 20ppg point guard. Beasley gives microwave scoring off the bench, averaging 20ppg himself last season. Sixers offense gets superpowered by moving on from Simmons and giving up one of their three promising guard prospects to win now.   Timberwolves move their expensive backup guards, a bust that needs a change of scenery, and picks that probably won't be in the lottery for Ben Simmons, who slots right into their offense. DLo/Ant/Ben/McDaniels/KAT is sp00ky for real. Again on the picks - they don't need any more young prospects, so moving a few picks for better players, now, is a likely and sensible move.   Pacers move on from Brogdon to try to build for the future while continuing to make the playoffs, which is their MO. They get Rubio, who can start in Brogdon's slot. They get Maxey, a promising guard prospect. They get Culver, who's really just filler but is still only 22yo and could be a reclamation project. And they get two 1st round picks that, who knows, could still be pretty good picks, knowing the Wolves."

"If former (strongly disliked) sixer Mike Muscala doesn’t hit a game winner for OKC in a meaningless last game in the 2019-2020 season, the Sixers don’t get their first round pick who turned out to be promising PG Tyrese Maxey. Muscala is now a hero to us sixers fans."
"Cavs/76ers/Blazers. Ive posted this in other subs, but want to know what the general fan thinks...  76ers get: Lillard, Covington  Blazers get: Simmons, Sexton, 76ers 28th pick, 76ers swap 2024, Cavs 2nd rounder, 76ers top 5 protected 2026  Cavs get: Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, Portland lottery protected pick (any year).   This is assuming Cavs want to move on from Sexton, they get a decent young Guard to fill that role immediately. They also get a raw top NBA defender in Tisse (they need defensive help). Blazers get Simmons/Sexton, an all-star, and potential young future all-star along with a nice hunk of picks, they could then decide to move CJ for whatever... 76ers get the missing piece to a Finals run and Covington back where he belongs."
"Kyle Lowry, Tyrese Maxey and a 2nd."
"Embiid was forced to do **so much** though. I don't think that's a fair point to take a lot of the onus off on the guy who refuses to shoot the ball or be aggressive and put it on the only guy on the team that's aggressive and plays at an MVP-level.   Other than Seth Curry, Furkan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey, of course, but none of those guys are All-NBA caliber players."
Things Doc Rivers has done well.  Utilise Seth Curry in a more effective way than other teams.  Run Tobias Harris at his ideal position  Make adjustments with Tyrese Maxey/Shake Milton to help swing games.  The issue with the sixers is that they don't have a real pg who can properly run a half court offense (unless you count an old George Hill who didn't cut it as a starting PG in 2018 let alone now).  Doc Rivers isn't the best coach ever but just two seasons ago he lead one of the most star-starved teams to the West playoffs in a decade+. He's not the greatest coach but overall he has more positives than negatives.  Also Scott Brooks made the playoffs lol
"Honestly it's kinda pathetic how much some of these dudes will ask for then be offended when they don't get it. Dude you're not guaranteed shit in this sport, and you gotta work for it. A $40 mil contract would make you set for life if you're not a moron, and you're here playing like complete asshole.... even $40 mil is more than enough for someone who competes like you did in the playoffs. Get over yourself, man. Tyrese Maxey played better this playoffs as a late round rookie."
"Idk what exactly Toronto gets, but this is a 4 team trade idea I have to get 3 players in different situations.   Pascal Siakam -&gt; PHI, Ben Simmons -&gt; GSW, Draymond Green -&gt; POR  Why the Sixers do this: Siakam is a much cleaner fit next to Embiid offensively due to his superior shooting abilities, whilst at the same time, not blocking the development of guards like Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton. Siakam takes over Simmons role as primary perimeter defender. More than anything, this trade makes Embiid *happy* as Siakam is one of his guys since they are both from Cameroon.   Why Golden State does this: This is a bet on Ben Simmons reviving his career in the most optimal situation for him. You are essentially hoping to turn Ben Simmons into the next Draymond Green with some slight differences, Simmons is not the rim protector that Draymond is, which makes Wiseman important, conversely Simmons is a much better perimeter defender and a point of attack defender is needed with Klay likely not being up to scratch in that kind of role anymore.   This is a talent acquisition bet for Golden State, their 5 they would be rolling with would be Simmons/Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Wiseman.   Why the Blazers do this: This is pretty simple, to make Dame happy. Dame and CJ have long wanted to play with Draymond after that 2019 WCF series where they were exposed to just how good he was, CJ went as far as photoshopping him in a Blazers jersey.   I'm not too sure what Toronto ends up with in this scenario, Covington for sure as part of salary matching and I suppose one of Nurkic or Derrick Jones Jr.?   Not sure who would need picks out of this to be properly compensated."
"1. Simmons value isn’t as easy as saying “well he he was 2nd in dpoy”. Perimeter defense is significantly less valuable than interior defense, so paying 35 million dollar for a net negative on offense and a elite perimeter defender is a waste. And then when you realize that’s he’s regressing on offense and unplayable in the playoffs, it makes a Simmons as a center piece ridiculous. He’s literally a 35 million dollar Draymond green with no heart, he’d be a great as a 4th option on a championship team imo, but not as Washington’s tank commander with Russ. Also I never said he has “no value”, just that his value isn’t close to Beal, which should be very obvious.   2. Idk if you’re serious but what decent young players do Philly have? Tyrese Maxey doesn’t move the needle really as he’d be taking the ball from Deni’s hands, and Matisse is sort of useless on a rebuilding team. GSW, BOS, DEN, and NOP just off the top of my head have better packages."
Tyrese Maxey
"No one thinks we can get Ben for dame 1 for one lol.   The question is if a disgruntled superstar *like* dame wanted out, is a handicapped Ben, upcoming tyrese maxey and the sixers future picks mortgaged together the best teams could get.   Also my mans is saying if it’s NOT for a star of dames caliber, he’d rather run it back with Ben. I’m indifferent tbh but just clarifying what my fellow depressed sixers fan is trying to say."
Don’t forget tyrese maxey
Tyrese Maxey.
Tyrese Maxey
They already have Tyrese Maxey there’s no point in getting another potentially expensive guard
I’ve watched the tape all year and he’s this years Tyrese Maxey where eye test &gt; a low sample college stat sheet
"You’re arguing like I’m saying we should keep Simmons when I’m saying that he’s worth more than washed, injury prone Kemba and two picks that will most likely not be any better or more impactful in the playoffs as Maxey is for the biggest chunk left of Embiid’s prime, and are likely not even going to make the impact Tyrese had because part of his opportunities on the floor were because of Ben’s deficiencies. There’s nothing Kemba provides that’s going to put Philly in a contending conversation."
"Except, yano, Tyrese Maxey"
The best player in that package was Tyrese Maxey.     Thybulle is overrated and cannot defend the perimeter without fouling 3 PT shooters and we know the deal with Ben Simmons. Take the Philly deal we'd turn to Pacers West lmao.
"Agree to disagree what would that lineup even be? Tyrese Maxey, Seth, Tobi, DeMar, Embiid? I don't think that beats the Hawks tbh.   Sixers need a real point guard and 4 perimeter scorers around Embiid to reach max potential."
"But you said few guys used the midrange and it’s pretty clear that’s not the case. An assortment of guys is relying on the midrange to score more than Booker is.  Guys these playoffs averaging more midrange attempts than restricted area attempts include Embiid, Middleton, Westbrook, Randle, Tatum, CP3, Butler, CJ, Kyrie, Dragic, MPJ, Melo, Bogdan, Ish, Hunter, Marcus Morris, Gallinari and a whole lot of others  More midrange than three include: KD, Embiid, Westbrook, Butler, CP3, Rose, AD, Ish, Lou Williams, Tyler Herro, Tyrese Maxey, and Jabari Parker among others.  It’s just not accurate that Booker is one of the few players with a midrange game."
Tyrese Maxey inherits the PG spot. Best possible exchange for Ben and doesn't have to be a PG.
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, plus picks for Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Zach Collins. Who says no if Dame demands a trade?"
and Tyrese Maxey via Future Draft Pick
"Post from yesterday “Portland gets: Ben Simmons, Mattise Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2 future 1st Rd Picks, 2 future 2nd Rd picks Philadelphia gets: Damian Lillard” lmao"
"This is completely wrong, they didn't give up on him in 1 season, and they traded him for the pick that became Tyrese Maxey, a player who is already better than Fultz."
Back of chips? That’s Tyrese Maxey ur talking about sir!
Seth Curry?   Tyrese Maxey?  Also btw what happened with Tyrese Maxey in game 7
"Certain players have that killer mentality of I want that shot. Trae has it. We saw yesterday Red Velvet has it. Joel Embiid has it, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey have it.  Giannis Antetakumpo has it.   Ben Simmons doesn't.   Antetakumpo isn't a great FT shooter. Dwight isn't a Great FT. Shaq too. But these guys were like okay whatever I'm still gonna body you in the post and my body is built to take those shots and you'll wear out faster than I do. And if they 0-2 and 1-2 and 0-3 and 1-3 or 2-3  they add up.   Simmons should have embraced Hack-A-Ben made the shots he can make and then just dominate on defense.   I'm a moron when it comes to basketball"
"I saw it on TV but I couldn't find it online. Here's an article by I believe the journalist who asked. [Article](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-76ers-tyrese-maxey-ben-simmons-nba-playoffs-20210620.html?outputType=amp)  Here's the quote from Doc to save a click: I’m not even going to answer that question,” scoffed Sixers coach Doc Rivers, said when asked if he’d even considered starting the man who saved his season. ”You want me to bench Ben Simmons?”"
"Looked for it but couldn't find it either. I saw it on TV but here's an article that [that recaps it I believe by the same reporter who asked.](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-76ers-tyrese-maxey-ben-simmons-nba-playoffs-20210620.html?outputType=amp) it.  To save you a click, here's the quote: I’m not even going to answer that question,” scoffed Sixers coach Doc Rivers, said when asked if he’d even considered starting the man who saved his season. ”You want me to bench Ben Simmons?”"
"Underrated point, is Lowry really going to want to play for the guy who said he isn’t worth Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle?"
"The Atlantic was reporting ""Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks"", which was just too much."
If he had a competent PG that would be solved  Also the conditioning since he has to do basically everything on offense while rim protecting on defense  Im not saying hes better than Ben but the 76ers just from the eye test looked way better with Tyrese Maxey on the floor and Ben sitting
They traded Fultz for a first round pick which turned out to be Tyrese Maxey which seems like a solid exchange
Tyrese Maxey was the big holdup they didn't wanna give up meanwhile Joel Embiid is wasting away his prime trying to carry those bums on a torn meniscus.
"How are all of Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, and 1st round picks ""extremely replaceable""   Masai basically asked for every asset we had for a 35 year old. Morey rightly walked away. Morey said the asking price was in La-La land, and that was proven true by the fact that no one ended up dealing for Lowry at all  We didn't need Lowry to win this series we just needed DG healthy"
I’m gonna get downvoted but they should have traded for Lowry.   Raptors aren’t losing sleep over Tyrese Maxey if Lowry walks for nothing. But Morey will be losing sleep for years knowing he blew a title run over extremely replaceable assets
"He refused to include Tyrese Maxey in Harden trade offers, even though Houston wanted him lol.  [Source 1](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349453856569253889) [Source 2](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1406067378253828099) [Source 3](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1349519348747145222)"
Tyrese Maxey?
Tyrese Maxey?
Didn’t the pick that was traded end up becoming Tyrese Maxey. I’ll always root for Fultz but I think it was probably in everyone’s best interest to get him to a new environment
"When Kyle Neubeck asked Doc if he would start Tyrese Maxey after he had a good game 6:  &gt;“I’m not even going to answer that question,” scoffed Sixers coach Doc Rivers, said when asked if he’d even considered starting the man who saved his season. ”You want me to bench Ben Simmons?”  &gt;“That’s not what we do. We stay solid. We stay disciplined. And we run our stuff.”  &gt;“I don’t overreact to every single game,” Rivers insisted.  This was the moment I knew the sixers were in trouble for game 7. “Sticking to the plan” after you blow multiple winnable games and a 26 point lead is not the move"
The Sixers probably win the series if they just start Tyrese Maxey. Ben was literally just a warm body the whole series.
Can I interest you in one Tyrese Maxey?
"Philly definitely choked but I'd have to say the foul calls on Ice Tre were the deciding factor. I don't understand fouls anymore. Tyrese Maxey didn't touch him but it was a foul, bad for basketball. Couldn't hang in the 80's"
lmao and they drew the line at Tyrese fucking Maxey. Delusional.
Reports of both  Tilman was either petty or Morey didn't want to let go of Tyrese Maxey   Hopefully Ben has enough trade value to get something of value
"Sixers fans can be happy knowing they have Ben Simmons instead of James Harden, all worth it to keep Tyrese Maxey"
Is it a stretch to say Tyrese Maxey jersey will outsell Ben Simmons jersey next season?
Having exactly no-clue who Terrance Mann or Tyrese Maxey are when I would have known their entire middle name and birthday 3-4 years ago.
Is Tyrese Maxey Penny Hardaway with dreads?
they learned real quick tyrese maxey cant play this game
I mean the Sixers may still need to blow up this team with how Ben Simmons is playing on offense.   If they can cover the offense responsibility with Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry and force Ben to improve his FT I'm talking 100 FT a day during the off-season. Maybe they can make Ben Simmons into a Draymond green role.
"depends lol, he's absolutely top 40 in the regular season but in the playoffs id rather have seth curry and even tyrese maxey over him"
Counterpoint. Tyrese Maxey
What’s really been great about these playoffs is seeing some non-superstars step up and really contribute. Bruce Brown has shown out. Terance Mann just went nuts. Tyrese Maxey saved the Sixers from elimination.
This dude is a killer.   I worry more about him holding the ball than Ben Simmons or even tbh Joel Embiid.  If the Sixers win game 7 it's gonna be because of Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry
Tyrese Maxey/Talen Horton-Tucker hybrid
"Every time I saw play Tyrese Maxey in Game 6, I kept thinking, ""Mann, doesn't he play for the Clippers..."""
"In March, after a successful game against the Knicks, rookie Tyrese Maxey was asked how he would be preparing for his following game against the Bucks which, it was pointed out, would be the first game 35 of the regular season of his career. ""You're right,"" Maxey said. ""(But) tonight was the first game 34 of the regular season of my career."""
Doc playing Tyrese Maxey only 1 single minute in game 5 was a coaching failure.  The kid has been stellar all season and was a big part of the rotation down the stretch.
Bag of Jalapeño Dorito’s (elite chips)   Tyrese Maxey  Terrance Men  Australian Bismack Biyombo
Tyrese Maxey also played in an extremely pressure sensitive college environment at Kentucky.  I think people underestimate how much that matters sometimes when it comes to rookie poise.
"For sure, my point was Tyrese Maxey didn't do anything special to win this game. That Hawks just played like ass."
Tyrese maxey
That all bench lineup is prolly better than lineups with Simmons in it.  Tyrese Maxey and George Hill looked good
Terrance Mann and Tyrese Maxey superteam in 2025
"Tyrese Maxey is so good, he scored 16 points in the Sixers game and 30 points in the clippers game"
"Personally, I think it's going to come down to whether or not the front office- and, to an extent, Joel- believes that Tyrese Maxey can be a championship caliber point guard as a sophomore. If their answer is no, it's more likely that they package Maxey and Simmons for a bigger and more reliable star. I've rated CJ highly since his performance in the nuggets blazer 5OT game"
Tyrese Maxey and Terrance Mann gonna earn a fat contract this offseason
Terrence  Mann 🤝 Tyrese Maxey  Young players with dreadlocks saving their teams
All the big names came out like Tyrese Maxey and Seth “literally Steph” Curry
Where were you for the Tyrese Maxey game
Terrance Mann and Tyrese Maxey are giving 💯 to their teams. They also look kinda alike haha.
Tyrese Maxey is a pad
"I haven't actually done the math, but the odds of hitting on a future playoff rotation player in the 2nd round can't possibly be more than 25%, and I think that's a very generous estimate.  The odds of hitting on someone in the back half of the second round where these picks will likely end up is even smaller.  When you are a true championship contender, trading a second round pick for a playoff rotation guy is a defensible move.  Now if the Tyrese Maxey bit is true, that is a flat out terrible move, but there are conflicting reports if that's even true."
"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."
"&gt; a bit of a shaky start in Philly, after also refusing to include Tyrese Maxey in James Harden trade discussions  Morey could've included Embiid himself , we would've still never traded with him because Fertitta is petty"
"&gt;The Sixers, league sources say, are trying to muster other assets (such as draft compensation) to offer Houston to keep Tyrese Maxey out of a potential James Harden trade, league sources say  [\- Marc Stein](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349453856569253889)  &gt;Tyrese Maxey, declared off limits by the Sixers in James Harden trade talks in January, is now getting crunch-time run in Game 6 in Atlanta as Philadelphia tries to save its season  [\- Marc Stein](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1406067378253828099)  &gt;the Sixers' final offer was ""Simmons, Thybulle, and draft picks.""

"&gt; after also refusing to include Tyrese Maxey in James Harden trade discussions  Wasn't that bullshit? The sad part is that even if it wasn't, a lot of Sixers fans didn't wanna trade Simmons and Maxey for Harden because ""defence"" and ""chemistry"" LOOL."
Tyrese Maxey &amp; Matisse Thybulle.
20 year olds I’m taking over Tyrese Maxey:  Lamelo  Ant   Cade   Green  Mobley   That’s it. That’s the list.
"Simmons to Minnesota, Lillard to Philly, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, 4 1sts from Philly and Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, 2 1sts from Minny to Portland"
"I'd say there's less of a problem that teams only play 8 to 9 players because over the course of the season it's not the same 8 to 9 players, plus the end of the bench is often filled with players that aren't getting minutes because of age. The Sixers for example, if we go by minutes played, Tyrese Maxey is 10th on the team and further down factoring in minutes per game, he wasn't really a part of their rotation but in the even of an expansion draft, the Sixers are absolutely going to hold on to him.  I'd say the bigger issue is that any given off season, not every team is going to fully have 8 players under a fully guaranteed contract (which wasn't the case the last time the league expanded). So, the changes you'll probably see are either only being able to hold on to a percentage of players under contract (like 60%) and some provisions about relinquishing bird rights or restricted free agents."

"&gt;None of my links stated that.  ""Toronto's asking price has been accordingly high: as ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported earlier Thursday, the Raptors have asked for multiple first-round picks and young players, including Philadelphia's Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey, in order to deal their franchise legend to his hometown.""  \-- [https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  Furthermore, the original point of the thread was that Lowry was not worth Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and a first -- which you argued for a couple days.  &gt;Miami isn’t paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don’t have to,  Well, yeah they are, since Lowry's ask was [$25 x 2.](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-eyeing-kyle-lowry-two-year-deal-nba-free-agency)  Even Lowry didn't think he was worth this contract, and it's not as though adding more AARP-eligible years adds value to the team.  In all likelihood, this contract will be among the league's worst by next season -- as we repeatedly see with expensive deals for players in their mid-to-late thirties.  &gt;especially considering how that deal essentially puts them at the salary cap, and especially because \~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry’s asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year.  Again, you don't pay more for adding years that late in a career.  &gt;I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it’s actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.   35 year old Dragic is not better than Caldwell-Pope -- which is why Dragic has not been an NBA starter in four years -- and his play dropped off significantly last year, and his health is unknown.  If they were the same age, that would be true, but Caldwell-Pope is seven years younger.  Dragic also has a worse contract.  &gt;Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.  Achiuwa is an extremely raw 20th pick, which makes him unlikely to be anything but a replacement-level player.  There's obviously a chance he's more, but it's slight.  &gt; It is also better than no return.  If Dragic is healthy and can play.  &gt;They’ve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived.  Kendrick Nunn is a point guard, and played 30 minutes per game for the Heat in both the preceding two seasons.  They also had Vincent for both of those seasons, and he even played 13 minutes per last year.  So, no."
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our “GM”). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I’d say he’s done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
"Lmao there's no way you get dame for a Ben Simmons package. Ben Simmons, some late 1sts, Tyrese maxey, and thybulle still wouldn't be enough for a top 10 player like dame. And Morey probably wouldn't offer both maxey and thybulle so no way in hell."
"that’s not even hindsight, he’s a notably worse player than Simmons, they can’t play together, and Fultz was traded for the pick that became Tyrese Maxey who’s likely better than Fultz anyway  (I say this all as a big fan of Fultz)"
"For me, tyrese maxey, with his insane speed he reminds me a lot of DWade. Very strong attacking the rim, Improving as a 3pt shooter and has good playmaking and above average defense. With the right development under Doc rivers he could be in a starring role for a championship team very quickly. I also feel that with this Ben Simmons stuff, early on he should be given the keys as such to the offense"
Tyrese Maxey
"Lauri Markkanen, Aaron Nesmith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Jordan Poole, Chuma Okeke, Robert Williams, Tyrese Maxey."
TYRESE. MAXEY. BEAST.
Tyrese Maxey -- the kids rate if improvement in defense and three point shooting was incredible. I can't imagine this guy not continuing to develop into an all Star at this rate
James Wiseman - Just because I have such a gut feeling  Tyrese Maxey- he sparkles in my eyes
"Dude r/sixers is the worst. They drag Sextons name through the mud (no pun intended BBall Paul) yet act like Tyrese Maxey is some untouchable asset.  Some dude last week said that Maxey &gt; Westbrook and added that ""it isn't close"" lol like what"
Tyrese Maxey
You newphews are overreacting to the fucking summer league lol. Summer league competition is so bad Simmons was shooting jump shots in the summer league. Also I fucking love Tyrese Maxey but this narrative that he played better than Simmons in the playoffs needs to die. Tyrese had spurts in the playoffs where he looked amazing but most of the Hawks series he wasn't very good. He was apart of the bench lineups that got obliterated by the Hawks even going as far as getting out scored 30-0 before Shake bailed us out. Maxey had one game in the Hawks series where he scored over 7 points...
"IQ and Tyrese Maxey. They just seem to have ""it."""
Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey. With Ben Simmons surely out the door, the Sixers need a new point man and Maxey fits the bill. Dude is really young so lots of room to grow yet but he's already really good at driving to and finishing at the rim. Not so much a shooter but a shot maker, though based on Summer league it looks like he's been working hard on his 3 ball. Plus Doc seems to love this kid so I expect he'll get plenty of playing time this season to prove himself.  My 2021-2022 Maxey prediction: 22-4.5-7.5 on 48-38-88 splits as starting PG."
Tyrese Maxey. But I'm not afraid to say it. I'll scream it from the rooftops
Tyrese Maxey

Tyrese Maxey
"I’m gonna sound crazy, but tyrese maxey. He improved so much during his rookie year, became only the 11th player to have a 35/5/5 game before his 21st bday, and is only going to improve more.  Also, thybulle is going to win multiple dpoy’s"
Tyrese Maxey  He works hard and he’s been getting better crazy fast
"Tyrese Maxey. Maybe I’m a biased Sixers fan, but I’ll be so sad if he’s traded."
Tyrese Maxey
"""Don't watch games"" Pritchard literally averaged 3 points per game on 13 minutes in the playoffs. What games are YOU watching?   Is Tyrese Maxey a scorer because he dropped 6 points per game in the playoffs in fewer minutes? Like is Pat Connaughton a scorer in your expert opinion?   Torrey Craig averaged 4 points on 12 minutes in the playoffs, let's consider him a scorer too.  ""People on this sub gotta learn to stop talking about players they don’t know about."" That's on me I'll keep quiet"

Tyrese Maxey will ball the fuck out and if he’s not starting be a sixth man of the year candidate

"Tyrese Maxey, Saddiq Bey, already been said but Immanuel Quickley"
Maxey. The sixers will probably start Tyrese this year if I had to guess
"&gt; “Maxey is probably giving you AI flashbacks lol.”    That seems like a comparison to me, maybe you didn’t intend it but saying that you think of AI when you watch Maxey play requires comparing their play styles/abilities.   &gt; “We literally just watched him play PG better than Ben in the playoffs as a rookie”  Tyrese  did not play better PG than Ben in the playoffs. Tyrese didn’t initiate the offense, wasnt running any plays, and was not setting up his teammates whatsoever. Did maxey have better offensive performances than Ben? Absolutely. But scoring points isn’t the only metric of if a PG is playing well. Go back and watch Maxey with the ball in his hands — he doesn’t play like a PG, he’s a combo guard with a handle."
Portland legend Tyrese Maxey
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De’aron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I’m pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
That’s Matisse Thybulle not Tyrese Maxey my guy but the names are similar and it’s an understandable err
"Alternatively  'The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey to the Charlotte Hornets for LaMelo Ball, James Bouknight, and their 2022/24/26 FRPs'   'Sources say Hornets owner Michael Jordan wants to make a playoff push now, and believes Ben Simmons could be the next heir of LeBron James'"

"If you think those teams are worse, then get off this sub. How is Fred not better than Pat Bev and Luke Kennard who barely got minutes in the playoffs 😂😂  The sixers had to play tyrese Maxey instead of Ben for stretches because of how shitty he was on offence. You don’t think that having Fred instead would make them better 😂  KP was a massive defensive liability, did jack shit on offence, and provided no value as a big. Fred alleviates their issues with creation outside of Luka.  If the raptors wouldn’t make that trade with Denver even though the money is equivalent, then that means FVV is on a Relatively good contract 😂😂😂😂😂"
Tyrese Maxey MIP
"Tyrese Maxey is going to be a really good player. Maybe he needs one more year but I think he'll play a much bigger role on the team this year.  Anthony Edwards will be substantially better, I think he is a future all-star.  Timelord is another candidate here."
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."
Except Tyrese Maxey literally said two days ago he talks to Ben all the time. Y’all just running away with these bullshit reports.
Tyrese Maxey
Yeah the sixers blew a chance at a chip by getting Lowry. Simmons wouldn’t have been as exposed and value tank either. All that for tyrese maxey lol
Why would I be butthurt? I've seen my team win a title already. I would be hurt tho if my team hadn't made it past the second round since 2001 and my GM wasted the best year of the franchise player's career by not trading Tyrese Maxey and a 1st round pick lmao. Have fun with the process part 2 when Embiid leaves in 2 years.

Theres no way Portland trades Dame to Philly without getting Tyrese Maxey back
Tyrese maxey!!
"I’ll say this, the Thunder have had horrible luck with protections so far. They lost their 2020 pick to the Sixers (Tyrese Maxey) bc of Mike Muscala hitting a buzzer beater in a meaningless bubble game. Their top 20 Warriors pick last year became 2 seconds. And their top 5 protected pick swap with Houston with a 50% chance to convey failed in the lottery."
Sixers were unironically better with Tyrese Maxey on the floor over Ben Simmons in games 6 and 7
"McConnell, Covington, and Grant all represented what made The Process so special.  McConnell was an undrafted guy who never would've stuck around in the league if not given the opportunity for extended playing time with Philly.  Covington was a cast off from the Rockets who was brought in due to familiarity with the front office and was given the greenlight to fire away, and is one of the most sought-after names every year.  Grant, who was nowhere near the player he is now compared to his Philly years, might've washed out of the league or never given a chance to play, as most 2nd round picks tend to do. He played well enough that OKC were willing to trade a 1st round pick for him, which ultimately became Tyrese Maxey."
"Dame doesn’t have a NTC, blazers can send him wherever they want. I’d rather take a warriors, nuggets, pelicans, raptors, thunder, etc package over Ben and Tyrese Maxey"
Nah you have the untradeable Tyrese Maxey who given the value Morey and Philly fans give to him is a future All-NBA PG.
I wonder how much he makes overseas?  I am sure he’s clearing $1-2 million per season since Euro clubs pay for expenses and taxes and stuff. So he would have to get paid $2-3 million US for it to financially make sense for him.  That puts him the RJ Hampton Tyrese Maxey salary range. He’s done pretty well overseas but not sure how your mid level Euro player compared to mid level NBA player.
Tyrese Maxey
Straight up embarrassing and he had the audacity to say tyrese maxey + a first was a lala land price for lowry??
And people keep saying the deal didn’t happen because of Tyrese Maxey which also no one knows if that’s true . How is that different?
Rockets are in La La Land if they think they could get future superstar Tyrese Fucking Maxey in a trade for Harden.
"Only the smoothest of brains would refuse to include Tyrese Maxey in a trade for James Harden.   The sixers offer was underwhelming af. Simmons, Thybulle, and 2 first rounders is a shit tier package. Blaming Tilman is just a conspiracy theory to cope"
"It depends on how bad Simmons' relationship is with the Sixers right now. If it's as bad as has been rumored, I think swapping him for CJ + some combination of picks and/or a young prospect is a no-brainer. An Embiid-Harris-McCollum trio is nice, and Tyrese Maxey should only get better. My gut tells me that either this trade happens, or he stays put. Depends on how dire the situation is, and no one really knows that for sure right now."
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and two timberwolves FRPs  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
" Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and a timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
"Right before the draft starts there is a three team trade between the sixers raptors and the timerwolves.  Philly: Lowry, Malik Beasley, Jake laymen and the timberwolves FRP  Minnesota: Ben Simmons and George Hill  Toronto: Tyrese Maxey or Thybulle, Ricky Rubio and philly FRP"
Tyrese Maxey baby!
"Knicks  Frank Ntilikina for Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Thybulle"
"To answer your last sentence, look at what Morey asked from us for Simmons lol.  If nobody met Masai’s demands because Lowry would be cheaper now, then Masai is right to wait, since now everyone is competing to get Lowry to sign with them.   Who? Literally every team interested at the deadline still wants to sign and trade for him. If he’s so old and decrepit how come teams are lining up to offer him between 20-30 million per year despite not even having the cap space yet?Teams like the Pelicans and Mavs are motivated now because getting Lowry means you get him locked up to a deal instead of as an expiring free agent, he’s worth more to *those* teams now than at the deadline.  I know you really want Masai to look bad here but the evidence isn’t there man. Idk what to tell you, he’s not greedy for wanting more than Duncan Robinson or Tyrese Maxey for Kyle Lowry.  The Sixers clearly don’t value Lowry the same way and won’t offer a competitive contract so don’t worry, you probably won’t be getting him. Lowry is getting paid and depending on who it is we might even get better compensation back. I’m losing no sleep if he walks and we don’t have Maxey or Duncan"
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese maxey
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
The money doesn’t line up there. More likely it’d be Simmons + Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle + a second round pick for Beal + Raul Neto or something like that
"I think our best case scenario is that a star demands a trade and we make a three team deal.    An example of what I mean (you can swap out different teams and players, just showing a structure):  Minnesota:  Ben Simmons  Sixers:  Dame Lillard  Blazers:  Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and whole bunch of Minnesota and Philadelphia draft picks  This of course assumes that the blazers/Wizards/other team are going to blow up their roster and are in asset acquisition mode."
Jarett allen for tyrese maxey?
1. Shake Milton  2. Furkan Korkmaz   3. Tyrese maxey   4. Matisse thybulle   5. Ben Simmons
"76ers - Dame, Buddy Hield  Kings - Ben Simmons, Robert Covington, Isiah Joe  Blazers - Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2021 #9 pick (Kings), 2021 #28 Pick (76ers), 2022 Pick Swap, 2023 Top 5 Protected Pick (Kings), 2024 Unprotected Pick (76ers)."
Tyrese Maxey had 39 points against the Nuggets. His high before that was 16.
Tyrese Maxey had 39 against the Nuggets in a covid outbreak game last January. His previous career high was 16 I think.
That doesn’t make him one of the most interesting players in the league this season though still. Why isn’t the most interesting player this year Cam Thomas if that’s the case? Or Nic Claxton? Or Tyrese Maxey? Or Bol Bol? Young role players are not the “most interesting” in a league of over 400 people.
Tyrese maxey is very good
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
"I really think Pat Bev in general is underrated, but there’s just no way he would start over Maxey.  Even if we assume they stay the same production wise, which they wont, Rese is just gonna be better this year, and age is gonna catch up to Pat Bev, their production is roughly the same, with Tyrese being a better playmaker and scorer, and Pat Bev being a significantly better defender, it just doesn’t make sense to start Pat Bev for the Sixers.  Not only is Maxey a better fit for the starters where his floor spacing and playmaking open up things for Embiid, Pat Bev is a better fit for the bench who don’t have defensive contributors like Joel and to a lesser extent Danny Green.  Like I can appreciate your sales pitch, but it’s just not true from any perspective that isn’t the Sixers should let the Wolves rob them."
Tyrese Maxey. Simmons drama is some serious shit but if Maxey can distribute and score enough from the PG position to keep us relevant in the regular season it could stop some of the bleeding.
Tyrese maxey who shoots barely 30% on less than 2 per game is their shooter? Lol
"Is Jason Dumas even credible at this point? He had to recant his report that Rich Paul wanted Tyrese Maxey out of there. And his tweets often include references to how players are thinking, which I’m not sure he could know without directly talking to a player or someone very close to him. This is the same guy who put out the “young socialite” report about Ben Simmons, which - while entertaining - is really just his take on Simmons as opposed to something Simmons said about himself."
Tyrese Maxey &gt;&gt;&gt;
"By 538's Player Projections, Ben Simmons and Draymond Green are both categorized as Borderline All-Stars.   Just saying that a swap of them would be interesting.   The Warriors kick the can down a year or two so some of their young players (Kuminga, Wiseman, Moody, Poole) get more experience. Klay already isn't coming back till Christmas. There's no reason to ""chase wins"" this year.   Then you go into next year with Klay having a full offseason under his belt and after playing games, primed and ready to go, and you have a 5 of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Simmons/Wiseman with Kuminga as your 6th man, and he probably slides in for Kuminga as part of the new ""Death Lineup"" with Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Kuminga/Simmons. Wiseman would be in Year 3 and Kuminga would be in Year 2, you could probably start to expect both of them to actually be able to contribute positively on a contender.   As for the Sixers, they probably have the best defensive duo in the league at that point with Embiid and Draymond. And you put your trust in Tyrese Maxey and give him the keys to be the team's #2 option for now and let him spread his wings."
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
PG: Tyrese Maxey  SG: Landry Shamet  SF: Danny Green  PF: Draymond Green  C: Mitchell Robinson
"1: Curry (super)/Dejounte Murray (non)/Tyrese Maxey (non)  2: Klay (all)/Terrance Mann (non)/Shai-GA (non)  3: Jayson Tatum (all)/Dort (non)/ Miles Bridges (non)  4: Draymond (non)/John Collins (non)/Patrick Williams (non)  5: Embiid (super)/Mitchell Robinson (non)/Marc Gasol (non)   Explanation: Starting 5 is pretty easy to explain. What you see is what is it, which is the warriors starters w/ Tatum replacing Wiggins to give us more consistent firepower at the position and w/ Embiid, who slides in the warriors core as a dominant post player which the warriors have never truly had before in their runs. Embiid and Tatum also provide spacing on the perimeter with their ability to knockdown 3's for this team, and both can play defense."
Tyrese Maxey is better than this iteration of John Wall and he's already on the team. What a dumbass statement by Perk.
"Aside from the Superstars and all-stars, MPJ is my pick. He’ll be the second option on offense this year which is a step in maximizing his potential. Also, I like to see D-Fox build on his great year last year. Also, the Hornets’ young guns are entertaining to watch along with their play-by-play guy. “Hum diddly dee” “MILES BRIDGES OHHHHHH!” And the like lol.  I’m also excited for the Sixers to shit the bed this year because Sixers fans are annoying as hell. “Muh Matisse Thybulle” “Muh Tyrese Maxey” even tho I like them both as players."
Tyrese Maxey
Muh Matisse Thybulle. Muh Tyrese Maxey
"No shit.  You don't want Shake Milton, Seth Curry, or Tyrese Maxey as your primary playmaker."
Ben Simmons and tyrese maxey
"You missed out on a 5th starter/elite bench player in Cam Johnson. There's a reason Cam got picked 11th in the actual draft too because sometimes you just need a guy that you know is going to bring good value to your team. THT does not have some kind of insane potential either - he's not the fluid kind of player that someone like Kevin Porter Jr. or a Tyrese Maxey, who have that kind of all-star potential even if they aren't too great right now."
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey have been the second coming of Jesus for Sixer fans lmao.
"John Wall, Eric Gordon, a pick for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey and salary filler honestly isn't bad for either.   Simmons isn't fitting in Philly from their perspective and I think Wall would be a good fit if he stays healthy, and EG would be a great fit. They throw in Maxey to make playing time for the win now 76ers, and filler to make the money work. I know both teams are going to look hard at the negatives that come with these players, but both sides are dealing with things that dot work, and both would have a high potential upside."
Tyrese Maxey
Cavs get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: John Wall and picks  Rockets get: KLove &amp; Tyrese Maxey
"* Lakers pupu platter for [insert superstar here] * more of a non-trade prosposal, but Tyrese Maxey being off-limits and/or being overvalued by Sixers fans"
"For the 76ers, Matisse is the better rotational player but Tyrese had better highs during the season.   Tyrese Maxey vs Nuggets - 39 pts, 7 reb, 6 ast, 2 stl, 18/33 fg, in 43 minutes. [Highlights](https://youtu.be/H9MMt6iBg5E)"
Imagine holding off on a Harden trade because you don't want to give up Tyrese Maxey lmao.   Wtf was Morey thinking?
"While I agree I do wonder if maybe there's a sense of necessity/urgency as far as getting *something* good/great back for him just because outside of Embiid nothing has worked out for the Sixers.  1st rd picks going back to 2014 when they drafted Embiid:  2014 - Embiid, Elfrid Payton.  Embiid obviously a centerpiece, but Payton was never all that special and still isn't today.  2015 - Jahlil Okafor -  Do I really need say anything?  Wasted 3rd pick.  2016 - Simmons, TLC, Korkmaz.  Simmons has been a disappointment, soon to be traded.  Wasted 1st pick possibly, depends on if they get extremely lucky with a trade. TLC is an ok bench player in limited stretches but nothing special, same for Korkmaz  2017 - Fultz - Had the yips, got traded, is halfway decent now.  Not great, not terribly special, but just ""ok"".  Wasted 1st pick.  2018 - Bridges and Shamet.  Bridges immediately traded for rights to Zhaire Smith (who has played like 13 games total in 2 yrs for Philly).  Shamet was solid, but he's gone too.  2019 - Ty Jerome whose rights were traded for Matisse ""Career avgs of 4.3/1.8/1.1"" Thybulle.    2020 - Tyrese Maxey.  Solid young player with lots of potential, but he's got a ways to go.  Oh and don't forget that after 2018/19 they lost Jimmy Butler.  I wouldn't be surprised if they feel like the last 7 years of moves has left them with nothing to show for it other than Embiid and now they feel pressure to get something ""good"" for Simmons, otherwise they just keep wasting FRP's for nothing.  I mean, this is the type of performance the avg GM would be on the hot seat for...a bunch of lottery picks that turned out to be one superstar who likely won't be dominant for long thanks to injury-history and a bunch of flameouts who ended up getting traded for Dorito-crumbs and bench players."
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
Look at the Nets and Lakers signings over the past two years then look at everyone else’s. Those two teams stay healthy the other teams don’t have a chance.   Also Simmons has 4 years left on a max deal and Tyrese Maxey was literally a rookie last year. Both were asked to be traded from the team by Rich Paul.
"A trash can, a bar of soap, and maybe a towel. Throw in Dragic if we can get Tyrese Maxey too."
Tyrese maxey floater.   You’ll be seeing a lot of it next year
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"&gt; As a cherry on top, if the Lillard or Beal sweepstakes ever do happen, a package based around Fox is just as if not more appealing than one based around Simmons.   All you have to do is trade the players you don't want, who don't want to be there, for more valuable players! Trade Ben for Fox, then Fox for Dame/Beal... shit you'll be trading for Luka in no time! Then you can flip Tyrese Maxey for Jalen Green! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before??"
Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey going 39/7/6 with 2 steals and only 2 turnovers against Denver. Granted, both squads were pretty depleted, but this was still a rookie in his 10th NBA game ever."
"I'll say it 1.75m times, none of these videos show ben simmons beating even a gym rat to his right side with two or more consecutive dribbles with his right hand.  for all the talk about his shooting, ben simmons shrinks in the 4th qtr of the playoffs because he is not an ambidextrous dribbler.  yes, there are counter moves and spins shown.  but nba coaches know he cannot beat good nba defenders while dribbling consecutively with his right hand.  he can get away with it more often in the regular season, but the playoffs have better defenses to contend with, and then there's the 4th quarter.  nba teams dont want average shooters taking midrange shots, so ben shooting from the midrange ought not impress anyone.  his job is to get to the hole.  he's getting better at using counter moves to get to the right, as this video shows.  but it is still flawed by nba point guard standards.     fortunately, the sixers have tyrese maxey developing into that guy."
"Yeah this is such a low effort article. So the Sixers give up Ben Simmons, and the Hawks drop off their least inspiring wing prospect with a 1st to nab Tyrese Maxey?  So wait, the Sixers lose the best player &amp; their best young prospect for the privilege of getting back spare parts, a pick, and a mediocre wing?"
"What you are saying is true.  However, the Sixers know this as well and have been trying to draft a chucker to take over in the 4th like Jimmy Butler did three years ago.  It's so important, the Sixers traded up to #1 for Markelle Fultz.  But going back to your point about leverage, Morey and Sixers fans are or should be justifiably excited about Tyrese Maxey filling that role, I think.  Maxey is as much of a hit as Matisse Thybulle.  The sky is not falling."
your Tyrese Maxey breakout post inspired this one
"&gt; Ben Simmons is overrated  ???  &gt; Luka is in the same tier as Kyrie/Trae  LOL  &gt; A 50 point game is a fluke  LOL  &gt; Tyrese Maxey is overrated  ????  &gt; Giannis: Obviously he is a top 5 player, but he still is not better than KD, Curry, LeBron, or healthy Kawhi. Just because he won a ring during the postseason with the most injuries in NBA history and weak competition doesn't mean he's the best player.  Yeah I agree with this one actually. Still you're 1/5"
"I brought up the Free throws as just one example of why you could run it back. You can “dig into” it as much as you’d like, but Ben Simmons shot historically bad from the line in the playoffs and it is extremely unlikely that he will shoot 35% from the line in another playoff series.   There are other reasons why you can run it back. Joel Embiid is a year old but has improved every year and I fully expect him to do so this offseason. Tyrese Maxey showed promise and could potentially share some of the ball handling duties with Ben — something most Sixers fans have been asking for since Boston exposed his half court flaws his rookie year. Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. That was quite literally his worse shooting performance of the year in one of the most important games of the year. $36million cannot equal 4 points, and I don’t expect it to again, Tobias played pretty well outside of that game. Danny Green going down with a coach that is NOTORIOUS for not making adjustments was a deadly combination and we saw that when Lou Will was torching George hill and the second unit in the huge comeback win ATL had in Philly or when Huerter was absolutely cooking Seth on the offensive end.   Point being, the team underperformed and I think people focus on Simmons’ shortcomings because they are glaring and have been around since he entered the league. Running back the #1 seed from a year ago retooled with Niang and Drummond could still be a contender."
"If the Sixers do this trade they're giving Shake Milton a shot at starting. Mitchell's not ready for that, he's a rook.   Edit: forgot the Sixers have Tyrese Maxey too."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
Tyrese Maxey isn’t our current point guard lmao.
Does it matter? Your current point guard is Tyrese Maxey. Is CJ better than him? Absolutely.
"The thing is, as it stands you're not running back the current core. You're down Simmons.  Is CJ a better fit than Simmons? Maybe not. Is CJ a better fit than Tyrese Maxey? Absolutely."
Maybe not but is CJ better than your current point guard... Tyrese Maxey? Yes.
"Ben Simmons would not be the only part of the deal (Sixers offered draft compensation instead of Tyrese Maxey, so they would be getting picks from the Sixers package too, but...)  Ben Simmons will not receive a similar return in quantity of picks as the Rockets received from the Nets, but Ben Simmons could return a better QUALITY of pick than the Rockets received from the Nets. Consider that trading Simmons to the Timberwolves or Kings could net the Rockets lottery picks in the draft instead of late first round picks every year. The Nets will not stop contending until Durant/Harden/Irving leave. First round picks fall off HARD after the lottery, and lottery picks or anything near the lottery are worth substantially more than late round picks"
Tyrese Maxey
"If the Kings offer Mitchell, then they’d probably have the better offer, but I’m not sure they want to offer Mitchell. They’ve been raving about him all summer.   I think the Cavs backed off of shopping Sexton after the draft as well. When those rumors came out, there was still speculation that either Jalen Green could drop to number 3 or the Cavs could draft Suggs. Now that the Cavs drafted Mobley, I don’t think that they want to trade for Simmons. A lineup including Simmons, Mobley, and Allen would never work.   If the 76ers do want Sexton, then a 3 team trade with the Wolves and Cavs might be the best bet. The Wolves can get Simmons. The Cavs can get Timberwolves picks and maybe Tyrese Maxey. The 76ers could get Sexton, McDaniels, Beasley, and Rubio."
"Trade Suggestion: Ben Simmons   Sixers get: Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, future first rd pick  Kings get: Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, 2nd rd pick  What do you think?"
"what do you mean? unlike kyrie, tyrese maxey brings positivity to the locker room and is filled with young potential and can really bloom into a star that’ll give the 76ers the momentum shift to get over the ecsf hump which will let them recruit hinkie to Complete the Process"
"I bet tyrese maxey probably hasn't even been to the rodin museum or the shofuso japanese house and garden yet. you have to visit these places before you request a trade out of philadelphia, they look incredible"
Can we all just shut the fuck up about Tyrese Maxey already   Dude will be lucky to be a serviceable starter this year and Sixers fans act like he’s Kyrie Irving
"Someone else mentioned that the Sixers should package Tyrese Maxey and Simmons in a three team trade involving the Timberwolves.   Third Team Receives: Maxey, Timberwolves 2022 FRP, Timberwolves 2026 FRP, Jaden McDaniels, and Two Timberwolves FRP Swaps.   Timberwolves Receive: Ben Simmons  76ers Receive: Third Team star player.   I'm not sure which team makes up that third trading partner. Wizards (Beal) or Trailblazers (Lillard). I don't know, man."
best thing for Maxey us to play behind BS anywhere?   Yo Tyrese you deserve better
Tyrese Maxey?
I think it’ll be one of these three.   CJ McCollum   Tyrese Halliburton and Buddy Heild   DLo Russell   And Maxey and Simmons back at the best.
there is no world where it's good for tyrese maxey to be traded to fucking minnesota and play behind d'lo and simmons instead of being the starting PG for the #1 seed and throw lobs to embiid.
"&gt; Like if the best we could get is Bagley, Hield and picks  it's not; his return is probably higher than what reddit thinks, but lower than what morey wants. i'm a portland fan so obviously take this with a grain of salt, but you could literally get cj mccollum, another player or two plus however many picks  we can trade (which can also be flipped) to improve. cj as an actual lead guard (point guard) can give you most likely a consistent 23/3/5. i think even minnesota can attach multiple picks alone with guys like bev (once he reaches his tradeable date) and beasley?  &gt;  I would be fine letting it drag out and not paying him.   so you want to show to embiid (who just locked down long-term guaranteed money aka he's comfortable) an unwillingness to compete to spite ben simmons for a year or two? again, look at ben simmons/anthony davis/paul george/ any other max star that wanted to be traded, etc. we've seen how insignificant signing these deals are to them to reaching that goal if they want out? i get he's been playing tennis with morey, but i've also watched dame spit ""loyalty"" for nine years just to have this off-season come about.  &gt; We’re a first or second round exit either way   your ceiling sans simmons is a first round exit max, not sure why second round is added lol you lack a significant primary ball hander if he decides to not actually suit up unless tyrese maxey turns into an league leading assist leader.  the same 6ers fans that are saying ""let ben sit and fine him"" are the ones who are saying portland would be idiotic to do the exact same thign with dame.  &gt; I’m fine giving Nerlens lawyers more evidence to use against Rich Paul.  also wouldn't do shit. one person is saying ""he didn't have my best interest in mind"" while other top nba talents (lavine) continue to sign to him lol"
"Minnesota: Simmons Philadelphia: Damian Lillard Portland: 2022 FRP Minnesota, 2023 FRP Philadelphia, 2024 FRP Minnesota, 2025 FRP Philadelphia, Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, and Tyrese Maxey to Portland"
What? Tyrese Maxey is perfectly capable of thinking and speaking for himself and if he’s not doing that then he deserves whatever happens with regards to this report...which I 100% would question the validity of before questioning Rich Paul’s intentions.    In any context he’s an adult who can fire his agent at any time if he’s not acting in his best interest.
You also added the pick that turned into tyrese maxey
That’s fucked up that Tyrese Maxey is being dragged into this. If he’s not with this he should fire Bitch Paul asap
Or maybe the second the Sixers start confirming Nerlens claims there is Rich Paul drama with Ben Simmons AND Tyrese Maxey? Rich Paul officially has a vendetta and wants klutch out of Philly
Tyrese Maxey is a grown man and can make his own decision. He wants to leave too.
Ben Simmons wants out so now there’s a report that Tyrese Maxey has to be included too because they’re in the same agency. What other agency has things like that?
"&gt;If I’m Tyrese Maxey, I’m firing Rich Paul. Lol. Ben Simmons gone would immediately increase Maxey’s minutes and might even put him in the starting lineup, depending on who they get back in the trade.  &gt;If I’m a player, and I hear my agent wants me to be traded because my agent doesn’t want me on that team, that agent is immediately fired. Like, through a text, the instant I find out. The agent is there to represent the player’s interest, not their own."
"Players want to play ball and they trust their agents to handle off-court stuff and have their best interests at heart. That level of trust can be abused, as is being contended by Rich Paul's own former client in the lawsuit against him. Rich Paul absolutely has a higher profile, more notoriety, and more power in NBA circles than Tyrese Maxey does. And it's not even close. It is absolutely possible that a young player could be swayed and convinced of something by his powerful advisor.  Basically, this argument has two sides. The side saying Rich Paul is driving this has multiple pieces of publicly reported evidence of why he'd be doing that: the report that started this whole thread, the fact that the relationship between the Sixers and Simmons has completely disintegrated, the fact that a former client is suing Rich Paul, and the fact that the Sixers organization recently supported Noel's story that is the basis of that lawsuit.  The side saying Maxey is the aggressor in this has ""he's a grown man"" and ""maybe there's something none of us know about."" I'm going to take the side that has multiple pieces of publicly reported evidence. You're more than welcome to disagree, but that's really the end of any discussion on this."
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
"I am suggesting that based on Nerlens Noel's comments, Rich Paul's allegiance to his clients is questionable and he may be trying to get Tyrese Maxey out of Philly against Maxey's own interests"
"I’m not trying to make fuckin judgements about maxey’s maturity. I’m just saying that if you think he woke up today and said, “I, tyrese maxey, bench player, will demand a trade today, coincidentally the exact same day rich paul ramps up pressure on a ben simmons trade”, instead of the explanation that klutch is abusing his power, ur nuts."
"Tyrese Maxey (or any 2nd yr player for that matter) does not have the leverage to hold out and force a trade.  And Rich Paul has no leverage with the Sixers to force anything with Maxey.  Rich Paul may want to move Maxey out of Philly, but Philly does not have to do jack shit.  Sixers hold the cards as to whether or where Maxey is traded.  Maxey and Paul have little say in the matter."
"So first of all, my apologies for throwing you under the bus. But secondly it absolutely could be an example of negligence. You claim to defend Nerlens but Rich Paul by no means acted in his best interest. Why are you giving him a pass now? Have you spoken to Tyrese Maxey? I doubt he’d fire the guy within minutes of hearing a Tweet"
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
"a fireable occurrence ≠ no chance Maxey explicitly asked for it because he didn’t fire the single most powerful and famous agent in the league. I really don’t see how a second year player who the league at large has no reason to give a shit about not firing his megastar agent who clearly has a lot of influence over his clients means that this is the only way it could happen because you think it’s impossible.   Change Tyrese Maxey to someone who’s been in the league for a while, like on their second contract and Rich Paul to pretty much any other agent and I’d agree. But literally everything that’s been presented has said nothing about Maxey being urgent to leave.   So no, “Maxey may not be *against* being moved isn’t all you’re saying because you then go on to say that he himself requested the move with no evidence, and while it COULD be true, there’s literally no evidence yet to support that: Tyrese Maxey wanted out of Philly after his age-20 rookie season he used Rich Paul, who is managing some of the biggest stars in the league and is **notorious** for shunning lower level players, to demand a trade away from a contender because…why?  Please tell me why if Maxey explicitly wanted a move, which is very different from being indifferent if you’re traded, Rich Paul would go out of his way, while being sued, to frame it like he just doesn’t want his clients in Philly. That’s way more fucking absurd than an agent with more power than his client leveraging his player that isn’t in high demand for any good agencies in the league. What does Maxey have to gain by firing Rich Paul if Paul is incessantly telling Maxey that Philly is bad for him and gonna fuck him over. Paul influencing this decision more than Maxey makes way more sense to me than Maxey using Rich Paul to get out, only for Rich Paul to take all of the media heat for influencing the decision. The dude is being sued and this would be a really odd route to take (framing it as Paul not wanting his clients there) considering his image is in shambles and he’s being sued."
Imagine using Ben Simmons as salary filler in a Tyrese Maxey trade
"&gt; I don’t see how Tyrese fucking Maxey has the pull to just walk to the FO and ask for a trade.  That's why he's using his power agent   &gt;but Rich Paul actively trying to turn Maxey against Philly   Regardless of how it ended up there, Maxey not firing Paul means he HAD to be on board with it."
"I don’t see how Tyrese fucking Maxey has the pull to just walk to the FO and ask for a trade. It makes no sense, imo. I obviously don’t know what happened, but Rich Paul actively trying to turn Maxey against Philly so he eventually believes he wants to get out is more realistic to me than him going to Daryl Morey and asking to be moved. He has no leverage."
"If I’m Tyrese Maxey, I’m firing Rich Paul. Lol. Ben Simmons gone would immediately increase Maxey’s minutes and might even put him in the starting lineup, depending on who they get back in the trade.  If I’m a player, and I hear my agent wants me to be traded because my agent doesn’t want me on that team, that agent is immediately fired. Like, through a text, the instant I find out. The agent is there to represent the player’s interest, not their own."
You know you're in the Tyrese Maxey thread right? We're pissed because Rich Paul is pulling another one of his clients in response to the team's head coach and star player finally being a little bit honest in a press conference after babying him every single day for the entire season (multiple seasons in Embiids case where he always said the right thing and never created any controversy between himself and Simmons)
Rich Paul is the most powerful agent in the NBA. Tyrese is 20 years old and entering his second year. It's not ridiculous to suggest that Rich could sway Maxey into doing things against his best interests
Maxey could be in line to be the starting PG for Philly next season and Rich Paul wants him out for what? Because they didn’t trade Ben fast enough? If Im Tyrese im looking into different agents because clearly Rich doesn’t have my best interest in mind
Imagine being unwilling to give up Tyrese Maxey for James Harden but probably including him in another trade for a lesser player one year later.  Probably sucks ass for Morey and FO.
Tyrese Maxey
Why did reports say talks ended after tyrese maxey wasnt included?
"really confident: Domantas Sabonis. i don’t think people realize how close he is to averaging a triple double and he’s only 24. if he can get 1 or 2 threes a game and up his free throws, he’s gonna be like 25/12/8 lmao  somewhat confident: Tyrese Maxey. he loves the big moment and will take and make clutch shots. a crazy amount of different finishes from both hands at the rim. willing and pesky defender. if he can shoot off the bounce, i think it can happen   Shot in the dark: Desmond Bane. a flamethrower and he seems to have made a leap in summer league. needs to get to the line a lot, but i think can be a star"
I’m really biased by Tyrese Maxey has all the intangibles and physical skill to get there. If he improves his 3 point percentage then he can get there
Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese Maxey will have a Jimmy Butler type career. Late first round pick who basically wills himself into becoming an all star.  Landry Shamet will hit a Ray Allen/Robert Horry type shot to win a championship.
Just play Tyrese Maxey more
"[Your trade](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ydq36oh9) has the Kings giving up the best player and getting the scraps from a team even worse than them and Tyrese Maxey in return. The Kings are trying to make the playoffs (whether that is smart or not is a different question) but if they were giving up, they wouldn't make this trade without getting Anthony Edwards in return."
Yes I guess but I also doubt Tyrese Maxey was forcing Simmons to work on improving his jumper like the Sixers would
"Uh no, James harden was available and you decided tyrese maxey was too much, then you didn’t trade for lowry"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"Depending on how the Simmons trade goes, Tyrese Maxey could be one to watch"
"Cam Reddish, Saddiq Bey. Jordan Poole I'm not that sold yet, hope it was not just preseason fluke. Desmond Bane. Jordan Nwora. Mo Bamba. Tyrese Maxey. Keldon Johnson."

Naw I think we could have scraped by with a dub if *Prime Michael Jordan* was starting instead of Danny Green or Tyrese Maxey. Just my opinion though.
lol he just broke Tyrese Maxey off something nice
B-b-b-b-but muh Tyrese Maxey is gonna be an All-Star this season
Tyrese Maxey looks like he's running even when he's standing still
Rip Tyrese Maxey GBNF 😔
Tyrese Maxey DPOY?
"Now this Tyrese Maxey guy, I tells ya"
"He’s getting better on offense but that’s what was expected of him and he’s delivered in the defense. Also, look at those drafted after him. Is there really that many people we’d take over him if given the chance to redraft? Saddiq Bey? Isaiah Stewart? Tyrese Maxey? That’s about it, and they were all drafted way after our pick.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/isaac-okoro-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-offense-defense-analysis/"
"They are thinking all their picks and pick swaps for 7 years, all their crypto, Pat's and Gino's, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, and Tyrese Maxey for Damian Lillard and a Dutch Bros. Location.  Edit: Neil Olshey hangs up then calls Philadelphia Police to do a wellness check on Daryl Morey."
Tyrese Maxey
"I know there’s a ton of Ben Simmons hate going around, and this is not that. But Tyrese Maxey just might make the 76ers better at some moments. Because defense is all great and wonderful, but it doesn’t help when you’re not putting the ball in the basket and moving it down the court. Maxey does those two things better."
"Injured guard Shake Milton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Furkan Korkmaz gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Tyrese Maxey yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Simmons hit the locker room door, current NBA great Joel Embiid hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"You’re acting like Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are role players and aren’t stars. Your point basically proves moreys point. And yes we don’t need another super star but we need another star pg who can distribute and shit create. What role players do we need? We are stacked on role players. We have a very solid bench. Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe, Andre Drummond, Niang, Thybulle. Thybulle and Drummond provide good defense. Drummond provides good rebounding. They are all solid at defending. Korkmaz brings the shot creation and ball distribution, Joe and Niang are very good catch and shoot players. And then in our starting lineup we have three very solid role players, Curry, Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey. So which role players do you propose that make us into a title contender huh? 1-2 solid role players and we are just pushing out players like Joe and Maxey who are developing very nicely. The fact is we need another 20+ ppg player who can be relied upon on the perimeter in the fourth"
Tyrese Maxey Szn
"Mostly boxing out, 2 or 3 of the classic Drummond rebounding his own missed layup, and he nearly flattened Tyrese Maxey for 1 rebound midway through the 4th lmao"
Tyrese Maxey in his first legit start looked really nice. Happy to see that for sure
Tyrese Maxey is a good defender but idk if NAW even sees him there
Tyrese Maxey is going to make all these guys look pedestrian. Wait and see.
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
"Trade suggestion:  * **PHI gets**: Damian Lillard * **LAL gets**: CJ McCollum, Norman Powell * **POR gets**: Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Maxey, Ben Simmons, 2022 FRP (via PHI), 2024 FRP (via PHI), 2026 FRP (via PHI), 2028 FRP (via PHI), 2025 FRP (via LAL)"
"I saw that too...especially on 538 which is super interesting.  Especially because historically, they are right around .500 with Embiid and no Simmons.  I think models just love their role players which is fair.  But is Tyrese Maxey ready to be a starting NBA point guard?  I like him but I just don't think so, especially on defense."
Tyrese maxey is a winner?
"The most damning part of this article:  &gt; ""On Sunday and Monday, he completed less than a handful of total defensive drills at practice — nothing more, nothing less. He played a few defensive stands in a scrimmage on Sunday. On Monday, Simmons participated in **one** drill, talking more to G League coaches than his 76ers coaches as the first team went through preparation for the opener in New Orleans with Tyrese Maxey in Simmons’ place in the starting lineup, sources said. Throughout his first two days of practice, Simmons **did not sprint** in a live scrimmage setting. He conducted some one-on-one work with coaches, working up a sweat.  If I'm an NBA GM, I'm not touching Simmons with a fucking 50-foot-pole. Put in the effort or just get out of the league."
Tyrese Maxey MIP run
Tyrese Maxey: I want to go home!
I have a lot of faith in Tyrese Maxey. Kid has a lot of potential and a lot more heart than Ben
"But they’ll throw in Tyrese Maxey, too! Simmons is really just salary filler in that trade! /s"
"They’ll be like “Tyrese Maxey is amazing, we love this guy.” even if Tyrese is just average because they’re so sick of the drama."
No they didn’t want to get rid of tyrese maxey
Are you really naive enough to think that Daryl Morey wouldn't part with *Tyrese Maxey* in order to acquire **James Harden**?   Come on.
"Tyrese Maxey, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Darius Garland, Rui Hachimura and screw it, ALL of Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba (BUY MAGIC STOCK!)"
"* Haliburton's play falls off a cliff. * Lakers are the 2 seed but a second round exit * Sixers play better with Tyrese Maxey starting at point guard than with Ben * De'Aaron Fox All-Star * Nets don't make it past the ECF, again * Bucks play badly to start the season, end up with the 4th seed but go to the Finals again * The Nuggets make it to the Finals * Jayson Tatum MVP"
Tyrese Maxey has a breakout season that allows the 6ers to move on from Ben and get good value still
Tyrese Maxey MIP FMVP you heard it here first
Also Tyrese Maxey
"*Jerami Grant for Ilyasova AND the first round pick that became Tyrese Maxey. A lot of Sixers fans [thought it was a decent deal at the time] (https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/5al2p9/the_76ers_have_traded_jerami_grant/) because Grant couldn’t shoot and was stuck behind other players.       I point this out because people act like the Process was infallible, like Hinkie did nothing wrong and Brand/Colangelo did everything wrong. So Hinkie would never have chosen Okafor but the organization made him, etc etc."
"Tyrese maxey, Matisse thybulle (all defensive 2nd team on roughly 20mpg), some picks and pick swaps on top of ben Simmons is the best offer unless okc decide to give up a lot of their picks"
Give me tyrese Maxey! He looked like a real contributor last season for PHI and hopefully can take another leap this year
"He’s in the same conversation as Tyrese Maxey. Genuine star potential, but not there yet. The bonafide superstars like Luka are in a separate category, and there is no shame in not being in their category."
"Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, 3 1st round picks for Kyrie?"
"Lol when KAT inevitably requests trade, we'll offer Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, and 2 1sts a.k.a. Beasley, McDaniels, Prince and 2 1sts. Maybe even less considering he has 1 less All-Star appearance than Simmons and has not shown an ability to contribute to winning basketball."
So you play Tyrese Maxey over Ben? Then the Hawks still win and he still gets the blame for playing a rookie over an all-star. That's just a lose/lose situation no matter what.  Give me an alternative of what you would have done.  The fact of the matter is that Philly doesn't have a 2nd scoring option and haven't had one since Jimmy so this was their ceiling regardless.
"&gt;Saying Ball got here because ""his daddy sending him around the world to gain experience for the league"" is disingenuous because Wiseman could have done the same thing.  Dude, I don't know if you know, but Wiseman's family was in poverty before he got a NBA contract. Lavar lives in a mansion in Chino Hills. LaMelo was driving Lamborghinis before he graduated high school. Not only that, Lavar was raking in millions from his business, special appearances, and Facebook exclusive show. When you are struggling to make ends meet, you can't just get up and move to an entirely new country at will.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;talk about moving the goalposts. He was expected to be the starting center for a team that has championship aspirations.     Two things can be at the same time. I don't know how many Warriors games you watched, but they were piss poor at center when facing bigger teams. Their front-court was always their biggest issue. When facing players like Embiid, Atyon, Gobert, Valančiūnas, and Jokic, the Warriors simply had no answer for them. That required Curry and Co. to work much harder to score because Draymond and whatever center they had couldn't make a shot past 6 feet. All long as Curry, Thompson, and Green share the floor together, the Warriors will always have championship aspirations. Wiseman needed time to get acclimated to the physicality of the NBA. Like I said before, dude was a high schooler playing against grown men who are more aggressive and physical than him.   Look, we can go back and forth on this, but I am not changing my mind. I support my favorite team and their players through thick and thin. I am more invested in being entertained than stressing out about who is better than who. Hell, Patrick Williams and Tyrese Maxey shocked everyone with how good they were, but I don't see Warriors fans dwelling on passing them up. Wiseman is a good kid and I want him to be successful. I didn't grow up much different than him, so I am rooting for him. If we still have a Reddit account a few years from now, we can get back in touch to see if the Wiseman experience pans out. Hopefully, you won't jump ship in the meantime."
Can we shut up about fucking Tyrese Maxey already? Jesus
"&gt;Also, the development of young guys like Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle will be crucial for Philly  It's in the subtitle."
"Well, we are better off if he plays vs relying on tyrese maxey or shake milton to be our starting PGs, so there's that at least."
"&gt; ""I felt good,"" he said. ""The first game -- I felt pretty good. Playing against Toronto is always a challenge for me. Not necessarily a challenge, but these are the types of games where I'm really focused on passing the ball and inviting double teams, and kicking it out. This is not the type of team I'm going to go out and score 50 because they are going to double and triple-team on every single possession.""  &gt;In past years, Raptors head coach Nick Nurse has proven that he can draw up a defensive game plan to get under Joel Embiid's skin. So, heading into Thursday night's game, the big man joked with another teammate that he knew he wasn't going to score much in his first preseason game since it was against Toronto.  &gt;”My focus coming into tonight was, I told Tyrese (Maxey) I was gonna have zero points and ten assists,"" Embiid said. ""I was trying to get guys and figure out how to be a better passer. A few turnovers here and there, but we can always get better."""
"At the rate some users on r/Sixers are going, pretty soon you’ll be able to add Tyrese Maxey to the list. :/   (If you’re reading this tyrese I believe in you)"
That's gonna be Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey
"What, Tyrese Maxey and some picks? Come on bro."

Who is he gonna consult? Tyrese Maxey?
"I think the raptors have the biggest draw. The raptors develop anything and treat people with respect.   It's a big city with media stars like drake. Jb and the weekend pulling up from time to time.   Trade Fred vanvleet , since he's a versatile scorer and decent passer avg 6 assist. With Chris boucher , Goran dragic for Phillies draft pics next 2 years and Tyrese Maxey, Isiah Joe rookie too.   I say by November when the raptors have a slow star when they realize pascal siakam isn't the  the first option type of guy but a co star."
"I think if the Simmons drama plays out into the regular season and the 76'ers don't have a trade,  Tyrese Maxey could have a breakout year as well.  My top 4 are Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole and  Tyrese Maxey"
"Considering how much playing time he should get with the Simmons disaster, Tyrese Maxey should see a notable jump.   He averaged 8.0/1.7/2.0 last year. Wouldn’t surprise me to see him go for 17/4/4 pretty quickly as a starter"
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I’m not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I’m really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"
"Patrick Williams, Onyeka Okongwu, Josh Green, Tyrese Maxey. When in doubt, bet on youth."
Tyrese Maxey. At least he can run a PnR. They’d be better off with literally any point guard that can shoot
I mean despite his flaws Ben Simmons has averaged 17 8 and 8 before and was runner up for DPOY. He’s 25 and has a pretty high ceiling considering he has quite a bit to improve on offense. Tyrese Maxey is a second year player and according to most accounts was one of the main sticking points in a potential Harden trade. What else would you trade Beal or Lillard for? I think you’re actually underestimating Bens true value. His value has been lowered mostly by this situation but as a talent most teams would love to have him.
Ben got outplayed by Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey is listed as Albanian, interesting"
"Yeah well it's Tyrese Maxey by a wide margin now so again not sure what response this is lol. We know what we're walking into, far better to think long term about our team than panic because we're not winning games in October November and December. Everyone is excited about their team and roster now, give it 20 games when someone is 5-15 and I'm sure it'll be worth waiting. We will see"
"Joel had 1 practice with Tyrese Maxey running the show and said, this shit is disrespectful."
"According to [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2477680/2021/03/25/exploring-george-hills-fit-kyle-lowrys-absence-and-the-sixers-needs-after-the-nba-trade-deadline/), the Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.  And Raptors fans laugh at Morey for what he's asking them for Ben."
I wonder if that unnamed agent is none other than Rich Paul!  (Also reps Tyrese Maxey)
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
"Alternative universe: Sixers trade Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and multiple 1st rd picks, for Curry and Klay. Sixers roll out a small ball lineup of Steph-Klay-DG-Tobias-Simmons.. Matisse and Seth off the bench. SHEESH."
"https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/kwqgcx/jason_dumas_source_the_rockets_asked_for_ben/  **[Jason Dumas] Source: The Rockets asked for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, and a number of unprotected draft picks in compensation for James Harden.**   *For reference, the 76ers couldn't give up 3 or 4 picks without OKC joining the trade so it's likely just 2 FRP in the trade.

(-5)  __________________  &gt; Yeah you’re right, Simmons has showed a ton of improvement so it only makes sense to rely on that /s (-4)"
Matisse is what he is imo. An elite defender and a terrible offensive player. In the modern NBA that basically makes him a really good bench player or a mediocre starter.  Tyrese Maxey is younger and has more room to improve. I think last year Matisse was clearly better but I expect Maxey to make a leap this year. This might be homerism but I could see him being a good stater this year or next.  Therefore I take Maxey on potential.
Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey are both relatively young players on the Philadelphia 76ers.
Matisse is the guy from the bubble. I have no fucking idea who Tyrese Maxey is.
"Besides Embiid, the Sixers have Tobias Harris (a serviceable starter), and 3 players that really should be the 6th man on a championship team in Danny Green, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey. I don't see where the Championship level depth is.  Compare that to their competition with the Nets with Harden, Durant and Kyrie and the Bucks with Giannis, Middleton and Holiday. You can pretty easily see that the Sixers aren't contenders this year and won't be unless they get a Middleton/Kyrie level of player back for Simmons, which is looking increasingly unlikely."
"I mean, look at tyrese maxey. He was a steal for us."
The Sixers' backup point guards in this span were Raul Neto and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Their backup centers were Al Horford and Dwight Howard.
Huh? In what way is Rich Paul a source in any of this? This quote is directly from Tyrese Maxey.
"Ben and Joel had a +17.7 net rating as a duo in the playoffs last season, and in the 2018-19 playoffs (Ben was hurt for 2019-20), they had a +20.0.   The problem has literally never been the on court fit between Ben and Joel, they and the starters as a whole have always pulled their weight.   The problems start when one or both of them comes off the floor. Our backups PGs have been TJ McConnell and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Our backups centers have been Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe, Boban, and a 35 year old Dwight Howard. That’s where 90% of our problems have stemmed from."
Tyrese Maxey will be a top 5 PG in the league in the next couple years.
Philly would have a championship already if they'd done whatever it took to get the Harden trade through with Simmons. Instead they get held up over Tyrese Maxey and the trade falls through...like come on lmao.   Embiid+Harden is a chip.

Tyrese Maxey
We were 8-2 and first place in the East when Embiid went into health and safety protocols.  The fact that we managed to stay above 0.500 is a testament to how much Tyrese Maxey stepped up and how well our bench played.
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."

"Tyrese maxey for sure. Mann is a pretty good defender and is useful enough offensively and can do several things - shoot, drive, and make some passes. But maxey is at a different level on offense and has the ability to bend the defense and create attacking situations by himself which I think is at a premium in the nba. Even though he is a poor defender, I’d probably have him. Mann may be more useful to a “win now” team tho. Quickley is also pretty good on offense but I think he’s a level below maxey"
Mike Muscala hitting a meaningless gsme winner which conveyed their first round pick to the sixers instead of 2 2nds.   That pick would be Tyrese Maxey. If not for Maxey the loss of Ben could have this sixers squad really hurting
"Tyrese Maxey for sure, he's shown the most out of all of those guys imo."
"Immanuel Quickley, Bones Hyland, and Tyrese Maxey are the new generation of microwave scoring guards"
"we are closer to a first round exit than a finals contender  theres no flow to the offense (even with Ben we never really had any flow), really suck at limited fast break offense, are hurt without Ben to defend the best players, and still lack any type of perimeter play maker shot maker.  If Ben came back and it was water under the bridge we still have a lot of problems but we have more problems without him.   The only dynamic players on the team that can do more than one thing are a 2nd year player in Tyrese Maxey (hot start but cant be sold on him yet) and Joel Embiid.  We have way too many one note players and still no guards/wings that can get their own shot at the end of a game.  It is too easy to swarm Embiid, he needs a release valve."
"Tyrese Maxey, Lu Dort"
"It's tough when you are getting old, have never taken care of your body and are literally overweight. Bruh, WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR if not taking care of yourself, not partying and eating like a madman.       And then the competition committee outlawed his cheating ways. House of Cards motherfuckers and it is burning.      I'm actually glad we didn't trade Ben and Maxey for him. At least Young Socialite has washboard abs and I'll ride and die with Tyrese"

"Although great on assists this game, this is where Tyrese Maxey just can’t match Ben Simmons play making ability. The Sixers are hurting."
"it’s cuz curry and the warriors beat the sixers practice squad (where seth curry and tyrese maxey are the best players for them)everyone was blowing up about how curry is the mvp and the narrative is “wow look at curry for leading his team to victory after down by 19pts”. yet when the suns beat a team like the timborwolves or cavs without blowing them out, the narrative is “wow the suns struggled against a g-league team🤡🤡”. the suns go on a 15 win streak which is almost gonna be a historical winstreak and ppl make every excuse they can to discredit it. i love curry and i was lokey a warriors bandwagon in 2016 but the amount of praise they get rn is annoying."
Tyrese Maxey
Ok buddy. Keep on believing that Tyrese Maxey is going to somehow win MIP this year.
Cole Anthony and Tyrese Maxey are second year players so they're basically disqualified from the conversation.
"Ok. Compared to last year he is:  +2.7 ppg, +1.1 rebounds, +2.8 assists  Miles Bridges is:  +7.5 ppg, +1.5 rebounds, +1.1 assists  Tyrese Maxey is:  +10.7 ppg, +1.8 rebounds, +1.8 assists  Cole Anthony is:  +7.3 ppg, +1.9 rebounds, +1.8 assists  I’m sorry but Dejounte isn’t even close to the improvement those 3 have."
"Indeed. I crinched at how Tyrese Maxey was getting to the line against the Warriors, he initiatied almost all of the contact on all his calls. It was the same move over and over again, the Harden special, jump into the defender and flail like you’ve just been shot. It was horrible, I’m glad the Warriors won."
Tyrese maxey should get some recognition here
"As far as this year is concerned, I’ll just take Maxey and Ben on the bench over a PG that shoots worse and gets paid way more than Tyrese."
Tyrese Maxey breakout and Suns continue to dominate
"1 - it's not about being the main guy, it's about having strong play that contributes to championship equity. Ant has not done that to the level that Simmons has.  2 - your first sentence is a huge reach. Simmons made All-NBA because he was one of the best defensive players in the league while still being an effective offensive force. He got All-NBA because he was considered a top 20 player in the NBA, while Ant may not be a top 50 player. Tyrese Maxey is a better n1 option than Gobert or Draymond, that does not make him better."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"

Tyrese Maxey is impressive.  Kid is not afraid of the moment.
Tyrese Maxey is basically DeAron Fox lite (honestly for much of this season hes probably been better than Fox). His first step is nasty. Obviously the 76ers are severely undermanned with Embiid and Tobias and Ben not playing but I love their pieces.   Also shout out Looney for straight up taking Drummond's lunch money all game. Drummond is not a starter quality player at this point.
Tyrese Maxey been holding it down though and he's looking to be a really good player for Philly.
"We were fucked soon as Poole hit that half court triple, honestly. Shame we fell apart but like, this roster is seemingly being held together by the Duct Tape Duo in Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey.  Excited to see JoJo back."
"Oh right the Sixers still have Tyrese ""God"" Maxey"
"lol Fitz  ""It didn't look like a foul live, and after review it's not going to be a foul on Tyrese Maxey...""  Such a gracious way to acknowledge that call was dogshit"
Yo tyrese maxey is so fun to watch. He's literally saved this season for me shit was so toxic in sixer land and he's literally so much better than even the biggest homers thought
BRB starting a Tyrese Maxey fan club
"Tyrese ""MVP"" Maxey"
"CP3 trade was bad? You do know how close that team was taking down the historically great Warriors.   And let’s see, he discovered Patrick Beverly, Chandler Parson, Clint Capella, Tyrese Maxey. Traded for Seth Curry, got rid of Al Horford contract while picking up Danny Green. Harden trade was definitely not his only good transaction.   Oh, btw. Simmons was the one who requested the trade. Team fined him when he claimed that he had mental issue m, but refused to cooperate and provide any update.  If you tell you boss you need a mental break. Your boss will probably let you take few days off. But after taking a break for couple weeks, don’t you think your boss has the right to ask you provide any update or a give them a doctor note?"

"Like, the next guy to come out of nowhere and win an MVP? Ja’s got MVP potential but everybody already knows that.  Maybe Tyrese Maxey. Feels like that guy’s real close to putting something special together. If not him… Miles Bridges maybe? Those are two really special players who I could see making a leap and waking up as top ten players a year or two from now and coming top 3 in MVP voting. They could be superstars."

"Tyrese Maxey 28 pts on 9/17 shooting and 9/9 fts, 8 asts and 0 turnovers."

"Maybe.   Can you beat Brooklyn or Milwaukee or Miami with a starting backcourt of CJ McCollum+Tyrese Maxey?  I don't know. Maybe. He's 30, so he sort-of fits the timeline. I still don't know that I'd take a Philly team with McCollum to make the Conference Finals."
"I got to work with Tyrese lately for my job and he was such a pleasant human. I’m pistons fan, but he made me a Maxey fan for life. Great dude."

If he continues with his numbers and improvement Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese maxey has been fantastic for the 6ers. Toronto has struck gold with Barnes.
Tyrese Maxey
Biased answer: tyrese maxey.     Unbiased answer: tyrese maxey
I’m pushing the Tyrese Maxey all star narrative
"A brief explanation -   John Wall team failed  2012-we won  2015 team - Went 38-1 record, Harrison twin dribbled it off his leg in crunch time. /r/nba notoriously has bad college bball takes imo, they will badly argue that Devin Booker/Tyler Ulis should have been playing instead but forget that Harrison twins had one of the all time miracle runs in the 2014 NCAA tournament to take Kentucky to the finals. Devin Booker also could not guard a lamp post in college, so the Harrison twins were the correct decision, it's just really hard to go 40-0 at Kentucky.   2017 - Fox/Monk/Bam team had their hopes dashed by John Higgins referee making calls like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j5d4ixo_k) throughout the game. Even though the biased referee tried to make us lose, the game still came down to one shot which North Carolina made. Had they missed that shot I believe we would have won a championship.   Immanuel Quickey/Tyrese Maxey year - This team was hitting their strides at the end of the year and I was convinced we would get to at least a Final Four and then Covid happened and the tournament was cancelled. Convince me this team didn't have a good shot when these two are so good. Quickley had the outside shooting, both of them could score floaters at will, and Maxey lives for the big time moments. Too bad we didn't get to see them shine together."
I think that’s part of the reason Tyrese Maxey looks so good his floater is very good. Might have one of the best floaters in the NBA already.
"That's going to be true with Ben Simmons, without Ben Simmons, or after a Ben Simmons trade if they don't actually get a true difference maker.  And FWIW, maybe they already have that difference maker on the roster in Tyrese Maxey."
TYRESE MAXEY IS BETTER THAN ANTHONY EDWARDS. HE AVERAGES A BETTER 3P% THAN EDWARDS DOES FG%
"is bad shooting really better than no shooting? And defense is half the game and Simmons literally does that at a DPOY level caliber.  I think if that offer came with Tyrese Maxey, I'd do it for the Kings, but I'm also really high on Maxey as a positive impact player who could cover the gap offensively. I wouldn't trade Maxey as the Sixers though."
At least that trade got you guys Tyrese Maxey (from what I believe)
"That's an interesting conclusion because I think the exact opposite. I love Tyrese and he's had an amazing start but it's clear he is a combo guard not a point guard. The type of guy we spent so much capital trying to pair with Ben.   The only numbers he has that are not wildly impressive are his assist numbers. But that's because he is not a point guard he is a score first guard. And as a guy essentially running point the fact that he doesn't turn the ball over is great but it should be expected because he has so few assists. So I think if we're discussing Ben trades maybe we don't need as dynamic as a scorer as we might have thought, maybe we need a facilitator first and if he can't score as well himself that's fine because Maxey is here.   He and Embiid essentially share PG duties right now. That's good for both of their development but not ideal."
Tyrese Maxey is better than Anthony Edwards
"be almost got dragged in when jason dumas was like “rich paul client tyrese maxey also wants out” and then a week later walked it back, and then at media say maxey was like “yeah i have no idea where that came from lol”"
"Fun fact, Maxey is the second Tyrese ever to be drafted in the NBA."
"the thing that Tyrese makes interesting is that before i was like you have to trade Ben for a pg, because if you don't, then who the hell are you gonna get out there to run point   now i see these Ben for Fox trades and i'm like no.. get a sg or another wing in there  honestly tho, Maxey/Seth/Tobias/Ben/Embiid, that's a legit contender   it's essentially last years roster, except another 16-18 ppg in there"

"Criticizing the historically stupid decisions that philly has made since last season is not proof that people hate them lmao.  First, the sixers were front-runners to acquire Harden with a package around simmons, but they refused to include Tyrese Maxey (who Houston coveted) in trade offers for him. Stupid mistake #1 (source [1](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349436865548595206), [2](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349438067296366592), [3](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349442356181925888), [4](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1349453856569253889), [5](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1406067378253828099))  Then obviously the Simmons playoff meltdown happened. Whatever, shit happens. Even LeBron had a similar meltdown. Move on.   In postgame press conferences after game 7, Doc Rivers said he didn't know if Simmons could be the PG on a championship team and Embiid blamed him for the loss. Stupid mistakes #2 and #3  Then this season starts and Doc/Embiid decide to shit talk him more. Embiid says he is ""done"" with Simmons, and ""does not care about that man."" Doc compares him to trump supporters denying election results. Stupid mistakes #4 and #5  Now, his trade value gets lower by the day because Morey was completely unrealistic about his trade value all offseason. That's #6."
Fucking hell Ben. Lucky y'all won the game or Tyrese Maxey gonna get the start over your ass for game 7.
Tyrese Maxey was much more effective guarding Young.  Ben cannot guard Trae.  I don’t see how that’s not obvious.  He’s a great defender; but that’s not a good matchup.
Tyrese Maxey ofc
"Lou Williams vs Tyrese Maxey, maybe a couple of ft made, so close.. and that blackout momentum killer."
As someone who wanted Tyrese Maxey seeing him ball out like that for Philly makes me feel real weird.
Tyrese maxey was clutch as fuckkk at the end of the philly atl game. Tobias too making all his free throws
Mann and Tyrese Maxey are that spiderman pointing meme right now lol
"What is this? Tyrese Maxey going off in one game, Mann going off in another. Talk about the Spiderman pointing meme..."
Terrence Mann is who Tyrese Maxey thinks he is
Are Terence Mann and Tyrese Maxey the same person?
Hope Ben Simmons plays over Tyrese Maxey in the fourth of game 7.
Tyrese Maxey man. Kid was out of the rotation and played a phenomenal game in the biggest game and mins of the year.    Thank you Mike Muscala
Man credit Sixers for their Defense. Even if they play like ass on offense *cough*Ben Simmons *cough*   They play lockdown defense which you know credit to Ben Simmons on that end.   Tyrese Maxey is a killer
"Without him and Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia would’ve had no shot."
Don't forget 76ers legend Tyrese Maxey
"Tyrese Maxey was great today, not even sure his numbers justify it, kid did good"
"This super long, sorry but I had a lot of feelings. I had so much joy watching Tyrese light it up in the first half while Ben sat on the bench.    Earlier this season when he dropped 39 points against the Nuggets, I posted this: Tyrese Maxey isn't an unearthed precious mineral recovered from the depths of the earth, needing hours and hours of intense labor and hundreds of degree of heat to take form and value. He is a cracked-screen industry-setting next generation phone released 5 years early, akin to an iPhone 6 in 2011. The shards have their bite and it's uncomfortable to use but the daybreak of a new era is only a tempered sheet of glass away. That screen, that window or barrier to the greatest works of humanities brightest minds is a corrected hip sway. It throws his jumper off and leads to inefficient numbers. Once that's resolved, defenses will respect him as a shooter and passing lanes will open up for him in a new way.     This season has proven it's Joel's team, and I think if they don't win a chip this season, it's going to come down to what Joel wants. Tyrese is cheap and he **is** better than Ben but will he be a championship caliber point guard in his second year that can find Joel and Seth in their spots, shoot to keep defenses honest and not lose his cool when the defense focuses on him?    Obvious he's incredible but if the Sixers want someone like Damian Lillard, they'll probably have to trade him to make it work. But I still believe that if Morey attaches enough picks to Ben, the Sixers can get someone decent in return, like CJ McCollum who can be an explosive scorer but isn't a great defender and has injury concerns.    But it comes down to Joel because this is all on his timeline. Does he want to take the risk of having an immature/not-ready PG next year while he's trying to go for a championship or does he want to risk cratering the cap and missing out on playing with a guy who could fulfill all their needs next year. It's a thinker    My goodness! Tyrese! He's been incredible but he used up all of my surprise when I watched him play for Kentucky :)"

Tyrese Maxey showed out tonight.
Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry saved The Process
This game had everything. Blown leads. Hot and cold streaks. Fights. Logo shots. Crazy posterizers and blocks. A blackout. Trae young. Tyrese Maxey. Seth Curry.   Now onto Game 7
Tyrese Maxey looks like Dave Chappelle's Rick James
Tyrese Maxey would slap the shit out of Collins. Now imagine Embiid throwing a punch at his head. That’s a dead man
I don’t watch much Philly basketball so I didn’t know who Tyrese Maxey was prior to this series but he seems like a terrific young player for the 76ers
"5 minutes left in an elimination game that is within 5 points  ""I'm told Tyrese Maxey is a hard worker who goes to the gym after dinner""  What the hell ESPN honestly"
If Simmons shot like Tyrese Maxey they would have been better than this
Don't worry bro I feel a certain starter will start getting to the line more soon  Or he could be benched for Tyrese Maxey who knows
With Embiid making those FT it's clear we are headed to game 7.   Tyrese Maxey is a baller
What a ridiculous call. Rivers should have challenged that. Tyrese Maxey got robbed.
Where were you when Tyrese Maxey saved the Sixers' season?

"When you're getting out beaten all around as a better player by a fucking rookie, Tyrese Maxey! Yea, Ben Simmons gtfo."
Tyrese maxey is so good. Hes playmaking better than Simmons and is scoring better than simmons. The sad part is that playmaking is supposed to be simmons specialty lmao
Tyrese Maxey is nice. Really like his game.
Tyrese Maxey is better than Ben Simmons.
tyrese maxey is really saving the sixers season rn. who would’ve thought lmao
Tyrese “Kobe Bryant” Maxey
Tyrese Maxey looks like Marcus from Juniper Lee lol

Tyrese Maxey and Terrance Mann are like long lost twin brothers.
Tyrese Maxey is giving Philly big minutes here
Tyrese Maxey MVP6MOYROY
Tyrese Maxey won’t be on this team next year lol
Hows the GOAT Tyrese Maxey doing btw?
"&gt; So we’re all gonna sit here and think Tyrese Maxey was the deal breaker to this deal? That the sixers were willing to give up everything else but Maxey?  This seems plausible IMO. There were a ton of reports that Morey was trying to keep Maxey (and that the Rockets really wanted him).   In hindsight, if I were a Rockets fan, I'd be furious with Tilman for turning down Ben Simmons because of Maxey.   Likewise, if I were a Sixers fan, I'd be furious with Morey for possibly letting Maxey get in the way of James Harden."
"So we’re all gonna sit here and think Tyrese Maxey was the deal breaker to this deal? That the sixers were willing to give up everything else but Maxey? Morey would have offered the liberty bell and the Phillie phantic, tilman wasn’t trading harden to Philly."
"Tyrese Maxey is gonna scare the league when he gets more minutes. He’s ridiculously good. Quick as hell with amazing soft touch at the rim, his floater game is money, he can stop on a dime to pull up for a jumper, has no fear taking a shot anywhere on the floor if he’s open, and his defense has improved massively over the year."
I thought this year that even Tyrese Maxey impressed me more then Cole Anthony. Yeah Anthony put up better stats but I’d say you put Maxey on Orlando and he probably been first team rookie.
"The core of a trade where CJ and draft compensation leaves Portland and Ben Simmons goes to Portland seems to fit perfectly for Portland - Ben fills their need of a wing defender, secondary ball handler, rebounder, guy to run the fast break, and a dude who can keep the ball moving on offense, while being the fifth option. Meanwhile they get to move on from one of their two starting SGs to get an actual wing. Dame/Norm/Ben/RoCo/Nurk is an incredible roster.   I think the Sixers could turn some combination  of CJ, Seth, Danny, picks, and young players (thybulle, maxey, etc) into a SF and/or PG. maybe Marcus Smart for Danny Green and a 1st, that way you have your ball handler and defense.   All you need at that point is a SF in return for CJ or Seth plus picks and/or young guys, and maybe George Hill as filler. Maybe some combination of George Hill, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and 1sts for Jerami Grant? I could see Detroit being interested in Maxey, Milton, and 1sts.   Smart/CJ/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Seth as sixth man looks really solid to me."
"Thats not what you offered thats what masai wanted.   ""The Philadelphia 76ers are interested in acquiring Kyle Lowry, but there is a limit to how much they will offer the Toronto Raptors in a potential deal.  ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on First Take (h/t Kyle Neubeck of Philly Voice) the Sixers won't package Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle and draft picks together for Lowry.  Windhorst noted that the Raptors want all of those pieces, which include first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, to send Lowry to Philadelphia."""
I got to see my boy tyrese maxey drop 39. I was happy lol

"Danny Green, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias. Mike Scott, who has a left knee contusion, was upgraded and will dress but is not likely to see playing time, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said.  Sizers beat writer on The Athletic"
"“And Tyrese Maxey throws up the lob to Reed, got it!!!. That cuts the Denver lead to 50.”"
Tyrese Maxey really about to drop 30
They also called Tyrese Maxey Shake Milton at one point. They're a mess.
"&gt; we traded him for ersan which immediately made us competitive  PHI was 20-32 during Ersan's 1st year there, that's not exactly competitive.   I hope Ersan wasn't the reason to trade Grant, because he was barely on the team. PHI traded for him in November 2016, and then traded him away to ATL in February 2017 for Tiago Splitter and a 2nd rounder (PHI sent 1 2nd, got 2 2nds back).  My best guess is the main reason Grant was traded was for the conditional 1st from OKC. But that turned into a disaster.   After trading Grant for the OKC pick, PHI then traded the OKC pick and a 2nd to ORL for Anzejs Pasecniks, who never even put on a Sixers jersey (he's now on WAS). Then PHI traded Fultz to ORL to get the OKC pick back. PHI used that prodigal pick a few months ago to draft Tyrese Maxey.  So basically, PHI traded Grant and Fultz for Maxey."

imagine being able to stop embiid but not tyrese maxey 😩
Tyrese Maxey is nice
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Is Tyrese Maxey the 6ers best perimeter creator? (Psst... yes)
Tyrese Maxey
A first round pick that ended up being their rookie Tyrese Maxey
"I mean, the Sixers have  3 max players but also have a very solid supporting cast. Seth Curry, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, all of those are players any fan would love to have on their team."

Be honest.   Would you rather have drafted Tyrese Maxey or Killian Hayes?
"Ashton hagans, Tyler herro, keldon Johnson, tyrese maxey"
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"

How has Tyrese Maxey been?
"Also Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey are infinitely better back up point guards than TJ McConnell (or Neto, or Burks, or Burke, or Fultz)"

Why does it feel like every decision Tyrese Maxey makes on the floor is the right decision?? Dude has been amazing to watch
"Maxey, Tyrese"
tyrese maxey. yall will find out soon enough
Tyrese Maxey.
Nah.  Michael Jordan is a worse Tyrese Maxey.
Serious Question: is Tyrese Maxey a better Michael Jordan?
I do but it belongs to Tyrese Maxey
Knicks fan here and I think Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey is a fair deal for both teams
"three teamer:  PHI gets Lillard  MIN gets Simmons  POR gets MIN 2022 1st, 2024 1st, 2023 PHI 1st, 2027 PHI 1st, swap rights for a couple future MIN and PHI 1sts, Jaden McDaniels, Tyrese Maxey, and expirings from MIN  imo the Sixers should have traded Simmons for whatever MIN was offering during the offseason (my best guess is 2 1sts,  a swap, McDaniels, and expirings Bev/Prince, and then can just wave their war chest of assets for whatever star guards eventually hit the market (Lillard, Beal, or whoever)"
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."

"Bro, we went from Hinkie getting sacked by the league, to a dude who beyond being a terrible GM in trades and the draft, was literally calling out his best player on twitter on burner accounts, to Elton Brand who never had any experience in that type of role and spent the last amount of cap space on Al Horford.  Morey came into this shitty Ben situation, and was not helped at all by Doc after the playoffs. With zero cap space, Morey traded Josh Richardson for Curry, somehow got off the Horford contract without hemorraging blood, drafted Tyrese Maxey, brought in Danny Green, etc. The Ben Simmons situation has always been 24/7 drama, no one in the organization is actually that upset he's gone, if anything it's galvanized everyone else on the roster. I know everyone loves to shit on Philly and Morey, but just caving and trading Ben bc you feel you have to right this second isn't helpful."
"Tyrese Maxey is averaging 18 a game on 60% TS, Murray is the better player right now due to his superior defense and passing, but I'd hardly say the Sixers are crestfallen for not getting Dejounte when Maxey is playing as well as he is so far."
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
Why would Rich Paul want Ben to ruin games for Tyrese Maxey?
tyrese? maxey or haliburton?
"The Pelicans also clearly expected NAW and Kira Lewis to be significantly more productive than they have been so far this season.   The entire scenario makes the Pelicans look stupid because NAW has played poorly and Kira Lewis has been so bad that he's been removed from the rotation, but if Kira Lewis was playing like Tyrese Maxey right now none of this would be getting brought up."
"It hasn't come close to working, so far, but the plan coming out of last season for the Pelicans was clearly for their 2019 and 2020 FRPs, NAW and Kira Lewis, to step into large roles in the guard rotation and be productive.   If you looked at where NAW and Kira Lewis seemed to be in their development by the end of last season that would not have seemed like an outlandish thing to expect.   For example, at the end of last season Kira Lewis was seen as being on the same level as Tyrese Maxey as a rookie who could step into a much larger role at some point this season."
Tyrese Maxey drops 31 on the Bucks.

[Wojnarowski] Sources are telling me Ben Simmons' mental health issues are worsening with every game Tyrese Maxey plays. He may never play another game for the 76ers.
"Honestly, the 2020 draft class is looking rough. Outside of Ant and LaMelo, there aren’t any guys that look like real stars. It’s to the point that Tyrese Maxey may have the third best odds to get an all star nod in the class"
You’d trade Ben Simmons for Tyrese Maxey?
"""Like, how old are you?"" LMFAO  I would trade for Tyrese Maxey. I would have Tyrese Maxey on my team ... I would not trade for Ben Simmons. I would not have Ben Simmons on my team.  Ben absolutely makes the Sixers more beatable. If they had Tyrese Maxey playing the way he is now against the Hawks in last year's playoffs they would have won the series."
"First off, foh with that gatekeeping bs about how anyone who disagrees with you “never played a sport seriously”. Like, how old are you? Second, if you’re really trying to argue that Tyrese Maxey is better or more valuable than a 3x all star, all nba, 2x all defense player in Ben Simmons, go ahead, but don’t pretend to be some authoritative figure in an internet forum discussion about it.   Ben hasn’t been traded because Morey is a no nonsense GM that won’t take anything less than a Harden level haul. And if you really want to take the stance that Ben is a locker room cancer for the 6rs thats fine, I would agree, but that doesn’t make Maxey any better of a player than Ben. Obviously someone playing and buying into team chemistry is better than someone not playing at all, nobody is making that argument. The point is that the 76rs should flip Ben for an equal level player and elevate their status, and in another world, if they were to make a trade, if it were for someone like Maxey it would be an absolute fleece against the 6rs."
"No one wants Ben in their locker room. It's not his stats that are bad, it's his presence.  If you could not have a locker room impact from Ben it would be different, but when everyone is working their ass off to win a championship and one MF who's on a max contract won't even put in the effort to learn a basic skill that's generally a requirement to play the game of basketball after 5 years in the league it's fucking toxic and brings everyone down a bit.  Tyrese has the opposite effect. He brings a great positive energy to the team. Ben being gone has changed the attitude of the team.  The people arguing with me sound like they've never played a sport seriously enough long enough to know the negative effect a toxic player environment has on championship aspirations.  Tyrese Maxey brings a better overall package than Ben, because he's a solid player, he increase spacing in a way Ben never will, and as important: he brings other people up where Ben is a floor-shrinking, friction and frustration causing problem.  If Ben was actually seen as a positive, level-changing player in the league he would already have been traded for because someone would have FOMOed into a deal to get him before someone else does."
If someone told me two years ago that a team wouldn't trade for Zion bc of Tyrese Maxey I would have called them insane
"Unless they trade Zion for Ben. lmao   But you know, Tyrese Maxey and Ben Simmons for Zion would improve the Pelicans imo. Tyrese/Devonte'/Ingram/Simmons/Valanciunas is better than their current lineup imo.  Zion/Embiid is a questionable fit though"
"I disagree on your entire premise of understanding of per 100 stats. I don't wanna waste my time explaining why but I'll just say using TS to judge per 100 stats is a nice way to keep the balance.   Another thing that I wanted to highlight with these stats is the volatility of such a small sample size where even one game drastically affects them. People are getting hyped up over a 12 game sample size where I believe the entire team, including Maxey himself are performing at unsustainable levels. Tyrese is a better defender I think and a more willing passer but he doesn't have the playmaking skills required for a PG. Sexton who is a much less willing passer averages about the same assists simply because he's that much better at creating shots for himself and passing it out.   All things said and done, I've been watching this kid since his debut. I think his ceiling is a 6MOTY candidate or maybe a little more than that."
I remember following my high school team my freshman year of college and thinking we were gonna make a deep playoff run after knocking off multiple top teams in the state. Second or third round we run up against Tyrese fuckin Maxey and I watched him cook our asses for a whole game. Kid is different.
"Sorry if I missed it, but was Tyrese Maxey in the top 75?"

"Tyrese ""No More BS"" Maxey"
"&gt;For the sake of a level playing field, i'm going to discuss stats on a per 100 possession basis.  This isn't leveling the playing field, it's biasing the stats towards the player who controls more of their teams possessions. Westbrook averaged 37 pts/100 in the '18 playoffs, which sounds great until you realize he was shooting 49% TS. Sexton was fairly efficient, but he was also using a LOT of the Cavs possessions. Maxey has been adjusting to a starter role and deferring, but after Embiid went out he's dropped 31 and then 33.  &gt;Tyrese is scoring 22.4 PPG this season per 100 possessions   &gt;   &gt;Sexton was averaging 25PPG his rookie season  These stats do not include the most recent game, if you think one game shouldn't matter I would agree if it weren't roughly 8% of the sample size. Maxey is scoring 24PPG per 100 possessions (17/5 on 59% TS) and he's doing it on 5 fewer shots than Sexton in his rookie year. His playmaking is indeed nothing special right now, but he's also averaging more assists and fewer turnovers than Sexton has in any year. He's also a much more promising defender. The whole knock on Sexton is that he doesn't impact the game much outside of scoring, Maxey is on track to be a better passer and defender.  You're also comparing Maxey's first 13 starts to Sexton's stats over a full season of playing 32MPG. If you don't remember, Sexton looked rough as a rookie and a lot of people were calling him a bust. Maxey still has only played about 2/3rds as many minutes as Sexton in his rookie season.  It doesn't make sense to call his ceiling Sexton when he's doing better than Sexton was at the same point in his career. Is his floor lower than Sexton? Of course. His ceiling is definitely higher though."
"Ben, the only thing hurting your mental health at this point is Tyrese Maxey, knowing that the team no longer needs you."
"Call him Pietro ""Tyrese Maxey""moff (Quicksilver in Marvel)"
"Jeez, those are Tyrese Maxey numbers!"
"This is the type of game Raptors would've lost last season. Woo happy they won. Showed resilience down the stretch. Great poise by OG making those plays happen by driving in the paint. Scottie B was great in the 3rd, Mykhaliuk was making those little great and this easily Chris Boucher's best game of the season. Also, Tyrese Maxey is relentless, I swear he's the basketball version of Speedy Gonzalez."
Tyrese Maxey.  2 Maxey's would be unstoppable.

Might be one of the most fun games for us all season. Got a little stressful at the end there but we closed it out.  Tyrese Maxey is *legit* though. Star potential.
"Gary and Freddy, particularly this game, make me feel considerably less bad about not getting Tyrese Maxey.  Still would have been nice, though: Dalano Banton isn't quite the same caliber of backup PG xD"
Tyrese Maxey finished the game with 33 points. Second straight 30+ point night for him. Ben last season had only one 30+ point night.

WHO THE FUCK IS TYRESE MAXEY I HATE THIS GUY WHO THE FUCK
the Miami Heat passed on Tyrese Maxey for Precious Achiuwa
Tyrese Maxey with 14pts on 6-9 shooting in todays first half
Interesting to see the takes on Precious after being told at the trade deadline that Masai would not be fleeced with Tyrese Maxey and picks for Lowry.
"Trade idea: Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey for Gordon Hayward?   Hornets desperately need defense and a bench guard. Hayward doesn't fit their timeline but Ben and Maxey do. Ben provides secondary ball handling on top of Lamelo and elevates their defense. Maxey helps them off the bench.   Meanwhile the Sixers get a SF that's a little older but he's a jack of all trades who slots in seamlessly, elevating their level of play. Seth/Green/Hayward/Harris/Embiid is really damn good.   Thoughts? Does one of the teams need to throw in draft capital?"
"Tyrese Maxey is going to be a star PG in this league. I say that as both a homer, but also as someone who's watched nearly every minute of every game for the Sixers.  Just his improvement from last year to this year is wildly impressive. His 3 point shot has looked great this year, and he's shooting it off the dribble. He's incredibly fast, and absolutely lethal on drives against bigger defenders. He has a gorgeously smooth floater that's one of his bread and butter shots. He's also been turning the ball over at a really low rate not just for a second year PG, but for any PG, especially in the past few games when he's been playing absurd minutes.  His defense isn't elite, but he's a disrupter. He has the speed to catch anyone on the court and recover when he misses a step while guarding someone. He hustles for boards, and pushes the ball well in transition.  If his court vision continues to improve (it's gotten better since last year, but hasn't progressed as remarkably as the other elements of his game)... he's going to be something really special."
Tyrese Maxey is the next A.I.
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr.

Tyrese maxey
Fuck outta here. Give me Tyrese Maxey in the playoffs over Hack-a-Ben
I can't believe the comments are in such an uproar over this. OP didn't even say Maxey is better than Ben. But I will. Tyrese Maxey is a better NBA player than Ben Simmons
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could’ve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo’s, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn’t even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let’s just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? 🤦"

Sometimes I get confused between Tyrese Maxey and Terance Mann. Ohh they are both TM lol
Tyrese Maxey baby
Tyrese Maxey is already Jordan level so I can see him possibly winning it this year or next 🤔
"Hmm let’s see, they drafted Embiid, Then Simmons! One is a 4x all star who is almost impossible to guard, the other is a 3x all star that became a triple double machine, is a top 3 defensive player and won rookie of the year! Then they draft Fultz who turned out to be a bust for them but hey you can’t win em all, next they draft Mikel Brides but they decide to trade him to the suns for Zaire Smith and a future draft pick, Zaire ends up out of the league for good after an injury and Mikel becomes a stud for Phoenix BUT that future draft pick gets sent over to the clippers in a trade for Tobias Harris, a borderline all star! Next up the sixers make a trade with Celtics in the draft and acquired Matisse Thybulle, this guy is ALREADY one of the best defense players in the league and he’s starting to be more involved offensively! And lastly the Sixers end up with the steal of the 2020 draft, Tyrese Maxey, this kid is super quick and can get any basket that he wants ! He put up a career high 39 points in his rookie year in a game where most of our starters were out! Idk bro, it looks to me like they’ve done a good job Drafting since picking Embiid!"
"Luka, Trae, LaMelo, Ja, Cole Anthony, Tyrese Maxey, a lotta dudes COULD win mvp but I don't think a point guard is actually gonna win any time soon, too many wings and big men are staying dominant in the league"
Tyrese Maxey might as well be James Harden offensively compared to Ben
Great game all around. This sixers squad is incredibly entertaining. Tyrese Maxey could have been a top 10 pick. Gg bucks
"I watched Tyrese Maxey often when he played for Kentucky. He isn't a diamond in the rough. He's a embossed diamond necklace recovered from the wreckage of the Titanic. The potential value is obvious at first sight and it could wearable with minimal debridment but the full value will not be recovered unless and until an experienced jeweler takes great care to polish it properly and dedicates the time to carefully clear away decades of salt, rust, and barnacles. It's in the hands of the Sixers' developmental staff now."
"No matter the result of this game, I Am Scared Of Tyrese Maxey."
I have no dog in the fight but I just want this game to end on a Tyrese Maxey buzzer beater so this crowd can bring the roof of the building down
Tyrese Maxey is so fuggin good man
Tyrese Maxey
He has a name and it's Tyrese Maxey
All 20+  Furkan Korkmaz  Landry Shamet  Matisse Thybulle  Tyrese Maxey  Top 3  Jahlil Okafor  Markelle Fultz  😫
Jaylen Brown and 3 1st round picks for Tyrese Maxey at this point.
Holy shit Tyrese Maxey
"first, I didn't name Dame, Portland has other very good players.  CJ, Nurk, Norm, RoCo all have value to a potential contender.  second, if Portland were to do a Dame trade with the Sixers, they would probably get a haul in return.  we're talking every pick that the Sixers are allowed to trade, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, maybe they could also demand Tybulle.  And Simmons could be flipped for additional picks.  that's a lot to get back."
Gotta disagree. Simmons led the league in 3 point assists since he touched the floor.  Not gonna believe that Tyrese Maxey who makes 0.8 3PM and averages 4.7 assists this season has more of an impact on Ben creating 3 point shots.
"The starters this year outside of Embiid:  Tyrese Maxey, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Paul Reed  Maxey's minutes doubled and so naturally his 3 PA went up. Seth Curry is shooting the same amount of 3PA pretty much (4.9 vs 5.2). Shake Milton is shooting 0.3 more 3PA and shooting 7% worse."
"Raps fans too.  I'm glad we got *something* for Lowry in a S&amp;T, but a deal based around Precious Achiuwa is significantly less appealing than one based around Tyrese Maxey (from Philly) or Horton-Tucker.   We had the most valuable asset at the trade deadline and held onto him because two win-now contenders refused to give up young guys who barely played in the playoffs. Big missed opportunity all around."
"I’m gonna try to unpack this differently. Your deductions make sense from your perspective, only because there’s a gap in your perspective. A writer/reporter is trained to be direct and succinct. They’re trained to not mince words, and not convey ideas that aren’t rooted in information. If you’re a writer, and you get information that Tyrese Maxey was offered to Toronto by Daryl Morey…. that’s a gold mine. That’s what a reporter lives and dies for. Reporters can further their careers by showing people that they stuck their chest out about facts and the facts were correct. A reporter does not stand to benefit from making you deduce something, and they’re specifically trained to not make you have to deduce something. It does not benefit a writer in any way, shape or form to make the reader make a deduction. Anything that a reporter writes, is written with intention, anything a reporter omits, is omitted with intention. Look at Shams or Woj, the top dogs in the field. The way they do business, they convey precise and exact information. That’s why they’re the top dogs. Shams and Woj are who everyone is trying to be. You don’t get to become that by getting information, and making something have to deduce it. If someone got the information “Maxey was offered to Toronto by Daryl Morey” they’d jump for joy and get it to the media immediately and probably go buy a 6 pack and celebrate an achievement. If a writer is forcing you to deduce something, they want you to deduce it because they either don’t have confidence in the information, or they know the information isn’t right but they’re getting it out to scratch someone’s back. I don’t wanna sit here and insult you, but you’re genuinely missing this part in your point. A writer making you deduce real information they have, would have to be a god awful writer, like a complete dog shit writer. And I don’t think that we’re here talking about complete dog shit writers.  If they had reliable info that Maxey was offered to Toronto, it would be reported as “Maxey was offered to Toronto” the same way all other reliable info is reported…. because that’s an achievement in their field. It’s not ever written that way for a reason bro"

I don't think Rich Paul will be sweating as much as Ben if Rich's client Tyrese Maxey is a starter on a contender
"So my thoughts aren't too relevant on if I think he is either ""great"" or ""terrible"" in the long run right, but the league views Ben as a 3x All Star, 2x All NBA Defensive 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team player who also was a ROY and a runner up for the DPOY last year at the age of 25 with 4 years of control left on his contract.  He is an elite defensive player even before all the handchecking and such that is allowed now, and a pass first playmaker of a team that lost to Kawhi in a buzzer beater in game 7, saw his team get swept when he was injured, and held Trae Young to 5-23 shooting in that game 7 where he passed up a layup.   He is a non shooter, and despite that still averaged 15 - 7 - 7 on an FG% of 0.56 last year (down year).  I know it's a meme to think he is ""terrible"" because he doesn't shoot outside of the paint, but he is a winning player that has never missed the playoffs in his career (when healthy) and the 76ers (prior to this year) were below .500 in games he missed that still featured Joel Embiid in the lineup.     Tyrese Maxey and Korkmaz are making great strides this year.  Seth Curry is playing like a #2 offensive option and George Niang / Drummond have been miles ahead of Mike Scott and Dwight respectively so I am extremely happy with how we are playing.  That doesn't take away from what Ben Simmons is as a player."
Who would you rather have on your team  between Tyrese Maxey and Westbrook at the same age to move forward as your franchise PG?

"Same, gave my friends a lists of guys I wanted and they thought I would be upset because Tyrese Maxey wasn't on there haha"
Sacrifice Tyrese Maxey on the alter of Sam Hinkie for a guaranteed championship
Without Fultz the 76ers would never have gotten Tyrese Maxey
"Klutch's PR person needs to be fired.  During the earlier part of this stupid saga, Klutch appears to have been leaking pro Simmons info to a random Houston reporter (Dumas). One leak was that Tyrese Maxey was also requesting to be traded from the Sixers. Maxey came out and said it was untrue.  It was just a footnote in this shitshow, but for me, it highlighted how inept Klutch is. They can't even leak info properly to some willing media mouthpiece."
I would rather just roll with Tyrese Maxey
Tyrese Maxey would like to have a word
Nobody cares if Tyrese Maxey shoots a three lol
Tyrese Maxey
Hot take:    Tyrese Maxey is a better fit for Sixers than Ben Simmons.
Tyrese Maxey is only 21 years old starting today
Tyrese Maxey is a better fit with Embiid than Ben Simmons
"Tyrese Maxey &amp; Mattise are pretty valued young guys that we could add in addition to picks.  Tyrese averaging 14 ppg so far this year, and Mattisse is already an All-NBA defender. Any team ready to blow it up that has any sort of all-star talent on, we could definitely make a move to set them up pretty well."
Pretty good honesty. Tyrese Maxey and Andre Drummond have both been very good. Georges Niang has suddenly been god. A little worried about Embiid’s health and the sixers letting him play through injury tho
"Trade idea:   Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Marcus Smart   * Tyrese Maxey  * Two Sixers 1sts  Celtics get:   * Ben Simmons  * Norman Powell  * Seth Curry  * One Sixers 1st  Sixers get their guy, run Dame/Milton/Green/Harris/Embiid  Blazers reset and remain competitive by running Smart/McCollum/Brown/RoCo/Nurkic   Celtics revamp and remain competitive by running Curry/Powell/Simmons/Tatum/Williams"
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
LaMelo's better than Ant but not so much that Timberwolves wouldn't roll with the guy that's already well established in the franchise  Warriors - LaMelo   Hornets - Tyrese   Bulls - Wiseman   Cavs - Maxey
Tyrese Maxey in shambles because he has to give up #0
"Lamelo, Ant, Tyrese, Bane, Bey(6-10 is Anthony, Wiseman, Williams, Stewart, Maxey)"
Tyrese maxey going for 39 again.
And Tyrese Maxey. And Quickley. And McDaniels.
"actually, tyrese maxey is doing fine. he actually has a better case for mip than jordan poole"
"I wanna give Tyrese Maxey a big shout out for his game tonight, he did well offensively like usual but other than Trae getting him a couple of times he did a great job covering him for the most part."
Tyrese Maxey
