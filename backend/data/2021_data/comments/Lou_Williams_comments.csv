"Gallinari and Lou Williams led a 31 point comeback for Doc back then, now they led a 26 point comeback against Doc."
Who in 2021 would have ever thought Lou Fucking Williams would be the catalyst in one of the greatest road comebacks in NBA history?  Yeah me neither.
They chocked it to fucking Lou Williams lmao
Youll be even worse off with 5 players with no offense. Lou williams and trae young just beat 3 all nba defenders
The Lou Williams final
"Don't know if you watched the game or just looked at the box score... Huerter was bricking every shot early, made a bone head clear path foul, and he was missing open layups.    Bogi was in early foul trouble , he ended up with 5 fouls in the 3rd. He never got in rhythm with the foul trouble. It would've been really dumb to keep play either one of them in their closing lineup under those circumstances.   In the last 3 minutes is the sixers failed to capitalize on the offense with Lou Williams and Trae on the floor on 3 straight positions at least. Yet when the hawks had the mismatch with Seth guarding Gallo, he immediately took advantage.   Gallo and Lou Will were playing great and it's what brought them back in the game, why on earth would he put in Bogi and Huerter.  Obviously plus minus isn't the best tracker, but I'm sure that Huerters and Bogi were garbage considering they were being blown out for 3 quarters.   Great hawks win but it's obviously all due to the sixers collapse. Only embiid and curry scored in the 2nd half..."
Its like Doc had never seen Lou Williams play
Lou Williams
I want Clippers vs Hawks so Lou Williams can get Finals MVP
Lou Williams 6th man of the year awards: 3 KD: 0 checks out
Is starting Lou Williams even legal?
with kawhai out clippers doing well.  sometimes too many chefs mess up a pot.  Reggie Jackson is lou Williams.
"The teams are not equally talented at all.  Trae has vetrans Gallinari, and Lou Williams and Capella - no one comparable on Mavs.  Think before you post :)"
Clips could really use Lou Williams now. He's been awesome for the Hox.
I mean like 5% Trae. Lou Williams' fire shooting and our entire team/coach decided to achieve maximum choke. Trae Young and Lou Williams were both defending for 8 minutes in the 4th and we made about 4 points.
I’d clamp the fuck out of 54 years old Lou Williams corpse
"Probably like a vanvleet, Norman Powell, Lou Williams.   I don't think Ben Simmons is a bad player. Definitely overrated but with a change of mindset and maybe a role change I think he could be great. When he's using his athleticism and being aggressive I think he's one of the top finishers in the NBA at the rim. Good hook touches from short range as well. He's way too passive though and his lack of confidence in jump shooting hurts him"
"As an OKC fan, I'm a full KD hater. But his greatness is undeniable. When he's on fire, all you can do is ask god for mercy. Too tall to block, too strong to body, ball handling too good to be stripped, ultra efficient at high usage, high BBIQ to kill you if you double team. He's a real life MyPlayer with all the sliders turned up. This MFer tore his achilles and is still a top 3 player in the league.  The Sixers dropping a 20+ point lead in half a quarter to Lou Williams and Trae Young is worse."
I think they won this game if they start Lou Williams
He was outplayed by 46 years old lou Williams that’s what happened
Durant is no Lou Williams
As someone who is a Sixers fan and a big Lou Williams fan I knew he was due for an explosion sooner or later. That man is a walking bucket.
Lou Williams +31. +31. +31!!
"Lou Williams was the MVP of that game, those shots in the 3rd quarter were ginormous"
The fact that the Hawks won a game where Bogi scored only 6 points in 21 minutes before being benched for old washed up Lou Williams is just hilarious.
How did he get away with trae Lou backcourt though? Sixers didn't even think of attacking them?  Monty Williams relentlessly attacked Mpj who is a slightly better defender than both. Doc sucks
The Sixers couldn't score on a lineup featuring Trae Young and Lou Williams together. I simply cannot understand it.
Lou Williams +31  LOL
And shout out to Lou Chicken Wings Williams and Danilo Gallinari for being clutch af in the 4th. Ben Simmons need to be traded right now for a bag of Cheetos that can shoot 70% from the line
Their closer was fucking Lou Williams tonight lol. You can build around a star that gets you up 30 points at the start of the 4th quarter and win as a team in the 4th. It’s possible. What’s not possible is having to score every single point in the 4th because 4/5th of the team are a complete non-threat  Swap Lou Williams and Tobias tonight and they win by 40
Is this where we pretend trae young and lou Williams have looked like good defenders their entire careers?
Lou Williams has now been a massive part in 2 25+ point comebacks in the playoffs. Incredible
How do you go on that long of a scoring drought against a backcourt of Trae Young and Lou Williams??
Not even trae young they got torched by Lou fucking Williams in the 4th.. at home.. in a game 5
"Yes Lou Williams went vintage mode. Yes, Trae Young is a fucking beast (though Holy shit the dude takes 4 steps at least once ever single lay up attempt he's not alone in this but it's still infuriating to watch him blow by simply because he's traveling egregiously), but WHATHE GODDAMN FUCK WAS THA 4TH QUARTER OFFENSE.  No scheme execution at all. So many forced bad shots. So many careless turnovers   How the fuck did a team this big let the hawks get so many offensive rebounds  And fucking hack a Ben, my God you get paid 10s of millions of dollars a year to play goddamn basketball, and you can't make free throws more than half the time. Free-throw are all about the time you spend practicing the shot. You get in what you put out. Guys like Nash would take over a hundred free throws a day. It's all routine. If your not making them, it's inexcusable.  The Hawjs didn't win, the 76ers didn't want to win. I'm sorry but it's the fucking truth.  PATHETIC"
That Lou Williams for Rondo trade looking pretty nice right now…
"Lou Williams led the charge since the third. Gallo was steady, the rest of the team were playing active defense against the Sixers predictable offense.  He got so hot with repeated PnRs against Curry. Floaters, jumpers. Trae got in and did the same. Gallo also did the same whenever he got Curry"
Lou Williams
Lou Williams was +31 tonight.
Lou Williams is a hero. He deserves all the Lemon Pepper he wants for the rest of his life.
Lou Williams can I be your third girlfriend
Lou Williams +31 that's pretty good
"Lou ""I was supposed to retire but decided not to because I'm gonna eliminate the team that drafted me"" Williams"
Lou Williams is lowkey better
"Lou Williams with +31, what a game"
lou williams happened
Lou Williams is about to win a Championship before the Clippers.
I LOVE YOU LOU WILLIAMS
76okers 😵😵😵😵😵 holy fuck.  Lou williams led that charge
Lou Williams is a hero if we win
Lou Williams and Doc Rivers
Bruh how you can't score with Lou Williams and Trae on the floor.
"Philly Subs on halfway through the 3rd gave Atlanta a boost, then Lou Williams and gallinari hit every shot in the 4th"
"Ben Simmons can’t hit a free throw, Lou Williams good, Trae young good, sixers bad apparently"
Lou Williams went off . Hack a summons worked
Lou Williams and Hack-a-Ben
Lou Williams owns that building
Sixers offense went for a stroll and Lemon Pepper Lou Williams took over
lou williams is the mvp of this game lmfao
"Progression in sports seems to work out half the time, but this Hawks team is fucking YOUNG. They SHOULD be a lock to make the playoffs for years. They wont add any free agent of significance I don't think but they have 4 draft picks this year, 5 next year depending on protections (for instance, Thunder is top 14 protected).   This team has enough draft capital to make a trade if they want, and this entire top 10 minus Lou Williams is back next year (they could resign him)"
Clippers could use Lou Williams
sixer fans do not worry. it took lou williams going ape shit for them to come back. this ain’t happening again lol
Lou Williams was a crazy good postseason pickup for the Hox.
Lou Williams is a +20 in this game
Lou Williams doing Lou Williams things.  He’s low key the 3rd greatest sixth man of all time
Lou Williams really likes big comebacks in playoff games don’t he?
Playoff Lou Williams is about to take over and put the Hawks down for good!
Im here for Lou Williams v Seth Curry
"Come for the excessive flopping, stay for the Seth Curry v Lou Williams duel"
Oh my goodness Lou Williams and Seth are trading buckets
#Lou Williams vs Seth Curry
for this exact moment ~ lou williams is a hawk
we getting a Lou Williams v. Seth Curry duel
lou williams saving the hawks
"Seth Curry VS Lou Williams to decide the game, as we all predicted"
lou williams made somebody fall gahtdam
I’m a fairly casual eastern conference viewer so forgive me  But wtf happened to Lou Williams? Are the hawks just not using him like the clippers did?
6’1 170 lbs Lou Williams dropped 6’10 240 lbs Ben Simmons 🧢🧢🧢   Flop
Start Lou Williams in the second half and have him hack Simmons from the first minute.
Shake reminds me of Lou Williams so much
A Lou Williams mid range jump shot on a fast break gross
"I’m probably in the minority here but I think the Hawks have a loaded roster and are probably underperforming. Two near max players on rookie contracts leaves space for high end role players like Capela, Gallinari, Bogdonavic, and Lou Williams. The Hawks are stacked right now."
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
"Not a big name, but Lou Williams shooting splits drop significantly in the playoffs:  Regular season: 14.5 points on 42% FG 35% 3P  Playoffs: 12.3 points on 39% FG 25% 3P"
🎶 2 bad seconds like I'm Lou Williams 🎶
"he's had 1 above average efficiency season in his career, 5 years ago  'overrated' is an understatement, he's lou williams in a starting spot and on a max contract"
Those guys just don't perform in the playoffs. Lou Williams has struggled every year in the postseason and Clarkson is being found out once again right now (-50 for the series)
"The Bucks are obviously a very talented team that has the ability to dominate anyone. Just need to find the right coach to get that team to show up all of the time. Also some minor adjustments to their bench could do wonders. They could use a ""you miss every shot you don't take"" type of bench scorer (like a Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type)."
Lou Williams all nba third team incoming
"I want him to play poorly. I want him to get frustrated, have some techs thrown at him, and make mistakes.  Of course all of that depends on him playing hurt, but that could end up helping us.  You know who scares me right now? Freaking Shake Milton. Whenever he is in, it looks like we cant keep up with him. Its kind of how i would feel about playing against a younger Lou Williams. Like even though he isnt a starter, he can gets buckets and run up the score."
He was a -1 in a 14 point loss. Check the Defensive rating with him Off the court. There’s a reason dudes like Lou Williams and Jamaal Crawford aren’t all stars. The game has two sides
And there is no way Gallo and Lou Williams don't absolutely dwarf shake Milton and Tyrone maxey lol
Ty Lue deserves way more credit than he gets.   Doc would have happily continued to play Trez and Lou Williams against the mavs to lose. And if we somehow made it this far he would never have made these adjustments.

I'll never understand why you guys wanted him over Lou Williams
Lou Williams being unable to score against Dwight is telling of how bad he is nowadays.
*skip to my lou williams gets a ring if/when LAC win the title this year*
"Definitely both. And you're right, 35 and 33 points is 2021 Lakers territory lol.   It's not like they didn't have any playmakers either though, so it is kinda baffling how they could be so bad. Kawhi and George were both pretty limited in that regard early in their career, but at this stage, Kawhi's definitely above average and George is solid. Lou Williams was more than capable of setting others up, and Reggie Jackson isn't bad as the 4th playmaking option, but yeah, they also didn't have a top-30 playmaker in the league either. Just a bizarre set of circumstances, fit, chemistry, and choking I guess."
And Lou Williams
"Superstar, no. I see Lou Williams when Graham plays."
“Lou Williams is a professional scorer”
Yeah but the Nets are out there giving up ORebs to Lou Williams  Defensive rebounding one of the reasons they can't stop anyone
Yeah Giannis shouldn't have won the 2019/2020 DPOY because of what happens in 2020/2021.  Also I think Lou Williams should've never won 6th man of the year in his career because he's bad now.
"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."
Is lou williams old now?
We have two of the stupidest people on Earth on this team and their names are Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac
Lou Williams has been ass tonight
Lou Williams so bad this year my god
Why does Lou Williams still get minutes on a contender lol
Lou Williams is washed up. It's no wonder the Clippers have been begging to trade him
Lou Williams iso ball is killing the second units rhythm.
Lou Williams is a washed player
How the hell did the Nets let Lou Williams get that rebound? That stuff is unacceptable for a championship contending team.
Tough look for Deandre having Lou williams get a board on him and going 1-4 on FTs to end the quarter
KD really let Lou Williams run in behind him and get an uncontested offensive rebound.  That's always been a weak point of his defensively.
Lou Williams not as effective as he was 2 years back on the offense.
Nets really allowed Lou Williams to get a rebound lmao
They let Lou Williams grab the rebound lmao
"So lou williams, D rose, steven adams.   I'll say d rose doesn't fit but I genuinely believe he is impossible to hate."
He could be a lou williams microwave bench scorer type of guy if he can keep this up
Pleasant: Ty Lue  Unpleasant: Lou Williams
He’s not terrible...at all. Lol he’s actually been playing better than Lou Williams this entire season. He’s usually not in our regular rotation but at this rate he might have to be
"potentially  i think RJ definitely showing he's a legit starting two  IG has potential  some have pointed out he's more of a lou williams, i kinda agree  but think he can still grow as a playmaker and could be a legit starting pg for a playoff team   especially in the east  and especially depending on who they get going forward, if you get a lebron/luka type who can drop 6-10 dimes a game not in the pg spot, then i think he's even more likely to   (obviously that's not too likely, just saying- depends on how rest of roster is)"

Lou Williams then proceeded to whoop the Knicks ass after that.
"Lou Williams is the best player I ever played against in high school. He had a way more athletic game back then, played above the rim. Probably the best high school player in the history of Georgia basketball. Everyone thought he was literally the next Kobe, he has somehow underperformed in the minds of a lot of Atlanta folks who saw him at South Gwinnett, that’s how freakishly good he was back then."
"""Were""?  Isn't Lou Williams like 19 years old?    What year is it?"
"""What do you mean *were*?""  -Lou Lemmon Pepper Williams"
"Didn't know about that. First thing upon Googling: ""Lou Williams runs triangle offence with 2 women"". Lol"
Lou Williams one of everyones favorite players
"The context though is that it's a rookie that's less than 20 games into his NBA career saying that... to a 15-year NBA all-time great. So it's one of those like starstruck moments ""I looked up to you while I was learning to play ball"" kind of moments and I think it's obvious to Lou   Not to mention, it's Lou Williams. He gets league wide respect from everyone lol"
Lou Williams has to be the most underrated player ever. The league knows he’s the truth but  most fans will never see him as more of a sixth man
"&gt; This was back when he was with the Sixers in 2011. He’s driving his car in Philadelphia on Christmas Eve. He stopped at a light, and a gunman comes up to rob him. Knocks on the window, ready to rob him. And Williams talked him out of it. Part of talking him out of it was he told him who he was. The gunman apparently said to him, ‘Yeah, you do a lot for this community.’ And decided not to hold him up. Williams then had him get in the car, and he took him to McDonald’s. And had a nice, long chat with him about life and what’s going on. Pretty incredible.  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/03/lou-williams-gunman-robbery-story-breen-nba-clippers"
I’ve never really thought about using him this way. It makes a lot of sense. He could be like a slightly more efficient Lou Williams with more range and playmaking ability.
"Lou ""Pawghunter"" Williams"
Conley x Lou Williams
They don't and the wizards obviously want good from they have no reason to get lou williams or pat Bev even trading them would get less that just straight up trading beal for picks
"You only need 22.4m to match 28m in salary, Pat bev and Lou Williams get them pretty much all the way there for matching.  Not sure about the Clippers' picks situation but it wouldn't surprise me if they actually have some tradeable picks once the offseason hits."
Notice how I said if defense is not an issue. There is no Trezz so the Clippers don't have a traffic cone on defense anymore. Also Lou Williams minutes have been significantly cut down as they have another plus defender in Batum.
"Do manu ginobli, jamal Crawford, Lou Williams or (maybe) Lamar Odom count? This is off the top of my head, so I don’t actually know if they made it to the game in a year they were 6th man, but feel like one of them had to right?"
"&gt; steph underperformed so they threw everything at stopping KD  Steph AVERAGED 25-7-5 on 71% TS in that series, 71%. They threw ""everything"" at KD, i guess everything was 9 inches shorter Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams.  &gt; steph also underperformed in the HOU series  Steph underperformed so much that when KD went down he carried Golden State to back to back wins and a 4-2 victory.  &gt; it was KD winning them games, hate to break it to u  KD was the best player on a team that without him still went to the Finals and was a Klay Thompson injury away from beating the Raptors. He was sensational, probably the best player in the league, but to act like there was no comparison between his 2019 version and Kobe in 2013, it is laughable."
"AD isn't a wing and is the best lob threat in the league, so of course his assist rate is higher lol. That's basic basketball. You keep using exceptions and act like that disproves trends. Hunter is generally considered a role player due to both his counting stats, his advanced stats, and eye test. It's not simply ""durr 2 numbers determine who a player is"" - it's a bunch of factors coming together. Hunter can work his way out of being a role player the same way Jaylen Brown did.   The Rockets and 7-9 and the Hawks are 9-9, but Eric Gordon's stats don't count and Hunter's do? Let's try to not be so biased here. The Hawks aren't some team kicking ass out here either.   You can be a 6man candidate and be a role player. That's been Lou Williams entire freaking career. Clarkson is a bona-fide role player - has been his whole career. Same with THJ - he's still a role player who had to step up due to injuries.   I think ultimately, our ideas of role player is quite different."
"He really wasn't *that* good, people only mention him because his play style was ahead of his time. But if you take a guy whose play style is ahead of his time and move him forward in time, then he's just another guy.  If you subtract out the shortened three point line seasons, he shot 30.7% from three for his career. If he focuses more on that part of his game then he would be an above average shooter, but not some lights-out guy. He was tiny and would have been an absolute liability on defense in today's NBA. His best case scenario today would have been a Lou Williams type 6th man role, 16 ppg at his peak. He would have been more of a regular season player, but not good enough to be a major contributor in the playoffs when teams gameplan around attacking defensive weakpoints."
"And that’s why he retired. Iverson could’ve given The Grizzlies, Pistons, whoever 20 minutes a game somewhere between Trey Burke and Lou Williams. But he didn’t want to do that."
If the Clippers can build a playoff team around Lou Williams I'm pretty sure there's a way to build a good team around Bradley Beal.
"Let's start with a simple question ""What teams would want Drummond?"" . I think we can agree the bottoms teams aren't looking for someone like Drummond, because he's an expiring deal and if they have the cap space they can get him in the summer.  So, the only teams that could want him are potential playoff teams who need a center. In the East we have Nets, Celtics and Raptors, and in the West we have Clippers, and maybe the Mavs.  So which of those teams have the assets to trade for Drummond? No team is going to give up any valuable player, so it mainly will be filler + draft pick. Nets would be willing but they don't anyone to trade; Raptors I don't think want Drummond; the Mavs know they aren't going to win a championship, and won't throw assets for a 1 in a million chance.  So, the only teams left are Celtics and Clippers. The Clippers have only Lou Williams who could be traded, but he only makes 8 million, while Drummond is making 27. It will be a hard trade to do. The Celtics have a trade exception and could absorb Drummond."
Lou Williams who has never made more than $8m in a single season? So why are you convinced that he's getting a max?
I think he’s lou williams
How about how Kyrie AND Durant dropped 40 a few nights ago and they got smoked by a third year who people claim is no better than Lou Williams in double overtime because literally nobody on that team can shut down a single player?
"Having kyrie is a problem, and not a good one at that. He disrupts their offense too much, he’s like Lou Williams(on steroids) that fails to acknowledge his placement on the team(third best)"
Lou Williams? Feels like too little but I mean Zo has been awful
"I actually kind of warmed up to Reggie. When he’s gotten real minutes this year he’s done a much better at staying within his role. With how much they asked Lou to take a step back it’s almost kind of redundant to have Lou around anymore if they don’t give him the keys, Reggie would do fine in his minutes as a spot up shorter.  Unfortunately though I love Lou Williams and I don’t want to see him leave. I’m pretty sure he’s going to retire once he’s off the Clippers."
I’ll give you mifondu kabengele anc Lou Williams.
He was SO NASTY on those teams. Those Sixers teams in general were so fun to watch. The 2011-2012 year in particular was one of my favorites to watch. With a young Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams and Thad Young. Even Vucevic had some good run with that team back then. Plus Elton Brand helping to anchor the inside.
"Fun fact: I looked up those numbers. Trae's FTr this season is .602  The last time a guard playing significant minutes (per BaskeballReference positions) got &gt;.600 FTr was Lou Williams in 2015-16, and before that it was Kevin Martin in 2007-08. Trae's rate of FTA/FGA is historically high, and nearly twice Nash's highest ever season."
"The bubble also hurt them pretty badly. Harrell and Williams had absolutely trash fitness coming back, and while Beverley is hurt often, it's possible he hurt himself partially due to lack of fitness. The lou Harrell lineups were basically just burning points."
I've said since his rookie season his floor was Lou Williams.  Apparently I might've been too conservative.
I got in an argument with a guy on here saying his ceiling is Lou Williams.
The idea of lonzo is prob better for us than Reggie Jackson or Lou williams tho! Heheh
But I assume he'd still cut into some minutes in the guard rotation. For the clippers literally any player that gets minutes is a plus because any minutes that Lou Williams loses is a plus.
"Nash's foul drawing was legitimate as hell, dude got knocked around and barely even got the foul for the times he intentionally drew contact. What Trae does is another level, he would be a bench player without the refs propping up his game. It's hilarious to compare the two even tangentially, the difference between Nash and Trae is the difference between Luka Doncic and Lou Williams"

Yup Lou Williams will get screened to death
"MVP: Tim Duncan (2002-03 version)   FMVP no MVP: Dwyane Wade (2005-06 version)   Under 18 ppg: Dikembe Mutombo (1996-97 version)   6thMoY: Lou Williams (2018-19 version)   Never 10: Bruce Bowen (2002-03 version)      Rotation;   C: 1997 Dikembe Mutombo   PF: 2003 Tim Duncan   SF: 2003 Bruce Bowen   SG: 2006 Dwyane Wade   PG: 2019 Lou Williams      I tried to create a team like 2005 Spurs within your rules.      Duncan and Bowen go without saying. I upgraded Nazr Mohammed with Mutombo &amp; Ginobili with Wade.   I could pick Ginobili for the 6th man but he was pretty weak in 2008 playoffs, especially against the Lakers in WCF. Lou Williams OTOH, had a pretty good showing in 2019 playoffs and I felt like he could be used in a situation like Parker even though their playing style was different.      Enjoyed the challenge mate. Thanks!"
Lou Williams  Lamelo Ball  Lebron James  Larry Sanders  Lamar Odom  This is easily a better starting 5 than K's. ^(/s)
"You can probably stagger the minutes and play Kyrie in a Lou Williams type role where he's the primary scorer against bench units.   The defensive questions are legit though. But he'll be more rested and can put in better effort, and a lot of defense is just effort."
Lou Williams on captain america serum. He's not coming off the bench tho
"Despite all the comedians ITT, he's worth probably isn't as high to most contending teams, especially due to his iso heavy play style and his average defense. It works well on the Knicks and a lot of tanking teams, but probably not so well elsewhere. Also, his salary is quite hard to move, making any trade difficult.   An argument could be made for his improved passing improving his value to a contender this season, but I'd say he's probably worth a combination of raw prospects/established role players and some seconds. Off the top of my head a few trades I think would be great are:  Mavericks: James Johnson, Tyrell Terry, two 2nd rounders  Raptors: Norman Powell, Aaron Baynes, 2nd rounder  Hornets: Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, 2nd rounder  Clippers: Lou Williams, Ivica Zubac"
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
"I'll be honest, Shamet was never good. He was hyped up a little after his rookie year due to his 3%, but outside of that he's just not good. He's too small to defend anyone and, as we've seen since his rookie year, his shot is not consistent enough to keep him in the floor given his lack of defense. He's like Lou Williams with a quarter of the offensive abilities."
Wait for Lou williams to come back. This team will be far better if Lue can figure out that Lou shouldn't play anymore. Doubt he will though. The bench is far far far worse if he plays.
Yeah our coach Lou Williams is doing a great job
Lou williams where?
"Nah they’d be staying, was thinking more Lou will + mifondu kabengele (young player who’s still promising) and or Terrence Mann. It’d be for a player with half a year left until he hits free agency who hasn’t broken out like you wanted him to with NAW being promising and Bledsoe also on the squad and isn’t a very movable player atm.   Lou Williams + mifondu kabengele/Mann + few second rounders. Those are all good contracts at the very least. And you get a young player who you have more contractual control over."
"lol ""took a worse deal out of spite"" yeah keep telling yourself that, whatever you need to do to rationalize how Morey shat the bed 😂  Who cares if we're at the bottom of the standings, we won a championship. On the other hand, 6'10"" Rondo on a max will *never* win you a championship and Embiid will be medically retired by the time his contract is up. The process will amount to a prolonged, dissipated fart in the wind.  We'll be trading Lowry to Miami - in a few months from now you will hear another report about how ""Masai didn't want to trade with Morey"" because he's too afraid to give up 6'2"" Lou Williams without a jumpshot and equally bad defense."
It’s a half a year long deal of a player who’s got like a 75% chance of leaving you with nothing to show for it.   Terrence Mann or Kabengele with Lou Williams and a second rounder.
He said he modelled his game after CJ McCollum and Lou Williams
Lou Williams with playmaking skills
I think his ceiling is Lou Williams.
"Watching Coby and Sexton is like watching the new generation of Ben Gordon/Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams (or Vinnie Johnson if you wanna go back further) be born. Sunrise, sunset."
An hour? Hell it takes longer than that for Lou Williams to get a full order of wings and a dance at Magic City.
"He's supposed to replace Lou Williams.  Unless there is a trade, Lou is still going to be the primary bench scorer this season.  So they're betting on Kennard's production from 21-22 onwards.  Still a risky gamble but far too early to judge the contract."
I can't tell if you two are joking or if you actually think NO would trade you Lonzo for Lou Williams and second rounders
"I mean if he’s gonna leave in the off season, I’d like for the clippers to trade for lonzo. I’ll give Lou Williams.  Edit: tbh more for narrative reasons then anything."
Oh hell no; what about Kyrie for Lou williams and cash Considerations lol
"Yeah it’s not like he’s 2014 Lou Williams who you can snag for a low first rounder to shore up second unit scoring. He’s a legit incredible scorer and much improved on defense. He’d push a lot of contenders over the edge into an elite tier— but that means the bulls can demand a lot in return, too."
IQ and Obi are poor Amare and Lou Williams
Lou Williams is a 99 cents store AI
"well i’ve actually watched both of them play and they are very similar, obviously AI is better but you could say lou williams is a poor mans version of him"
He was also playing alongside a top 3 worst defender in the league in Lou Williams
No Lou Williams leads to good bench.
Melos celling will be Lou Williams with silly looking hair and more passing abilities. Have him on the court with starter minutes and any competent NBA offense will turn you to BBQ chicken
"Why?    Nuggets were more talented and a terrible matchup for the Clippers.    Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Grant&gt;&gt;Kawhi/PG/Nobody     The lesson of that series isn't that talent doesn't matter, it's that a lot of people were stupid for thinking Trez/Lou Williams/Bev were elite playoffs caliber players."
Mavs bigs will give trouble to clippers but ibaka will help. Cauley Stein playing well too.   Ya Morris and Barton been shit but Barton can do more things when shot isn’t falling. Plus clippers bench is real bad rn and Lou Williams is trash rn
Shake’s game is so damn smooth. We haven’t had a sixth man like this since Lou Williams.
"No, that's not what happened. That's what you've been fed. The starters built massive leads and the bench blew it every fucking time due to Cock Rivers running a three guard lineup with Trez in the middle. Five minutes of their play and 15 point lead would disappear. Lou Williams shat 10% from three, Shamet 22%, Trez offered nothing as well. All three were fucking pylons on defense. Denver abused every time they came on."
It's crazy how one wide open missed shot by Lou Williams at the end of game 5 has turned the Clippers in the eyes of everyone here into a trash team.
He wasn't great off ball in OKC either. That's why came off the bench. He just ISO'd and played Harden-ball against other teams bench scrubs. Similar to a Lou Williams type of role.
"In 2017 he had Pat Bev, Lou Williams, Ryan Anderson, and Capela (who was really not that good at that point in his career) as his supporting cast"
"Nick Young, Lou Williams, JR Smith and Klay"
Lou Williams comes to mind as a comparable player who looks great when he's scoring but doesn't do enough of the other stuff to probably be more than a good 6th man.
better than lou williams shooting contested mid range jumpers that he bricks with 0 defense
"If we have a starting lineup that includes Cade and Ant, you pretty much need Beasley out there in order to maximize those guys playmaking and driving ability (due to Malik's ability to stretch the floor).  And then you need a shot creator to lead the second unit, Beasley can't do that.  So it would make sense for Dlo to play a role similar to Lou Williams used to on the Clippers"
"KD will be like Lou Williams, come off bench but instead score 40 and play defense.   We are screwed.   Good luck LA/JUtah/Denver/and LA again."
"yeah I know I don't mean he plays the point. but I mean long term he is short, so you need to try him at point, but he can't pass for shit so it won't work. The Cavs already went through that whole process, and thus now start Garland, who is actually good. if you want to start a SG who's 6'1"" in the playoffs be my guest but woooooowwwwiieeee will it not work.  The next good CLE Cavaliers team will not have Collin Sexton on them. His absolute peak is 6MOY, he is basically Lou Williams  it's ok CLE fans, you can just debate, you don't need to downvote immediately. lol."
"You really tried to call me out and exposed you didn’t watch the games yourself. Nice job /u/FlowersForAdri   Capela was emerging but he also missed 17 games.  Nene was a bench player lmao, and Trevor Ariza was his 3rd.   It’s funny you brought up watching the games because you deadass went to bball-ref and brought these takes. Lou Williams got traded to that team so make it 4, Capela missed 17 games so he wasn’t a consistent option, and Ryan Anderson while great didn’t have the impact Trevor had.   So nice job, you outed your own self trying to call me and /u/lakersbacktoback out."
Lou Williams and Bogdan Bogdonovic 😤
"&gt; To me though, the loss of Montrezl Harrell and sweet Lou Williams will prove to be too much and the Clippers will fail to make the WCF again this season.   Casual spotted"
"Ha, not exactly.  But mentally Denver owned them given the circumstances.  And Denver got better with the AG pick up and an improving MPJ and MVP-level Jokic, Clippers got worse IMO by losing Montrezl and Lou Williams.  Plus whatever lingering toe injury PG may have."
It was on Lou Williams. Doesn't count
I love Lou Williams. So glad he decided not to retire
but the defensive strategy they each faced wasnt the same at all  luka got switches onto reggie jackson and lou williams and feasted. giannis was goin against a wall lol
Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford for aesthetic but low impact.
One type of role player is scoring off the bench. Like Lou Williams for example.
Who do you mean by Doc? Doc Rivers? Also when did Ainge take Kyrie’s word over his?   Which trade at the deadline was even proposed that included Kyrie? From what I remember he wasn’t even included in talks with New Orleans for AD. [This is what this article says too.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/04/celtics-sheltering-irving-from-the-trade-deadline-whirlwind/amp/)  Even [this source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2833296-kyrie-irving-rumors-clippers-asked-celtics-about-deadline-trade-got-quick-no.amp.html) says the Celtics gave a “quick no” to the Clippers when they asked about Kyrie. Besides is Tobias Harris and Lou Williams really enough of a “what if” over Kawhi Leonard?
"I see you couldn’t provide source?  Go take a look at individual RAPM seasons, and you’ll see that massive amounts of outliers. The 19-20 season all has Aaron Holiday, Jrue Holiday and Siakam ranked in the top 10. AD the guy who was first team all NBA is ranked in the 20s after Lou Williams at 13 and just after Kevin Love at 19. And that’s just a few. No model is perfect but that is ridiculous.  I could go on. No one. And I mean no one uses single seasons rating of RAPM to mean anything. The RAPTOR guys recommend no period less than 5 years. Goldstein said minimum 7.  And no one said any of these stats are perfect. But the whole point of RAPTOR and Lebron is that they use shorter time to stabilize. Lebron is ranked poorly defensively in both of them.   Yeah there is pretty big difference between 9 and 1 buddy. Being the 6 best defensive center in the league and being number 1 is pretty fucking different.  I mean if he says LEBRON is an elite defender when none of the advanced models say so, then he is saying his own (and everyone else’s) models suck.  Why would you take your own eye test? Are you an NBA scout? Do you watch the all 10 footage and know what the defensive plays are, and who messed up? You are the one who said to compare it to the eye test not me."
"1. Manu Ginóbili  2. Kevin McHale (1 and 2 are interchangeable but i went with Manu on number 1 since i have seen that season live, and from McHales season i have seen only highlights)  3. Toni Kukoč  4. James Harden  5. Lamar Odom  6. Detlef Schrempf  7. Jamal Crawford  8. Lou Williams ( 7 and 8 also interchangeable easily both Crawford and Williams were completely one dimensional as an 6th man)"
Lou Williams is one of the worst playoff performers of all time dog you didn’t fleece anything lmao
"forgive me if I'm wrong, but did you just compare lou Williams to trae young"
"Honestly it's necessary. People still have it in their minds that Trae Young is a superstar. Remember when people thought that Lou Williams was better than LeBron James? Oh sorry, that was Trae and Luka."
I mean they traded playoff Rondo. No one denies that Lou Williams isn't a good player. It's just he is useless in the playoffs because he plays no defense
“You can’t have your best player play like this”  Oh on the contrary since we just did. He’s also hurt and trying to play through it. Lou Williams is also a goddamn hooper
"Playing Trae Young, Lou Williams, and Gallo and they put the Hawks in the bonus with 8 minutes to go in the 4th. Idk what the warriors were doing."
Lou Williams was looking good too
Lou Williams got the Jordan Clarkson green light on the Hawks lol
Lou Williams switched conferences and still hates the warriors. Damn ya hate to see it.
Do you watch your own fucking team? 18.4% of Kawhi Leonard's shot attempts and 17.5% of Paul George's shot attempts come from 0-3 feet. Each of those numbers are low for star players. Zubac and Mann get to the line at a high rate but shoot less than 5 times per game. What do you expect?   The Clippers last season led the league in free throw attempts IIRC. They lost Montrezl Harrell (who got to the line a ton) in the offseason and Lou Williams (who is now also gone) declined ptetty hard.
"Zubac established himself as one of the best Jokic defenders in the playoffs last year, it was more so Harrell that Jokic went off on, ofc because of Doc's coaching.  Last game was no fluke.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/clippers/.amp/news/doc-rivers-playing-harrell-over-zubac-contributed-to-departure  Furthermore you can see this issue has followed him to the LAL, their defense has not been the same since they got him &amp; shed Howard.  Clippers also shed Lou Williams, 35mpg, 10ppg, 35/16/38 shooting splits vs Denver.    Last game they nearly beat Denver missing their starting C, both PGs and Morris, PG, Kawhi all injured.   Also Rondo, Batum, are added Jokic defenders, Batum has the IQ to cancel out Jokic's, Rondo was Denver's nightmare last year, whilst Ibaka has shown the ability to abuse Jokic on the offensive side of the ball."
Did you watch the Clippers at all the last two years? He was almost exclusively used in pick and rolls. He and Lou Williams were one of the highest usage pick and roll combos in the league even with both coming off the bench.
"I'm kind of bored with Lakers vs. Clippers games. We do well enough against them, it's the other good teams I'm eager to see us play. I am interested to see how both Rondo and Lou Williams are looking now, enough to tune in for a bit.  Not spending time with family though, they have cooties."
"The thing is, a real role in his eyes probably isn't being a back up. Most back ups in the NBA are role players, I don't think he could be a good role player, unless his role is something akin to Lou Williams."
"Long post incoming:   Wiseman's OBPM on the year is -4.3. His DBPM is -1.3. As a point of reference, Andris Biedrins in his final year with the Warriors had a -4.8 OBPM. Biedrins' TS% that year was 45%. Wiseman's this year is 55%. Despite being a far more efficient finisher, a 33% three point shooter and shooting 30 points better from the free throw line than Biedrins, Wiseman's offensive impact is only marginally better than later career Biedrins. That's um... really bad.  In the Kerr era Steph has only been a part of three two-man combos to play &gt;100 minutes with a negative net rating: Steph/Oubre -1.9, Steph/Varejao -6.6, and Steph/Wiseman -7.4. The ORTG of Steph/Wiseman is 102.8  In Steph's entire career, these are the negative net rating two-man combos he's been in that have received &gt;100 minutes . Steph/Oubre, Steph/Varejao (2015-16), Steph Wiseman, Steph/Festus (2012-13) Steph/Biedrins (2012-13), Steph/Steve Blake, Steph/Jordan Crawford, Steph/Klay (2011-12) , Steph/Biedrins (2011-12), Monta/Steph (2010-11), Steph/Reggie Williams (2010-11), Steph/Lou Admunson (2010-11), Steph/Biedrins (2010-11), Steph/Gadzuric (2010-11), Steph/Carney (2010-11) Steph/Turiaf (2009-10) Steph/Morrow (2009-10), Steph/S-Jax (2009-10), Steph/Chris Hunter (2009-10), Steph/Randolph, Steph/Biedrins (2009-10), Steph/William (2009-10)s, Steph/Maggette (2009-10), Steph/Randmonovic (2009-10), Monta/Steph (2009-10), Steph/Bukie (2009-10), Steph/Mikki Moore (2009-10)  In Steph's ENTIRE CAREER, only six two man-combos have performed worse than Steph/Wiseman:  Monta/Steph -8.0 (2009-10) Steph/Gadzuric -8.8 (2010-11) Steph/Carney -10.5 (2010-11) Curry/Crawford -11.8 (2013-14) Steph/Bukie -14.0 (2009-10) Steph/Mikki Moore -20.8 (2009-10)  You'll notice that three of those two man combos are from when Steph was a rookie and wasn't STEPH F'n CURRY. The other three players Gadzuric, Carney, and Crawford, literally never played another NBA game after their seasons with the Warriors. So in the Kerr era era, Wiseman has had the worst numbers per net rating in a two-man combo with Steph and the only players worse than him played with rookie Steph or did not play in the NBA the season after. From the Kerr era, no two-man combo involving Steph has ever had a worse ORTG than Steph/Wiseman.  What does Wiseman do well, exactly? Finish? Yeah, but he's also 7'1 and in the 99th percentile of human athleticism. He should at the bare minimum, finish well. At this point his jumper is mostly an idea. He's shooting 33% on jumpers this year and only 63% from the free throw line. On the year, Wiseman is shooting 30% from shots in the paint that are not in the restricted area, 29.7% on hook shots, and is shooting 34% from the mid-range. Add that all up and there's a body of evidence that suggests Wiseman doesn't have a natural shooter's touch. Beyond that, his shot selection is really bad. It's still a bit of a mystery as to whether the coaching staff wants Wiseman to post up or he's seeking out those shots himself, but he's a bad post player at this point. Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler punk'd him multiple times last night and he spins himself into trouble and fades on an alarming number of shots.  Wiseman has looked way more comfortable in PNR situations this year and I absolutely believe that he should be running more of those, but his PPP there isn't stellar either. Looney, Paschall, Dray, JTA, and Steph all have a higher PPP than Wiseman does as the roll man, albeit on lower volume (the only one who comes close to matching the frequency of PNR roll man is Paschall)."

Good to see Lou Williams playing well in his new team
He gonna name his kid Fifty like Lou Williams named his kid Syx?
Dang. Lou Williams gotta be shaking his head...
"""On June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.""... yes he ""joined"" him...  ""On July 16, 2019, the Houston Rockets traded Paul, 2024 and 2026 first round picks, and 2021 and 2025 second round pick swaps to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Russell Westbrook.""... yes... also ""joined"" him"
"I didn’t. Even with a healthy Klay I think they’re competing for that 7/8 spot.   The bench has been decimated over the last few years. We went from Livingston, Iggy, McGee/healthy Looney, David West, Barbosa, and Bogut to a bunch of g leaguers who are inconsistent.   Poole has potential to be a 6th man scorer like a Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams, but he’s nowhere near that point yet. Lee is nothing more than a spot up shooter.   With a healthy Klay maybe they make some moves at the deadline to get some more help, but this warriors team with a healthy Steph, Draymond, and Klay was still not competing for a championship.   Wiseman has potential but he has a lot of work to do. He needs to bulk up and really develop his game."
Tony Snell and Lou Williams
I'm just happy it's not fucking Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford anymore.
"Lou Williams barely played that season.   Gordon, Anderson, and Beverly all shot above 37% from three that season, with Anderson over 40%. He also had Ariza and a good rim runner that could actually catch the ball in Capela.   That’s a much better offensive supporting cast than what Steph is playing with."
"What? They are better defensively, but 50x times worse offensively.  Man Curry alongside Gordon, Capela, Ariza, Lou Williams, Beverly plus a solid bench is way better than a bunch of G leaguers and 5 ppg Draymond Green. How is this even a discussion.  Oubre and Wiggins are far from reliable players, specialy Oubre who started the seasom with the worst shooting stretch in nba history."
"Harden **led the league in assists** playing next to Lou Williams, Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon"
Lou Williams once talked a robber out of robbing him and bought him [McDonalds](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/7391657/lou-williams-philadelphia-76ers-says-won-armed-robber) afterward
"harden had him beat on literally every stat on the way worse team. and no, durants defense wasn't ""far"" better, both were matched up with eachother quite often during the series.  yeah durant was able to dominate patrick beverley and lou williams, harden struggled a bit against the #1 jazz defense who guarded him from behind. give harden the warriors team and give kd the rockets team and its not even fucking close who wins, atleast harden made it a dog fight"
Maybe players like JJ Redick And Lou Williams
"[Dunno what u rememberin then](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lnsqkd/in_light_of_the_recent_dameluka_comparisonswhich/go2al5b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)  &gt; Luka shot 1/7 for 2 points against anyone not named Lou Williams or Reggie Jackson in the final like 11 minutes of the game. He shot 4/4 for 11 points against Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson.  Again, superb job forcing those switches though! Great result at the end."
"He hasnt been that dominant against good defenders tbh  He feasted on Kemba off of switches tonight  And his iconic 40 smth point game against the clippers in the first round with the game winner? Like every field goal he made in the last ten minutes or so were while guarded by reggie jackson or lou williams. Struggled far more vs kawhi/pg/morris  Point is, you need a team without a small liability like kemba or lou. Because he’ll attack them relentlessly. he’s lebron esque in that regard"
"Lamelo, Lou Williams, Brandon ingram, lebron, boogie.  (Lamelo recently passed Dion waiters since the later is not in the league rn)  I think that’s a 2nd round team maybe but they’d be awful defensively"
Lou Williams. Jamal Crawford. I’m sorry but what?
&gt;Lou Williams breaks silence  didnt he post a statement on his ig within a day of being traded
"Defense matters but it hardly matters when comparing Halliburton and Ant lmao. Historically speaking, buckets is the most important thing with RotY. Awards are what they are. You don’t see defensive specialists winning 6moty either, it’s Lou Williams lmao. Ppg is also the most important stat for mvp not named wins. Don’t hate me for acknowledging the history of the awards."
His value is kind of low because of his injuries but I've been advocating for a PatBev-Eric Bledsoe swap for a while; sort of a sell-low for both parties.  The Clippers need a proper point guard and have extremely limited assets (as shown by the fact that they were only able to get Rajon Rondo for Lou Williams). Bledsoe can't shoot for shit but he'd only be there to make plays (remember he averaged 6 assists a game in the playoffs last year) and play defense. Hopefully Ibaka being a stretch-5 counteracts the lack of shooting.  The Pels get rid of a logjam in their backcourt while getting a guy that helps space the floor (PatBev is like a career 40% shooter from 3) who fits really well next to Lonzo.
"No the dude has terrible takes, here are some I copy pasted from someone else's comment  &gt; Where are all the white NBA players? How come they aren't saying anything? Sometimes I feel like the white community only cares about its own people.  &gt; Honestly I think it's time for the higher IQ players like Gasol and Caruso to really take up the playmaking role that LeBron left.  &gt; Jokic gets no respect on here. The level he's playing at right now easily matches up against any season in NBA history. Right now I'd say he's playing at the same level as prime LeBron.  &gt; Greatest point guard of all time(about John Stockton)  &gt; It's hilarious how much people try to denigrate Euros these days. Jokic is clearly the best player in the league, and it's not particularly close, but because of the rest of his roster is so shit it's held against him.\  &gt; He's not even a mid-all-time defender either. He was overrated-to-garbage defensively for most of his career. I'd put him on par with Ginobili actually, but at least Manu was consistent.(about draymond)   &gt; Yeah let's not kid ourselves, Herro is still 100% the better player than Westbrook is  &gt; I agree, I'm just saying Luka is the only one even close. Jokic is having arguably the best season in NBA history, and he's clearly the best player in the league by far at this point, no one even comes close. At this point he's outstripped prime LeBron offensively.  &gt; The real question is, is LeBron better than Bird? Only knock on Bird is that he didn't play long enough. Otherwise he was better.  &gt; Malone was nothing without Stockton  &gt; Then those people need to stop eating glue. Comparing Trae and Luka at any point in their careers is like comparing LeBron James and Lou Williams  &gt; You're disrespecting Rubio a ton here. He completely outplayed Russ the last time they faced each other in the playoffs. If he wasn't better than Russ then, he certainly was from that point forward.  &gt; It's funny that for a small ball team Ryan Anderson ended up being the only legit stretch big they got  It's not too hard to figure out what he's doing"
"I'd argue he's 3rd, MPJ is just a taller Lou Williams with better rebounding"
"Remember when we thought that Lou Williams was better than LeBron? Oh, sorry, that was Trae Young and Luka."
"Smart puts your team in a weird position I think. He's so good on the defensive end, especially at the end of games, that you feel compelled to have on the court at the end of games, because if you don't you're missing out on something that (probably) no one else on your team can provide. However, that also means he'll be on the court for offensive possessions in the last 5 minutes, and defences will sag off of him and he'll go right ahead and waste a few key possessions with debatable plays. Sort of a damned if you, damned if you don't type of situation.   Hard to say for value -- I can barely even think of comps. Like Lou Williams a few years ago, maybe."
Plenty of failed super teams exist. Just look at the Clippers last year with Kawhi Paul George Marcus Morris Montrezz Harrell Patrick Beverly Lou Williams Jaymycal Green Reggie Jackson
Steve Kerr spent that whole series whipping his dick around doing shit like starting Damian Jones. Warriors were all banged up and slept walked through every first half.....and yet a sweep. Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari could take 2 games vs a healthy Warriors team but Portland couldn’t even get one   Portland benefitted from a favorable draw to make that conference final then just got swept as the Warriors flagrantly disrespected them with an undermanned squad. So yeah all that series did was highlight what a non contender Portland was
"Harden had a better team, which is the main reason for the better record. Russ would've killed for backups life Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, not only that Harden had great pieces like Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela to fill out the squad.  People act like the Rockets won 55 games because Harden was that much better than Russ, when in reality the difference wins was due to better coaching and a better roster"
"Lou Williams literally takes one bounce and then shoots it, his free throw routine can’t be more than 3 seconds"
I think that SG and PF are weak because they're pretty much tweener positions and most of them identify as something else. Even Lou Williams is a PG now
No Lou Williams leads to great things.
"Exactly, and somehow the Clippers having to pay more than the Nets for players at the deadline supports the idea of big market teams are getting better players for less?   &gt;The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo   Do they know the Clippers are in LA?"
If you guys just got Rondo from a buy out sure  But you lost out on Lou Williams  I get his defense is trash and he hasnt been particularly effective this season - but come playoff time not having him coming off the bench is gonna hurt esp given that he is easily good for 1 playoff win when he gets the hot hand
"&gt; “This is creating a competitive advantage for the large, destination markets,” says the first team exec. “And it’s another inequity for the small markets.”  &gt; **The Clippers** had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  &gt; **The Sixers** traded players and picks to get George Hill.  Yeah, poor small markets *Los Angeles* and *Philadelphia*"
"I do watch the Mavericks.   He shoots a ton of catch and shoot 3’s.   He is a great player, but Jordan Clarkson’s appeal is literally the fact he is a shot creator. He plays like a Lou Williams-type.   If you think THJ creates as many shots as Clarkson does than you don’t watch Jordan Clarkson. I’m also not saying Clarkson is better, just pointing out that the voters typically award shot creators."
"Willis Reed is technically the only 2nd round pick to win an MVP.... but that was 1964 and the rounds were different then, so he was still 8th overall, not really the same thing as Jokic who was picked 41st overall. Other than that Jokic is pretty clearly the best 2nd rounder ever, or will be if he wins MVP this year (+110 odds).   Other 2nd rounders who were/are good but not MVP level: Draymond, Manu, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Millsap, Lou Williams, PJ Tucker, Rodman, Gilbert Arenas.   None of those guys were as good at their peaks as Jokic is now though."
Wow Lou Williams says many have multiple gfs? I guess 80% are cheaters
 I literally provided a link with Lou Williams who is an nba player saying many of the guys have multiple gf. Meanwhile you have nothing. Being a hot/tall/multimillionaire at the age of 23 literally is a fantasy stop being a dumb. It’s an achievable fantasy but it’s still Hollywood shit. You just don’t know rich people
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."
"How are the Clippers a small market team? If it's because they're the ""little brother"" in LA to the Lakers, the Nets are the same to the Knicks in NYC. Not to mention the fact that they have the richest owner in the NBA. Trading Lou Williams was their choice. Pretty sure Miami and Philly aren't really small markets either, but I'm not claiming that I know anything for certain here."
"I agree with this. Buyouts generate buzz but don't move the needle.   LMA and Blake are less impactful than we assume because neither can defend. So you have a Jalen Rose situation where both can score 10 points a game but the person they're guarding will scored 14. If you're a bench player your primary job is to preserve the lead that your starters created. Don't see that happening when they can't defend, they aren't prolific scorers either, so not like we're seeing a Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford situation here."
"NBA isn’t normal people. I don’t think most normal people cheat. Hollywood literally has sex cults and you think a bunch of attractive, tall rich dudes who travel for a living don’t cheat. Youre being naive. We are literally talking about stardom/riches being thrust on teenage kids. I’m not the immature one, the players are when they enter the league. Maybe Lonzo is different but Idk. Like the players even admit it.   https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/lou-williams-nba-players-multiple-girlfriends-article-1.3795125  https://www.thesportster.com/basketball/nba-stars-chasing-championships/  Maybe I’m falling for the “glitz and glam” and how these guys are portrayed in the media so maybe I’m naive but that doesn’t make me immature."
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201201300PHI.html  This. The 2011-12 76ers were the most unentertaining team in NBA history. Doug Collins literally coached basketball like a caveman and believed in hero ball. This is great when you have Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, or Old Michael Jordan. It’s not good when you have Lou Williams as your primary option.   In this game, they played the Orlando Magic and both teams sucked. The 76ers sucked less."
"Eh, Gary is great on guards like lillard or Mitchell but honestly PG just missed a ton of shots he should have hit. Gary did great on Lou williams but wasnt crucial to guarding their wings"
They got a huge starting centre upgrade with serge ibaka   They got a huge upgrade from Landry shamet to Luke Kennard  And they have a play off upgrade from lou Williams to rajon rondo   PG has also been playing amazing  Saying the clippers are the same is a casual take
"But it's likely gonna be Grant because this award is based on the biggest stat increases from a player who went to irrelevancy to borderline stardom, even if Randle deserves it   It's like how you could make the argument there are flat out better players than the Lou Williams or Montrezl Harrells of the world off the bench, but they're always in contention for 6MOY because the award is typically given to the bench player with the best volume scoring stats (this year, Clarkson)"
Lou Williams and James Harden come screeching in.
"Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Melo, Lou Williams, Drummond"
"&gt;SG - Lou Williams  &gt;PF - Montrezl Harrell  First off, Lou and Trezz are a PG and a C  Second off, they 100% belong in the league, you blind"
"2017 Rockets had four: James Harden, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams and Corey Brewer."
Subtracting doc rivers/lou williams/trez is the real greay deal but it hurts me to include lou in that  Replace lou/doc/trez with rondo/lue/ibaka and no way clippers don't close out that game 5
"Clippers, because their executives were sneaking around our arena during games trying to lure Kawhi, and I don't understand why Kawhi didn't at least run it back for one more year given how many people we had on expiring contracts. Yeah, PG13 is better than Siakam, but Patrick Beverly and Lou Williams aren't anywhere near as good as Lowry and FVV.  Also him leaving kind of sent us into a death-spiral which we're unlikely to recover from this season."
"Top 20 for a skilled scorer, okay passer and no other good qualities? Where would Kyrie or '18 Lou Williams rank in the top 20?"
I thought the consensus was everyone wanted to be Lou Williams
"All time: Drazen Petrovic, Rod Strickland  Current: Lou Williams, Jamal Murray, CJ"
Remember when people were legitimately discussing whether he should be an allstar over Lou Williams
Lou Williams - LeBron James
"I mean this could really be Jamal Crawford, Lou Williams or JR Smith's whole careers that he's referring to."
"They saw themselves as the heart of the team? Those guys didn’t show up in the bubble and played horribly! Lou Williams legit put the team in jeopardy to get Lemon Pepper wings, the guy who thinks of himself as the heart of the team isn’t doing this BS."
"Idk effort i guess. they also have a few liabilities tbh in Lou Williams, like kennard."
"Also, Kennard is regularly getting DNP-CDs nowadays and he has a 4 year $64 million extension that kicks in next year. Nobody is going to want him at that price. He's a negative value asset because of the contract extension he signed. And Lou Williams said recently if he was traded he'd just retire, so all he represents to another team is $8 million in cap space next summer. Reggie Jackson is on a minimum contract, so he can't fetch much. Beverley is incredibly injury prone and is old who also has a contract larger than what he contributes. Morris is also getting old and is way overpaid.   None of those guys really have much trade value. Morris probably has the most value, then Beverley, but everyone else is pretty much worthless in a trade (or worse, would need more assets attached to them to unload them). The Clippers can't give up Beverley without getting a starting guard back, because they're already so thin at guard. And they're using Morris as their closing center because Ibaka has been so underwhelming this year (only 23 mpg). They could possibly do Morris for Turner, if the Pacers are interested in taking on $64 million of Morris who's already 31 years old. But that's probably all they could do unless they trade Ibaka instead."
Lou Williams
Shout out Lou Williams 4th quarter defense
Lou Williams Defensive Player of the Year.
LOU WILLIAMS DPOY WHAT IS GOING ON
"DPOY lou Williams, of course"
You know Luka wouldnt have shot that if there wasnt a hand out he could trap into it. I understand wanting a call for your team but you don’t have to be disingenuous about that type of call. I dont go around defending the shit Lou Williams does to draw fouls lol
Lou Williams probably still does that second part tbh
Methinks he can return and play a Lou Williams role on certain teams. We just can't expect to be an allstar any longer I'd imagine.
"Sixers win, but Embiid will have at least one embarrassing game where Capela owns him. Dwight will also get into a fight with Lou Williams thinking it’s Pat Beverly."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are the newest ones:  Lou Williams: [https://basketballbeacon.com/lou-williams-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/lou-williams-player-profile-stats/)  JJ Redick: [https://basketballbeacon.com/jj-redick-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/jj-redick-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
"There hasn't been a Clippers/Blazers game this season where the Blazers have played with the current starting lineup they are using  No Norm first game + rusty Nurk + Clips had Lou Williams, No Nurk second game plus hurting Dame, no Dame third game"
"2016-17 Harden’s rockets won 55, with his best costar as Eric Gordon or Lou Williams  The next season he won 65 games with CP3. His teams didn’t miss the playoffs. And Durant shot 28% from 3, and 42% from the field when he lost to the Warriors, which is a choke IMO.  Both players r phenomenal I agree. I just think media has sold us on Durant is #2 or 1 in world narrative, but if you eliminate his easy titles, it’s really not that clean cut"
Totally forgot about Lou Will lol. “Williams not happy about being traded from the clippers. Thought about retiring after being traded”
Lou Williams ain't feeling Atlanta.
"Even Blazer fans are mixed. Some think he’s a top 25 player, truly all star level. Others think he’s a glorified Lou Williams at worst. I’m somewhere in the middle and think he’s a good iso scorer, decent ball handler but nothing much else. I think our new guy Norman Powell is a more complete, impactful player"
The Lakers should be ashamed at how they treated DLo.  And to think that the team and the staff and even the media were defending Nick Young - a total dirtbag.  It's definitely also one of the black marks on Magic Johnson.  An incredible low point for the Lakers and they should somehow try to publicly apologize to DLo.  And Lou Williams. Oh god. That guy destroyed the Clippers season last year.
"Lol ""Lou Williams got up and walked away"" from DLO according to the article. Also Lou has two girlfriends who are cool with each other."
"Seems like the quote needs context. And I think Trudell meant for what the Lakers need, Caruso offers more value than Lou Williams. If you are a liability on defense, then you don't belong on the Lakers. Even Kuzma improved defensively. If he didn't, then he would've been traded this season.  They have a bunch of defensive minded players: Caruso, KCP, Matthews, AD, LeBron, and Gasol. And the rest are decent, not liabilities."
After his injury he came back as first guy off the bench.  He was excellent as the first offensive option with the second unit.  Something of a Lou Williams role.
"Offensively sure, it's not hard to play the 5th man role.  Defensively Lou Williams is one of the worst players in the league while Caruso is (at worst) a significantly positive team defender."
His best teammate since Aldridge left (in Dame’s third year) is a glorified Lou Williams lmao. At this point I borderline want him to team up with another star elsewhere to just make everyone shut the fuck up
Lou Williams is undeniably better than Caruso as the best player on a team. If he's the best player on your team that team is going to be terrible.  Caruso is undeniably better than Lou Williams as a 5th option offensively because he provides positive defensive and off-ball value.
Lou Williams is still far better. Caruso is a scrappy white guy that plays next to Lebron so he gets overrated by the suburban weirdos
I can only interpret his silence as a vote for Lou Williams to which I must say I am shocked and appalled. I can't believe Draymond thinks that Lou Williams should win DPOY.
"He’s been balling out on Utah for forever. Lou Williams type role, he fits it perfectly. All scoring no brain"
I remember in the 2018 playoffs Clarkson went over 100 minutes without an assist while jacking up like 55 shots. Lol. I think he's going to be Lou Williams-esque again in the playoffs.
Lou Williams vs GSW is infuriating as a Dubs fan.  He seemingly makes every shot he takes against us.
DeMar DeFrozen   also Lou Williams sucks in the playoffs
"It's unfortunately probably Jose Calderon and Lou Williams smh. Attracting free agents is a different argument than 'retaining their guy' tho.   We're a historically shit team but we had no trouble retaining our allstars when we actually had a good team to offer. VC and Bosh left because they were wasting their talent on terrible teams.   I'd agree that canadian teams will never attract american players, but neither do many other small tv market teams in the nba."
I think Anfernee Simons might end up as a Jordan Clarkson/Lou Williams type player. 6th man scorer who can shoot with bad defense.
so a better lou williams?
Did dude just call CJ... Lou Williams?
i used to like him but ever since he brought pg into his beef with pat bev and lou williams i’ve seen him as just a big ego guy
"Andre came off that bench too! The fact that he didn’t win a 6MOY during that run is a travesty and he deserved it way more than Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, or Jamal Crawford ever did in that time."
Lou Williams has joined the chat
"I’ll take that seeing as that Simmons is a better scorer, passer, rebounder, and defender than Draymond. Having Simmons isn’t the easiest for roster construction but people act like he should be traded for fuckin Lou Williams cause he can get buckets easier. It wild to me."
"Yep, only way to use him as a roleplayer is as a bench sparkplug to lead a unit, and that's if he somehow gets his scoring mojo back enough to be a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams type."
"Ujiri needs to trust the process. Being a perpetual low seed is not the way to go through life don. Many years of my life were wasted by Mo Cheeks misusing two different AIs, Elton Brand (the player edition), Eddie Jordan, and Lou Williams ISOs."
"I know he's been injured, but it feels like it's been forever since DeAndre Hunter last played (Reddish too for that matter).  I don't think either of them has played with Lou Williams yet."
hes a pg the same way lou williams is one
His defense is super concerning.  It's so bad I don't know how he becomes anything but a supercharged version of Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson with more athleticism if he doesn't get better on that end.
Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams
"Think they meant in terms of a young guy who gets it, and will he a solid role player. Not the same skill set obviously, everyone does it different.   Think Lou Williams, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Shane Battier kinda guy."
Once he gets 25+mpg those Lou Williams comparisons are going to take off even more
"Monta was a good comparison. I always thought of Jennings as an early career Lou Williams. Lou Will really didn't become an impactful player until his mid to late 20's. Until then he was, like Jennings, a very inefficient, undersized guard. But Lou became a great pick and roll player later in his career. Jennings probably could have been a better version of Lou Will cuz he had more talent."
Nate McMillan having Lou Williams be the backup point guard for the Hawks reminds me of the disaster with Jamal Crawford being our backup point guard in Nate McMillan's last year with the Blazers.
If Monta was essentially Lou Williams before the warriors asked him to carry thee team
I’m still traumatized by Doug Collins endlessly ISOing Lou Williams. Pretty sure he singlehandedly destroyed Evan Turner’s development.   So Monta.
Lou Williams.
Would Lou Williams and Rudy Gay get bench spots on this ex-Raptors team?
Just goes to show how many winners were on Lakers roster last season in comparison to Clips. Can't believe there was a point in time people thought Montrez and Lou Williams were legit playoff contributers and comparable to Rondo
"Baynes is a good guy, he just ruined our season cause he was the only big man we signed and was supposed to be a serviceable player but is actually unplayable.      Lou Williams was also a cool guy when he has here, but extremely selfish and shot the ball horribly. Did the same dumb ass fading to the left shot at the end of every quarter and always bricked it. Then he played AWFUL in the playoffs, and was a huge reason we got swept. Then he signs somewhere else, and later on says ""Once you're there, you'll love playing for the Raptors, you'll love playing for the country, but that fourth, fifth month into the season, you're like 'goddamn, I want to go home.'"""
Aron Baynes current  Lou Williams all time
"Not really, not having Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell + having by all accounts a superior Paul George makes their chances much greater. I also don't see Lue fucking up rotations as badly."
Plys it's a grey area. Lou Williams was 6th man but played 30+ mins. That's basically starter minutes. So minutes is the better representation.
Lou Williams
"The defensive situation is pretty rough. If I'm being honest, I think as good a scorer as Sexton is, he's likely to end up being the next Lou Williams— a 6MOTY-caliber bucket off the bench, but not a good enough playmaker to start at the 1 and too much of a defensive liability to start at the 2 on a good team. That's a very valuable player, don't get me wrong, but it's not a star, and the SexLand backcourt probably isn't going to be starting together in the long term."
Should Devin Booker take a Lou Williams role off the bench?

May I introduce you to Lou Williams?
Lou Williams
The Lou Williams/Jamal Crawford award
Lou Williams and the playoffs don’t mesh too well
"If I were to make a top ten of most skilled players of all time, the list would include players like Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry, Larry Bird, Isaiah Thomas, Jerry West, Jason Williams, Sweet Lou and J Crawford. I wouldn't put Manu on that list.   But I could agree with Manu as the best sixth man followed by Crawford, Lou and Tony K."
"What are you defining as raw playing ability? Because wouldn’t IQ, ability to impact the game, total packages on both ends be raw playing ability? And as such, manu was multitudes better than both of these guys.  Manu was consistently near the top of the league in RAPM throughout his prime, showing he was a huge impact player, probably far better than the average fan thought he was.   From 97-14, manu ginobili ranked 4th in RAPM, one of the more reliable impact metrics imo. Obviously there are outliers (like Pat Bev being ranked 8th) and obviously I don’t think he was the 4th best player over that period, but for Comparison, Lou Williams was 592nd, and Crawford was 829th.  Jamal in particular was always wildly overrated, he had a nice looking offensive game, but it never really eventuated into much impact, as his efficiency plummeted in the playoffs (and was never good to begin with). And scoring was all he ever brought to the table, and it was never even really evident that his scoring outweighed all his other negatives.   I’m just pointing out that I think it’s crazy to compare Jamal and Lou to a true star player like manu. You can say manu played on good teams, but manu clearly was a reason those teams were so good."
"\*cough* Iverson \*cough*  Detroit was a disaster, but he could've been a Lou Williams in Memphis with that team and the way it was set up. They had all the pieces that would get them to a WCF a few years later (Gasol, Conley, Randolph) plus they still had Rudy Gay, and young OJ Mayo and Demarre Carroll.  Still disappointed he didn't realize the opportunity. Probably doesn't play until he's 43 like Vince Carter, but still, he could've had a few more productive years of 13+ points off the bench on a playoff team."
"Bogdan Bogdanovich, and Sweet Lou Williams"
i’m just shocked you’re having trouble with the fact that they can make lou williams jokes while not allowing their own employees to publicly post themselves at strip clubs.  lmao wtf does the karma comment mean
"&gt;no idea how they got blown out by the Pistons though the night after  half the team is injured.   Trae Young, Lou Williams, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell were all out and Kevin Huerter and Brandon Goodwill both left the game injured."
again they don’t pay lou williams so it’s you that’s missing the point lol
Well they don't pay Lou Williams salary so I'm not sure how that relates.
They probably shouldn't bring up Lou Williams going to magic city every time they talk about him then
"2017 rockets had good role players who shot really well from 3 like Ryan Anderson, Beverly, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams and Ariza. They also had pretty good centers in capela and harrell. Harden was great too but that is better than who steph has right now  I’m not saying harden didn’t have an impact but I don’t get the notion that harden is a better floor raiser than steph. They haven’t really had even caliber teams for us to test that theory out."

Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
He got paid by the Hawks then was traded for Lou Williams.  Clippers are on the hook for the remaining portion of his salary.
Lou Williams helps. He is leading the league in fourth quarter scoring for years now
lou williams really kept slipping those 2 man traps. Bogdan was bombing. Great play down the 4th and a very nice win for the hawks.
He needs to be better in the 4th. No one on the Hawks can guard him.  Lou Williams should be run off the floor when Giannis is in the game.   They still haven't learned to force teams into those type of adjustments
People forget Lou Williams scored 51 points against Peak Warriors in the playoffs
"There'll be plenty of games when I'll hate him, but I'm very happy we turned Rondo into Lou Williams"
"Lou ""actually michael jordan"" Williams"
I would like to issue a formal apology to Lou Williams for everything I have said about his play tonight
"Yeah, it's more like: Lou Williams makes dumb move to challenge the reigning DPOY who is also a foot taller than him"
"It's not like they're getting blown out. They could easily be in the playoffs if they didn't choke in the clutch, which partly is due to being so young.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd run it back, but:  \- Trade Bledsoe + picks for a 3 + D. Duncan Robinson would be nutty but his D is meh. I'd like a tough guy who can be vocal, a better James Johnson (who's been really great, but his place is on the bench).  \- Trade Steven Adams + picks for someone like Myles Turner. I love Adams but the extension he signed is atrocious and Hernangomez can be a lite version of him, which is more than enough in today's NBA. The fact that you have to take off your 20m$/yr guy because he's getting outplayed is unacceptable.  \- I'd resign Lonzo to be honest. He's got the right attitude, he's improving every year, his chemistry with Zion is nuts and he's a layup package away from being an elite role player. His defence is there, his 3 is there, his playmaking is there, his midrange is there, even his fucking Free Throws are there. He needs to get to the rim. That should be his assignment for this offseason. Even though his 3pt% might not show that, he's taken his 3p to a new level from last year. Last year he would be really good from 3 as a catch and shoot. Feet set, wide open, etc This year he's hitting stepbacks, shooting off the dribble, getting plays run for him  \- The bench is getting stacked in hustle guys (Hayes, Hart, James Johnson) but the Pels need someone who can get buckets. Someone like Lou Williams. Kira and NAW are nice, we'll see their development.  \-Maybe trade BI + picks for a superstar that complements Zion (if the opportunity presents itself)."
"Lou Williams, on the league choosing not to double him in the bubble during the playoffs: “If you want to stay at the Magic City gentleman's club with me, I’m going to be the one to get the BBQ wings first … whatever the hell that means.”"
Still remember him hitting a big 3 over Lou Williams in the playoffs and it just looked ridiculous. Knew the nuggets were winning it at that point.
Lou Williams Kyle Lowry seem to get a lot
Prime Lou Williams baby
Lou Williams by casuals
So did Blake Griffin and Lou Williams.
Unbiased opinion   MVP - Trae Young  DPOY - Clint Capela  6MOY - Lou Williams  MIP - Brandon Goodwin  COY - Nate McMillan  ROY - Onyeka Okongwu
"With all the injuries, it was really great to see so many guys step up. Guys like Okongwu, Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Duncan Robinson, and Lou Williams all contributed for the Hawks tonight"
Lou Williams
"Lol amazing strawman, I must say.  Lou Williams played 20 games so that doesn’t matter. Capella was about as good as adams that season. Oladipo was better then gordon, same offensive production while oladipo was a much better defender. And nice job ignoring all defensive player roberson lol.   Both teams had role players, rockets more so for offense OKC more so for defense. The difference was harden being far more efficient, that’s really it.  Also, here is bleacher report ranking houston 11th in a 2017 season prediction.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2664038-nba-predictions-2016-17-win-loss-projections-for-every-team-pre-training-camp.amp.html  And lmao @ clutch points, nobody gives a shit. Harden was putting teams away earlier and by more points. He didn’t need clutch time, he led the 4th best team in the league without any other stars. Westbrook did not deserve the award for being a worse player on a worse team who pads rebounds   I don’t care about advanced stats that are padded by rebounds lmao. Anyone with a brain knows harden was better, led the better team (who by the way destroyed OKC in the playoffs with harden outplaying russ) and deserved the award easily"
Lou Williams as our primary ball-handler seems...problematic
"Itll be tough for Quickley to get good looks against the three noted stalwart defenders of Trae Young, Lou Williams, and Brandon Goodwin"
He is better in the Lou Williams role
Traded with Atlanta for Lou Williams.
Lou Williams on steroids in his late years.  Jesus...
He is better in the Lou Williams role
"&gt;It was reported that both PG and Kawhi were coming to practices late and had “superstar” treatment. Lou Will, Pat Bev, and Harrel weren’t happy with this and felt they got special treatment.   Ok what do this have to do with the Nets?    &gt;On top of the fact that Kawhi wasn’t a vocal leader, that locker room was far from sane.   How does this relate to us? Deandre Jordan probaly more vocal that Kawhi. Again, two separate situations   &gt;They only had a 3-1 lead because of talent, and lost it because they couldn’t overcome getting punched in the mouth.  The first couple of games were a back and forth.  Both kawhi and PG shot terribly especially in the 4th quarter of a game 7. Here’s a fact, PG has disappeared in close games before, and this was with **having chemistry**. Lou Williams has also been a negative on the floor in the playoffs which is why Toronto couldn’t wait to let him go off somewhere else. That’s while **having chemistry**. Montrez got destroyed by Jokic. He could have played 82 games with Kawhi/PG/Lou etc and that **still** would have happened. Chemistry wasn’t fixing shit, and it has nothing to do with the Brooklyn Nets. Nothing anyone can say could change that"
"The Clippers with Lou Williams took the Warriors to 6 in 2019.   Boston added Kyrie didn’t lead to any more wins  The Heat “took” the Lakers to six games last year in the finals   There’s diminishing marginal returns to adding talent, and just because you win 2 games in a series doesn’t mean you weren’t convincingly outplayed. Plus, dally played the game of his life game 2, better than a regular Kyrie would have in game 2 specifically"
Dude you listed a bunch of underperforming players and used that to prove your point..  Lou Williams is having by far the worst season of his career.  Herro is looking like a bust.  KCP... lol  Aint my fault dude
"Define “good.” You said he’s “pure ass.” Going by BPM (worse than Kuz), here are some players this year that are crystal-grade ass:  Schröder  RJ Barrett  PJ Washington  KCP  Seth Curry  Darius Garland  Tyler Herro  Gary Trent JR  Lou Williams  Ricky Rubio  Lu Dort  Ant Edwards  Dillon Brooks"
"He’s the only reason the hawks aren’t the 30th worst defense in a starting lineup with trae young, bogdon bogdonavich, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon hill. Not to mention atrocious defenders like Lou Williams and gallinari and a mediocre guy like John Collins. Capela is a monster at protecting the rim while bam isn’t, which is by far the most important part of center defense."
"He definitely has the physical talent to play in the league.  He's at least an average defender, and certainly not someone you hunt for matchups like Lou Williams."
"Okay, I can get the McHale bias with Bird. And, I get Charles and MJ don't get along anymore. But, if you have the 3rd pick in the all-time NBA draft you are going iverson? Honestly, loved AI as a kid, but if you are building an all-time team among 7 people (so you are theoretically taking the top 70 players of all-time). I'm valuing Iverson as the ideal 6th man/spark plug player who you use like Vinnie Johnson or Lou Williams."
Lou Williams too
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"2012 he was elite in the playoffs until a poor finals, as a bench player you can’t really blame him too much when he was your 2nd best player in a few matchups.  2013 he averaged 26/7/5 on 55% TS, underperformed but he was the 8th seed against the 1st seed lol, not a huge deal  2014 was the same story he was a bit inefficient and I guess it’s fair to blame him here  2015 lmao you’re brushing off an entire fucking playoff run because Josh smith and Corey Brewer made a couple threes? He was elite in the dallas series, elite in the Clippers series, check out his game 7 and overall series stats, one bad game doesnt mean anything. Against golden state he was bad in the last game but the series was already long lost lmao.  I know you didn’t even watch but go back and look at games 1 and 2 at Oracle. Harden is doing everything hitting big shot after big shot with 30 pt triple doubles and we lose by a possession each game. He had no help; already down 2 starters with Jason Terry on steph curry.  He was good in that series overall and only had 2 bad games, he also had a 45 point game to give us our only win.  In 2016 his stats went down a bit but is that not expected when the 8th seeded team you dragged into the playoffs gets to face the 73-9 warriors? Curry or not, there defense was elite and harden again had no help. Michael beasley is his best player this series.  2017 he was great in round 1 putting up 33/7/7 on andre roberson the best wing defender in the league on 60% TS.  Round 2 yes this is an actual choke. Game 6 we should have won and there was no excuse. However harden was still elite for the other 5 games and that shouldn’t be discounted. Lou Williams was absurdly bad this series and harden hadn’t figured out the floater game yet, Spurs iced him on every pick and roll. Also, he had a concussion.  2018 Jesus Christ you can’t possibly blame him losing to 4 allstars as the only one? Paul went down after 3-2, and even then harden put up big games 6 and 7. He had us in the game in 7 until this happened https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU  2019 35/7 on 60% TS on golden state outplayed steph and kd  2020 harden put up 30/8 on 60% TS with no westbrook while guarded by dort, best wing defender in the league and clinched it with a game 7 game winning block. Round 2 westbrook puts up 15/4 on 40% TS and is left open every play while harden averaged 30/8 on 65% TS while being full on trapped all game. How are you this blind lol?  2021 he puts up 29/8/10 on 76% TS against Boston and his hamstring is destroyed. Yet he still goes out and plays for them and he’s still mockded  Stupid ass post"
Lou Williams keeps coming to my mind. Against college defenders he would get his shot every possession and his defense wouldn't even get taken advantage of. That's prolly my best guess.
"JR Smith is the king of dumbass contested 3 point swishes. I love Peja but I think JR is the king of this.  Also Lou Williams with the 2 for 1, or as was known in Philly, the Lou-for-1."
"Lou williams and Trae young were exploited when they were on the court against the Sixers starters. The problem was, OP is misremembering and Lou was cooking against the bench. He cooled off once the starters came back but the damage was done."
Sixers.   Still blows my mind the 76ers couldn’t take advantage of Trae and Lou Williams defensive liabilities
"The '1' part is the hard part- easy to get 0-82! Need at least 1 or 2 dudes that can get crazy hot but will let you down most of the time. No good team players- want some jerks who are gonna get there own shot but not build chemistry, and then someone who screws you on defending corner 3s most games because he can't get out there in time:  JR Smith, Lou Williams, Nick Young, Gilbert Arenas, Alex Len"
I think you would want someone that can create offense for themselves or others. 6th men types  So my best guess is current Lou Williams or Derrick Rose
"Give me Jeremy Lin, JJ Barea, DJ Augustin, Lou Williams and Wayne Ellington"
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
Literally every player except Gallo and Lou Williams. It's nice being young and good
"I'm glad you pointed that out, I definitely confused those two trades haha. But I do agree that trading Lou Williams wasn't a tanking move. I just remember everyone talking about the trade as if it was. I remember thinking that Lou Williams was a decent scorer but he was nowhere near the deciding factor for winning basketball especially on a team filled with young players who were still developing."
"Lou Williams wasn't traded for the pick that became Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma was part of the Mozgov/D'Lo trade with Brooklyn. Lou Williams was traded for a pick that was then traded to Utah for the picks that were used on Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant.  Trading Lou Williams was also not a ""tanking"" move. It did make the Lakers worse in the short term, but Lou Williams was much older than the rest of the young core, and was seen at the time as someone they should probably try to get something for before he went downhill with age. Ironically he went on to play probably the best ball of his career after that in his early 30s, but that was unexpected.   That trade was about getting a 1st round pick for Lou while he still had time left on his contract rather than thinking the Lakers were too good with him (they were horribly bad either way). When the Lakers traded Lou they were 19-39 and [had just been trashed by an awful Suns team, losing by 36 points.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702150PHO.html) At the rate the Lakers were winning with Lou (32% of the time), that put them on a 26 win pace with him. Without him they finished the season with 26 wins, meaning they were no worse without him.   The Lou Williams trade was not done by Mitch and Jim, as they'd just been fired, but rather was the first move from Magic and Pelinka, as they began the process of trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole Mitch and Jim had put the team in. The Lakers were awful and capped out when Mitch and Jim were fired. 18 months later they were a 35 win team with two max cap slots. The Lakers were just really awful under Mitch and Jim, even though they were trying to be good."
"I agree with you that Deng and Mozgov being benched were definitely for the better when considering how bad they were for us. I will say though that trading Lou Williams was definitely seen at the time as a move to help us tank, even by our own fanbase. Look back at our own threads when we traded him, everyone pretty much agreed that it was better for our pick. Although it's not like Lou Williams was moving the needle towards winning basketball for us anyway. I think it comes down to personal opinion considering there were other benefits to the Lou Will trade especially since we got a pick from it that turned into Kyle Kuzma."
mitchell is also 22 while cam is 19. Cam's scoring arsenal for his age is super advanced. I could see him definitely having a lou williams/cj mccollum type career. Maybe not as good as CJ but i think he will be able to score at the next level.
"A few Laker related ones people always get wrong :  Mike Bibby was not called for a foul when elbowed by Kobe, Doug Christie was.  Kobe in 2001 playoffs did not only go off because he was the 2nd option and “every one triple teamed Shaq”. In fact, the Lakers were significantly better with Kobe and no Shaq than the opposite.  Similarly, AD didn’t have an insane playoff run in 2020 because “he was spoonfed by LeBron”. In fact his scoring volume and efficiency were higher when Bron was on the bench. And the Lakers were good with AD even without LeBron.  It’s often mentioned in hypothetical posts about “what if the Lakers had kept their young core” that we could not have had D-Lo and Kuz because we traded D-Lo for the 27th pick. That’s technically true but we had the 28th pick from the Lou Williams - Corey Brewer trade and Kuz wasn’t on the Nets radar so we could have kept D-Lo and almost certainly still picked Kuz at 28. He couldn’t however trade the 28th for the picks that ended up being Hart and Thomas Bryant.  My biggest one : Magic wasn’t bad as POBO. He signed LeBron, kept a max slot for that summer and when that didn’t work he turned around and filled the roster with vets while maintaing cap flexibility for the next summer. There weren’t many shooters available so he focused on a unique “zag while everyone zigs” approach built on stacking playmakers and it was actually working. Lakers were a top-4 seed through the first 34 games, which historically has a 97% chance of leading to a playoff qualification. Our draft picks under Magic were very good. Lonzo was a no-brainer. Kuz, Hart and Thomas Bryant all picked after 27. Caruso signed to the Summer League team then upgraded to two-way. Then he threw everything he had at the AD trade but Demps seemingly just refused anything. Even the maligned Zubac - Muscala trade was about clearing Zu’s cap hold to keep maximum space for the 2019 offseason. Magic’s main fault was that he left right after we’d missed the playoffs because of a gazillion injuries and before the cap space he cleared and assets he gathered could used to upgrade into a contender. I like Rob Pelinka but his moves that offseason were largely just the logical continuation of what Magic had started."
Yes god forbid they lose to the Lou Williams led Clippers without KD
"Shoutout to ""Lemon Pepper"" appearing on Lou Williams' Basketball Reference page"
"I don’t think we’re contenders. But anything short of another ECF appearance should not put our run in question. We had the second best record in the league once McMillan took over. We dealt with injuries all regular season, and had one relatively healthy series vs NY (still missing Reddish) and we see how that went. Beat Philly without Hunter. You can keep saying Philly beat themselves but it was Lou Williams and Trae Young who took over and practically didn’t miss down the stretch. We created our own momentum. The team believed in themselves no matter the odds.  Now the East is stronger. We could very well end up a first round exit to a good team. That would be frustrating, considering the internet would label us a “fluke” but our window isn’t now and outside of Bogi and Capela our main group is 23 and under. I think we’re the only playoff team that can say that, so if we play the cards right and choose the right young players to keep, we have a good amount of time. If we fall short, I’d chalk it up to the East getting better. We didn’t make many changes: this group fell short to the eventual champions and we had injuries to Hunter Trae and Reddish, so it only makes sense to gift them one season to run it back and see what’s really there. Maybe what’s there got surpassed by other teams this off season, or maybe we’re good enough to go the distance. We’ll see.  Unless we get swept handily in the first round, I don’t think the Fluke card is on the table."
"&gt;If they have a weakness, it's the inability of the backcourt to get stops, primarily players like Trae Young and Lou Williams.  &gt;Playoff teams will probably always work to get Young or Williams on a switch before attacking, so exploring a trade for a big, defensive-minded guard (a la Marcus Smart) would do a lot for this roster.   Lmao this is actually so fucking dumb I cant believe these ppl get paid to write.   1. Trae and Lou will never play together (and actually they did IN THE PLAYOFFS and teams couldnt take advantage)   2. Yeah just go for the switch right? Tell that to the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks who did that maybe a grand total of 3 times. It's so easy and such a good strategy right?   3. Trading for Marcus Smart as if we don't already got ppl to cover for Trae smfh. That's the entire point of our roster construction"
"Pat Bev played with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell for years and didn't seem to improve their defensive chops any. Beverley needs to just focus on trying to stay healthy this year, otherwise this might be his last year in the NBA."
depends on the team imo and level of the player..Bradley beal being the scorer guy will be more valuable than prolly a guy like ben wallace / rodman  but for a starter calibre guy the defender might be more valuable...smart/thybulle vs lou williams/clarkson i am picking smart /thybulle
"Middleton has been an all star twice. Seth partnow who does one of the deepest analytics dives on the top 100 players has him as a top 20 player and jrue as a top 25 player. Just for reference middleton is on the same tier as kyrie and Tatum and jrue is on the same tier as booker Zion and Trae in his rankings.   Hawks had an injured bogdanovic, didn’t have Deandre hunter. They were literally relying on Lou Williams for their primary creation.   That bucks team was a lot better than the hawks with both teams down their stars. You’re just a blind homer if you disagree"
"I'm not going to yuck your yum, but it was pretty clear we wouldn't have been #1 if Brooklyn had stayed healthy and while I agree on the ""championship or bust"" thing we lost in the second round...again...to a team that was in their first playoff run and was able to beat us with Lou Williams and Trey Young on the floor at the same time.   It was another embarrassing end to another season."
Ok but it's Lou Williams
"I never read anything actually bad about Rondo in the locker room, but I didn't read anything positive either once the season started. Unlike as you say Lou Williams whom immediately everybody starting gushing about as a mentor. Rondo's attitude never seemed actively shitty or anything but I don't think ""veteran presence for the young guys"" is a reason to have him on your roster."
"For sure, I'm just going off the top of my head and players from my lifetime.   Kandi man as in Michael Olowakandi? Come on man😂 I remember people being in disbelief at how high the Clippers selected him. I definitely don't think he was a more valuable player or contributor than Beverly.   Kaman I think made one all-star team and was a Clipper for a while so I think you could include him. Lou Williams as well."
I think Saben Lee could be like a more athletic Lou Williams. Maybe not a super star. But I think he could be a 6MOTY candidate for a long time
"Theo Maledon and Jared Butler have professional scorer/sixth man of the year potential, Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams type guy. Michael Porter Jr. is a future MVP in the league"
I thought he’d be the next Melo and that his floor was going to be like the Forward version of Lou Williams. Never thought things would go like this.
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
"Crazier yet, there are only 2 players left from 2005.  CP3 and Lou Williams."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Lou Williams
"&gt; He's looking like what Fultz should've been.  No…not at all. I swear this sub just puts together the most random basketball statements and then think that people are going to agree with them. Fultz was billed as a three level scorer with draft comparisons of Harden/DLO. Maxey was billed as a future 6 man similar to Lou Williams. Fultz is 6ft 5 with a 6’ 10” wingspan and great court vision. Fultz shot 41% from 3 in college, Maxey shot 29%. Fultz had twice as many assists/game as Maxey and was more efficient with 9 more ppg on similar minutes.   You’re either misremembering what Fultz was billed as or you’re overestimating what Maxey can do. I watched at least 15 of his college games and a solid half dozen of Maxey’s and they are two completely different players outside of their ability to get to the rim."
Dennis is getting paid 900k more than Lou Williams. Even if he flames out it's worth it because the Celtics 2nd unit is basically the Maine Red Claws.
"Yep.  Jamal Crawford got it over him shooting 40.4% from the field and 34% from 3 for a whopping 14.2 ppg, 1.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists and a -1.4 on/off.  Crawford wasn't even top 5 bench players that year.  Lou Williams did almost the exact same thing but slightly better in every way.  Ridiculous."
Dude fuckin flat out scores. He can give you the same thing Lou Williams is doing at this point. Sure that’s not highly valued but it deserves a spot on a team
Curry is a plus defender. Wiggins is a plus defender. Draymond is a top 5 defender. We can slot Luke Garza and Lou Williams in those last two spots and we still wouldn’t be the worst defense in the league.
"who was the 2nd best player on the lakers those years?Nick young, young randle and d'angelo, lou williams, fucking robert scare? if you're not making the playoffs, fuck it try to get the most points til you retire."
"I can't imagine that's still a thing. They earn so much more now, they are way better advised and I would imagine they are a little bit more privat nowadays since the glaring eye of social media (not falling to every gold digger around etc). Also it's really hard to reach that point without being super disciplined these days.  Guys like Lou Williams and James Harden kind of relevate the last two points, but I hope you see where I'm coming from.  I heard that fun fact in the 2000s the first time when guys like Toine and AI went broke, so I guess the actual source for it is kind of old."
"Isaiah Thomas is a bad locker room guy unlike Lou  He kinda hurt his rep coming into Cleveland, coming back 70% then publically critiquing the teams  and coaching while playing some of the worst defense in the league with the Cavs slumping. Then the whole D Wade / IT vs K Love thing  Also Lou Williams really never was in a position to command a massive contract like IT. If IT was on a $8 mil deal or something, he would still be in the league"
"Is this guy not good enough for a minimum contract in the NBA?  &amp;#x200B;  I don't get it. He looks fit and healthy, and I thought health was the only thing stopping him from being an NBA player.  &amp;#x200B;  I thought there was still a spot in the league for offensive spark plugs off the bench, even with suspect defense. I mean... Lou Williams still has a job."
"Well we do in reality, Delon Wright is a bigger, more physical guard who will presumably be the backup and Lou Williams is, well, Lou Williams.  Cooper likely won’t play much barring injury."
How much do u honestly think he’s worth inconsistent guards usually aren’t paid very well I always felt like Lou Williams was underpaid and I’d certainly take Lou Williams over him any day of the week. I don’t even think he was worth anything close to the 84million they offered him.
"Imo an empty stats player is basically just someone who puts up good looking stats, but makes up for it by either being super inefficient, or by being a turnstile on defense. I think Lou Williams would fit the bill if he was a starter and got more minutes. I think his role as a bench scorer allows his scoring to outweigh his issues on D.  The obvious choice for this question is Andre Drummond, but since you said no centers, I'm having a difficult time coming up with a good example off the top of my head. Guys no longer in the league who fit the description are Monta Ellis, Jamaal Crawford, etc."
Usually any dude who scores over 10ppg but utterly refuses to play defense.  Like Jeremy Lamb or Oubre types.   Maybe even someone like Lou Williams
I remember when I thought Carsen Edwards was gonna be a Lou Williams-esque sixth man after his first year in summer league…
"Seriously, 34yo Lou Williams signed for 5m iirc."
"Yeah, the Sixers sure punished the Hawks lol, even Trae and Lou Williams were getting minutes together"
Great to see. His floor rn is Lou Williams which is amazing already. Lou averaged 12.8ppg when he was 22. That’s something IQ could easily do
"They're the underdog team in their own city but are not wholesome enough to vibe with it. Lou Williams was culture changing when he was there. Paul George honestly is kinda empathetic he might change it. But with Chris Paul and those guys the chippyness wasn't a champion level style. It was like warning track power. Angry enough to whoop ass and get there, but not resilient enough to climb over the challenge when the board tipped against them.  Doesn't help that Balmer doesn't know what humble pie is. more like do coke and go for the thighs."
Do you think a relatively successful outcome for someone like that would be a bench guard kind of role? With the very best possible outcome being continued development and ending up in a Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson kind of role?
IT doesn't want to be Lou Williams.  He still fancies himself an All-Star and that's a big part of the problem.  If he'd be totally cool with a 10 minutes a game backup PG role and a commensurate borderline vet min contract then he could be a great veteran bench guy for most teams in this league.  But he needs to be totally happy with that and accept playing within his role.
"I mean, Gilbert Arenas just took a steamy shat on the Raptors a few days ago lol. And Lou Williams last year, Kawhi's family during free agency, etc. It's definitely not something that's long in the past."
&gt;none of his teammates deserve blame.  Clint Capela: 3-11  Eric Gordon: 2-9  Ryan Anderson: 0-6  Lou Williams: 3-7  Sam Dekker: 2-6
Lou Williams   I’m legit surprised he never got a fat contract his entire career
Dollar store Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford
Player comps for the last 2 years:  Jason Kidd = Rondo Shawn Marion = Iggy Tyson Chandler = Montrez Harrell Jason Terry = Lou Williams
"I'd say Melo is currently similar to Kidd in that they're an older respected, former all-star, but not nearly as good of a player as he once was. Completely different positions but similar in situation.  Terry is lou Williams? Just a respected team player who can get hot and score in bunches?"
"When LeBron and AD were out the Lakers were a below average team. When LeBron got hurt the Lakers were 28-13, and they then proceeded to go 9-17 over the next few weeks. He could probably be a starter for a bad team, so I guess if some bad team has nobody else then he could start for you at point guard, but he's never going to be the answer as a starting PG for a good team.   The reason he's more suited for a bench role is because he's got too many holes in his game. There's some things he does well, but there's things he does poorly too. He's more in the vein of a Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford kind of player, who is just better suited to playing with a good second unit than being a weak link with a good starting 5. He'd be one of the better backup PGs in the league, but would be one of the worst starting PGs. So if you're an NBA team you need to ask yourself which role you'd rather have him fill."

"Seeing CP3 and Lowry balling out at their age gives me hope. Maybe a better comp is Lou Williams coz he's skinny like PM. Whatever, I think he'll be there.  Also wouldn't surprise me at all if he just retires and does humanitarian stuff in Aus after his next contract. He's just that type of dude."
Lou Williams is named after a flavor of wing from MAgic City because of how much he stripped there
"Embidd was the obvious pick, he was thought of as possible number 1 pick if not for his injury.    Simmons was consensus 1st  pick.  Tatum neither him or colangelo drafted, so don’t know how Hinkie gets credit for it.    Noel, was an ok pick,McCollum, giannis and gobert were all in this draft, though. So it’s not like he hit a home run.   One thing I noticed is they got hosed in the Bynum trade. They trade iggy and vuc and a 1st round pick for Bynum, Jason Richardson.  They had a promising team with vuc, Thad, iggy, jrue, Lou Williams. And completely screwed it up."
Lou williams leaves the bubble in Orlando to pick up wings at a strip club in Atlanta and people just think it's hilarious.
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
"This is the right answer. Where is it fun to be young, wealthy, and famous. Lou Williams didn't want to go to Atlanta then, likely, discovered the strip club scene and was like ""this could work out...""  It ain't Iowa..."
"I said in another comment, he is the successor to Lou Williams as an elite 6th man and could easily win that award like every year going forward if he wants to. But he wants to be more than that."
"[Just take a few minutes to watch his iso package.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k8Xgs1xUNo) He has a ton of tools, and a good ability to get to the rim, he's strong for his size.  If he can build a long ball he could be knocking on the door of an all-star status or lou williams peak in a few years. Big if but plenty of kids his age develop a shot if they work at it."
They should have traded CJ a long time ago. He's good but more in a Lou Williams role on a championship team. You can't start Dame and CJ and expect to compete for a title in a guard heavy league. They're both defensive liabilities and one if not both will be exploited by really good teams.
"No one (nor advanced stats) hates on the offensive skills he possesses. People hate on his defense, and his inability to develop a 3 point shot in a league metagame that necessitates spacing from 4-5 of the starters.  Its not that DeRozan is bad at basketball, it has just been hard to fit him into a modern offense (his newfound playmaking skills make it easier now), and its hard to be a Championship contender when your Forward is a liability on defense.  You can get away with worse defensive guards as a solid defensive center can often compensate... but when you have a guy at SF/PF who can't defend the perimeter/interior, on-ball/off-ball, and gets destroyed in pick-and-roll? That is very hard to win playoff games against the elite teams.  He has always been an ELITE mid-range scorer, and an upper-echelon finisher at the rim, and now he has even developed playmaking skills (a skill that I think actually allows him to finally fit into a modern offense), but his defense is still something that he needs to get figured out in these later years of his career if he wants to get a ring as a starter. Otherwise, he might see these last years in the league as a 6th man of the year bench spark plug like Lou Williams/Jamal Crawford but at Forward."

I’m just saying ish Smith can get you 12 assists every night and 2013 kawhi can give your best player nightmares is that combined a good player or a 6th man like a Lou Williams
That exactly what Lou Williams said to Trae before his winning shot in game 1 against y’all. It was something like “All I told him was don’t pass it”
Isn't Lou Williams still a good player to have on the bench? I would think a young team would want him to guide the young players
Idk if people have watched THJ on the Mavs much but he is like Lou Williams pretty much. He can take a team that needs a boost and will them to victory by scoring spurts.   He is a better player per value compared to Fournier. But they are not far off. Mavs got a deal with THJ turning down 14 mil extra from the pels

If we somehow land danny green or Lou Williams… this team will be really fun to watch
"I disagree. I think that Melo has a unique ability to create offense out of nothing and change the momentum of a game. Even if he’s not hugely efficient over long stretches, he makes timely shots and always demands defensive attention. It’s really a failure of analytics that stats don’t measure the full impact of high-volume, low-efficiency scorers like Melo, Lou Williams, Russ, and even younger guys like Donovan Mitchell and Anthony Edwards.  Also I guarantee Melo was not a net negative either for attendance or for the locker room."
"Unpopular opinion here, but I've always felt like Derozans skillset has been suited for a Lou Williams type of role, as someone who doesn't start but comes off the bench for a burst of offense and closes in an offensive situation"
"Streaky scorer, sort of a poor man's Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams.  He might get you 25 one night and 6 the next. Not a bad heat check coming off the bench."
"Who specifically though? Like I said, Lou Williams and some second round picks is very, very little. You shouldn't expect much for that, even a contributing bench player."
I see him as a 6th man tbh. Maybe his ceiling is Lou Williams lite.
"He helps them a lot in the sense that he's way better than Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson and kinda combines their skill set into 1 player.  But he still doesn't solve their play-making issues, Hill is a shooting guard in a point guard's body."
John Collins to Minnesota for something centered around Malik Beasely and Jaden Mcdaniels  Harrison Barnes to Boston for Romeo Langford and a first  George Hill to the Clippers for Lou Williams and Detroit seconds
"OKC has a vested interest in making sure the Clippers stay mediocre so I can't see them trading Hill to them. Also what assets do they have to trade for Hill? Lou Williams makes sense salary-match wise but he straight up said he'd retire if he got moved.  I think the Clippers need a playmaker but they have to lower their expectations. I don't even think they can get Ricky Rubio now. As much as I hate to say, two potentially obtainable playmaking upgrades are *gag* Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe."
"&gt;Need these losses so the front office doesn’t get complacent and makes some moves.   What moves are you expecting them to make? They don't have anything other teams would want. Lou Williams would just retire if he was traded, the Clippers don't have any 1st round picks they can trade, and everyone else is either wildly overpaid or is someone the Clippers wouldn't trade. So what's the move you're waiting on?"
Lou Williams is such an odd one on this Clippers roster. He’s actually likeable.
"Guy who has never averaged even 2 assist has ""euro level passing ability""? Is that a pasta? Lou Williams is also a secret euro level passer."
"Paul George, Harrell and Lou Williams last year"
"I always saw Coby as more of a Lou Williams 6th man scorer then a Facilitating Starting PG, I think this move will work out better for him"
"He’s not there as a leader yet overall. He needs to mature. People tend to forget he could still be in college. But making his teammates better? And you name Collins? Nearly every one of John’s buckets the past two seasons have been a by product of a pick n roll with Trae or a spot up 3 off his pass. They’ve made each other much better. Trae is a willing passer and leads the league in hockey assists this season. He gets his teammates open shots, it’s up to them to hit it.   Capela’s whole offensive game is predicated off putbacks and lobs so idk what you mean, he gets plenty. If anything he hurts the offense because he can’t space the floor.   That whole Collins film session debacle was greatly exaggerated, as Collins himself was confused when the article dropped. He and Trae have been like peas in a pod since entering the league, it doesn’t mean they’ll have disagreements.  Lou Williams is a solid passer but he didn’t make his mark in this league for passing the ball. Trae is better in that area and you can’t just use his usage against him. Plenty of teams have high usage guys and he beats all but harden and Westbrook in assists.  I don’t think Trae is a championship level 1a as of now either and i wouldn’t be surprised if he never gets there but this talk of him being Lou Williams with a high usage rate is absolutely absurd. He’s not Luka but he’s plenty good in his own right, more than equipped to run an offense for a playoff team. If he suddenly became available on the market every GM would take him over Murray"
Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford wish they could pass the ball like Trae. Just say you don’t actually watch him. Dude has led the eastern conference in assists since he entered the league and all you think he is a bench scorer?
"For Trae Young to contribute to a championship team, he would need to play a Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford 6th man role because ultimately that is his skillset. I'll take my downvotes gladly until that day comes. This isn't a Lavine, Booker, or Beal situation where they are below average defenders but great offensive players. They still all have the size and strength to compete at their position. Trae will get eaten alive in the playoffs when teams gameplan to target him."
Lou Williams is blamed for everything lately. We have a lot of fans that think Luke Kennard is a good player
Lou Williams
"So teams should value Lou Williams and EG defense comparably because EG gets away with being physical?  Not sure I follow.  Maybe if Lou were physical he'd get away with it, too."
The Clippers not having that many good defenders after Kawhi/PG/Bev is part of the issue yes.   The Morris at the 5 132 defensive rating lineups dont have that rating because of guys like Reggie Jackson. And theyve been terrible defensively in the sample we have(small) regardless of who the guards are even when its Beverley/Batum/PG/Kawhi/Mook. One shitty guard isnt going to make that kind of defensive rating good suddenly.  Also Ill believe Ty Lue wont play Lou Williams in the playoffs when I actually see it. Established veterans getting more time than they should in the playoffs is a tradition as old as any. And regardless their defensive rating has been about identical this year with or without Lou Will
"I mean defensive slips might have more to do with Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams and kennard in the rotation and sometimes two of those three will be on the court at a time."
Taller Lou williams
"Bradley Beal always seems to get a pass; he's been one of the worst defensive players on the Wizards, and the wizards have been one of the worst defensive teams in the league. Most metrics would throw him in the same bucket defensively as D'Lo, Trae, Lou Williams, and Colin Sexton.   RPM has him 117th of 118 shooting guards defensively. RAPTOR has him 75th of 90 shooting guards (using the default 514 minutes played filter)."
KD couldn't even hold Lou Williams nuts on defense. PG is the better defender
"Yeah but Gobert is going to be the one people remember for years. Nobody’s going to remember Harden or Lou Williams’ lemon pepper wings, and both of those were well after anybody could be excused for not knowing how serious it was"
"Or lou Williams, not Joe Johnson, don't want to segregate based on skin color, however it's easy to do so. Michael Finley but no.  Maybe Paul pierce"
Herro is not worth it. Not by a long shot. You don’t trade an all-star you control for Lou Williams 2.0
"This is so true. You can see in real time too exactly what Draymond was going for, and it’s not terribly hard to argue that he had the right idea. He even had the cutter wide open in Looney (no way in hell Lou Williams was going to stop that). He just flubbed the pass badly. If anything KD not running the floor made that pass way harder than it needed to be."
&gt; I don’t think they can go another playoffs with Lou Williams. He’s a terrible playoff player.   Lol Simmons is definitely hanging out on this sub
"I really don't get the Tyler Herro projections of him potentially being an all-nba guy (which Booker is close to now)  I think his ceiling is more like a Lou Williams-type player.. a great 4th option, butttt probably shouldn't be higher than that. He's not a good enough shooter/shot-creator/passer to be a first or second option in most starting lineups."
"&gt; Who is making somebody else better on that team?  Paul George, Lou Williams, and Nic Batum mainly. Kawhi's gotten better at it too but he does go through stagnant stretches.  We had our worst stretch of the season right before the all-star break, but for most of this season our offense has looked fine. It's our defense that's been a more consistent issue. But I guess Simmons would rather talk about coffee"
the lakers do it all the time when they target reggie jackson and lou williams
Clippers can pound sand we don't want luke Kanard or Lou Williams or Patrick Beverly or 2nd round pics
"Loy Vaught, Darius Miles, Keith Closs and Lou Williams."
Lou Williams
"Aww. Analytics guy can’t figure out why the numbers  don’t give him an answer lol    I kid, but it’s simple he’s undersized. Not only in height but he’s rail thin. So he can’t finish. You can have all the hops in the world but even in today’s modern game that’s smaller you’re not gonna just get to the cup uncontested.  Then you factor in mid range: 1) not all players have this skill set. Not everyone can shoot a floater, for example. Some of these young kids grew up never taking m mid range shots, 2) Basically role players aren’t even allowed to take mid range shots anyway. So the end result is why 5 of his 7 shots per game are threes.   Plus, he isn’t a playmaker at all , and I’d imagine he can’t defend bc of his size, so not much reason for him to be on the court  other than a catch and shoot guy.   If he gets stronger his best case is Lou Williams, or perhaps more reasonable, Malik Monk."
Skip to My Lou maybe after them. Or Cory Joseph.   Whoops forgot Alvin Williams.
"I don't really have a problem with the Clipper fans I see on here, for the most part they're pretty cool. We don't like each other's teams, which is fine and to be expected, but they don't generally seem like huge assholes or anything. But it is really strange to me how much the Clippers themselves are always talking about the Lakers. I can't think of any other team that spends this much time specifically talking about another team, except when they're in a playoff series with them.   Ballmer in particular seems focused on the Lakers and their fans to an almost unhealthy degree. Not only did he put up all those billboards around LA targeting Laker fans, but he seems to talk about them in every interview. He just gave some long quote about them at the groundbreaking for his new arena last week, and now here he is again. And of course Doc Rivers used to talk about the Lakers a lot, as did Pat Beverley, Lou Williams and Paul George.   Rivalry between fans is fine, it's to be expected. But it's just frankly a little weird how much the Clippers seem focused on the Lakers. Maybe Ballmer feels like he'd prefer Laker fans are talking poorly about the Clippers than just not talking about them at all? I don't know what his deal is. Are there other sports owners that bring up some other team as much as Ballmer does with the Lakers? Do Clipper fans like how much Ballmer and the Clippers talk about the Lakers and their fans?"
"At the start of the 2nd and 4th quarters, when you're up by 16, Avery Bradley is perfect player to come in and guard Rajon Rondo, or Lou Williams or even D.J. Augustin for 8-12 quality minutes."
"The warriors. I hated the warriors back when they sucked and I’ve always felt that our games have been some kind of memorable highs for both sides. (Be it Steph crossing cp3 and going off, or Lou Williams leading the 31 point comeback in the playoffs )."
Never had to play a team as bad as the pacers? He had steph Klay and Dray and got taken to 6 by Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams lmao
"&gt; Using Lou Williams career average? He was averaging 12 points a game with LAC. And was traded as salary filler.  That was his 19-20 numbers...you know...the year before he got traded to the Hawks.  &gt; Also not factoring in Minutes played either. Lol.  When comparing Kemba to what he could do in the playoffs to what he did in the playoffs, minutes doesn't matter. He's an ironman who will play through injuries. Just because he gives you 40min doesn't mean it was healthy Kemba Walker giving you that.  &gt; Yeah you really know what you’re talking about /s  Well this was an ok argument until insults started getting thrown around for no reason. Have a good one."
Using Lou Williams career average? He was averaging 12 points a game with LAC. And was traded as salary filler.  Also not factoring in Minutes played either. Lol.  Yeah you really know what you’re talking about /s
"&gt; Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?  That was an exaggeration, but at least 4 of them played equivalent or better in years without Trae. And the rest of the have never played without Trae, so there's no way of knowing.  1. Gallinari: 18ppg in OKC then 13 ppg in ATL  2. Lou Williams: 18ppg in LAC then 10ppg in ATL  3. Bogdan Bogdanovic: 15ppg in SAC then 16ppg in ATL  4. Clint Capela: 16ppg in HOU then 15ppg in ATL  &gt; Hayward played 4/6 games  He averaged 10ppg and wasn't around for the rest of the playoffs to get to that point. Hardly, anything helpful to the team.   &gt; So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.  Wtf?!?!? That's a reach on what I was saying. I said the best players were injured and Kemba was certainly injured and his per 36 numbers certainly show that. Doesn't matter how man minutes he played.  &gt; Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours  Lol wtf does this even mean?"
"Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?   And Hayward played 4/6 games in the ECF, the same that Trae did.   And Kemba played every game in the playoffs that year. Averaged 40 MPG and 17-4-6 against the Raptors and 36 MPG against the Heat with 20-4-5.  So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.   Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours"
"Agreed, Trae is the Hawk’s offense, asking Lou Williams to be your starting PG is not going to end well."
"&gt;	Five years later, when Paul forced his way to Houston, Morey merely surrendered Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley and a future first-round pick.  the author should learn what a free agent is"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
KD warriors got taken to 6 by Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams    Dang it’s almost like it doesn’t mean Jack shit
Lou Williams.
How much did Lou Williams average?
"Calling him an average playmaker and average defender is a bit.  He is basically the same level of playmaker as a Kent Bazemore type, and statistically he is the worst defender on the Warriors.   Despite being on a good defensive team he has a -3.0 DRaptor (Lou Williams, DeMar DeRozan, DLo Russell territory), a -1.4 DBPM (same as CJ McCullom, Joe Harris).  He is a promising young player with potential to improve, but he isn’t average at playmaking or defence yet"
"&gt;How did the lakers suck  Did you look? The 2018-2019 Lakers were 37-45. Kawhi and AD moved in the same offseason.  &gt;which stars joined Kobe other thean Shaq and Pau  What a weird way to communicate. Instead of this silly exercise, let's list the stars that have joined the LA Lakers over the last 20 years.  * Russell Westbrook * Dwight Howard * Anthony Davis * Rajon Rondo * Karl Malone * Gary Payton * Caron Butler * Pau Gasol * Shaquille O'neal * Ron Artest * Steve Nash * Roy Hibbert * Lou Williams  I'm sure I missed some I'm just tired of doing this."
PG: De'aaron Fox SG: Bradley Beal SF: Lebron PF: Siakam  C: Giannis  Jordan Clarkson Lou Williams Joe Ingles DeAndre Jordan Blake Griffin Buddy Hield Thybulle
Fitzpatrick is Lou Williams
"He averaged those 20 point with 40 minutes played a night and on a *scorching* true shooting percentage of .485. And playing forward at 6’7” and a whopping 195, he couldn’t play defense against anyone, not that he ever tried. He was decent at jumping passing lanes, that’s about it.  At his best, he was J.R. Smith with no charm, Lou Williams with no lemon pepper, or skinny, washed Antoine Walker, take your pick."
"No, but they could have used him instead of Lou Williams running a conference finals do or die offense at the age of 40"
"Trae is more important to the hawks than Giannis is to the bucks, especially when the hawks don’t have a healthy bogdanovic. Bucks had two all star level players who could handle and create some level of offense and another guy who could play as a defensive anchor in brook.   Without Trae the entire hawks offense collapses. Lou Williams had a miracle game but otherwise the hawks are toast without Trae. The bucks without Giannis are obviously much much worse but they have guys that can pick up some slack"
"Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams, and PJ Tucker fucking suck too      You act like his supporting cast was worse than LeBron’s 1st stint in Cleveland"
"*Bunch of All NBA defender players like Trae young, Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams."
"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cqb9x/lou_williams_first_shot_theory_proved/) is the closest I was able to find on it, this is possibly even the very thread that birthed it.  It's called the ""Lou Williams First Shot Theory"", and it's wild that it's a thing. Whether he makes or misses his first shot largely determines how he'll perform for the remainder of the game."
"I'm still astounded by the statistic with Lou Williams' FG % after making his first shot and Lou Williams' FG % after missing his first shot.  He's definitely a scorer, but definitely a streaky one."
"Nah, the NBA updated the rules once vaccines became more widely available. As long as players were fully vaccinated, they had more freedom than non-vaccinated players. If a player wasn’t vaccinated and was caught at a party, they would have been suspended regardless of whether or not they actually got COVID.   That’s what happened to Lou Williams when he left the bubble to go to a strip club. He didn’t catch COVID there, but the NBA suspended him when he got back to Orlando."
"Idk if kobe is a bad dude tho  he just tries hard to be MJ. That's his idol  seems like he's trying so hard to play this act as a tough guy, even lou williams said it. He's just playing the mamba mentality act to live up to his reputation.  &gt; ""I told him once, we had a conversation and I said, 'Yo, I'm on to you,'"" Williams said. ""He's like, 'What you mean?' I said, 'You want people to think you're a jerk. But you're one of the nicest guys in the world. That's how you want to be remembered when you're done playing, like you want everyone to think you was this hard-ass competitor and just a jerk to everybody.' But I said, 'That's not your nature, that's not your natural nature.' I said, 'You're forcing your mean on everybody else.'""   Of course this doesn't mean he still wasn't an asshole lol. But I guess that's how he wanted to be seen, and how he wanted to lead."
"Similar in undersized and high motor, but Harrell can score.  Faried was more garbage man (collecting boards and hustle plays), rather than instant offense off the bench.  The Harrell / Lou Williams PnR was a legit play for the Clippers."
"Lou Williams, just the way he acts so intentionally cool annoys me. For example that ""highlight"" where he let Ja Shoot that 3pter and was nodding as if Ja was his apprentice he had been training for years rather than an opponent and just contesting it like a normal basketball player. Combining that with the fact that all his clutch buckets are usually cancelled out with his lacklustre defence just frustrates me greatly"
lou williams
Pretty sure Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford belong here. 20+ point seasons with like 40% FG% and nothing else.
"He got the stars on the 2008 Celtics on the same page and led them on a great run. He had Thibs and Ty Lue on that bench too. Those guys didn’t hate Doc.  He had a really good run with the LAC too, those guys might not like him, but no one likes Blake or Paul. He got that Beverly, Harrell, Lou Williams team to overachieve as well.  Also clearly a bad in game coach no matter what assistants he had."
Jordan Clarkson is gonna be the next JR/Lou Williams dont @ me
"I'd say the fact that the 2000s also featured at least two other elite defensive big men in Kevin Garnett and Ben Wallace didn't help, plus the fact that the Spurs org doesn't really campaign for end of season awards.  The latter fact is why Manu Ginobili only has one 6MOY to his name, unlike Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams who have three each."
"I’d my mind does not fail me he scored 1 field goal in the second half of a game 7 and went 1-11.    It’s the worst game 7 performance by a star ever, got outscored by Jamychal green, Lou Williams, Trez Harrel, Pat Bev and Zubac. Disgraceful."
&gt;I remember a young Lou Williams in practice with tears in his eyes because A.I. was having his way every single day. I remember talking to Lou and I’m so proud of who he is because of that moment. It should be inspirational because he decided in that moment to become one of the greatest reserve players of all time.  such an odd compliment...
Lou williams
Lou Williams is a basketball player that had 2 girlfriends. It was a throwaway joke that he was shot posting on Reddit like the rest of us. Was never denying that you were a woman.
The 2019 team…lead by Lou Williams.
"It's not just that. Lou Williams is also well-known for his obsession with decorative pillows, that's how he got the nickname ""The Underground Throw."". He broke quarantine during the covid bubble last year to go to a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in Atlanta. He even designs some - his signature creation is a pillowcase with an overlapping yellow and black-speckled enclosure, known as Lou's Lemon Pepper Flaps.  So you can see why a pillow enthusiast with multiple girlfriends would lead people to think you're him."
"I love how everyone is properly identifying you as Lou Williams.   But yea the thing with Mike was… he really was like that. Guys like Pippen, Rodmen, Kukoc etc. all helped out but Mike really was that dude.   I don’t think people realize how hard it is to win 6 rings. A threepeat is so rare that even the KD Warriors didn’t pull it off, in spite of the injuries to the bulls they did it twice. Kobe and Shaq are both top 10 all time tier players and they did it once before getting worn down and game planned against hard."
Isn’t the bachelor literally a show about a guy who dates a dozen or more women over the span of a few months  Kinda sounds like Lou Williams to me
"I mean Lou Williams has/had 2 girlfriends who both knew about each other and were cool with it, does that count as bachelor drama?   Man could probably broker world peace"
The subreddit's demographics lead me to think this is a deflection and you are in fact Lou Williams.
&gt;my girlfriends  Is OP Lou Williams? Probably not.
"Lol, he took us to the playoffs with Lou Williams as our best player(coming off the bench).  We took two games off the *healthy* warriors in the playoffs, twice."
"I guess my view is different because I saw first hand us constantly go at Steph and get easy buckets. I still think his defensive stats are somewhat inflated due to his team but I do appreciate you backing up your statement with sources.   Maybe my opinion isn’t as negative towards him defensively now after seeing that he can hold his own, in a mismatch it’s a different story but it’s not like he’s Lou Williams out there. Thanks for the write up"

"Looking at either jamal crawford or lou williams. Tough race, wouldnt wanna decide. If i had to id choose jamal tho"
"Then either one of the two happens:  a) He won't be bought out because Toronto has no fucking reason to pay him 19M in order for him NOT to take a quality 10-15mpg role for them;  b) Somehow he gets bought out and go to the Nets because if he's playing for vet min, he's going for a ring instead of the Luka and Friends 2nd round exit.  Either way, we are stuck with running Luka to the ground AGAIN because God forbid we trade end of the bench guys for the highest need in the roster. ""OH THEY HAVE THE EVER ELUSIVE FUCKING POTENTIAL. THEY CAN BE AS GOOD AS A GUY PLAYING POINT IN A FINALS 2 YEARS AGO, EVEN!  Fuck this shit. Lou Williams is making 5M. ISH SMITH IS MAKING 4.5 BUT DRAGIC WILL MAKE 2.7M HERE BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE ARE THE LAKERS NOW.  We will fuck things up because we have a glaring, gigantic need, and an obvious solution, but we will fuck it up because ""Moses tho, 20 rbs bro"".  This franchise is fucking my day and we are still 1 month away of preseason."
"Charles Barkley would easily be considered as being better than Malone, if he'd shot 35% on the obscene amount of 3's he attempted  Ben Simmons - Shooting  Trae Young - Defense (Trae's doing well for himself, but the dude would be the frontrunner for both MVP and MIP, if he magically became an average defender)  Young Rondo - Shooting (he'd be seen in the same light as CP3)  Roy Hibbert - Shooting  Carmelo Anthony - Defense  Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and all the other microwave guards throughout NBA history - Defense  Blake Griffin, Amar'e and all the other athletic forwards that never became true superstars - Defense and/or Shooting"
"Dragic is a back up point guard dumb shit.    The pelicans are trying to make the playoffs.  Yeah Delon Wright is a rookie, Lou Williams is a rookie,  dieng is a rookie.  Celtics can trade Schroder and  Dunn  The rest you can look up yourself  You are a complete fucking tool"
"It's seems counter intuitive to buy out players that still have value in the league, but the way to look after veteran guys matters. It might end up like a Lou Williams type situation at the Hawks and he ends up being happy to stay, but if not, buy him out and let him join a contender. That is only going to help you sign vet guys in the future.  Also, if he gets picked up, the other team pays some of the money. If someone gets him for the vet min, you are talking about $2.4M dollars. Given the option between flushing $17M or $19M down the toilet, most would choose to only lose $17M."
What ring chasing vets did the Lakers have in 2020 ? It doesn’t really matter.  The ‘19 Warriors were running on fumes. They got taken to 6 by the Clippers led by Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell…  If they’d won that year and run it back they would have been even more beat up by the time the ‘20 playoffs rolled around.  Not to mention that the ‘20 Lakers are very well built to go up against those Warriors. They had a ton of size and athleticism which was always the Warriors weakness. Plus the only two superstars in the league who’ve consistently played above their normal level in the playoffs against Golden State.
"I hated him.   Hated every post every game asking for him to get more playing time. Dude is the worst defensive player I’ve ever seen, and we had Lou Williams for a year."

And you guys have Lou Williams too
"Lou Williams is probably up there. Guys has had a nuts career, but was never quite at that level. He stayed just below it for a looooong time though which is impressive."
Maybe if Lou Williams took half the day to get his shit together he wouldn’t turn the ball over all the time and  always take stupid fade to the left jumpers that never go in
Best sixth man not named Lou Williams - Ben Gordon.
I have a bridge to sell you  - Lou Williams probably
"He had that crazy run and everyone immediately jumped to thinking he was Devin Booker when it’s more likely he’s a more complete version of Lou Williams.  He’s still super young though so we really don’t know. If he turned into a 25ppg guy I wouldn’t be surprised. As a heat fan, I don’t expect it, though."
Defense doesn’t matter. The Hawks beat us with a Trae Young Lou Williams backcourt when Ben didn’t play offense
"Lou Williams was way better than Lamar ever was and I mean this with no disrespect, sweet Lou would've been an All-Star in the East at some point during that 6MOTY run."
"&gt; I always find it so weird to hear people say ""But he had prime Odom.""   Anyone saying that like he played with a star is being absurd. Odom never even made a single All Star team, though he did with 6MOTY once. This would be like saying Kawhi played with prime Lou Williams."
"&gt; Lou Williams has had a much, much better career than Caruso. He’s 34 now, of course a dropoff was coming lol. Remind me who averaged 23 a game as a sixth man on the Clips? I get PPG isn’t everything but Caruso topped out at uhh… 6 a game.  Cool. We were talking about who'd be better in the 2020 playoffs and Caruso provided elite defense, elite off-ball cutting/screening, pushed the pace in transition and just straight up helped the team.  Lou, as he literally has in every playoffs of his career except 2019, disappeared in the playoffs, shot an abysmal % from everywhere, was hunted defensively whenever he touched the hardwood, and provided nothing off-ball.   Every impact stat already had Caruso as the better player but this sub refused to admit it.  &gt; Lonzo is a bust. He’s not playing like a #2 pick, nor has he ever. He’s not bad but he’s extremely flawed at the same time.  Incorrect. People massively overrate the value of draft picks. Lonzo is an above average no2 pick.  &gt; Don’t ever remember Ingram getting called overrated. Everyone said he could be KD-lite if he got a bit less skinny and developed a bit more.  In his first 2 seasons in the league, the most upvoted comment about Ingram I've ever seen was ""challenge : explain to me the difference between Brandon Ingram and Travis Outlaw"". Every reply was along the lines of ""damn, I actually can't"" and other shit like that. You'd have gotten downvoted to hell and back for calling him a future All-Star, especially during his rookie year.  &gt; As for the other three, fully disagree with you on all counts. People thought Clarkson could be decent, which he is, people thought DLo would be better on another team with room to shine, which he was, and people thought Randle could improve if he lost his tunnel vision, which he did.  People called Clarkson an overrated inefficient chucker, definitely didn't say D-Lo would shine elsewhere, and Randle did lose his tunnel vision his last year in LA but nobody would accept it.  &gt; You’re proving me right with this comment  Ironic, you're proving me right. I guarantee you in 2 years if THT is a fringe All-Star, all we'll see on this sub is ""lmao Lakers fans and their victim complex. Everyone knew THT would be an All-Star if he cleaned up his jumper a bit""."

You’re proving me right with this comment. You have this “us against the world” mentality when in reality it’s just a victim complex. All of these players developed into pretty much the guys they were supposed to be, besides Lonzo who’s actually worse than expected. I feel like you tried to dunk on me with this comment and I couldn’t disagree with your points more."
I mean they do. Everyone was calling Lonzo a bust and Ingram overrated until we traded them. Same with Randle. Same with D-Lo. Same with Clarkson.   They were well on the path to becoming the players they are now when they were in LA and Laker fans were “delusional” for saying they would be good.  Hell a year ago there was a thread about Lou Williams vs Caruso and anyone picking Caruso got absolutely FLAMED for doing so. Now there isn’t a fanbase in the league who would rather have Lou.
"Because maybe some players are good defenders if they try?   People don't realize that no player can drop 30 points and play amazing defense (Giannis is the expection). Team defense is much more important. Jrue Holiday was amazing on defense this playoffs, but he was complete ass on offense, Kawhi was amazing on offense, but didn't give his all on defense(DPOY level).   Rudy was the DPOY and got outplayed by Terrance Man,  The Sixers had 2 top 5 DPOY candidates and 3 all defensive team members and they got cooked by lou williams  it's stupid to ask every star player that's the main offensive point of the team to play hard on defense, I'm sure booker, luka and harden could chase guys around screens and hustle more, but is it worth it if they get gassed on offense then?"
Hawks got rid of rondo for Lou Williams last year in a trade. He was on the clippers to finish.
"&gt; Simmons would have a field day being guarded by IT and Lou Williams.  Yeah we saw what he did against Trae Young and Lou Will, imagine what he'd do against IT and Lou Will 🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"OP could've gone:  &amp;#x200B;  |Position|Defense|Offense| |:-|:-|:-| |C:|Ben Wallace|Rik Smits| |PF:|Dennis Rodman|Dāvis Bertāns| |SF:|Tony Allen|Steve Novak| |SG:|Andre Roberson|Lou Williams| |PG:|Ben Simmons|Jose Calderon|  &amp;#x200B;  Everyone's in their primes, I think it's a decent argument, I'd probably lean towards team offense, but this way you aren't just relying on old and out of prime players."
"But this isn't great offense.   C: 2021 DeMarcus Cousins was statistically average offensively.   PF: 2021 Carmelo Anthony was a below average scorer and inefficient  SF: Jabari Parker in his prime was a solid 20 ppg guy, but not elite at any one thing  SG: Lou Williams in his prime was a great scorer, that was about it though, not a ton of facilitating. I think Simmons and Thybulle would be able to contain him in the halfcourt.   PG: 2020 Isaiah Thomas was garbage. He's averaged 11 ppg on 39% from the field over the last 3 seasons.   These are just offensive players that are atrocious on defense. Prime Lou and Jabari are really the only good offensive players here and neither were elite."
"That defensive team has two HOFers in their prime and then an All Star caliber guy in Simmons. team defense would kill.  I realize he's a meme at this point, but Simmons would have a field day being guarded by IT and Lou Williams.  Also Melo is washed, replace him with Dāvis Bertāns or something, and maybe it's a little more interesting."
"Ok, Imma go full hype beast and say prime John Wall is better than Kyrie at finishing inside. Google some highlights and he can use both hands with a ton of techniques like he's a point guard in the nba or something /s  I think highlights are really nice and cool. However, if we looked only at the impressiveness of highlights then Lou Williams and JR Smith would be the GOATs. If skill is measured in scoring, and field goal percent, why are we trying to adjust for Kyrie reverse euro stepping through 3 people and somehow saying the difficulty of shot determines skill?  People forget that Kyrie isn't always hot. In fact, sometimes he just murders his teams chances for winning a game by both his inability to hit and volume. This doesn't even necessarily require double teams or specialized coverages, Kyrie is not the type of player who on an average night needs somebody on him 24/7. When he's hot or catching stride yes, but he is not given the attention Curry gets. People want to give Kyrie all this credit for his handle, and thats cool and all but he plays either by himself and just tries to improvise using sheer volume scoring. When his fellow star players return, they employ a ""you're hot why the fuck are you passing shoot that shit"" strategy depending on who's hitting their looks. (Not criticizing, when you're as good as the Nets are you can just let people fuck around and then tighten down the routine and strategy as you go) Curry plays within a system built around him, and while he might have some off nights he is going to be there for you with cold streaks few and far between. This applies more broadly to their finishing ability, and thus I say again, who gives a shit how pretty the shot is if a simpler one goes in more at similar volume?"
"I think sextons value has more so to do with things such as upcoming contract extensions, build and play style, not just stats. He’s going to be seeking a large bag, which a lot of teams aren’t wanting to take on. By no means does it mean he’s a bad player, or that his stats are empty. Lou Williams was a 20ppg scorer and his value was exactly that. It wasn’t empty stats. Everything is more so market value, not necessarily their impact. It’s not 1 for 1."
"3P SFD  Since 2009-10 season  James Harden 7.23% - (521 total on 6728 3PA - 3ptFG% = 36.34%)  Lou Williams	6.31% - (243 total on 3625 3PA -  3ptFG% = 35.53%)  Damian Lillard 3.57% - (201 total on 5468 3PA - 3ptFG% = 37.51%)  Stephen Curry 2.84% - (190 total on 6540 3PA - 3ptFG% = 43.30%)  JJ Redick	4.08% - (184 total on 4384 3PA - 3ptFG% = 41.70%)  Jamal Crawford 4.54% - (161 total on 3426 3P - 3ptFG% = 34.91%)  Kevin Durant	3.67% - (147 total on 3876 on 3PA - 3ptFG% = 38.67%)  &amp;#x200B;  Fun fact, Harden has attempted almost 200 more threes than Steph, yet made 400 less threes in total."
Love this Lou Williams prop
"I like Allen, although they would be a bit undersized:  [Lucius Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenlu01.html)  [Ray Allen ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html)  [Tony Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allento01.html)  [Grayson Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allengr01.html)  [Jarrett Allen] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenja01.html)  Williams is another good one, although it would be a super small lineup:  [Deron Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willide01.html)  [Lou Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willilo02.html)  [Reggie Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willire01.html)  [Gus Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willigu01.html)  [Buck Williams] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willibu01.html)  However the correct answer is obviously Marjanović."
"PG - Gus Williams SG - Deron Williams SF - Marvin Williams PF - Buck Williams C - Herb Williams  Bench - Lou, Mo, Jason, Hot Rod  Maybe not the best, but very solid."
"I don’t have a clear answer for it, but I think there’s something in the ‘pure scorer’ discussion that’s probably worth considering.   In the same way you’d adjust TS% based on era, you could also do that for shot difficulty.   Goal is to credit points according to how much more/less efficiently the average replacement player could score them.   This would take value away from lob-catchers &amp; give value to isolation scorers. % of Field Goals Assisted on is probably the easiest proxy for this, but there’s also a ton of other stuff you could layer in. Play type, seconds left on shot clock, stage of the game, % contested, etc.   Super exaggerated example: Lou Williams 10ppg / 60%TS strictly based on end of shot clock isolation shots in the 4th quarter is bringing a lot more value to a team than Deandre Jordan catching lobs to get the same stats.   With that said, I’d imagine that it’s pretty difficult to disentangle tough shots by ‘necessity’ from a tough shot due to bad shot selection."
Wet Willy  for Lou Williams.
And Lou Williams 👍
I miss Lou Williams on the clippers. Man was fire in the regular season.
"&gt;Because Williams was traded for a non-factor in Rondo  And what did Simmons get traded for? Thats right, nothing, because the trade hasn't happened yet, so you have no reasonable basis on which to evaluate the risk-reward of the trade because it doesn't exist.   Everything has a price. It's crazy to say that Simmons is not worth trading for. He has a fair market price, just like Lou Williams did. You're basing your entire argument on what the GM of the team said he wants in return. It's that guys job to overhype his guy. Of course he's asking for too much. If he came out and said he was looking to get a bag of chips for Simmons he would be fired on the spot. The Spurs said they wanted a young, franchise-type, all star and first round picks for Kawhi and got Demar and 1 protected 1st. So pump the breaks on grading a trade before it's even happened.  You're not talking about Kawhi's trade in terms of what the spurs asked for. They asked for more than they got, and people still said the won the trade until Toronto won the championship"
"That's not true at all. Risk and reward is priced into the trade. Everything has a fair price. Otherwise how did Lou Williams get traded when his ""potential reward"" isn't even near that of Simmons?"
"That's not really relevant to the point being made, which is that players say they don't want to play somewhere and then regularly end up playing somewhere else successfully. Lou williams said he was going to retire immediately if he got traded and just signed a new contract with Atlanta for another year."

"&gt; Lou Will is one of the nicest dudes of all time  Definitely one the nicest guy around. Here’s a pretty neat story about him for those who haven’t heard about it yet.   &gt;While stopped in his car in Manayunk on Christmas Eve, Williams was approached by a man with a gun. The situation was deflated when the gunman recognized Williams and commended him for his work in the community. Williams said he treated the man to a meal at a local fast-food restaurant by giving him some money.  Source: https://www.inquirer.com/philly/sports/sixers/20111227_Lou_Williams__reputation_can_be_disarming.html"
"Giannis was super shy when I met him years back. Tony Snell was chill, though another dude thought he was Thon Maker and kept yelling that out, so that was awkward  Embiid was chill  AD ignored me, so did Tyreke. Jrue was nice, as were Ryno and Jimmer. David Wesley was hilarious (and hating on Kobe). Monty Williams might have been the nicest person of all time  Dwane Casey was so nice and humble  Kobe was surprisingly nice and personable. Pau and Sasha Vucacic were cool. Shannon Brown I just said wattup, he was with a girl so didn't bother  Zbo was absolutely adorable  Bobby Jackson did not seem to want to talk or get a pic at all  Yogi Ferrell seemed douchey out of all people  DLo didn't want to talk or get a pic when I saw him right after the Lakers traded him to the Nets, so that makes sense. But before that got to talk and take a pic with him  Lou Will is one of the nicest dudes of all time, as is Jamal Crawford  Bagley was chill and we got a clean pic. Gallo was a cool guy as well  Jerry West seemed so genuine and I was like a fanboy seeing him  Pretty sure I saw Danny Granger at six flags, but I didn't want to yell out his name to confirm  Kareem was very quiet. I once got pushed by Shaqs bodyguard. Brian Shaw was quiet as well  Rick Fox, RJ, and Pierce were at an event and were chill  Larry Sanders and Arenas were cool  I'm sure there's more but I've blabbered long enough haha"
"If he has already finished puberty I would be absolutely shocked if he becomes anything more then just a piece a team adds with the hope that Lebron joins them too.   He is 6’2 with limited skills and terrible shooting. Not a PG.   Compare him to someone like DeJon Jarreau, Kerwin Roach, Rasheed Sulaimon and Solomon Poole and he is well behind them in terms of talent and pro potential.   Comparing him to someone like Lou Williams, Monta Ellis and even Malik Newman and he is miles behind them.   With that said, if he hits a 3-4” growth (unlikely as he hasn’t seemed to grow much the last 2 years) he could definitely be an NBA player he lives in the gym. If your 6’5-6’6 and a good athlete (he is) with a knockdown shot you’ll get a decent chance.   Definitely has the athleticism to compete at the nba level, just not the skills nor the IQ.   Excited to see what happens with his development these next 2-3 years"
Penny Hardaway. We don't really have a lot of players from Memphis being successful in the NBA. The next best player after him is Lou Williams.
"That Trae Young is overrated. Skip has actually said this but I agree. Atl is a really good team top to bottom but they have no all stars outside of Trae so he gets all the credit. I literally saw Lou Williams bring the Hawks back from down 20 against the Sixers to single digits. Huerter, Collins, and there other role players had good games while Trae shot horrible from the field but ended up with a high point total because he shot a million free throws and the next day all the sports shows were praising him. I’m not saying he’s not an all star level PG he obviously is but people have been hyping him up for beating the Knicks who were celebrating one playoff win happy to be there and the Sixers who have choked every year in the Second round that they’ve had Ben Simmons. Next year they won’t be calling those baiting fouls as shooting fouls. Let’s see how far they go with the East improved and everyone healthy."
Nah he's just another Lou Williams
"He at least deserved a Lou Williams level of responsibility. He was playing very well up until his injury, a solid 15/5 player that was hitting his shots while still facilitating the role.   The amount of scrutiny he was faced with after Linsanity can be attributed to nothing other than him being Asian. Was he far from a point god? Absolutely. But could he play a Kemba Walker type of role for the second squad? Without a doubt.  Look at Kuzma. He’s probably going to get a hell of a lot of playing time as a scorer."
Still a Laker at heart. It's pretty great that you guys traded away Lou Williams for a guy who helped the Lakers win a championship less than a year ago and who's now back on the Lakers 😂
Can it get Paul George tho or just DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams?
"Kawhi had one bad game in the nuggets series and for the rest of the time carried lou Williams, montrezl harrell, doc rivers, and Paul George yet people still blame the loss on kawhi.  Harden is good in the playoffs, John wall was too  I have some that are the opposite, dame isn’t all that great in the playoffs, and people are still overrating Giannis because of this playoff run."
My boy you are disrespectful as hell comparing Middleton to that no defense glorified Lou Williams
"&gt;Please…3 of those rings Mitch was along for the ride.  This is demonstrably not the case.  Kupchak was fully-empowered as the General Manager in the summer of 2000.  That means Kupchak:  * made the Horace Grant trade -- who started every playoff game in 2001 -- for Glen Rice, who was terrible the previous season * signed bench guys Medvedenko, Hunter, and Rider who all played a bunch of minutes * but most importantly by-far, managed to keep O'Neal and Jackson from either killing Bryant, or quitting in frustration over his truculence, or both.  He probably deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for the latter alone.  And previous to that, he was the GM in charge of most operations from 1995 through 2000.  More to the actual point, no GM makes every decision in a vacuum with zero input from ownership or Executive Vice Presidents -- which was West's title from '95 through 2000.  The fact remains that the Lakers won 6 titles with Kupchak as their GM, and five of those occurred after West was formally retired.  If you want to discount some of those early titles, you may have to add the 2020 ring in their place.  Kupchak was gone by then, but he laid much of the groundwork -- doing things like [refusing to trade Ingram for DeMarcus Cousins](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/sam-amick/2017/02/21/why-lakers-jeanie-buss-fired-jim-buss-mitch-kupchak/98223130/) and not trading away the picks that became Ball and Hunter in a misguided attempt to win with the aged Bryant, and trading cash for Jordan Clarkson (!!), and signing Lou Williams."
I feel like ppl forget he was literally averaging almost 20 a game in the playoffs like 2 years ago he’s always had this in him just didn’t play well in the playoffs last year and they had Montrezl Harrel and Lou Williams so he didn’t have as big of a role
"It's the same garbage that followed Lowry for years before 2019. Yes, he along with PG and Harden had bad series, but the way they're talked about you thought they were Lou Williams calibre in the playoffs."
Clarkson is like the new and improved Lou Williams
Some surprising entries here were:  - Boris Diaw with a 11/16/11/3/2 statline - Vucevic with a 20/29 (!) game - Kevin Love with a 31/31 (!) game back in his Wolves days   - Defensive specialist Lou Williams with a 31pts 10 STEALS game
"Oh no, that 2015-16 roster was just.... ugh  Kobe  Roy Hibbert  Brandon Bass  Lou Williams  Nick Young  D-Lo  Jordan Clarkson  Julius Randle  Larry Nance Jr  Anthony Brown  Tarik Black (one of my favorite Lakers during the down years)  Marcelo Huertas (the fucking GOAT)  Robert Sacre (the other fucking GOAT)  That's 13 out of 15 I can remember. I'm too lazy to check but I think Metta World Peace was also on it or maybe I'm thinking of 2016-17"
"The biggest thing for MPJ is he needs to become a mediocre defender.  He's basically Lou Williams right now. Sure he can score well, but literally anyone on the opposing team can score on him.  Jokic isn't the greatest paint/help defender either so the combo is bad"
Clippers doomed themselves when they betrayed Lou Williams.
That's Lou Williams
Is this the first playoff game in which Lou Williams doesn’t have his team’s worst +/-?
"What happened to Lou Williams? He went from 2x 6th man of the year, to barely playing rotational minutes on a 5 seed team lol"
"&gt;I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not “cheap”  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn’t the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn’t he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren’t cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren’t exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don’t have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don’t have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don’t trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don’t know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I’ll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there’s a high chance of us bringing back. So you’re talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that’s 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you’re in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that’s fine.   Now I don’t even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we’re talking about the Lakers."
Collins getting out played by Lou Williams
Anybody remember a high school Lou Williams hanging out in the back yard during the filming of little bow wows cribs episode?
"Dude i fucking swear, the more strip clubs in a 5 mile radius, the better Lou Williams gets"
Lou Williams for no reason stopped playing defense with 6 seconds left and didn’t move from that spot on the court till the basket was made. Got to get him off the court.
What a silly play by Lou Williams. That's not a real 2-for-1 type of situation...
"Lou Williams - good defense, bad offense"
Do you guys want to bring trez back? He was always a pretty weird fit in my opinion.   I think if Schroeder ended up playing the Lou Williams role trez woulda made some sense but he didn’t seem to be getting the same looks this year
Sounds like Lou Williams without the two girlfriends.
Why even trade Lou Williams for this man if you ain’t gonna use him
"Lou Williams needs only one dribble and his FT% is over 80 percent.  Hell, I want to see a player do a cut, catch and shoot from the FT one day."
Who would’ve ever thought J Clarkson would turn into prime Lou Williams after Lakers shipped him off
"No, he's just been on a consistent top 3 team in the East. KD was amazing in 2014 to get the Thunder to the finals and no one considered Harden a star then. He was like Lou Williams 2/3 years ago then"
"Honestly, not even always for the playoffs. Ever since Trae Young got here, the energy has been different, there have been some really electric home crowds even when the team was losing. But Lou Williams was with the Hawks during previous playoff years and he said this year has been different. The 60 win season under Coach Bud didn't even have great playoff crowds, nobody believed in the team or the ownership."
ah yes Denver Nuggets legend “Lemon Pepper” Lou Williams
"Lou Williams was for years, Ricky Pierce"
 Lou Williams
Nah we already saw that. He was traded for Lou Williams and Blake did a terrible job of leading them which led to him getting traded.
Why does Cam Payne look like dollar store Lou Williams
"Over the years I saw the comparisons with dame (PBUH) go from people wondering if he deserved allstar over lou williams (LOL), to vs wall, to vs westbrook or lowry, to vs kyrie, and in a few years it won't be heresy to say that he's on or above steph's level."
"They already have Ben McLemore if they want a guy who can shoot but not defend. One way guys like that have limited value in the playoffs. That's why the Clippers traded away Lou Williams. It hurts your team too much to have a guy the opposition can target over and over like that, no matter how good of a shooter they are."
"I mean, Giannis at least played well in Game 1 of the Semifinals. Paul George, on the other hand...  Should also be noted that Paul George has better teammates than Giannis does (I'd take Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, and Lou Williams in a heartbeat over Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Brook Lopez)."
"Shake is basically what Lou Williams has been all his career,  an instant offense type off the bench.  He's capable of putting up 20 at any time.  He's been in a slump the last couple of weeks of the season and the opening series against Washington,  but this game may have broken him out of it.    If regular season Shake is back and sparks the rest of the bench like tonight, I'm not worried about this series at all.  The bench play was the biggest reason the Sixers lost the first game."
"Suns bench:  Guards - Cam Payne (can start on any team), Etwan Moore (proven vet) Langston Galloway (Microwave scorer from downtown and proven starter), Jevon Carter (best defender among the guards and capable 3pt shooter), Tyshon Alexander (rookie, 3 pt sniper)  Forwards - Cam Johnson (has been a starter as well), Torrey Craig (Proven Vet and rebounder w a sweet 3pt stroke)  PF/C - Dario Saric (proven stretch big), Frank Kaminsky (also proven stretch big) - both of them are capable passers btw ; Jalen Smith (Rookie but can shoot the 3 and block shots/rebound)  Just looking at the Bench, we can field another starting 5 with Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric and still be able to defend and outscore another average NBA starting 5, and have capable backups in Galloway, Jevon Carter, and Frank Kaminsky to run vs other 2nd units...that's a DEEP bench right there...  I don't think the hawks have a much better bench TBH, outside of Gallinari, Lou Williams and Huerter... Quite the opposite TBH with the Suns probably having the best Bench composition in the entire league TBH.  The bench has been one of the major strengths of the Suns and will be for years to come . Go SUNS!!!!"
Lou Williams plays like such a hoe
Lou Williams and John Collins really sold today.
Lou Williams really trying hard to lose lol
"I hate the call but at the same time, it's 2021, if you are dumb enough to still ignore what Lou Williams will do in this situation then it's on you"
"When did I mention free throws? I'm taking about flopping. It's well known Trae and Lou Williams initiate and sell contact, but when Embiid does it it's a problem?"
Does Lou williams still have 2 girlfriends
"Wtf, Hawks have Lou Williams too?"
"""Lou Williams doing what he does""  *brick*"
incredible bad coaching. wth Lou Williams are doing in a game like this?
"I love seeing Clint Capela and Lou Williams. I am a Rockets fan, so...they are my people."
How have defenders not learned by now to NEVER contest a Lou Williams fall away jumper.   Contesting it only makes it a guaranteed make
Lou Williams is on the floor.  Hunt Lou Williams
"Don't just stand there Lou Williams, block the dunk."
"Iguodala was supposed to be the franchise guy after Iverson left, but he just wasn't that guy. Philly sports radio thought he should be a 25 point a night guy and that just clearly wasn't him. The teams weren't built around him to fully utilize him like he was used later. Had him and AI overlapped for longer (with guys like Korver and Lou Williams still in the mix) I think they could've made a nasty combo.   He proved himself with the Olympic team and then eventually Golden State."
"You need to realize that the NBA didn't suspend players for violating Covid rules, so that was never an option. Some players were put in the health and safety protocols if they were discovered to be a risk to infect other people, and they would have to isolate for safety reasons, but there were never suspensions handed out. Players were put in the health and safety protocols if they tested positive or if they came in close contact with someone else who did, or even if they were in an environment where it was unclear what their level of exposure could have been (like going to a club filled with strangers).   Even last year when [Lou Williams went to Magic City for lemon pepper wings](https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/25/lou-williams-gentlemans-club-magic-city) or when [Danuel House brought a woman back to his room,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/sports/basketball/nba-houston-rockets-danuel-house.html?smid=url-share) they weren't suspended by the league, they were just forced to isolate to make sure they didn't infect anyone else. LeBron went to an event that was outdoors and where everyone present had to have either been vaccinated or have proof of a negative test, so he wasn't considered to have been exposed to anyone infected, so there was no reason to isolate him."
As opposed to Trae and Lou Williams? I'd rather have CJ as a playoff 6th man who can come in for both Trae and Bogie rather than Gallo as a playoff 6th man where the Hawks have 5 players competing for 2 positions
"Tyson Chandler won in 2012, not 2011. Lou Williams won in 2015, not 2014."
"it's unbelievable how overrated mccollum is on here  he's had 1 year of above average efficiency scoring in his career, 5 years ago, and that's with lillard getting the best perimeter defender  lou williams on a max contract"

"Lou williams is a good role player, dennis schroeder when he was 6th man was a good role player,"
What? My comment was in response to you saying this:  &gt;but Lou Will proved year after year that he's big time in the playoffs  About a guy shooting 40% from the field and 26.5% from three for his playoff career lol. Had nothing to do with Josh Richardson. Getting a 34 year old Lou Williams who is an absolute turnstile on defense wouldn't be any improvement. And even *if* it was an improvement the improvement would be completely marginal and make no sense if the goal is to get better playoff performers.
"Not sure what Lou Williams you’ve been watching lol. Outside of a series here or there he’s been consistently awful during the playoffs throughout his career. His career numbers in 77 playoff games are 12 PPG on 40% from the field, and 26% from three."
"This is true that Kennard's defense is his only weakness, luckily we literally have Paul George, Kawhi, Morris, and Batum in the same lineups. Kennards the worst defender on any given lineup but the other guys more than make up for it. A big reason we traded away Lou Williams was because we couldnt afford 2 defensive sieves on the same team."
"I was crying out loud on this sub about how good a pick Lou Will would be to the Mavs and hell broke lose on me talking about how bad a defender he is (as if JRich is any better) last post-season arguably the 2nd best player for the clippers in the series against us was lou williams.    I have been telling everybody that we need a second ball handler who can take the load off of Luka's shoulders, and Lou Will was that guy in my eyes, especially after trading Seth which turned out to be a disaster."
strip clubs saluting lou williams rn
"I completely agree, but I just don't see what Kemba can give the Mavs. Brunson is a good playmaker and can drive to the basket. He shouldn't be their main scorer from the bench though. They could really use a Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player that can produce coming from the bench. I don't see Kemba as that player at this point in his career."
"The one strategy that did work well in the regular season matchups was the Clippers blitzing the pick and roll with Bev, Jackson, and Lou Williams. It forced Mitchell to make quicker decisions and disrupted the Jazz half court offense. With that said, Mitchell has learned some counters over the season on how to attack aggressive defenders, so if the Clippers do this again, they need to make sure they don't foul. Memphis tried this strategy in round 1 and Mitchell made a mockery of it."
?? This is not what the series hinges on lol. This series is much more about the wings. I think Reggie Jackson will have to be in point because the Jazz biggest weakness is the small guards that can shoot and get to the hole.   Lou Williams was the Jazz Killer so that will help the Jazz a lot to not have to deal with him.
"Yeah I thought Gallinari, Lou Williams, and Solomon Hill were pretty good picks up for the Hawks - Mavs should look for some veterans in the postseason that can be known quantities for when things get tough."
Lou Williams is another textbook example.
Lou Williams is the six-time 3rd man of the year.
"Anyone old enough to remember the Lou Williams, Thad Young &amp; Iggy playoff team that was so much fun to watch?  Lou Will killing Philly now is fun to see"
Lou Williams can fill a basketball up
Lou Williams torching Doc after he was the reason they lost to us last season is the ultimate F U to Doc
“We can slow down the Nets big 3”  Cant even handle a 35 year old Lou Williams
Lol that was such a Lou Williams possession
"I’ve also seen Lou Williams defend for stretches. Doesn’t mean he’s capable in every scenario. Coaches tend to play to their players strengths. If they’re playing Joel in drop every time (deferring to you here because I don’t watch the Sixers enough to dispute that claim), it’s because that’s what is best served for their defensive scheme."
"“We can slow down KD, Kyrie, and Harden”  They can’t even slow down Lou Williams lol"
Ayyy dumbfoundead on r/NBA interviewing Lou Williams. Didn't see that coming
I think so. Flashbacks to my days watching GrindTime.   https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/lou-williams-talks-atlanta-hip-hop-over-friend-lobster-tail-the-takeout
Lol ain’t nobody scared of pat bev. It was Lou Williams and Harrell that were actually giving it to the warriors.

Clint Capela  PJ Tucker  James Harden  Lou Williams  Chris Paul   in reverse order of position
"On point. They keep looking for playmaking guards when they could have developed Kuzma to be an aggressive scorer. You cant expect him to score 20 only when you need it coz he’s no Lou Williams, he needs consistency.   His energy will match his game. Fuck it if he’s inefficent at times, make it easier for him by giving him rhythm"
You should've kept in the entire sequence beforehand of Kawhi calling for the switch and having them force Luka to guard for him  So disrespectful lmao this is some LeBron on Lou Williams shit and they say Kawhi doesn't have a sense of humor....
Lou Williams vs KD 2019 WCSF /s
"This is like when Lou Williams clippers were giving the KD warriors work, no top team wanted to see them regardless"
_breaking news: Lou Williams demands trade to a contender_  _Clippers forced to take asset Rajon Rondo back in return_
"His playstyle is really best suited to a role as a 6th man I think, and even if Finch only had him coming of the bench as he worked back from injury I think that's his best role going forward.  I really liked how the Wolves were playing with him in that role, it let the starting lineup operate within the normal structure and gave him the freedom to be a ball dominant iso scorer in bench heavy lineups that had been problematic prior to that point.  He makes a lot more money than a 6th man typically would, so we will have to see what happens next year, but having pass first Rubio play with Beasley, Ant and KAT just makes so much more sense from an offensive flow perspective.  Using Russell as a supercharged version of Lou Williams or Clarkson could really apply pressure to opposing bench units imo."
"Man, if there was a series for Kuzma to really step up (and get paid), this was it. When AD was out, he could have been that 2nd scorer to put up like 30 - he could have given them the Lou Williams type of energy off the bench or really stepped up to lock guys up."
I had no idea Lou Williams was drafted before Rondo
"middleton is way way way better offensively, people in general have some really deluded opinion of mccollum's skills - he's had 1 above average efficiency season in his career, and it was a long time ago  mccollum is lou williams in a starting spot and on a max contract"
And Lou Williams!
CJ is a great Lou Williams type 6th man masquerading as a starter.
Lou Williams.
Jokic had 32-18-10 lmao. If that’s “guarding a centre” then Lou Williams can guard 1-5 I guess
Payne looks like a sad boy Lou Williams.
Honestly fuck those people who claimed Booker would be a Lou Williams/Jamal Crawford type player just because he was a young player on a shitty team. It actually makes me happy when players perform well and make haters eat their words
Wow. Maybe one day he could be a Lou Williams / sixth man type
yes. Dame isn't good enough that his 2nd best player can be a glorified Lou Williams and the team can win a chip
"Chris Paul and Schroder were teammates, Paul must know all of his shit. Maybe Schroder will come in as some kind of Lou Williams type player. Basically once the other team is over their foul limit, Schroder will just run around and try to bait fouls while the defense is sheepish about playing aggressively."
Indeed. And our 8th man is Lou Williams
"What was the point of trading Rondo for Lou Williams? I appreciate Rondo's intangibles, but they need points, and trading away their third leading scorer without a viable replacement was dumb."
" &gt;Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry.  Ya pre cp3. A lot of those guys weren't there at that time lol. And Lou for one season... pi tucker didn't become a decent shooter till much later."
"Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.

"Hawks went out and got Bogdonavic, Capela, Gallo, Lou Williams and they already had Collins, Hunter, and Huerter.  Cavs surround Sexton with Larry Nance and Dean Wade. Not a fair comp."
"2012 he was elite in the playoffs until a poor finals, as a bench player you can’t really blame him too much when he was your 2nd best player in a few matchups.  2013 he averaged 26/7/5 on 55% TS, underperformed but he was the 8th seed against the 1st seed lol, not a huge deal  2014 was the same story he was a bit inefficient and I guess it’s fair to blame him here  2015 lmao you’re brushing off an entire fucking playoff run because Josh smith and Corey Brewer made a couple threes? He was elite in the dallas series, elite in the Clippers series, check out his game 7 and overall series stats, one bad game doesnt mean anything. Against golden state he was bad in the last game but the series was already long lost lmao.  I know you didn’t even watch but go back and look at games 1 and 2 at Oracle. Harden is doing everything hitting big shot after big shot with 30 pt triple doubles and we lose by a possession each game. He had no help; already down 2 starters with Jason Terry on steph curry.  He was good in that series overall and only had 2 bad games, he also had a 45 point game to give us our only win.  In 2016 his stats went down a bit but is that not expected when the 8th seeded team you dragged into the playoffs gets to face the 73-9 warriors? Curry or not, there defense was elite and harden again had no help. Michael beasley is his best player this series.  2017 he was great in round 1 putting up 33/7/7 on andre roberson the best wing defender in the league on 60% TS.  Round 2 yes this is an actual choke. Game 6 we should have won and there was no excuse. However harden was still elite for the other 5 games and that shouldn’t be discounted. Lou Williams was absurdly bad this series and harden hadn’t figured out the floater game yet, Spurs iced him on every pick and roll.   Also, he had a concussion.   2018 Jesus Christ you can’t possibly blame him losing to 4 allstars as the only one? Paul went down after 3-2, and even then harden put up big games 6 and 7. He had us in the game in 7 until this happened  https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU  2019 35/7 on 60% TS on golden state outplayed steph and kd  2020 harden put up 30/8 on 60% TS with no westbrook while guarded by dort, best wing defender in the league and clinched it with a game 7 game winning block.  Round 2 westbrook puts up 15/4 on 40% TS and is left open every play while harden averaged 30/8 on 65% TS while being full on trapped all game. How are you this blind lol?  2021 he puts up 29/8/10 on 76% TS against Boston and his hamstring is destroyed. Yet he still goes out and plays for them and he’s still mockded  Stupid fucking comment"
He doesn’t even need to shoot like Curry to be in the conversation. If Giannis could shoot like Lou Williams he’d have goat potential.
I just bought a pair of Peak Streetball Lou Williams from Amazon a couple months ago since I started playing outdoors and my indoor shoes were pretty worn down. So far they've held up pretty well and they were only $60 so that was nice
Lou Williams said it too
Lou Williams said it too
...he is right. Basketball is a team sport. Lou Williams could cook basically anyone 1v1 but he’s still just a bench player cause he’s a bad defender and isn’t a true playmaker. Basketball is a team game.
1 - Westbrook  2 - Lou Williams  3 - Ben Simmons  4 - Enes Kanter   5 - Hassan Whiteside
"And it was crazy because we really didn't have any other options.   Isaiah was the only player on our roster who could dribble **and** shoot at a decent level. Everyone else on the roster could only do one or the other.   Marcus could handle the ball but was having a historically bad shooting season, Avery could shoot but he's a 6'2 SG because he has zero handles, etc etc.  We had decent players, but there was no Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum or even a Lou Williams that Isaiah could share those late-game responsibilities with.  Plus he had a huge target on his back because of the KOT4 stuff.  So when the game slowed down in the clutch entire defenses would just zero in on Isaiah. Teams knew they only had to slow this one guy down for a short specific stretch.  He obliterated them game after game.   It was absurd how consistently he did it too, it was like clockwork. He would sub in with 8 minutes left and 12-15 points on the board, he'd finish the game with 30."
CJ can be the next Lou Williams
Lou Williams Jordan Clarkson Carmelo Anthony Damontas Sabonis Hassan Whiteside
Russ-Easily the best player on this list but his efficiency and IQ really get exposed in the playoffs  Sexton-Closer to Lou Williams than a true star worth a max  Sabonis-By the advanced metrics one of the most horrific defenders in the NBA. People try and tell me that the Pacers should trade Turner and start Sabonis at center like it’s that easy  And ofc the goats of empty stats Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside  Replace Drummond with Kanter for your challenge
Lou Williams catching strays
"Sexton is straight cheeks, but it's funny as hell to see the Cavs fans that don't understand winning basketball scurry to defend him.  He's a scorer without any discernible bbiq, is allergic to defense and doesn't understand how to run an offense (or participate in team defense).    If he accepts a role off the bench, he's got 6th man awards in his future, like Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford.  If you're paying him to be the 2nd/3rd best player on your team, you're utterly fucked."
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
No he’d look more like Lou Williams.
Save yourself about 20 mill and just substitute Lou Williams for Derozan and have Williams on the bench.
Lemon (Lou Williams) Pepper
No he's not lol he's basically young Lou Williams  Lou Will in 2018 was averaging 23 on 57% TS while Sexton is doing 24 on 57% TS. Lou also came off the bench so he prob could have averaged more if he started
"That's not possible.  There are still people who think he's some amazing young talent, therefore he's overrated.  He's an undersized 2-guard who still requires the ball in his hands to be effective yet he can't pass.  He's also a truly awful defender.  He's basically Lou Williams but given too much of a green light to do whatever he wants because his team is so bad."
He reminds me of a younger Lou Williams
He averaged 11 assists as well in the regular season. Probably would have won the assist title if he didn't get hurt seeing as those would have gone up once KD returned to the lineup  Also did 11 in 2017 passing to Eric Gordon and Lou Williams and won assist title that year
"What is Maxey's absolute ceiling though? He's a 6'2"" shooting guard without a three point shot. How many of those are in the league right now?  The two most efficient shots in the league are the three pointer and the free throw. Maxey doesn't draw fouls or hit threes. He doesn't have the facilitating skills to play point guard, he doesn't have the size to play shooting guard, he's a negative on defense. He would have been great in 2002.  His best case scenario is a Lou Williams type 6th Man who scores 18 ppg off the bench in the regular season (with terrible advanced stats) and is unplayable in the playoffs.  I'd take Thybulle any day over Maxey. Absolutely zero doubt in my mind."
"Lou Williams, you trash. I know you thought I forgot about you but I did not."
"Collin Sexton, as a 22 year old who has improved massively every year he's been in the league and clearly hasn't even come close to reaching his prime, was better this year than Lou Williams has ever been. Playing on a team that was decimated by injuries practically the entire year.  22 year old Lou Will scored under 20 ppg, shot under 40% from the field, and had a TS of 51%. 22 year old Collin Sexton scored nearly 25 a game, shot 47.5% from the field, and had a TS of 57% -- again, on a team with virtually no cohesion. -- If your basis for considering Sexton's value is that he's a facsimile of Lou Will, you're just wrong. Period. Sexton is a tier above Lou Will and that isn't really debatable. They both do similar things, Sexton just does it far better."
Hes Lou williams part deux. That was the comp made before he was drafted and unfortunately still holds true
"&gt; What’s wrong with him?  Truly awful defender, he's extremely undersized for a 2-guard, and he's way too ball dominant for his lack of playmaking ability.  &gt; Or they don’t think he is a franchise level material?   Exactly this.  He's much more Lou Williams than he is a max player.  Contract will be coming up and they'd rather sell now and get value than lose him to free agency by some crazy team overpaying him."
"It didn’t overly.   The re-signed a few RFA’s (Lowry, Ibaka)   But they also lost PJ Tucker, PPatt, Kawhi, Green, Gasol, Ibaka (for his next contract) and debatably lost Lou Williams (sounded like he was interested in coming back but the Raptors wanted to move on. Since then he has downplayed Toronto but at the time he made a comment that Toronto didn’t offer him a contract).  Toronto has a pretty terrible free agency history.  Edit: also Shout out to Biyombo. Signed a 1 year deal with the Raptors only to get paid an insane amount by Orlando. He wanted to stay, but the money was way too good to pass up."
"Generally the problem is the mentality and not the ability. Kobe could've kept playing a couple more years as a bench scorer averaging 22-24 minutes a game, but he was incapable of having the mentality that a bench player that only plays sporadically needs to have.  People have this skewed perception that LeBron could be a bench player, but if he could, he would be the first all-time great that was able to do it, players of this level just think different, they aren't wired to be a Lou Williams."
"Clippers also attacked Luka and Porzingis over and over again on defense, this year and last year. Mavericks didn’t get any better on defense by trading Seth for a guy who was unplayable in the playoffs, Mavs problems on defense were/are a lot bigger than Seth.  Seth primarly guarded Bogdanovic who averaged 13 PPG on 45 TS%. Heurter averaged 13PPG on 57 TS%, he was amazing in game 7 but was meh most of the series. The Hawks were able to hide a backcourt of Trae and Lou Williams, it’s possible to hide Seth on defense in a more limited role."
"He averaged 21 PPG on 78.8 TS% in a playoff series making 8M/year. The other team was playing a backcourt of Lou Williams and Trae Young for long stretches, both of whom are worse defenders than Seth.   Looked bad in game 7 but Heurter also just had the game of his life and was hitting a lot of though shots."
"Crawford, Lou Williams, Clarkson... They all have a lot in common."
Lou Williams during the 2017-18 season
"People see high PPG and think a guy's good. That's why a lot of 6th Men of the Year were just dudes who scored and did fuck-all else. Like Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams have the most 6MOTY awards, but were not helpful when it mattered."
"He might not be an all-star anymore, but I still think he's too good to come off the bench. Unless he turns into Lou Williams and actually plays better as a sub."
lou williams seems like someone who might do it just for fun.
"I feel like late career Lou Williams/Jamal Crawford seems really fun. Just come in, cross up some backups, jack up shots, head back to the bench, maybe hit the town after the game. Cant beat that"
Meanwhile Lou Williams doesn't even make double figures in a year
"They were going against Lou Williams and Kevin Huerter lol. The ECF after Giannis’ and Trae’s injuries were a glorified play-in matchup. Actually, those teams wouldn’t make the play-in in the West after those injuries."
If jrue and Middleton couldnt play well against the defensive backcourt of one ankle trae young and lou williams then theyd need to be sued tbh
Lou Williams.
He got that Lou Williams syndrome.
Holiday and Middleton don’t look so hot when they’re not going against the Lou Williams-Bogdanovic dynamic duo
Lol they hardly beat a a hobbled Nets with Harden on one leg and no kyrie. Then lost to a Lou Williams led Hawks team.
"First name ""DAMIAN"" - 6 letters  Damian is a named originating from GREECE - 6 letters  Damian, in American culture, was a name portrayed in the 1976 movie, *The Omen* and became somewhat notorious for being known as the son of the Devil, which is also associated with the ever-notorious ""666""  Lou Williams son is named Syx, and that is stupid"
"Yes, if the world was black and white and everyone thought exactly like you, but it's not, and they don't. Lou Williams took a fat discount to stay with the Clippers. Other players have taken discounts as well. Do you not remember the heatles? Or the warriors?"
He's not wrong.  But the tough thing for Kuzma is that his best role is to be the 2nd leading scorer on a bad team. I don't mean that as shade. His best outcome is to become a taller Jordan Clarkson/Lou Williams 6th man scoring type.
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There’s really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year’s team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."
Klay tore his ACL coming down after a tough foul then tore his Achilles in a chill pickup game just driving   Lou Williams tore his ACL on a regular layup  That Louisville guy broke his leg in two on a normal closeout  Unlucky
"Bron be averaging 2 free throw attempts per game and y’all get mad when he complains… He gets hacked just like Shaq used to but since he’s so strong the fouls don’t look as bad… I’ve seen KD, Harden, Booker, Butler, CP3, PG, Lou Williams, Trae, all get touched like LBJ does on every possession and they live at the line… Defenders are allowed to be physical with stronger offensive players…"
what all 3? I don't care what the Bucks did in the East.  And seriously dude? Acting like GORAN DRAGIC and LOU WILLIAMS and a washed up Blake Griffin were some incredible hurdles? lol the East must be softer than I thought
"No they didnt. They were more aggressive on the pick and rolls in Game 2, but it wasnt a complete change which is why in Game 3, Trae was right back to cooking them like he was in Game 1. In Game 5 they finally relented the drop coverage because Lou Williams wasnt even bothered by it in Game 4 and they started just switching more with Lopez which they normally wouldnt do but Trae wasnt in position to blow by Lopez every play anymore in Game 6 when he returned.   That's what they tried in Game 1 vs the Suns but when CP3 drew the flagrant they went back to drop coverage. Didnt work. Still tried to switch with Portis, didnt work so it was Giannis at the 5 pretty much full time as the only resort.   Personally I think switch &gt; drop because the results are pretty much the same except with less pressure at the rim especially with the lob, even though the idea is Jrue should be able to get back which he honestly has not been able to this entire postseason besides Game 2 vs the Hawks maybe. I would just make sure when Lopez switches onto CP3 he plays him to drive because CP3 is reluctant to take it to the rim and when Lopez is on Booker you have to send help and see if he'll make the right pass consistently"
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
Bruh he was getting covered by Lou Williams and a hobbled Trae in g7. Suns team defense is soo much better than Hawks it's not even worth comparing.  Jrue averaged 20/10 on 50/40 shooting next to Giannis games 1-3 against the Hawks.
"Delusional take. Likely basing it off 2 games against a shitty Hawks defense with Jrue attacking the likes of Lou Williams and hobbled Trae, getting into the paint at will."
"Lou Williams contract he signed to stay with the Clips......He could have made 10+ easily, but wanted to stay there"
The hawks are not a bad defensive team at all. They have decent to great defenders on their team. Trae and Lou williams are the only ones that are really bad.
"I think that's what most people mean, me included. 20 points on 41% shooting type, poor defense, doesn't assist or rebound well. Basically shoots a lot and doesn't impact winning the ball game  If someone like Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams was a starter, he would have scored 24 a game but get roasted alive on defense against the other team's starters"
Lou Williams
"That applies to nearly every point guard in the league now. Every all star point guard are scorers now. Even Chris Paul adapted his game to become more of a scorer. There are no put point guards anymore. If that’s your definition of a combo guard then all these players are combo guards.  A combo guard to me is a tweezer that is neither a point guard or a 2 guard. Examples would be Jason Terry, Monta Ellis, and Lou Williams. I wouldn’t put Kyrie in that discussion as he has the handles to be considered a pure point guard"
Rightly deserved it. His time at the Pacers proved that he did not receive ample support and pieces from the former GM.   Only thing left for the hawks is to resign John Collins and Lou Williams in this upcoming free agency.
Lou Williams has played in the NBA for 16 seasons and had just played 35 minutes for two games in a row.....in July.  He looked cooked at the end of game 5.  Assuming that a completely gassed Lou Will could play better than a rusty Trae is pretty silly.  There was no good option.
"A lot of those any 6th man of the year or similar type scorer guy is like this. Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, etc. Iguodala left his scoring ways but on the warriors he would always miss gimmes, but he was on fire on clutch or heavily guarded plays"
"Gallinari, Lou Williams"
Lou Williams with the extra lemon pepper in his wings.
"Did you watch game 6? He was near godlike out there, deflecting every ball near him, forcing Trae to turnovers and logo 3s, having blocks on even Galinari's fadeaways etc.   Players being guard by him in the entire series shot for 22% from the 3p line and he guarded mainly Trae, Bogdan, Lou Williams, Huerter and Galinari."
Lou Williams with the extra bounce in his step.
"I have to disagree. Hawks were destroying the drop coverage. Trae Young’s game is perfect against it, threes and floaters, and Lou Williams has similar strengths. Without the change to an all-switching defense i am sure the Bucks don’t win this series.   The bucks experimented with switching some this past regular season, and weren’t that good at it. But it was essential to be able to go to it in the post season. I give Bud credit for recognizing the need, from his last two post seasons, and planning for more flexibility."
Everyone knows Lou Williams' favorite rapper is Lil Bow Wow. [skip to 4:45 for a high school Lou Williams cameo](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=go1q-Ei_i_0)
If anyone is baby face it's Lou Williams. He will probably still look 18 when he is 50.
I agree completely. Lou Williams did well when Young was out. I guess Trae didn't want to be like Drew Bledsoe and get Tom Bradyed.
I'd assume it's because Dupri's mainly a stripclub artist lol Lou Williams is nothing if not consistent
"Man I get why Nate did it, but he should have taken Trae out in Game 4 and Game 6. Trae wasnt doing anything in either 4th quarter and Lou Williams should have closed. Hawks probably still lose but damn watching him unable to get past Lopez in the 4th was painful while Cam was trying to keep them in it"
There's no way Lou Williams and Kris Dunn play worse than that.
Trae was a liability. Lou Williams would have been better.
At least Red Velvet's a kid; Lou Williams picked fucking Jermaine Dupri over Outkast at Game 3 Sixers
Trae cant even get past Lopez. Honestly put Lou Williams out there
Still better than lou Williams
Brook Lopez and Chris Paul and Lou Williams say hi
That’s the Lou Williams Toronto fans know and don’t love
Bro Trae young is a turnover machine.  The team was good with Lou Williams starting.  Could have had young off the bench .
" They’re called stars for a reason. They’re the best at what they do.   Giannis is better than Bobby Portis.   Trae Young is better than Lou Williams.   So naturally, people will tune out more if the best players aren’t involved.   So please spare me this “you only care about stars” self-righteous crap."
"Jokic made the WCF as a young player without that special of a supporting cast, he pretty much is a clear top 10 player in terms of building a winner around imo.  If that Wolves team had LaVine and not KAT, they miss the playoffs.  Guards put up better offensive stats, stick Lou Williams next to KAT and you can replicate LaVine's play far more easily than if trying to replace KAT's production with a cheap big man.  Perhaps last season, you'd say LaVine was better, but I think in general KAT is more talented and should be better next season for obvious reasons."
"Artificial parity only in the form of injuries, who tf wants to watch a Lou Williams vs Khris Middleton ECF?"
There's no easy way to market Lou Williams vs Brook Lopez
You're not amped up to see Khris Middleton vs Lou Williams?
Kemba Walker is the most overrated player in recent years. He's garbage. We shipped off Lou Williams to get another one?
Hawks fans really thought Lou Williams was a good player? lmao he fooled yall
damn just realized lou williams and cameron payne look exactly alike i could mistake them for twins
I’ll trade you a Lou Williams bounce pass through 3 defenders.
whatever happened to lou williams.  is even playing anymore
Bring in Reddish and move Heurter to PG. Lou Williams is just walking around the court doing nothing
Lou Williams gotta get hot if the Hawks are gonna win this
"Lou Williams is having the worst night, but that's to be expected. He goes from hot to cold every other game."
"Bogdanovic is on fire, if gallinari and Lou Williams start scoring bucks are in trouble"
Lou Williams is way too casual 4 turnovers already. It’s like he’s not putting any effort into dribbling
"We need more coaches like McMillan.  Two starters  Lou Williams and Capela were playing soft, getting outworked so he benched them immediately."
Lou Williams vs kris Middleton in a duel to decide who goes to the NBA championship.
Excited for the epic Khris Middleton-Lou Williams duel that’s incoming.
"The bucks still have the best player playing tonight and Lou Williams never has 2 good games in a row. This game is super unpredictable, I wouldn’t bet a lot on it."
Because they are matchup hunting for Brunson. Rondo/KCP/LeBron did it against the Clippers to hunt Lou Williams.
I would think that would be Lou Williams.
"My dream is that the Clippers lose in the first round and decide to blow it up, and Kawhi signs with the Knicks. I don’t think it’s completely impossible, as Kawhi does seem like the type of person who could be attracted by the idea of being the guy who brings NY a championship, but I’m not holding my breath. Still, I think a starting 5 of Quickley/Barrett/Leonard/Randle/Robinson would be a serious contender for a championship, especially if we can sign a more traditional PG like Lonzo and use Quickley in a Lou Williams, offensive spark-plug 6th man role"
Lou Williams and Harrell were problems but replacing Doc with Lue removed any good done from replacing them
Has Lou Williams ever made it out of the second round?
i got downvoted yesterday for comparing him to lou williams
Did that front row fan just slap Lou Williams on the ass??
Hawks defense = really good.   Hawks offense when Lou Williams is on the court = absolute cheeks
Lou Williams is just so bad. He can't create and he doesn't have the speed or moves that Trae does to score consistently. Offense is just so much worse with him out there leading.
"Lou Williams, listen to me when I say this. You’re trash."
Lou Williams is the best NBA player to go from 23 to 6
"Bruh you got Lou Williams, relax"
"Kanter played on 3 conference finals teams in the past 5 years. It's not like he's an absolute zero.  If Lou Williams gets a rep as the worst playoffs guy just for his defense, Pat Beverly shouldn't even be on a playoff team."
I don’t know why people are so high on Herro. He’s a rail thin inefficient scorer with average athleticism. AT best he’s some kind of budget version of Lou Williams (who 50% of the time is borderline unplayable because he breaks the offense and is a defensive liability) and at worse he’s...this.
Cam looks like a failed clone of Lou Williams
I have to think Rose benefits more from an LAC Lou Williams play from the bench and finish games role at his age than a starting role
"Don't be so tough on yourself, you're right.  The Clippers these past 2 years felt like just a collection of guys rather than a team.  Each guy takes his turn to do his own thing, whether it be the superstars iso-ing by themselves, or someone else like Rat Bev taking the opposing point guard and locking him up.  They have a lot of talent and talent will win you a lot of games by itself, but because there's no cohesion, it feels like every guy does his own thing when things get tough and it makes it hard to close out games where you're not up.  They don't much have a group mentality where guys will set up others, or sacrifice their own stats to get others going.  Meanwhile, you have Kawhi as a non-leader, people distrusting PG for his bloviating, and the loud voices in the locker room not being the best players.  Last year they thought Trezz and Lou Williams and Doc Rivers were the issue, and now they're all gone.  If they lose in the first round or even the 2nd, I wonder who they will blame this time?"
Ibaka just missed time for a serious back injury. He can barely move out there and was grimacing in pain and they benched him after 5 minutes. Huge pick up lmao. Lou Williams was  playing 28 mpg and scoring 18 ppg last year. Even if he’s limited in the playoffs that’s more impactful than guys who barely even play and when they do suck ass.
"You *cannot* say enough about Thybulle's defense. Doc said after the game that he's like ""a defensive Lou Williams,"" and that's just such a perfect way to think of it. He comes in and just brings the freakin thunder. I don't even watch the ball when we're on defense -- I just look for the 22 jersey and watch him run around and shake things up.  Also... Maxey has ***The Goods***. His touch, his speed, his vision, his in-season improvement... wow, man.  Lastly, we got the Tale of Two Simmons experience so far, lol. On the one hand, he had an awesome Game 1 where he played awesome defense, got everyone involved, but just wasn't looking for his shot and missed his FTs. On the other hand, in this game, he went bonkers looking for his shot, but as a result, he only assisted on two 3pt makes (both Embiid) *^((mightve been more if Seth didn't step into long twos))*, Seth and Danny combined for 2-6 from 3 (vs. 6-13 on Sunday), and just affected the game in a completely different way.   Totally different experience when watching his game last night vs. Sunday, but to say that either one is no-doubt preferable to the other is silly. He's a unicorn, a mismatch nightmare, a playmaking savant, and is 4th in the league for playoff +/-."
"Ibaka isn’t even on the injury report from what I’ve seen, what are you basing that claim on? Also the clippers performed worse in the regular during the stretch where Ibaka actually played, so you’re argument doesn’t really hold up here either  Yes im sure defensive stopper Lou Williams would would be a much better fit over rondo on that side of the floor"
Counting rondos points is like counting Draymond Green or Ben Simmons points. Not an accurate reflection of impact. He has a 9.0 net rtg compared to lou Williams 1.3. And is a much better pg who can facilitate the offense and defend. Hes been a capable shooter there as well. There’s a reason they made the trade  You’re the only person ive ever seen who says their roster isnt better
"In terms of guys who actually fit their team, i would say yes. Rondo makes a lot more sense than Lou Williams for example"
"&gt;Here’s the thing, you’ve just listed a bunch of averages at me and no one actually shoots their average consistently, it’s like how Lebrons career average is 27/7/7 but he never records that. Shit fluctuates.  No shit. I'm not saying they hit their season averages exactly every game, but they have 5 players on their roster who hit 40% from 3 on the season. That means they're good 3 point shooters (all ranked in the top 70 of NBA players on the season), but they went 4/26. Julius Randle averaged 24 ppg this season. He had an uncharacteristically bad game 1, so it was easy to see a bounce back in game 2. That doesn't mean he's going to score exactly 24 points, but game 1 he was unlucky. He was missing shots he'd made all year.  &gt;Most of your players hit above their average last game.  I'm not a Hawks fan.  &gt;if you expect consistent from a young inexperienced team idk what to tell you.  The players I'm talking about are Gallinari, who is 32 and in his 12th NBA season. Bogdanovic, who is 28 and in his 4th NBA season. Tony Snell, who is 29 and in his 8th NBA season. Lou Williams, who is 34 and in his 16th NBA season. And John Collins, who is 23 and in his 4th NBA season."
"Yes, during the point that Lou Williams went ice cold and should have been pulled"
I think it was more Lou Williams having a bad game and not subbing him out for Trae.  I feel like that was purely on Nate McMillan
Why do the Knicks let Trae Young rest on defense?  So many possessions where he would just be standing in the corner guarding Reggie Bullock. Basically resting up and playing half a game.  Remember when LeBron attacked Lou Williams over and over again. He had KCP setting screens to get the mismatch. Randle/Rose and Bullock can do the same. Except Atlanta can't afford to sub out Trae.
I think Lou Williams thought he was still on the Clippers tonight
If I see one more Lou Williams I'm converting to Islam.
"Wait you mean to tell me that Tony Snell, Lou Williams, and a literal Muppet can't carry a team down the stretch in the playoffs?"
Playoff Lou Williams is here
Lou Williams is done as a #2 PG
Yes yes Lou “clutch” Williams for the last shot
lou williams is on the atlanta hawks??
"There's value there.  Some people don't see it, but there's value. For Chris Paul walking, the Clippers got back Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Dekker, and some G-Leaguer called Montrezl Harrell.  Felt like a bunch of random players at the time but Clippers found some value.  And at the time, the few guys the Clippers did get back didn't appear all that valuable to their current needs.  They turned out alright."
"Seeing Hunter back in shape I have a good feeling about my Hawks in 5-6 games pick for this series. Also Lou Williams is still an assassin. Clippers miss him a lot in our series. He used to torch us badly coming off the bench,"
"Kennard isn't some offensive wizard though. He's not Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford or something, where you just put him in and he's a walking bucket. He's just a 3-pt threat who stands on the other side of the court, and the Clippers have a bunch of guys who can also do that who at the same time aren't the worst defenders in the league. You've seen how badly Luka is hunting mismatches already with guys like Zubac and Beverley, now imagine he's got Luke fucking Kennard to pick on. And the only reason for the Clippers to open themselves up to such carnage defensively is so Kennard can go stand at the 3-pt line? That's a recipe for disaster."
I loved Lou Williams from his Toronto days and it was cool to see him progress with the Clips. Now he might end up going further in the playoffs with ATL than with LAC. It's a wild ride.
I guess they bet in him being a sixth man replacement for Lou Williams since he was a great shooter and good passer last season.
Yeah I definitely think that Lou Williams trade solved any lingering locker room issues!
&gt;But then I see their misremembering of Ben Wallace career and it starts to make more sense.  lmao you are still dying on this hill?  To quote you from a few days ago:  &gt;You’re comparing Ben Wallace to Melo when you should be comparing him to Lou Williams  You  lost all right to ever feel superior to any nephew on here after writing that.
"He was fine, but they miss Lou Williams in this series. He used to torch us really badly last year. Really glad he's no longer on the Clippers."
Lue takes a lot of blame. Guy you're responding to was talking about Lou Williams
"Yeah lol.  Its either him or Morris Sr.  They legit have a bad roster other than their big 2.  I'd much rather have Hardaway Jr as my 3rd or Drummond/Schroder like the Lakers have.  Or Jrue like the Bucks.  Its too late now, they thought this would be enough but its not.  Lou Williams was supposed to be that guy but we know what happened."
Not sure if Rondo was the answer but Lou Williams is totally unplayable in the playoffs. Career playoff FG % less than 40% and playoff 3PT % less than 30%. And his defense is trash.
I think people underestimated just how quickly Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly both declined. Williams isn't even on a team any more and Beverly's barking doesn't match his quality of play.
"Yeah imagine being the LA franchise that's had a winning record for 10 straight seasons (the longest active streak in the league) and several All-Stars (Blake Griffin x5, Chris Paul x5, DeAndre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard x2, Paul George) and 6MOY winners (Jamal Crawford x2, Lou Williams x2, Montrezl Harrell) ...  Yet has never made it to the conference finals and sadly plays second fiddle to the other LA team that had six straight losing seasons over the same timespan.  Just brutal."
"Barber and facial reconstruction plastic surgeon: ""What'll it be?""  Cameron Payne: ""The Lou Williams look. But don't use a photo, it has to be from memory."""
I wish they still had Lou Williams..
Don’t forget Lou Williams who’s unplayable in the postseason
i don’t blame him i blame lou williams and doc rivers
I can't believe Lou Williams would do this to the Clippers.
They should've traded Rat Bev and not Lou Williams. That scrub is a liability on offense.
Lakers fans are so mad they’re getting worked by Walmart Lou Williams
Caveman Lou Williams stole Sweet Lou's 3pt shooting like a Monstar
Payne looks like Mongloid Lou Williams
"He's like a mix between Lou Williams and the ""I'm the captain now"" guy."
Jeremy Lin hasn’t been better than Lou Williams a day in his life
"Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, and Eric Gordon and Lou Williams"
2017 Lou Williams:
Also Eric Gordon and Lou Williams lol
Haven't Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams been basically in the same boat for the past few years when they were both on the Clippers?
Yeah but Ingles is objectively better. It's like comparing Klay and Lou Williams
"Always got love for Clarkson since he started on the Lakers. I just hope he does well in the playoffs. High scoring 6th man guards tend to play awful in the playoffs like Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, etc."
Lmaoo   The Lou Williams Center for Kids Who Should Never Pass and Want to Learn to Not Pass in Clutch Moments too.
Not even close. Ingles is so much better than Clarkson it's like comparing Klay Thompson and Lou Williams
"Tooting my own team’s horn here, but to put context on how insane the Lou Williams lead comeback on golden state was, if the heat were to come back and win in the second half, they’d miss the record by three points.   Also to put that into even further context, the warriors were also healthy."
"Except Lou Williams only said ""franchise"" one time in this entire clip. Not sure why OP decided to butcher the quote in the title"
lou williams is just so cool. hes got that swag
"lou williams basketball camp day 1  ""do not pass the ball"""
Lou “Really Smart Guy” Williams
"Trae Young: *hits game winner*  Lou Williams: ""I told him to do that!"""
Step into the mind of a Lou Williams
"[Lou ""Ice in my veins"" Williams steps up in these moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWrfMY81Bbg).  Although I remember losing my shit when I saw him pull up on this shot and I had a half-second mini meltdown before it went in. Not that I thought we even had a chance in the series to begin with though"
Lou Williams
Lou Williams and Gallo are both worse defenders. I think Gallonari's feet have to weigh about 40 pounds a piece. I am a homer but I know for a fact that hes not as bad at defense as this sub makes him out to be. Hes still a bad defender but Dame is just as bad if not worse.
He’s like the outlier of recent seasons. Lou Williams and Trezz being great examples.
NBA needs to keep that same energy like they did with Lou Williams in the bubble
This particular call was one that seemed to be a regular season foul but not a playoff foul.  Go watch some of the terrible Lou Williams playoff performances of years past and see how many times he tries this and the ref’s swallow their whistles. He would get it every time during the season.
And the best part? He didn't come onto the court until the 7 minute mark of the 4th. For the last several minutes of the 3rd and up until that 7 minute mark? Lou Williams was the PG while Young sat on the bench. And then Knicks fans cried about Young like he shot 40 free throws. He shot 9 and won on a floater and they still wont shut their dumb fucking mouth about him going to the line
"I'm certain they viewed him as their Lou Williams replacement at the start of the year, but the sudden Terrance Mann emergence sort of put Kennard in a weird spot in the rotation. Mann was suddenly taking the minutes that Kennard was gonna get."
"We don’t win this game without bogi or Lou Williams, bogi been coming through all year"
He literally swung his arms into Lou Williams and got free throws and then kicked his legs out into Bogi.
"Drose, Lou Williams, Westbrook"
"westbrook, d rose, lou williams"
Lou Williams is fucking sweet!
Professional scorer Lou Williams
goddamn lou williams is cold
Lou Williams is gonna turn into a hired gun different team every year and in the playoffs every year
His favorite player is Lou Williams or Clint Capela?
Lou Williams is keeping the hawks in the game
"Lou Williams is crazy talented.  If he's a free agent, I want him on the Knicks next year."
Lol Knicks can't seem to stop Lou Williams
Lou Williams is really good to have in the playoffs
"It's the year 2050. Tom Brady still winning Super Bowls, Phil winning tournaments, and Lou Williams hitting shots."
Sweet Lou looks like the real Lou Williams again on ATL
I either forgot or didn't even know the Hawks had Lou Williams. Got to feel good having him on your squad down the stretch.
"Lou Williams keeping the Hawks in the game, just like we all expected"
I routinely forget that Lou Williams is on the Hawks.
How does Lou Williams keep getting these layup line points!
RESPECT LOU WILLIAMS
"Lou Williams is a good one. Cam's D has actually impressed me the last couple of games, you can tell he's trying super hard on D to earn more minutes.   He's also clearly been working on catch and shooting"
I guess like a Lou Williams type of player? He can score the ball. Been like that since High School. Led the EYBL in scoring his last year of AAU.   He was born to score the basketball.
"2nd round picks for essentially worthless unless you get lucky. For instance, our entire roster (that actually play) were FRP other than Lou Williams. But yeah it definitely wasn't a net positive for us"
"Damn good point Luka really abused Lou Williams, who wasn’t even on the Clippers in the playoffs last year."
dealing with draymond green vs getting switches onto lou williams and reggie jackson
CJ McCollum &amp; Colin Sexton. Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams if comparing to retired players.
6 men aren't really bought in to play defense. They are there to generate offense and points whilst the stars sit.  It's why Lou Williams was so good off the bench.
"I feel like giving Jalen Johnson minutes can't be worse than Hill and TLC getting them, honestly.   And realistically I'm not sure how giving Cooper a shot can be much worse than Delon Wright and Lou Williams have been so far this year.  That's not to say that you don't want to get your vets right by the playoffs, but these young guys have to be options too.    People love to give Thibs shit for relying too much on the starters and not liking rookies, but he played Obi and IQ big minutes last year, and when we've been missing guys this year he's had no hesitation putting Jericho Sims and Quentin Grimes into games."
"Yeah Lou Williams creates more of his offense than Ray Allen did.  Off-ball scoring is just as valuable as on-ball, if not more.  AD’s been better than Luka this season. It’s not even debatable."
"[It's real](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/28/devin-booker-suns-scoring-future-james-harden-kyrie-irving) from the end of the 18/19 season. Dude says that Booker's future is as role player like Lou Williams. (FYI, video won't load with an ad blocker on)."
"I also know that Bogdanvic and Capella who've been in the league for a while now both look massively improved now that they play with Trae. I also know that John Collins doesn't look nearly as good when he plays with Delon Wright or Lou Williams - both of whom are competent PGs. Maybe some of the credit for Trae's teammates playing so well should go to him.  All I'm saying is that everyone always says Luka is way better and has a way worse team, but every other great player with a bad team has massive on/off numbers. AD had +8.8, +9.4, and +9.7 his last three years in NOLA. KAT has +9.0, +11.2, +5.3 last three years in Minny, etc."
How many minutes is he even averaging these days? Feel like I don't see him much. I still think the Lou Williams trade was a terrible decision and they may have gotten through us last year if they had him instead.
"I'm gonna go ahead and say Lou Williams. I saw someone mention Solo Hill for Hawks too, but I think the general consensus with Lou is that he's just lost a step and isn't fit for meaningful bench minutes.   Lou does have his moments though were he's a one man scoring run and those are fun to watch. Overall though I believe the fan base would prefer that when the team is healthy, Lou sees less minutes. Awesome vet to have on the team though."
"My problem with the 6MOTY award is in recent history it almost always goes to a very specific type of player. Specifically a shooting guard bucket getter.   9 out of the last 10 have went to a SG. It’s almost always the Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson types. Not saying they weren’t deserving but what about the defensive guys, rebounders, and facilitators?"
Lol I have a feeling you don’t realize how average Lou Williams was
Herro is an average defender and certainly not close to as poor as Lou Williams was.
Herro has done nothing to be put ahead of Lou Williams. Suggesting that he's better than Lou all time is a peak homer take.
?  Herro is better than Lou Williams lol
Coby White as the off the bench volume scorer a la the Jamal Crawford/Lou Williams mold
Depending on if he hits his stride/how the team treats him moving forward I can see Cam Thomas basically being the second coming of Lou Williams
Small guys with a nice handle and score a lot = Lou Williams or CJ McCollum
"I know what you’re saying but which DRose are we talking about here? The 30-year old one right?  Pooles fast af but DRose was a generational physical freak, legit was him VS Russ in terms of explosiveness for a long time.  Poole reminds me more of Lou Williams without the foul drawing ability. He’s slippery &amp; nimble and has great touch. But he’s still not an athletic freak"
"Well that's kind of the name of the game for microwave scorer 6th men lol  If Lou Williams could have hit 5 threes and scored 25 points in 25 minutes every game then he'd have been a perennial all star, but he could only do it once every five games.  Nature of the role."
&gt; Lou Williams seems like a good over/under for Poole. His ceiling is higher I'd say.  Even if true. That's NOT a superstar ceiling.
"Plenty of players with good physical attributes never turned into plus defenders.  Jamal Crawford had the length to be a decent perimeter defender, but he had no defensive instincts and never applied himself on that end of the floor.  And so he became one of the worst defenders of all time.  Go back and look at his draft profile.  People comment on his need to add weight, which he never really did, but it's not a Lou Williams situation where his height/length put a low ceiling on his defensive potential."
Clarkson is probably at his ceiling now. He's 29. Poole is 22 and has played only about 50 decent games since he seems to have figured it out (his rookie season was garbo)  Lou Williams seems like a good over/under for Poole. His ceiling is higher I'd say.
"I don't see why it matters what year Lou Williams peaked. When Klay comes back, Poole will be the sixth man. You'd have to be delusional to think Jordan Poole is going to be top 5 or top 10 in this league. At best, he'll be a Bradley Beal type. Who almost led the league in scoring but NOBODY considers a superstar."
"No way. I love the kid but superstar puts him in a class with Steph, Durant, LeBron and Harden. His ceiling is Lou Williams when he played for the Clippers or Jamal Crawford."
Agreed. And Clarkson will never be a superstar either. Both of their ceilings are Lou Williams when he was on the Clippers.
"&gt;Harden had capela his first year starting, beverly, gordon, ariza, and ryan anderson and still lead them to a high seed.  &amp;#x200B;  flat out false. It takes legitimately 5 seconds to look at their rosters side by side. You also didnt mention Montrezl and Lou Williams. Most the role players you named, russ would have killed for lmfao. Russ was the best player in the league that year.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;f billy donovan had demar and lavine you think hed lose to the blazers/jazz?  I dont know. Would Demar score like 8 points in an elimination game like PG? Would lavine constantly underperform like melo?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You think Allen Iverson would lose  I dont..know?   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Billy Donovan doesn’t tell Russ to brick shots and turn the ball over so many times. That’s 100% on him as the leader and star of the team. You can’t coach a parked car  but he does tell russ to carry his teams with shitty spacing and get triple doubles and win like 75% of the time with them. The leader and star of the team put up great stats in wins. Whats your point? He did what he had to do"
"He added new moves and hunted fouls, that doesnt change the fact that his bread and butter was getting too the line, last year in OKC he averaged 6 FT's a game, 1st year in HOU 10.2, lowest FT's per game came in 13-14 with 9.1. Like im not saying hes a bad player, but he based his game heavily around getting too the line, and unlike most other players who done that before him (Magette, Lou williams, etc), Harden had the talent to be an elite scorer without needing to bait the refs."
The pump fake and jump into someone move was less of a Harden thing because so many of his shots are step backs. I always associate that move with Jeff Teague and Lou Williams for whatever reason.
Looks like he's finally figured out his role.  Like the RC cola version of Lou Williams off the bench.
"If he's a max player ig Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford were max caliber players too right?      There's more to the game than scoring guys. Garland is a better guy to run ur offense and the defense is gonna be too trash to start them both"
Hey it worked for Lou Williams
"No. The commentator was claiming curry is the reason the warriors value grew. I disagreed by pointing out the demographic and area the warriors played in. They grew value because of San Francisco becoming the  social media  and  tech companies preferred place.   Also the warriors haven't signed any valuable free agent except kd who liked Steve kerr ball movement.    The current core is based off draft picks and trades plus  journey man.. You've never had cap space to go and get a Lou Williams type role player .   So I don't know what players on the current warriors who aren't Journey man, drafted by them or traded for."
"Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams  CP3 for Lou Williams, Beverly and space parts"
Per Tim McMahon that trade was Harden and Fertitta's idea and Morey's disapproval led to his leaving the team. Other trades include...  Clippers got spare parts for CP3  Thunder got spare parts for Harden  Magic got Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams
"At the time, dragic wasn’t good, and he didn’t play well for Houston. Brooks was the better player at the time. Suns also got to let dragic develop under Houston and sign him for cheap. Suns probably win that trade given Houston traded away the pick for nothing.  I’d take a 28th pick over Lou Williams. Also, the Lakers were wanting to tank, so it worked well for them.  Alston went to the Magic in a three team deal, so Memphis fleeced orlando. Lowry wasn’t that much better than Alston in Houston.  The mcgrady deal was about cap relief and also, Rockets gave up fan favorite Carl Landry."
"By your logic Morey deserves no credit for acquiring CP3 and Harden which is idiotic but whatever, how about  Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry  Washed up T-Mac for Kevin Martin and a first  Aaron Brooks for Goran Dragic and a first  Corey Brewer and the 28th pick for Lou Williams"
"I mean Trae young and lou williams still exist lol.  Am aware, i watched him in OKC when he was the 6th man, he just stopped giving a fuck once he got too Houston"
"I thought Lillard was supposed to be a legit superstar, why does he seem like a glorified Lou Williams now? Sad."
"We were super dissapoinyed to lose bev, and the year before that with Lou Williams."
"Trick question, the answer is obviously Lou Williams"
It was a lot of fun I won’t lie. And very funny since 31 is a lot like 3-1. And it was Lou Williams.   Also you sure talk a lot of shit for someone who doesn’t  have a flair.
Imagine if those two teamed up and blew a 31 point lead to Lou Williams in the playoffs
I thought his ceiling was sweet lou williams but I may be wrong
lou williams didn't want any of that
"""He's Kevin Durant. You know who he is. We tried I promise we did"" - Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley.  I believe the lesson learned is they know who KD is now.    That or the power of friendship?"
"I want to know what you mean by great. Top 20? Top 30? Top 50? Top 100? Top 150?  Are we going to start calling every single solid starter a great player? Lonzo ball is great? bogdan/bojan bogdanovic are great? current gordon hayward is great?  Great has to be at least a fringe all star. You don't have to make the all star team but your name should be in the 5 or 6 ""snubs"". Like Lou williams that one year."
Lou Williams GOAT RIP
"You would think between Hunter, Capela, and to a lesser extent Reddish, they would have an ok defense. But their other players are all atrocious defensively. Trae, Collins, Bogdan, Huerter, Gallinari, Lou Williams all suck at d.   Should’ve seen Curry embarrass Huerter the other night. Targeted him every play and just kept scoring at will"
"I was happy with the results we got from him, so i wouldn’t say i was against keeping him. Coming off an ECF appearance, the last problem I thought we’d have would be coaching. But i definitely did have thoughts when we resigned him that we could do a lot better considering our talent. We need a more innovative coach. Nate can inspire, and usually runs good defensive squads, but there’s no way you trot our Trae/Collins/Bogi and don’t get 70+ points from that trio on a nightly basis. With shooters like Gallo, Huerter, and Reddish off the bench? Lou Williams doesn’t even play. Our offense should never be the problem besides those few nights a year where you can’t buy a bucket.  But what can he do when Bogi/Collins/Huerter/Gallo/Hunter hit a whopping one 3 pointer between them on 20 attempts, most WIDE open."
"Whenever KD hits his midrange I feel like that clip of Lou Williams and PB being like YO WE TRIED TO STOP HIM, YOU TELL US HOW?"
i feel like really bad is reserved for guys like trae young and lou williams. Curry is passable for a guard his size or slightly below average
"yep. He is an sg with great handles and ability to make plays.  I think like maybe Lou williams, Manu Ginboili he can have his best impact coming off the bench as a spark and creating rather than a full time pg.   Talented player"
Thought it was Lou Williams shitting on LeMao for a second.
"They’d have to have a Malcolm Brogdon style RotY, a thoroughly disappointing sophomore campaign and then break out in their third year as a 6MOtY and MIP. Then develop into an MVP/DPOY caliber player. The 10/3/4 line he won ROTY with is probably the lowest realist line, and leaves just enough space to win 6th man and MIP with something like 22/5/6 off the bench. His career would pretty much have to be if Lou Williams had a great rookie year and then also turned into Gary Payton defensively in his prime."
Malik “Lou Williams” Monk
True. Its not impressive for starting quality players to play starters minutes from the bench. Lou Williams kind of screwed up 6moty
"You can try to stop one thing with KD, but his bag is so deep you'll end up giving him something else.   I don't have the effort to link it right now, but Google the Patrick Beverly and Lou Williams interview about KD. When NBA players are looking at reporters and going, you got any ideas? That's KD"
"Lmao are you 14? Did you ever watch these players play? All 3 were bonafide All NBA talents. All 3 racked up individual accolades whether it’s all nba / all star selections or in bens case DPOYs. 2 of the 3 were in the MVP race at their peaks, and of course Ben also has a ring to go along with all of that. Tmac and Webber are top ten at their positions all time. Easily HOF worthy.  Lou Williams isn’t a fraction of how good they are. For most of his career he’s been a putrid defender while being an inefficient mid-high teens scorer off the bench. He has no accolades outside of his 6 man awards"
You mean Lou Williams***
"Is he a top 100 player of all time? No.  But is he a top *200* player of all time? Also no.  But can you write the story of the NBA without including Lou Williams?? Well... yes. Yes you can.  But *all of that said...* — if a player of note is asked if he should be in the HOF, I will never blame him for saying yes."
Lou Williams has never heard of Manu Ginobili
And that young protégée.... Lou Williams
"Silenced? Ever since he ""returned"" to the NBA he is playing like a average spot up shooter who provides zero defense, his percentages are pathetic besides the FT shooting, this is a simple fact. Still a serviceable role player who can provide 15 minutes of contribution, but nothing beyond that. If Vogel keeps forcing him as this Lou Williams kind of role, being a scorer off the bench with the green light at 38 years old, 30 minutes per game? That will backfire for sure. It would not be a problem if Melo could actually defend, also if he is ego was not so great + the unwanted attention/distraction... if he was a role player in the literal sense, ok, why not keep him around. But he brings a lot of negative aspects, it's really not worthy imo"
Why didn't Lou Williams play last night? I remember him going off as last year as a microwave scorer.
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"That’s simply not true and absolutely completely irrelevant to my argument. There’s plenty of players with insanely high fg percentages with low shot attempts as well, so it goes both ways when it comes to skewing fg percentages. Lou Williams is a career 41.1% shooter, Harden has a career 44% from the field, Trae Young is 43%. Obviously a small sample size but these guys are considered really good scorers they’re not being benched or cut."
Lou Williams man couldn’t play defence at all and his offensive game prioritized iso ball. While his game did improve after leaving Toronto his efforts on defence pretty much took away his work he did on offensive. He was abysmal during the playoffs but was upset that the raptors didn’t offer him a contract
"I think wb is fine. Point is they need a guy that'll let LBJ rest. Either wb or Lowry would've been cool for that. But then they go ahead and toss bulls legend Caruso away after getting wb or Lowry. So now it's like they're back to square one. They need someone like lou Williams or caruso. A play making bench jesus. Whether it have been lowry instead or wb or even lillard instead of the 3, they still need solid non LBJ players yet they tossed caruso."
"Watching him tonight, I like him as a Lou Williams-like 6th man. I mean that as a very high compliment."
The fact that Lou Williams is playing over Delon Wright is making me question Nate’s judgement. The reason we went out and got Delon was because we have no playmaking on our bench when Trae comes out and we’re wasting him smh
Lou Williams special
"They had a lot of talented guys, though without that Rose injury, I don’t think they would have beaten the Bulls in the 2011-2012 season.  But that roster, Lou Williams, Andre Iguodala, Jrue Holiday, Thad Young, even Elton Brand was playing a solid vet role for that team. They had just drafted Vucevic. And Evan Turner was showing some signs of being a solid guy.  I always wonder what could have been if they didn’t trade for Andrew Bynum. Another year or two and all those guys may have made a serious run in the East."
Some Rockets fans see current Lou Williams/ old man Crawford and think it’s offensive for KPJ to be compared to those guys but they were legit great players in their primes   I’m rooting for KPJ to be a star but I’m not mad if he ends up as a 6th man.
"What he's being asked to do this year if totally diff than last year.   He fits the super 6th man role a lot better as a basket getter. He can probably start in that role on teams as well, but that is his role even if he can pass more than a guy like Crawford/Lou Williams."
"Since AI. The major candidates since are Lou Williams and Jrue Holiday.  Here are their best scoring seasons on the Sixers taking both volume and efficiency into account.  **9-10 Lou Williams:**  14 ppg on 47/34/82 58%TS  One other season with 14.9 ppg but his TS was sub-50  **12-13 Jrue Holiday**  17.7 ppg on 43/37/75 50% TS  **20-21 Seth Curry (8 games)**  17.1 ppg on 61/54/85 76% TS  You could make the argument that he is a worse ""scorer"" because a lot of his shots are assisted:  **Assist rates:**  Lou 2pt% 34 3pt% 89  Jrue: 2pt% 25 3pt% 47  Curry: 2pt% 57 3pt% 86  However, I would argue his absurd efficiency still puts him over the top. I am also of the camp that moving offball is a form of shot creation. Tbf, I don't think this is sustainable over the course of the entire season. I see him dropping to somewhere to 15-16ppg on 45+% on 3s which is still absurd."

"I disagree. I watched Curry get headhunted in the playoffs a lot last year, he still played well tho. Lou Williams at one point scored 10 straight on Curry during their comeback in the playoffs"
Something something Lou Williams
"Yeah, the whole saga was such a laugh  https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/29/jack-harlow-lou-williams-clippers-magic-city-nba-bubble/"
"What do you mean plenty? In the last 10 years only Lou Williams has averaged 20 points off the bench as a 6MOTY winner and he only did it twice. In fact, since 1987 till now, it's only been done 4 times."
"No one should care, many won't because Lou Williams is rich and can't afford that life.  But don't let it fool you that people will drag others based on how many partners they have."
So wait Lou Williams has his own harem?
"Because first and foremost marriage is a moral commitment.  If people are willing to do that, and make verbal commitments to care for spouses and offspring, why would you want to prevent that?    It's truly ironic.   Lou Williams wishes he could marry 2 women and everyone treats him as a freak who's trying to abuse women into a weird polygamous marriage.  As if it'd be worse off for the children.  Yet nobody blinks when Antonio Cromartie [has 14 children with 8 separate women](https://fanbuzz.com/nfl/antonio-cromartie-kids/) and can barely remembers their names."
Lou Williams is living patrice oneals dream. Rip big fella
"100% agreed , why wouldn't he be used as a Lou Williams or Derrick Rose type of guard"
Lou Williams is that one anime harem protagonist.
He broke up with Ashley a few years ago though. https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/02/lou-williams-talks-about-breaking-up-1-of-his-2-girlfriends
Tell that to Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford.
"Abu Lou bin Williams, my Somalian akhi. Also Taylor Rooks talks seductive af in her every interview, its like she tryin to trap them with words"
Lou “Kirito” Williams
"Rozier didn't hate anyone, he was just annoyed in general because he thought he should be in the scoring sixth man role like Lou Williams but never got enough touches.  It was Morris that hated Hayward because of the favortism."
Lou Williams has never played in a bad city   Everywhere he goes is a hot spot
Lou wasn't with us long but he's a big part of the reason why our franchise is still above water after the Lob City era.  Anyone who knows or loves the game of basketball respects Lou Williams. Having a guy like Lou around after the break up helped maintain some respectability and helped us build a culture that eventually lured Kawhi and PG13 here.   He meant a lot more to the Clippers than just what he did on the court.
"Watching Basketball is supposed to be entertaining, and Lou Williams always put on a show."
"That sort of arrangement is easy to come by when you're a famous baller, and a lot of players have something similar going on, [as mentioned by him](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/01/lou-williams-clippers-legend-blake-griffin-allen-iverson-doc-rivers). Drake just happened to rap about Lou."
"I hate to break this to you but Clint Capela fucked up the Knicks in the postseason just as bad as Trae did. They were INCREDIBLY deep last year, we had no answer for it, Heurter, Gallo, Lou Williams all off the bench. We didn't lose that series because of solely Trae."
"I have a relative who used to be a high up in an NBA organization, and he said Lou Williams was a really selfish dude, on and off the court. I’m not sure if this is news, but he just cares about getting his own (allegedly)."
I think he does have star potential. Sophomore slump is a saying for a reason. And his midrange got so much better this year and his finishing got a lot better this year. The only thing that went down statistically is his 3 ball. But that was mainly due to him being put as a main ball handler. His 3 point percentage has been rocketing up recently. I don’t think it’s fair to say he’s that close to his ceiling because he did get so much better this year then last year. Especially at finishing and his midrange and getting to the rim more. I think his ceiling his 24-25 points per game 8 rebounds and 2-3 assists while being really clutch and average efficiency. And his floor being something more like Lou Williams.
"He's overrated in that people think he's going to become an all-star/good enough to be a second/third option on a championship team.  I just don't see how he gets there.   His efficiency and advanced stats almost all dropped this year. Usually ""great prospects"" don't get worse their second year.  His ceiling is ""more dynamic Seth Curry with worse-shooting."" Or ""better rebounding worse passing Lou Williams."" That's certainly a good player, that's not a ""great prospect"" though."
Can I interest you in a Lou Williams reunion tour?
I'd take him over Danny Green or Lou Williams
"Lou Williams, Marcus Morris, and a 2026 first round pick?"
"If Lou Williams and....whoever the guys on the Celitcs bench are...can get minutes in a playoff game, so can Blake."
Kobe is 85% Jordan Lillard is 90% Curry Embiid is 87% Olajuwon Derozan is 115% Lou Williams
Astonishing how similar Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams are
I thought that was Lou Williams. Lol
Lou Williams probably took Zion to get some Wings at Magic City before the game
Lots of elements to coaching. In Toronto Casey always got the players to buy in which was really important...but he was terrible at play calling. I remember one season where like every single end of quarter play was just give it to Lou Williams after he hit a few end of quarter shots at the beginning of the season and went on to miss them for the rest of the year...
"Lou Williams against the Warriors:  11-21, 25 points, 9 assusts  13-22, 36 points, 11 assists  4-11, 16 points, 4 assists  2-10, 12 points, 3 assists  12-29, 33 points, 10 assists  3-21, 8 points, 7 assists  I acknowledged in my post, he did fair well and won them two games. He had 3 great games this series and then other 3 were awful. Again this in itself is an issue if you can only have good-great games sometimes and then the rest is plagued with absolutely dreadful performances, which is what his playoff career has been like."
"Steph is bad defender and has always been a bad defender. I don’t understand why warriors fans keep dying on that hill. Like he is Lou Williams level, he just plays amazing offense and can contribute that way."
"Idk if you've seen Willie Green on the Suns bench, but like Lou Williams he hasn't aged, like at all.  Makes me feel less old."
"Oh yes, because the out of bounds call is what won us the game, not Donovan Mitchell going full 2011-12 Lou Williams."
Gets hunted in the pick and roll like he's Lou Williams in the playoffs
Are 11 2nd rounders worth enough?  u/LAClippers get:  Bradley Beal  Alex Len  u/WashWizards get:  Lou Williams  Marcus Morris Sr.  Luke Kennard  Patrick Patterson  2022 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2027 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/Oe3lbVZ00
Lou Williams played tho unless you meant someone else
Lou Williams is gonna hit an and 1 three pointer
I've always said Lou Williams is this team's closer ~Skip Bayless
That is not lou williams
So is Lou Williams washed
hey my guy remember when u proposed Terrence Mann or Kabengele with Lou Williams and a second rounder then acted like i was the asshole for pointing out how dumb that was lmao
"Also predictable when Lou Williams, Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson are playing that much. They're trying to play Terrance Mann more because he's the only bench guard who can defend."
"I get what he means when he says Lou will is a scorer and giannis isn’t. I’m not saying that Lou will is a better scorer at all, but he’s more the type of guy you think of to get you a bucket. Giannis is more of an overpowering and footwork but Lou Williams is more of a pure scorer"
"I know exactly who you're talking about. I think its Balldontstop and he actually has nba players like Arenas and Jamal Crawford follow him on twitter and IG. He overvalues skill and undervalues production. He even said Lou Williams is a scorer but Giannis isn't, he just puts the ball in the hoop."
"&gt; Kemba came back and has played like Lou Williams instead of Kemba  *was* playing like Lou Williams. He's been much better lately. Over his last 8 games he's averaging 22/5/4 on 44/40/94, and that's including a game where he went 5/21 with 1/12 from 3. That 40% 3pt% is with 9 attempts a game too. It's safe to say he's like 90% back. Still has some clunkers here and there, but he's mostly been money."
- Tatum hasn't been able to shoot since getting COVID  - Kemba came back and has played like Lou Williams instead of Kemba  - Marcus Smart has been missing for awhile now and our defense has gone to shit  - Our bench still sucks
It’d still be equally meaningless. It still penalizes Ironman players like Wilt and Iverson while rewarding 6th man type players like Lou Williams.
"I've been watching the rockets since the mid 90s, though I don't see how that matters.  The team was always structured around harden, but that doesn't mean we had washed players.  Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight (not prime, but still was a double double machine then), prime Ariza, Gordon, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Chandler parsons (who got max contracted right after his rockets stint), post NYC Jeremy Lin, Ryan Anderson when he could still move, capella, and plenty of other veteran depth signings along the way.  The players weren't trash. It just takes a ton to win, and the only year we had all the pieces was when cp3 was here."
Lou Williams and Kyle kuzma aren't even close to stars.
"Star - A **good** player / Key piece on a contender. Think Lou Williams or Kyle Kuzma  All-Star - An all-star.. pretty self explanatory. Randle, Jaylen Brown, Bam Adebayo  Superstar - Good enough to be the best player on a championship level team. LeBron, Kawhi, AD, KD, Jokic, Steph, etc."
"Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, and reggie Jackson are great for running point in the regular season for running point, but yall need a point gaurd in the playoffs"
beverly+lou williams and whatever for lowry  let's go
"Milwaukee - Bogut or Monta Ellis  Orlando - Vucevic or Oladipo  Detroit - Drummond  Clippers - Gallinari or Lou Williams  There were some solid guys on those teams too, but yeah, he's never really played with a superstar or even like a perennial All-Star."
Lou Williams would likely be included
Trade for Lou Williams
"he can be a quick offense 6th man type of guy, someone like Lou Williams, Jordan Clarkson and Jamal Crawford."
Nah he's more of a Lou Williams.
Lou Williams averaged more than that off the bench and got 3 6MOTY with no all star appearance
"The insurance is less about this season and more about moving forward.  Kennard is *currently* making 5 million to bench warm, and his 16M a year kicks next year.  Lou Williams is currently 34 years old and an expiring contract.  Kennard is literally entering his prime.  We have no idea what the team will look like next year, so taking a chance and locking up a historically great shooter when you'll be capped out the ass regardless is the right move to make.  I imagine Kennard will have his opportunities to shine again, even if it isn't this year."
I tend to think of Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams in the same terms but Lou is only 34.  I feel like they should both be 40.
he makes Lou williams look like an all NBA Defender
"That’s the point my dude, it’s easier to hide bad defenders in the regular reason. Look at what happens to Lou Williams in the playoffs. The targeting becomes so untenable they get played off the floor.  The gap in the armor doesn’t become a problem until you have Kawhi Leonard iso switching to hunt him for 4+ games straight  It’s also why the Lakers were so dominant - they had the floor of 5 great defenders out at once against other teams who didn’t"
It's just a makeup call for them allowing Lou Williams to throw a hard foul on Royce just to lay into the ref about a no-call.
"I had actually typed out “I view him as a Lou Williams type guy” but then deleted it, so it’s funny you drew the same comparison. But I really do think he could be the third guy on a great team, or the second guy on a good team. I guess we’ll just have to see."
"I guess when I hear someone say “good to great” that means he can be the 3rd scorer on a good team. To me, he is not that guy. He’s much better cast in the Lou Williams role. So maybe a dime a dozen was harsh but “good to great” is a big overstatement.  Edit: like Tobias Harris has been good to great."
"&gt;Pretty acceptable at this point that Defensive Ratings are flawed; look at the rest of the roster to confirm that. He was playing alongside Lou Williams who is one of the worst defensive guards and the only center on that roster was Zubac...  I dont see the counterfactual being offered of evidence of where he was good in the playoffs. I watched that series, even in the games they won his +/- was underneath the win margin. The game where they won by 8 he was -7. He's known as a terrible defender and it's known that bad defenders get played more easily off the floor. I don't see what the counterfactual is to either of those 2 statements.  You can shit on the stats all you want but you aren't offering any alternative evidence of him being a net positive in the playoffs  &gt;It would hurt team chemistry? They already have a solid guard and forward rotation so why would you change that and add a new player to the locker room.  Skeptical  &gt;Yeah no he most definitely wasn't severely negative at all like mentioned above the defensive ratings are super flawed not to mentioned that team went against the warriors lmao  He definitely was  &gt;Jokic is literally the one unicorn match up  Except its not, he'd be bbq chicken against Ibaka who can shoot or Embiid who would dominate him downlow. Play the Jazz where you need to put AD on Gobert and then you're going to have him defend Bogdanovic at the corner? He represents a weakness no matter what"
"&gt; While being -79 (!!) in the series overall. It's his defense that's a huge problem.  Pretty acceptable at this point that Defensive Ratings are flawed; look at the rest of the roster to confirm that. He was playing alongside Lou Williams who is one of the worst defensive guards and the only center on that roster was Zubac...  Pretty sure they went up against KD Warriors too so those games definitely skewed those defensive ratings...  &gt; No they dont, they could have better depth, why would you turn down ways to improve your team?  It would hurt team chemistry? They already have a solid guard and forward rotation so why  would you change that and add a new player to the locker room.   &gt; Literally the year before.  Yeah no he most definitely wasn't severely negative at all like mentioned above the defensive ratings are super flawed not to mentioned that team went against the warriors lmao  &gt; So it's best to keep an 8m center who can't guard Jokic. makes sense. And before you say ""but we have AD"" - then who does Harrell guard? On the perimeter? lol. He puts teams in impossible situations in the playoffs, he's not worth it.  Jokic is literally the one unicorn match up, not even AD could do a good job against him. Harrell will have matchups where is going to thrive and where he might need to play less minutes. The road to the playoffs is just as important too."
"&gt; Young is an empty stats player.   Oof  &gt; I doubt the kid ever makes it out of the first round as the number 1 option and probably would never even make the playoffs in the west.  Oooooooof  &gt;He will eventually find his niche as a Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford 6MOY type player.  Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooof  This is not it at all."
"Young is an empty stats player. I will be called a hater my whole life but I doubt the kid ever makes it out of the first round as the number 1 option and probably would never even make the playoffs in the west. You would have to build your whole team around hiding his weaknesses and he isn't transcendent enough to make that worth it. He will eventually find his niche as a Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford 6MOY type player."
Personally I think you’re heavily overrating Maxey.   Lou Williams is an expiring contract. Pat Bev is only this season and the next. It’s not like they’re incredibly long term contracts.
Bruh why tf do you want Otto porter. He has the back of a 60yr old man but has the partying ability of Lou williams and James Harden combined together.
"I mean our Big 3 just isn't as good as yours, so we'd lose 4-1. We're just the JV Clippers. Kemba has regressed to Lou Williams level. We badly need a point guard, just like the Clippers."
"It was a horrendous call at the end, but some of our guys get favorable calls too on most nights.  Kawhi and Lou Williams especially."
Lou Williams actually needs to show up for these type of games. Very reminiscent of his playoff outing. He's been playing well recently but these games just makes me want to trade him.
Dont really want Marcus morris iso'ing when Paul George and Lou Williams both on the court
*Lakers legends Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly
"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
"It’s true. We literally tried to rebuild after the Bynum trade blew up, and we got so much shit for it. We embraced sucking for draft picks because it was the only way to get good in a city with dubious attractiveness to high caliber free agents.   The NBA doesn’t incentivize being mediocre. You’re either a contender or wasting your fans’ time. Thad Young, Lou Williams, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, and Jrue Holiday weren’t going to win a championship or be bad enough to get them into position to win one. Gotta draft talent, get good and hope they stick around."
Don’t forget Rockets legends Lou Williams and Patrick Beverly on the Clippers
Needing Lou Williams to score 19 in 25 minutes is very very bad for the Clippers since he'll be hunted down and scored on at will in the playoffs.
"Actually really happy with this performance, we didn’t just lie down and accept defeat and we were able to contain the LAC stars again.      * In 4 games vs Utah for LAC, Kawhi has shot just 33/92 (35.9%) from the field. * In 3 games vs Utah for LAC, PG13 has shot just 18/56 (32.1%) from the field.  Unfortunately today, Lou Williams and Marcus Morris were able to step up for the Clippers and shoot 15/25 from the field to be the X-Factors that swung the contest. Still satisfied with how the Jazz played against great opposition. Can’t win them all and we’ll get them next time."

"#CLARKSON 19 POINTS ZERO ASSISTS TRULY A DISCIPLE OF LOU WILLIAMS, SWAGGY P, KOBE I LOVE IT"
"lol during the run where the Clippers pulled away in this game, it was from scoring by Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, and Lou Williams.   But sure, let's be lazy and pretend the only guys who hit buckets in the 4th were Paul George and Kawhi."
There was a stretch there earlier in the 4th where the clippers are set the pick with clarkson's man every time down and scored. The jazz were doing a solid job of helping him too. He's going to get the lou williams treatment come playoff time.
Probably bad that the Clippers need so much production from Lou Williams to win these games
Lou Williams got in kawhi's way
"""aint no way we're losing back to back to the same team"" -lou williams   the joke here is too easy lol"
lou williams lead the clippers in assists last year
Clarkson is a disciple of Lou Williams nick young and Kobe I’m glad he has 0 assists

Historically the 6MOTY award has gone to those one dimensional players though. Lou Williams over Iggy in 2015 for example.  6MOTY seems to be the bench gunner award rather than the best player coming off the bench.
"Yeah, it's weird to see guys like Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell win the award over guys like Iggy and Marcus Smart."
"Okay so like, that’s really disingenuous wording. He left for two weeks for undisclosed personal reasons and was spotted at his sisters birthday party.   That’s a lot different than being like James Harden or Lou Williams and showing up at strip clubs. I’d never advise or advocate anyone do what Kyrie did but the way you’re speaking on it is deliberately misleading in terms of what we know actually happened."
You’re fine haha. I mean Steph Curry finally broke out when he was 26/27. Lou Williams didn’t have his best season until 31. I’d say Kyle Lowry might fit your description the most.  Overall I feel like star players get to a high level usually around 24/25 and consistently build on that.
Imagine getting Lou Williams to guard anyone even remotely important
"Lol, also putting Lou Williams on John Wall was the precursor to CJ Miles on Love."
Trez is so terrible on defense.  I cannot even imagine having him and lou williams on the court at the same time.
"Basketball's a 48 minute game, saying that a specific quarter matters more than the others is silly, for one thing, you have to get to the 4th quarter and have the game be close, which is not always the case.   Let me put it like this, Lou Williams is an infinitely better 4th quarter scorer than Rudy Gobert. However, does that mean Lou Williams is a better player than Rudy Gobert? More impactful? No, not even close.   When evaluating players, I want the player who is the best in a 48-minute game.   Khris Middleton is a better scorer in the 4th quarter than Giannis is. Would I rather have Khris Middleton than Giannis? Fuck no. Giannis is the better player over the course of a 48-minute game, even if Middleton is the better late game offensive player."

Beverly and Lou Williams are so annoying to play against.  They played great tonight.
i completely understand why lou williams did that - hell i do that shit all the time in 2k when im pissed  can't believe that the team culture is one that allows lou will to do that though...

"Like say if the Nuggets go on a winning streak I like to think that it would be possible for a guy like Jamychal Green to get more votes then Lou Williams who has been bad all year but who is the ""6th man archetype"".  Clarkson is VERY VERY good at that, like Lou was 2 years ago when he won it so I have no problem with those guys winning it, but when it's debatable I like the voters to reward who the actual best player is and not just look at ""points per game"""
"He's better defensively than Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams by a huge margin, not that he's good, but at least tries, hence why I said that he's at least ""good"" unlike Crawford when he last won that award. And unlike in recent years there doesn't seem to be a ""low key great role player who doesn't score at all"" ala George Hill/Kleber/Justin Holiday last year. I was talking more generally about the award, this year without digging too much into it Clarkson seem pretty far above the rest"
Lou Williams
Damn! Didn’t know Lou Williams could pass like that.
I'm surprised Lou Williams or maybe Jamal Crawford didn't get close to this sooner
You're putting a lot of pressure on 34 year old Lou Williams
Terance Mann Marcus Morris Sr.  Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Lou Williams  Jimmy Butler Kelly Olynyk Bam Adebayo Duncan Robinson Kendrick Nunn   Starting lineups   Lmao
"Because of coaching and underpreforming players. We Sabonis being a spot up big and Victor Oladipo was playing like he plays now but worse. Those where the other two options on that team. People don't understand how fucking terrible that shit was. Also Hardens advanced stats where also good but the triple double counts, russ completed some shit people never thought could ever happen again period that counts for something. Harden had some pretty decent guys on that roster looking back too that where performing. Capelam Dekker, Montrezl, Ariza, Ryan Andersons last good year, Lou Williams etc.  People just read off Houston fanboy arguments and don't look at the context. We dead ass had Oladipo and Sabonis as spot up shooters  next to Steven Adams and Roberson and Billy Donovans trash ass not knowing what to do."
"Its not about skills as much as durability and scoring consistency (not efficiency). Wiggins could end his career with +40,000 min and +20,000 points. He is average. Good player to have on your team as 3-5 option, and I can totally see him having Lou Williams trajectory by becoming multiple times 6th man as he age."
There is no circumstance where Lou Williams and Deandre Jordan should come close to the hall of fame.
"Kyle Korver should not be in the hall of fame. He averaged 10/3/2 for his career and only made one all star game. Never won anything. Same goes for Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford, those dudes are just 2nd unit chuckers.  Iggy, Gobert aren't controversial."
I know he was marketed as a point guard during his draft but it really seems like he's more of a Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player.
"I could actually see that.  AKME wants to build a roster of two way players.  Coby is a talented scorer in the Lou Williams mode, but he's a very poor defender and is not a point guard (regardless of how he is listed or advertised).  While I still think he could be a good microwave scorer for us off the bench, I also could see him being moved for a reserve PF/C."
Well of course there will be more clips of people scoring on him because he is good defender so scoring on him as different weight than scoring on Lou Williams l.
You can close the game with both of them (like Lou Williams on the Clippers) but they shouldn’t be there beginning of the game. I admit i was being a little hyperbolic.
"Empty calories scoring, like Lou Williams"

Not since Lou Williams and Nick Young were on the team
"I'm actually watching a YouTube video on foul baiting. Since 3 point shooting fouls were tracked in 2000, the 2nd place players are Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams tied at 249. First place is James Harden at 521."
Nah Lou Williams was like the most prominent sixth man in his prine.
Ahh the Lou Williams/Kevin Willis special.
"Ja Morant, Doncic, and Sweet Lou Williams."
Feel like he can easily end up as a Lou Williams type of player coming off the bench. Really really hyped about Nwora
"The Harden Rockets were really the only team to reach that extreme. CP3 went from about 30% of his shots coming from 15 feet-the three point line to 10% after he joined the Rockets, and he and Harden were really the only ones that ever took them. I remember Lou Williams being admonished for taking one after he crossed someone over and got an open shot"
Thuggish behavior so glad we traded him for an upstanding citizen like Lou Williams
Forbes and Lou Will are comparable? Williams makes 4X what Forbes does for a reason.
The drop-off from DiVincenzo to Bryn Forbes (the Buck's #8 in post season MPG) is about as high as the drop off from Hunter to Lou Williams (8th in Hawks post season MPG).  The Hawks have a deep team.
"Hunter would’ve helped Huerter on defense, plus Reddish + Hunter always keeps the opposing team on their toes. They have depth but Hunters attributes are more suited for the playoffs than a guy like Lou Williams, Huerter, or Okongwu. Also he averages more than all of those guys."
"Lies.  Gallo can come off the books which will free up 15Mil.  Delon Wright comes off too, that's another 15 Mil.  Lou Williams is 9.5 Mil that comes off.  All of those contracts equal up to 15+15+10=45 Mil.  I don't think Reddish and Hunter will get max contracts.  If you give them both 25 Mil each, its workable.  The lux cap is near 150, they fit, if only barely.  Don't forget that even if they sign next year, they aren't on the books til 23-24.  By then, Bogi will be in his last yr clearing the way for Okungwu's contract."
"Neal/Dinwiddie is not better than Young/Bogdanovic lol. Not to mention the hawks have Huerter, Delon Wright, and Lou Williams off the bench"
"Lou Williams, Gallonari and Okungwo didn’t play either."
Hawks were missing Lou Williams and Gallinari.
"Hawks aren't even playing Gallinari and Lou Williams (injuries?), these guys deep af."
"I agree Dame's late game shots paint too much of an image, but in Dame's prime his best teammates have been a glorified Lou Williams and a hobbled slow center who can't make a layup (and he wasn't even in the 2019 run). If Dame was on those Pacers or Boston teams - or even the 05' Sonics team - he'd have just as much success, if not more IMO. Those guys were pioneers for their time but Dame is also just a more complete offensive player than either when it comes to scoring and passing. Also Ray only reached Dame's level of efficiency when he was on those stacked Boston teams where he was the third option.   However I'll admit that Allen was obviously a better defender"
Lou Williams
Sexton should be coming off the bench with Rubio.  Then all he has to do is focus on getting buckets.  The Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson role would fit him well.
"you clearly haven't watched him play - yes, he can score - but that's literally about it - he doesn't understand the concept of team basketball on offense, period - shoots when he should pass, passes when he should shoot, routinely misses open guys - and frankly, the rest of the team is way too passive when he's on the court and often leaves the scoring up to him.  He's Lou Williams at best on a very good team and can't be the lead guy on a legit contending team, period.  I have to believe they are looking to move him instead of paying him."
"Ben is such a brat. Pouting as if he’s not the reason for the demise of the Sixers. This dude is a multiple all star/ all defensive player and got outplayed by Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and John Collins down the stretch. They ask him to work on his game and he gets offended and quits on his team smh. The entitlement is insane man."
Lou Williams
you mean the second coming of Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford? No sir we won't
"His contract meant he had big expectations that he couldn’t meet. On his current contract he’s a valuable player but wouldn’t be surprised if DRose ends up starting over him at some point. Currently I think his best role would be a Lou Williams 6th man type role for like 25min a game.   He’s a defensive liability so to be valuable his offense  or teammates have to carry his defensive short comings. Offensively he’s not very efficient and struggled to get to the rim leading to difficult mid range shots. He’s an solid 3 point shooter, okay playmaker who can create his own shot and a great lockeroom presence. Injuries also really exacerbated everything.  Best way I can put it is I remember thinking we just need 80% of prime Kemba and we’d be set. Turns out 80% of prime Kemba is an inefficient 19ppg player with terrible defense."
"The Hawks are ridiculously deep. They have players like Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and Danilo Gallinari off the bench who would get quality/starter mins and usage on some other teams. I’m not even including everyone’s favorite prospect Cam Reddish."
"Last year he averaged all of 6 passes per game less than Darius Garland, who not a single soul would say is a ball hog.  I think Cavs fans just don't like that we roll out 2 small guards as a starting backcourt and see Garland as a ""true PG"" while Sexton is a tweener. Feels like ever since Garland was drafted Sexton was destined to be a 6th man in a lot of fans eyes, a la Lou Williams. But all he has done since Garland was drafted is improve his scoring and efficiency every season and improved his playmaking for teammates."
"The con to that is that his D is a liability.  But I'm not sweating that - I picture us using him off the bench in a Lou Williams type role, which sounds fantastic to me."
"I mean even if he is a better version of lou williams, that would still be a great career..but not a superstar. Lets let him win a most improved, then an all star team…then go from there lol"
Some people just have more talent than others.   Wasn't it Lou Williams who said he never practices or trains during the off season or something and he's still collecting checks until he's in his 30s
In the perfect situation he would be a Lou Williams type off the bench microwave scorer.
The sad thing is he was still better than Rondo before the Lou Williams trade.

"Save for one blowout each, Toronto Philly was a defensive series. Kawhi was pretty much the only Raptor who was able to score consistently. That was matched by Embiid and Butler on the other end. Embiid was struggling with a sickness during the series but Philly were a net positive with him on the floor and lost the minutes with him off it. JJ Reddick was the weak link defensively for Philly and he was hunted whenever he was on the floor.   Trey Young is a more dynamic offensive player than anyone on that Raptors team and that Philly team was better. Trey’s ability to get anywhere on the floor with his dribble, his use of screens and the cat and mouse game he plays between throwing the lob and using the floater asked a lot of Philly’s defense.   With that said this series was there for Philly to take. Doc Rivers yet again oversaw a huge fourth quarter collapse where Simmons passiveness on offense allowed Atlanta to play Trey Young and Lou Williams in the back court for an extended stretch.   Against the 2019 Philly team the Embiid Reddick hand off is destroying that and so is Jimmy just straight up bullying them.  Simmons held up defensively and did well on Kawhi he was ok on offense, scoring in double digits but his assist to turnover ratio was poor and he didn’t do much but stand in the dunker’s spot on offense in the half court."
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
we need to talk about him reaching lou williams level first lmao
"I know im a hawks fan but I think we might take the cake.  Our 2nd unit will be some combo of:  PG: Delon Wright/lou Williams  SG: Kevin huerter  SF: Cam Reddish  PF: Gallo  C: OO/Gorgui Deing  Then we have Jalen johnson, Solomon hill and sharife cooper to back those guys up"
Lou Williams isn’t just a small guy and he said he wears a medium.
"you’re missing the point and getting hyper focused on something that doesn’t matter. you’re also conflating his scoring prowess with 2 preseason performances and short flashes last year. it’s way too early to be making this comparison. y’all are comparing him to WB but we need to start by talking about whether hell even sniff a career like lou williams or jason terry. this isn’t a knock on him, it’s just y’all took one performance and compared him to someone who has multiple first team all nbas and an MvP, which describes like 15 players in history"
"When you say this, my mind immediately goes to Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams, but I know I am being a bit disrespectful to those guys as they were decent/good passers along with their scoring."
Lou Williams got sent to his hometown that's different
"I don’t know, Lou Williams said he’d retire if the Clippers trade him. Now he signed an extension with the Hawks and is happy there."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Kinda the more likely thing. Sixers would yell luuuuuuu for lou Williams, when I was younger though I’d wonder why we boo’d our own guys lol"
Lou Williams got to go to Atlanta and home to Magic city. If Lou was traded to Minnesota or Sacramento then maybe he does contemplate retirement
"Lou Williams said the same thing when he was with the Clippers. Granted, he's less dramatic than Kyrie, but these players flip their minds more than a mcdonalds cook"
"From what I could find, it seems like Nick Wright said he said it with no confirmation from Kyrie. Obviously very different situation, but Lou Williams for sure said it when he was on the Clippers"
Lou Williams almost did it. Front threatened it in nfl. I assume the cba covers it if someone is way less lazy than me.
"I feel like people will lose intrest in him if he's career goes nowhere. Like no rings, mvp, scoring titles, all nba etc  he'd be more like a lou williams were he's generally liked and talked about but nowhere near the current intrest everybody has on what he says and does"
believe me the talent level and experience is still there. they know their roles and are better 4th and 5th options than coby white or lou williams
"The Gallo/Tobias Harris Clippers perfectly show this. He took a tea with no true top tier talent to 48 wins in the West and took Golden State to 6.   No disrepect to Gallo, Tobi, Lou Williams or Montrezl, but they aren't exactly top 20 players in the league. Doc really overachieved with them."
didnt Lou Williams also say he'd retire if the Clips traded him?
"It's not that his teammates were bad - it was more that we just didn't have a real backup PG all year.  Rondo was awful even when healthy (which was rare), Lou Williams had his moments but isn't really a PG at this point, and then you had some G-League caliber guys filling in the gaps.    We're a deep team, to varying degrees last year with all the injuries, but we basically just didn't have a backup PG for pretty much the whole season so it was kind of just a series of Gallo ISO's when Trae went out."
Well when it’s not him it’s like Lou Williams?  Trae is so good he makes the offense sky high but they drop a lot due to him not having a good backup
"Play-in at the minimum. They have a nice starting 5 with what looks like D-Lo, Edwards, Towns, Okogie and McDaniels. Also having Naz Reid, Pat Bev and Beasley as a potential Lou Williams type off the bench is a plus as well. If Russell and Towns can both remain relatively healthy together then I really like this team, but that seems to have been their Achilles heal lately."
"Yeah, I view his ceiling is a Caris Levert type (maybe more consistent/less injury prone).   However I don’t really view him as a high level starter to be honest. I think a realistic projection for him would be more the Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Jordan Clarkson type role as a spark plug bench scorer.   He could probably be a starter on some teams (bad/lotto teams), but ideally on a good team his role would be a 6th man type role as a bench spark plug.   Who knows though, the guy was a high ceiling prospect who has improved every year so far. So it wouldn’t be too surprising to me for him to beat my expectations. Easily the best draft pick the Warriors made since they won a ring."
"For a team desperately lacking scoring and shooting outside of Steph (until Klay comes back), Poole provides that.   He can create and shoot off the dribble, the only player on the team besides Steph who can put pressure at the rim (though he needs to get stronger to be a consistent finisher through contact).   He’s basically a 6MOY, Lou Williams/Jordan Clarkson type player right now who can get you 30pts when he’s hitting his 3’s like he was yesterday.  But he needs to bulk up and significantly improve his defense if he’s going to be anything more than a microwave bench scorer.   We over hype him because everyone says he’s the hardest worker on the team and you can see it with how much he’s improved IN SEASON. He was a 19yr old late 1st round pick who’s made huge improvements in his 1st two years.   He also is learning and mimicking Steph. His ability to shoot off the dribble, specifically his step back 3 plus his off ball movement.   Between Poole, Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman - there’s a lot to be excited about and we just need one or two of these guys to pop if we want to prolong the core’s window."
"Sweet Lou Williams.      When he's hot he's hot, and when he's not, he's not."
Lou williams/C.J mccollum type player
"Disagree about him looking more shifty &amp; explosive.  Agree about the PnR passing but I feel like he was already pretty good at that. He had some impressive skip passes &amp; cross body passes last year. It did look better last night tho youre right  The inbetween game was basic stuff and it was usually with Lou Williams on his hip, which isnt very hard to do considering how bad of a defender Lou is and how old he is. If Herro can consistently do that against good defenders then itll be an improvement over last season"
Lou Williams is a tier above Jamal Crawford imo. Crawford could only play a 6th man role and was a more inefficient volume scorer. Lou Williams developed some legitimate playmaking skills and was a better shooter. You could have him run an offense.
lou williams/ jamal crawford
"Where would you put the likes of Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams, then?"
"You're looking at a guy who can compete for 6th man of the year, and fill that Lou Williams type of role. Solid guy to have on your team, but he's not a 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd option on a team that is contending."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
He fits in more of a 6th man role for a championship team like Jason Terry. He's a slightly better version of Lou Williams and is somehow being paid 30+ million for the forseeable future.
Lou Williams
"Lou Williams type of players is pretty valuable tho,there is a reason he was 6th man of the year"
"Or it's not nitpicky and a bucket getter with deficiencies in every other part of his game has a very specific path to being high value.  You are basically either a Lou Williams/Jamal Crawford guy, which isn't that valuable, or you're efficient enough to be one of the main guys. And then there's the outcome where you don't hit the bare minimum efficiency and you're just completely useless.  Teams usually want prospects with a wider array of success cases."
He'll likely have a career like Lou Williams or Clarkson if his defense doesn't improve
Fav:  Lou Williams for dating two women at the same time.   Least: Kemba Walker because he smiles too much on the court.  &amp;#x200B;  Not very good reasons i know
"It’s about time. Only thing I would have added:   The Lou Williams foul. Driving to the rim, leaning into the defender and drawing a foul. We’ll see if that’s considered abnormal enough"
"His problem was he was on an upward trajectory in his first two years and then the Lakers brought in AD and it wildly changed what the Lakers were looking for from Kuzma. He never settled in to just being a scorer off the bench like Lou Williams or Jordan Clarkson. He flourished as a starter who was counted on to score a lot, and maybe he'll get that chance again in Washington. But if he's destined to be a bench player forever then I don't think he'll realistically improve from where he is right now. Not unless he makes a major leap forward as an outside shooter."
Are you going to ignore the Bucks lost to the Hawks with Trae Young out and Lou Williams as their starting point guard?  With Giannis playing 3/4 of the game?  The Bucks are a good team but certainly not a powerhouse.  Lillard and Embiid is probably a top 3 duo at the least and I’d put them above the Bucks
"No, it was 5 years of dogshit basketball, even if they were only at rock bottom for 3.  They lost Iggy, Brand, and Lou Williams all in the same offseason and did nothing to replace them - the full intention there was to get young and suck for a draft pick.  Then the following year they decided to just go all-in and dumped Jrue (and eventually Turner).  That lead to 3 years of 15 win teams.  The 5th year was an earnest byproduct of ""the process"" as Embiid wasn't healthy yet and Simmons had to sit.  All in it was 5 hopeless years.  And it's lead to a couple of second round exits and now we stand with Embiid for 60 games a year as the only remaining piece of the process.  The process was a bust.  There were plenty of other paths to second round exits and halfway decent teams that didn't require 5 bad years to get there.  People will whine about Hinkie would've done better, but that's more just romanticizing Hinkie than any real proof he would have."
Pelinka's first trade was to get a 1st rounder. We traded Lou Williams for a first. We traded Clarkson and Nance for assets. Etc. Are you really interested in minutia of what Pelinka did before LeBron got there?
Ask Lou Williams. He might know.
Lou Williams and a stripper from Magic City.
Lou Williams I’ve always liked his game and he’s probably the only non star player I really like and follow
"Who he is is a weak ass 7'4"" player who can't post up Lou Williams."
He's often been compared to a Lou Williams while he was with us so that makes sense.
"Like I said, 1v1 on the perimeter he's elite. He's not the guy to take a team to another level. That's actually a great example.  The Sixers only scored 19 points in the 4th and Lou Williams had 13 for the hawks. Holding Trae to 13 (that's not a huge quarter for Trae by any stretch) and forcing someone else to beat them wasn't ""bad"", and is more than most could do.  The problem was the team defense and lack of scoring. Even though they couldn't put the ball in the basket if they as a team held Lou to 6, 8, 10 they win or tie. Ben can guard a (singular) guy at a high level. He doesn't make a team great defensively on his own."
Lakers (guessing their starting 5)  Russell Westbrook (Rajon Rondo) Malik Monk (Lou Williams) LeBron James (Magic Johnson)  Anthony Davis (Kevin Garnett)  Dwight Howard (N/A)
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
"If you wanna argue semantics then I’ll clarify “big FA market” and my argument still applies.  The Knicks had nothing to do with their market. The Knicks weren’t good, and the few years they were good they didn’t have cap. That has nothing to do with market, that’s players not wanting to sign a lottery team. Teams like Toronto on the other hand, large basketball market, doesn’t attract players even when they are good. They’ve targeted many FAs over the years and routinely strike out, and players they get via trade or draft often want out purely because it’s Toronto, such as Lou Williams and Vince Carter"
He honestly could be. He was just such a solid guy off the bench. Extraordinary player. Sort of the Lou Williams of the NBA.
No way you sign crawford this team needs defense not lou williams type players
"nah Shake is a much better shooter than Lou Williams, he's a great 6th man true but a different kind of scorer"
Shouldn’t he be more expendable in a trade then? I’ve heard Shake has been playing well and kinda sliding into that “Lou Williams” role
I'd say Lou Williams
"&gt; This idea of mitigating risk is nonsense, the league does not care about players contracting covid, if it did they wouldn’t allow them to play at all under these circumstances. They just care about minimizing as much as possible to make the most amount of money in the time frame this works.  The whole point is the players don’t actually care about the risk that much either they also want to play and get paid. Which if you are going to have the games you do what you can where possible to mitigate spread it’s literally in everybody’s best interest to avoid spread for the sake of being able to play all the games and have the closest thing to a normal season as possible. It’s such a false equivalency of “well we don’t take this other precautionary measure so that must demand we take zero precautionary measures at all”   &gt; Them not being able to see their families isn’t actually for the benefit of anyone  They have the option of seeing their family and quarantining upon return if they want. Nobody is stopping them even in the bubble nobody stopped Lou Williams from leaving when that’s what he wanted to do. Actions have consequences the virus spreads no differently if a player believes seeing their family is so important for their mental well being missing 3-5 games upon return isn’t exactly some big price to pay"
Lou Williams. He from my hometown and showed love when I went to Clippers game
"Magical freedom to walk away?  It is called the millions George Hill has already made.  If he cared about getting Coronavirus he would be saying yo team wear your masks always.  Social distance on the bench.  Lets do our part.  Like every healthcare worker at work does throughout the USA.  He doesn’t need those millions of dollars.  He is rich as fuck already.   His one game salary is more than most healthcare workers make in a year, who ironicially are the ones who can’t just walk away.  Because they need that 50k to keep the lights on.  To put food on the table for their kids. To have a roof even.   His millions, what is he walking away from?  Some new cars?  More money in his retirement account?  Another house?  James Harden and Lou Williams strip club visits?"
"Jordan Clarkson gets my vote so far. He is a walking bucket much like Lou Williams. Doesn't give you much on defense but his offensive game is so good your team gets that spark.  Just also want to mention Bobby Portis on the Bucks. Not going to win it this year, but he's bought into the system and playing really well."
"My 3 part plan:   1. Stop rescheduling games if a team doesn't have enough players.  Start handing out some forfeits if you can't get your shit under control.  1. Make owners give 1/72nd of their share of the league media contract to the team they forfeited to.  This hits owners in the pocketbook if they aren't doing everything they can to get these guys into a mini-bubble.  There's zero reason every team isn't buying out the closest hotel to their home arena and delivering 5-star meals to them every day.  Guys were fine being around each other in the bubble because nobody (outside Lou Williams) was going to restaurants/clubs/strippers.    1. If a team forfeits, the players on the forfeiting team forfeit that game check.  Now they're ready to police themselves.  The Nets players would tell Kyrie to gtfo and not come back if he started costing them money.  That applies pressure to get the players to not let down the rest of their teammates.  And it makes players a hell of a lot more careful than a lot of them are being currently."
Lou Williams?
Thought it was Lou Williams randomly deciding to shit on Aron Baynes and Alex Len for a second lol
Reverse Lou Williams again
"For real. Gobert still gets blasted regularly for it but this was before just about *anyone* in the states actually took it serious, meanwhile people like Harden, Lou Williams, and Kylie get some flack for a few days and then people forget about it. What Gobert did was dumb but now we’re living in a time where there’s a lot more COVID going around and literally everyone should know better by now."
Kyrie to the clippers for Lou Williams and way off P tell me I’m crazy
"Their bench lacks anyone that can run an offense. And it’s weak defensively, especially when Kennard and Lou Williams are on at the same time. The key for them is Kennard. And he has been pretty bad. Averaging 8ppg and 1.6 apg. Last year might have been a fluke. Or maybe his knee issue will plague him for the rest of his career. Or maybe he’s just trying to figure out his role still.  I can’t believe they gave him $16 million a year."
"Not to mention the place literally has a grubhub option so if he really just wanted the wings he could’ve had them delivered or something. And even if they didn’t, I’m more than positive they’d make an exception if Lou Williams (who they’ve named a flavor after) called and was like “hey, can y’all deliver some wings? I can’t break protocol”"
"Because two things are happening.   The Clipper optimists discount this and say PG and Kawhi are both good defenders and they'll step up during the playoffs. Which could be true but the regular season isn't gonna prove or disprove that.  The Clipper pessimists don't care about this stat because they were proved right in the playoffs and assume they'll continue to be proved right. This stat backs them up, but the 3-1 loss and the 50 point loss are much more compelling for their argument.  That is why no one is talking about their defense. In reality they're a basketball team not a hypothetical entity for debate club. The defense is worrisome.   Ibaka doesn't look as quick footed that he did even a year earlier. Kawhi's defense was wildly inconsistent all of last year including the playoffs. PG13 is still a good defender but he hasn't been All-Defense level for a few years now. Pat Bev has fallen off. Zubac can rim protect but he has holes that can be picked apart. Lou Williams has been an abomination since he entered the league on that end. And the comeback of Nick Batum is pretty insignificant."
theres a difference between shaq/lebron (or giannis) lowering their shoulder and a ref having to decide whether that is a foul or just allowable contact and harden or trae young or lou williams or dame playing the game with the intention of running into people or hooking them to get fouls
"Hadn’t PG and Kawhi joined the Clippers, Lou Williams would have had a shot at this imo"
"Automatic buckets, guys like Jordan Clarkson, Kyrie Irving, Lou Williams, Kevin Durant etc who can create their own shot consistently and just score from literally anywhere on the court in a great variety of ways."
"The haters needed to go somewhere so they went to Brad.   Quite frankly, Brad was solid.   I think they just got jealous of Lou Williams and decided to crap on the dude"
Lou Williams
We got the win and Kawhi didn't suffer a terrible injury at the end.  Nice bounce back game from Lou Williams in a game where defense was irrelevant.
If a prime Michael Jordan had been playing tonight he would’ve been the 3rd best SG on the court after Zach LaVine and Lou Williams in that order
"Wow, what a game. Just fun basketball. Both teams repeatedly answering each other with threes was awesome. Saw some small mistakes by the Bulls that I think lost them the game (the White turnover in the last minutes was particularly painful). But that's expected in such a young team. They honestly feel just a piece or two away from being real contenders. Will be interested to see how they develop.   In other news, all Kawhi needed to unleash his full potential was to remove the mask. Like reverse Batman. Also nice to see Lou Williams start to get his groove back."
lou williams
I know Harden is the guy everyone talks about regarding foul hunting but man Lou Williams is absolutely unwatchable for me. His entire game is leaning in and getting fouls. At least Harden has the step back 3
"Gross, Lou jumped into Williams pretty blatantly"
"Trusting 500 players to not be dumb fucks is a tall task. We've already seen multiple episodes of stupidity (e.g. James Harden at clubs, Lou Williams mourning the loss of a loved one at a strip club, Danuel House trying to get laid). That being said, I doubt they cancel the season unless like 1/4 of the league is infected in quick succession."
"Steroid Bonds was the greatest hitter in baseball history. Better than babe ruth, lou gehrig, ted williams and any other all time greats."
Giannis did choke these past two years. But if your argument for Harden not choking is that Lou Williams had a bad series you're making a really weak argument.

"2nd round picks have *extremely* limited trade value, so I wouldn't expect them to fetch very much. And Lou Williams' contract is expiring, but who is looking to free up a bunch of space next summer? All the best free agents (other than Kawhi) are already re-signed and won't be available. And on top of that, a bunch of teams had already set aside cap space to try to go after Giannis, so their cap sheets are clean anyway.   Lou Williams is an old player who looks like he's washed, so if all the Clippers have to offer is some 2nd round picks and $9 million cap space, that's really not much. I wouldn't expect teams to give up the kind of valuable players that can add to a title run for only that. Those types of players who would be available in trades will almost surely be had for better offers than just that. I mean, look what it took the Clippers to get Marcus Morris last year. No way the Knicks would have traded him for some 2nd round picks and cap space. They wanted that 1st round pick."
"&gt; Creates $9-10 mil in cap space for OKC in 2021  Do you think OKC is targeting this summer to make a big free agent splash? Cause I don't. I think they're looking at drafting well and will probably target some time down the road for that. But even if that was the case, George Hill's contract for next year only has about $1 million of it guaranteed. So getting Lou Williams doesn't really offer much allure for the Thunder.  I wouldn't be surprised to see some contender offer a late 1st round pick for George Hill. Boston, Philly or possibly the Raptors could be in the market for additional point guard help this year and could offer a much better trade package than Lou Williams and a 2nd round pick for him."
&gt; I doubt Lou Williams is going to look so bad for the whole season  Keep in mind Lou Williams is 34. He's probably not going to improve going forward.
&gt; they got a bunch of scorers  Who are they? Lou Williams and who else?
"&gt; Lou Williams/George Hill fake trade needs to happen  I really don't see how the Clippers can get George Hill considering they don't have a 1st round pick to offer. What would the Thunder want 34 year old Lou Williams on an expiring contract for? He does nothing for them going forward, and some 2nd round pick isn't going to have much appeal for them either. I feel like some team out there is eventually going to offer the Thunder a 1st for George Hill. There's other teams with playoff aspirations who could use a point guard who have a 1st to offer."
People forget but Lou Williams is 34 years old. Father Time catches up with everyone.
"I think Patrick Bev and Lou Williams are overrated, and would take Caruso over them any day."
"I've never looked at the numbers but I'm not sure he was ever not a negative, at least in a playoff scenario.   He's definitely a defensive liability and a gifted offensive player. That being said, he needs the ball in his hands. I'm not sure letting Lou Williams run your offense has ever worked. There's usually better ways to run an offense."
"I think people are overreacting a little bit. Marcus Morris has missed a lot of games and that's one of the reason why their bench looked so bad. I doubt Lou Williams is going to look so bad for the whole season, and Luke Kennard will improve and look better when the bench is doing better.  Overall, when playoffs come they have their 3-4 main guys off the bench. Zubac, Morris, Kennard and Williams, and you don't need more. The only player with a question mark is Lou Williams. He's 34 and this may be the year where age catches up with him."
If it wasnt for that unfortunate ACL tear I think he could at least be a Lou Williams type of player as of right now.
Lou Will needs a lot of touches because he can’t really do anything outside of that except spot up shooting but his defense is so bad that if all you are getting is that shooting then he’s a big minus. Clippers keep adding a bunch of scorers on the team that aren’t great passers and don’t do much without the ball like Jackson Morris and Kennard which is less than ideal for getting the most out of Williams
"Lou Williams, Terrance Mann, and Daniel Oturo"
Luke Kennard also isnt ready for the role they are going ot ultimately want him to take as a guy they gave $64 mil to.   Lou Williams/George Hill fake trade needs to happen. Zubac has been dust this year also although I have some faith he can turn it around
Lou Williams is so fucking bad
"There's nothing embarrassing about a superstar NBA player going off on you,   that's some lame reddit narrative building to say otherwise. I'll always respect a guy that takes the challenge and clearly gets after it.   Bev did pretty well for 3 quarters; Curry started going off when they took Bev off and had Lou Williams in the game.  He was able to find a bit more space when that happened then he was getting before."
"Ive watched this in slow motion no less than 10 times and its even more incredible when you realize that lou williams was about 0.2 seconds away from swatting that ball away. If he had reacted a bit sooner or if curry had cut a little slower or his side step was a bit smaller, it would’ve been a block, but knowing curry it wasn’t just coincidence it all worked out."
Lou Williams has gone to the bathroom
Has lou williams been good at all this season? The last two games against the Warriors he was completely nonexistent. Seems like his game isn't as good without Harrell.
"If you’re gonna place any blame on the Clippers it should go to Tye Lue. Didn’t use any timeouts during the run, kept Ibaka and George off the floor too long, keeps playing Lou Williams and Zubac too long despite them getting killed on defense and not bringing offense to offset it"
"Lou Williams is one of the worst defenders in the league and is a undersized 2 guard most effective offensively against bench units. Reggie Jackson is also an undersized 2 guard who isn't that great on offense who's only a good catch and shoot three point shooter and is a subpar defender. Gary Harris is still better than both of them, Harris is one of the best guard defenders in the league and can still at least finish at the rim offensively even though he can't shoot like Lou or Jackson."
Why can’t lou Williams score anymore?
Lou Williams and Reggie Jackson are not starter level players in the league loool
Who we blaming? Lou Williams?
What can he get back though realistically because there isn’t a pick to attach to him to trade with. You’ll likely just be getting a similar level creator probably just a lateral move then. Ricky Rubio is the guy that would work well here but minn doesn’t need Kennard.   Lou Williams for george hill might be another option that would help in the playoffs maybe
"Am I wrong for saying this: Lou Williams is a problem for the Clippers. I've always felt with the Clippers that their biggest problem, even during the LOB era, was their best bench player was a guy who was just a scorer.  You need a bench scorer, but if your best bench player/scorer is a black hole defensively at the G position, you are going to blow leads a lot, especially if they aren't scoring. The Clippers learned nothing from Jamal Crawford. Doc Rivers was blowing leads even with CP3 on the team, including the underrated game against the Kings when the Kings were down like 14, the Clips had to bring their best players out, but the Kings won the game still.  You can't have Lou out on the floor and have him not be the scorer, because he provides very little."
Lou Williams -25  Ivica Zubac -26  Marcus Morris Sr. -20  Luke Kennard -22  Our fucking bench is just Trezz clones Jesus Christ...
puts luke kennard and lou williams in the game and the lead evaporates
That’s lou Williams music. He makes a lot of them though.
Lol how are you gonna get blocked by Lou Williams when you have a 7'1 wingspan.
you just got blocked by Lou Williams LMAOO
Lou “LeBron James” Williams
Lou Williams?
I mean guarding Lou Williams isn’t really important anyway
Lou Williams
"Lou Williams also tore his on a fast break euro to the basket years ago.  Its a tough move for your body to handle at full speed.  Shifting your momentum from one knee to the other, then elevating."
Lou Williams
Lou Williams i think
"Terrence Ross on Magic, Murray on Nuggets, Klay, Wiggins (I still believe in him - especially if vs OKC), DLo, PG13, Tatum or Brown (if one is injured and they get a bunch of shots), Jimmy Butler (man scored 40+ in the finals), Westbrook, Embiid, Seth Curry, Kevin Love (hot take but if healthy sure), fucking Austin Rivers, John Wall ( I’m still a believer), Donavan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams"
"You can if your coach recognizes it and uses it. Lou Williams is the ultimate example, but others have come before him."
You don't have to guard Lou Williams in the playoffs.  He will choke on his own.
"Holy shit 2021 and people are still talking about Lou Williams, if only that McDonald’s high school game and east bay magazines could be so proud"
"I haven't been watching, but I guess Kerr solved america's other biggest problem of how to guard Lou Williams."
Have Lou Williams guard capital hill. Boom. Problem solved
&gt;how are we going to guard Lou Williams without fouling?  just wait until the playoffs
"Steve Kerr on what happened today at the capitol: ""I started today thinking about how we're going to guard Lou Williams without fouling him. Suddenly, that didn't seem very important when I turned on the TV. ... It's just a clear reminder that the truth matters in our country."""
"The clippers also have lou williams, who basically contribute nothing if he doesn't score, which is something the can't be said about spicy p and Lowery"
Edwards- dwyane wade/anthony masons  Wiseman- anthony randolph/marvin bagley  Lamelo ball- jason williams  Payton pritchard- muggsy bogues  Immanuel quickly- lou williams  Tyrese haliburton- george hill
"He landed on my shitlist tonight and that’s hard to do, I’m usually pretty understanding of guys limitations, etc.  But I will not stand for a dude getting paid 12-15mm a year who plays like such a pussy. If he was a rookie or 2nd year guy finding his way, fine. Dude is a knock down shooter who will find any excuse not to put the shot up. Dude closing away from 6 feet? Better pass to Batum. The passes aren’t even high quality. He’s not passing up good shots for better shots, he’s just passing up good shots.   Maybe that doesn’t sound so bad but he’s pretty awful on defense too. I don’t know what the team is supposed to do in the playoffs if he’s going to be a defensive liability. At least Lou Williams will trade buckets.  Hopefully as he spends more time with the team he gets more comfortable taking shots when he has them. I don’t know what he’s doing on the court otherwise. I think he can still be good but as of now he’s being WELL outplayed by minimum salary Nic Batum."
"In the geeky podcasts I listen to, he mainly gets flak for his defense. I think Nate Duncan called him the worst defensive 2guard in the league last season. He is definitely below average, but there are still guys like Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson below him."
"Hey man, be nicer to Lou Williams. He’s my friend"
"Lou Williams *is* 34 years old, after all."
Lou williams needs to take open shots not self created terrible iso shots.
"That spurs team plays hard man, I'd imagine Lou Williams and Kennaed didn't do enough on D and that's why they lost?"
"Good news and bad news:   Bad news, we really need Lou Williams to convert those shots at the end, or else we can’t close games with him.   Good news: our announcers are wizards"
"Reggie Jackson, lou Williams, luke kennard all on the same time.  Spurs score a bunch of points.  Shocking."
lou williams needs to retire
"Lou Williams' teammates have to cover for him on D too, but he's still in the league."
"&gt; maybe, but still his defense was so bad in his boston years.  Lots of bad defenders stay in the league because they can score. Jamal Crawford stuck around forever. Lou Williams is still around."
He's more like Lou Williams. Score first kind of guard
Shake and Maxey are pretty handy too. Guys who can dribble pass and shoot are such an exotic luxury for the Sixers. Jimmy was the only one we’d had since Lou Williams pretty much.
"It's the reason that a fair amount of people who root for the Clippers do so: it's just another way of rooting against the Lakers. Celtics fans don't want the Lakers to win another title and the Clippers are probably the biggest obstacle to them doing do, so Boston fans are looking for ways to strengthen the Clippers.   Unfortunately for them, because of the hard cap it would be pretty difficult for the Clippers to get Lowry via trade. Probably the best the Clippers could manage is Beverley, Morris and P.Pat for Lowry, and that's if the Raptors had any interest in such a trade. Or if not maybe swap Morris for Lou Williams and Luke Kennard (along with Bev and P.Pat). Those would work."
The 2012 Sixers were led by Lou Williams at 14.9. Don’t know if that’s the record though.
"From the latest ringer article.   Doc Rivers was loyal to Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Montrezl Harrell, and kept them in roles that fit their games. But all that is out the window under Lue. Beverley is averaging the fewest shots (5.7 per game) he has since his rookie season, Williams is down to no. 6 on the team in touches (35.7), and Harrell is on the Lakers.  (Lou was second in touches. More than PG last season)"
I thought there were glimpses in the third quarter of how this Warriors offense can click and get really good:  lots of off-balance attacks involving ball movement and slashers filling up open lanes.  Steph being the lone spacer *still* isn't ideal tbh but I knew adding Draymond would unlock some interior spacing for Wiggins &amp; Oubre to slash and smash off of.  Before Dray came back they had no interior playmaking whatsoever.  Now they have one of the best interior playmakers in the league.  Back to spacing... I really hope the Warriors can manage to snag Lou Williams.  Tbh someone like him would unlock this team &amp; take a huge load off of the offense.
"I think it's tough to argue that the way the Bucks failed was ""more spectacular"". A lot of people, even the Clippers themselves apparently, still think the Clippers were better than the Nuggets, and they just imploded against them. Going into that Heat-Bucks series there were quite a few people who picked the Heat to win.  The Bucks definitely have gotten some heat for that series (no pun intended), but IMO the difference is they didn't talk all year like they'd already won the title the way the Clippers did. I mean, what's the most controversial comment or interview anyone on the Bucks gave/said last year? I can't think of anything.   But with the Clippers there's eyewitness reports of Pat Beverley jumping up on a table in a 5 star restaurant and yelling ""I just won the championship!"" at the top of his lungs, and there's video of he and Lou Williams celebrating in a Vegas casino. There's Bev going to knock on LeBron's door and tell him it's over for him. There's Ballmer's insane press conference. There was that corny marketing campaign about ""streetlights over spotlights"" and all that.  Not to mention the different interviews the players did, especially Paul George, who seems to have a real talent for putting his foot in his mouth virtually every time he opens it. And then of course there was also the stalking/tampering/cheating with Kawhi that the league is currently investigating.  The Clippers upset a lot of people last season, so when they failed people loved it. If you really can't understand why, then I'm not sure what to tell you. But all the hate the Clippers and PG get, it's not manufactured out of thin air. There's legit reasons for why it exists."
*Lou Williams has entered the chat*
"Lowry, dragic, lou Williams, horford and a few others are solid to good players at 34. Then you got a ton of guys who are 33 and still playing at a high level. I don’t see why harden can’t be elite  for the next 5 years."
"What year would you consider prime Lou will? I watched a ton of him in Atlanta and while he was good, I'd rather have THJ with the defense than Lou will. I just feel like he's a bit more versatile in things he can do to help you win.  If your team needs bench scorers, I think those guys have been kind of a dime a dozen lately (Jamaal Williams comes to mind)"
"I mean Capela, Lou Williams, Gallinari and Solomon Hill all have playoff experience. It's not like playoff experience has ever really helped the Hawks in the past anyways lol"
If he plays defense consistently hes more valuable than lou williams ever was.
Reminds me of that one girl thirsting for Lou Williams lol
"I mean it’s good to have hope. Look at KD this year, looks just as explosive as ever and has no fear driving off of his Achilles. It’s not an ERA long gone if Steph is having his second best year of his career. Look at players now who have had ACL years as well. Lavine is having the best year of his career. Nerlens Noel is an elite defender. Lou Williams didn’t lose a step. There are a lot of players who are still great after an ACL tear. Sure, he could be significantly hampered. But there is also a decent enough chance to continue to be great that I’ll keep my hopes up."
He will never be a plus defender with his short wingspan. His peak is Lou Williams and that's being generous
lou williams and pj tucker never dunking is kind of surprising
Who’s the better scorer:  Enes Kanter or Lou Williams?
Worse Lou Williams.
Lou Williams looked atrocious tonight too. We need to get someone like Jared Butler in the draft
Bulls fans really went from “we have a starting PG now” to “holy shit he might not even be Lou Williams” lol
Anyone else see Middleton hit Lou Williams with that stiff arm on the rebound before his last three? Cause that was hilarious.
Hawks are 7-1 since Lou Williams became activated so looks like a good trade so far for both teams.
"Both of these articles reference the event, I've seen a couple of beat writers for the clippers mention it as well. Reggie was not playing well early in the year, and there was already a log jam at point guard. Ty Lue told Reggie to stay ready and when some injuries happened Reggie stepped in with whole new energy to how he played.   I remember those days with him on the Pistons, and even during his days on the Thunder when he would complain about his role versus Westbrook. He's come a long way in a short time; it's impressive to see. Playing on a veteran team probably helps too.  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-10/clippers-reggie-jackson-patrick-beverley-injured  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/ty-lue-met-with-lou-williams-reggie-jackson-and-luke-kennard"
"I want him to start as a fan of his, but I honestly think he has great 6th man potential. Doesn't hve to be sixth man of the year but he can be very similar to Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams. Only issue is the contract he has now and it might force him to start, but if he is willing to come off the bench, I think he can live up to 20 million of that contract.  The guy can legit play even though last two games have been one of those bad D lo games. Still, he has many games where he can create buckets and can be big for the Wolves.  I still think he can start with KAT, but they need better defensive pieces around him and KAT and some help.  I also think he can be a really good off-ball scoring shooter like how Joe Harris and JJ Reddick play but with better offensive versaility. Sort of like how Jason Terry was with the Mavericks."
People like you are still stuck in the past and are projecting the bubble memes onto a brand new season with different circumstances.  Kawhi and PG have been locked in and on a mission this year PG’s slump was only because of his toe injury and in his last 4 games is averaging 30+ so he seems to have moved on from that injury.   They’re out for blood now and with Rondo and Batum as the connective glue that can playmake and keep the ball moving plus step up on defense that alone is an improvement from Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
"He’s next in line for that Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Crawford, Lou Williams type bucket-getter"

Most of you nephews didn't think the previous three were good defenders before watching them. It's gonna be the same case with the current players. People are making it seem like Nunn is Trae or Lou Williams.
"Lol harden was walking around the court on one leg and refusing wide open fast breaks. Irving missed 4 games. Harden was injured the whole series. Trae missed games and was literally sitting corner while lou williams tried to create offense because they had nobody else . Sure, give the bucks credit for winning the series with both the top players out.  But you’re actually pretty dumb if you can’t see the difference between how healthy giannis was against the Suns compared to what happened to harden/Irving against the nets"
How hasn't Lou Williams been picked up yet? Dude proved in the hawks that he's still a walking bucket. There were a number of times where his midrange jumpers would start a hawks comeback run.
"Covid aside, he's pretty good in a Lou Williams role, yeah"
Looking at whose left in FA. Lou Williams and Delly would be a pretty good fit on this Lakers squad
Lou Williams is a walking bucket
"It really is. Dude really improved last year. 40% from 3, puts in effort on defense.   Y’all got a great guy to bring youth to the locker room, and second unit scoring. In 5 years he may be the next Lou Williams. And that’s a compliment."

Carmelo Anthony and Lou Williams: COME ON DOWN!
"Wait their not using White as their Lou Williams off the bench? The kid can score, so why not?"
Ouch. That's a lot for a guy with a Lou Williams ceiling but I trust the FO.
And the Bucks have the defenders to hide what he lacks on that end. He could just come in and play that Lou Williams roll.
"Coby seems destined to be a future 6th man of the year candidate, in the Clarkson, Lou Williams mold."

"If we could keep Coby I'd love that, personally I think he's got a role here as a Lou Williams type guy but the injury *might* have changed how the FO sees him. I think back to the White Sox trade for Craig Kimbrel. I thought Madrigal was untouchable but he is now with the Cubs, and as someone said, ""if Madrigal isn't injured he isn't involved in the trade,"" which has me preparing to see Coby's name in a tweet if we do get DeRozan. But again, would love to keep him"
Rumors have been pretty dead for Bucks free agency besides the rumblings of Bobby coming back so it's really anyone's guess. I think Lou Williams was the only guy even remotely mentioned so far
Strip club chicken wings have no calories. Look at Lou Williams
"It's pretty amazing Lou Williams, a 6' shooting guard who plays poor defense, has been in the NBA for so long"
Lou Williams is the [only active player](https://247sports.com/Season/2005-Basketball/CompositeRecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool) from my graduating class.
Lou Williams crying while eating spicy wings
"Really? Standouts are Zach/Vuc/Lauri/Sato/Thad/PWill/Coby. Sato and Thad are role players in the vein of the Jae Crowders and Bryn Forbes of the league. Everyone else is literally replaceable in the role they played for us.  A point guard in itself only solves one issue of the bulls. Our defense is sorely lacking. Would legit need PWill to be Covington and Coby to end up being Lou Williams for the bulls to be competitive the way the bulls are currently built. Look across the East Division and realistically, who do you see the bulls being competitive with? 76ers/Bucks/Nets/Hawks/Heat/Celtics/Knicks are easily better than us so we are competing with Hornets/Pacers/Wizards/Raptors retooling and the Pistons/Cavs are fast on our heels with their youth."
"He isn't very good. He's an anchor, and not the good kind. If he had developed any versatility over the past 10 years he would have a market. But the truth is you know that if you get Demar he is going to handle the ball a lot and that just isn't a proven review for success. The ship has sailed on the ""Demar carried the Raptors to the ECF narrative."". The Raptors built a championship roster AROUND him - literally. The only thing that was not championship caliber, from the coaching staff, to the front office, to the roster, was him.   He is a total Lou Williams in Kobe Bryant's clothing."
Keep Collins. Find a backup pg for Trae. Either Lou Williams or any other competent guard. Backup center is needed as well....maybe like Theis or Robin Lopez if the price is on the low end.
"Right, I think he fits the mold of a Lou Williams-type very well. And against bench units he’ll be able to build his confidence and get into a rhythm, plus he’ll have less pressure on facilitating. I wouldn’t call him untouchable, but I think he’s a solid rotation piece to keep around."
"I’ve been saying for a while, Coby’s ideal role is the Lou Williams spark plug off the bench."
His game is also nothing like D Wade lol he’s much more comparable to Lou Williams
I was just picking up wings for the fam - Lou Williams
TJM inability to space the floor will always make him a liability in the playoffs as well as his size.  Not against Lou Williams his defense isn't good but he can sure score it from anywhere and can do some passing duties as he's pretty decent at that.
"Again, I am not the one comparing the ""3rd or 4th"" best player on his team to Trae Young, you are. That's like me comparing Ben Wallace to Lou Williams (Which I am not doing).  I already yielded the your team effort stance in my previous post. But if you would like to try more examples go for it."
Lou Williams must really love the wings in ATL. Lol
"Yeah I enjoyed reading thru this post haha. Damn, you just reminded me of Raefer ‘skip 2 my lou’, he brought and1 into the NBA. Holyyyy that just reminded me of Jason Williams now that dude was fun af to watch! That Kings team as a whole with Divac and Webber were lit.   Iguodala and Andre is actually a good comparison as far as the value they brought to a team. Andre was so fun to watch because he looked like the stadium janitor lol and it almost didn’t make sense how he would blow by defenders at half their speed."
"Ja Morant, Lou Williams, Dennis Rodman, Larry Johnson"
The scoring he brings at the vet minimum is exactly why the Lakers need him. That was the point I was trying to make. Teams that don’t have much scoring and cap space really need players such as Lou Williams.
He's also 6'5 he could easily be our Lou Williams style full green light spark plug off the bench. The defense wouldn't be stellar but a Rose-Coby bench backcourt is probably the best bench backcourt in the league.
"I’m confident the Hawks will also pick up a decent veteran PG in free agency to eat minutes until/unless Sharife Cooper develops to the point of backing up Trae full time, or retain Lou Williams"
I think DeMar did a great job as a leader in the locker room to the young guys and as a primary initiator.  One of the common trends we see in teams who have trouble developing young talent is not providing the prospects with solid NBA-level guard play. This is even true for young guards.  Learning how to effectively initiate an offense is probably the most difficult learning curve in the NBA for young players and having a solid vet show you how it's done can change the course of a player's development..  Shai had Lou Williams and Pat Bev in his rookie year with LAC  Jamal Murray had Jameer Nelson his rookie year.  Donovan Mitchell had Rick Rubio his rookie year.  Trae Young had Vince Carter and Jeremy Lin during his rookie year.. and there's a ton of other examples.
"A lot of ex-Lakers have flourished the past few years beyond their Laker days.  Julius Randle Jordan Clarkson D'Angelo Russell Brandon Ingram Brook Lopez Ivica Zubac Lou Williams  This is just from memory, could be more."
"Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Jeff Teague, Kent Bazemore, E'Twaun Moore, Mike Scott, Langston Galloway, Wes Matthews, Ben Mclemore...   Really not as hard as you're making it out to be to just grab some cheap guys to shoot open 3s"
Today I came to the realisation of how long Lou Williams has been in the NBA. 2005??
"The Rockets turned  Pat Beverley, Harrel, Sam Dekker, and Lou Williams into John Wall,  and the Wizards turned John Wall into Kuzma, Harrel, KCP, and Aaron Holiday."
"Good shooters *are* widely available every offseason. But good shooters, on cheap deals, who aren't total liabilities at everything else, are not. Teams could have guys like Lou Williams, IT, Wayne Ellington etc for dirt cheap. Ellington just played for a 20 win Detroit team for $1m salary shooting 42% from deep on 6 attempts per game. But guys like that just don't offer anything else on the court."
He's that.  I think he can be a rich man's Lou Williams one day.
If he becomes a poor mans lou Williams I’ll be very happy. We need a guy off the bench who can just get buckets
"Instant offense! Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, or the original microwave, Vinnie Johnson."
"VCU alum here: you guys have a stud here who's going to get you buckets as a 6th man this season.  Shot creator and deadly 3 point shooter.  I think of him as kinda like Lou Williams, but better at 3s.  Easily the most talented player I've seen play for VCU in the decade I've been following.  I'd have been happy with my team taking him at 14.  He's going to play right away and elevate the Nuggets.  I think he'll fit right in with Murray.  Dangerous team you guys are building over there."
Lou Williams is such a great dude OH MY GOODNESS  What a class act  What a charming young man  Oh my god my God bless his wonderful kind soul  What an angel!!!!!
"Lou Williams: Underdogs, you too can date two chicks at the same time!"
Damn they really won't trade Walmart Lou Williams for Harden....
"they could also all die in a tragic strip club incident, below a pile of boobies, drowning in the champagne that an unaware lou williams is popping off above them"
Lou Williams + 2023 POR second round pick + 2027 LAC second round pick for Rondo. Lou Will was a big part in ATL reaching the eastern conference finals while Rondo was a non factor for the Clippers.
Lou Williams for Rajon Rondo
Not really a star but Lou Williams
"His stats will never “wow” anyone besides his triple double. His TS? I bet Lou Williams, Jeff Teague, will Bynum probably has better TS than Rondo. Everyone knows his jump shot was streaky at best, freethows, horrible, average around the rim, and compared to the list? Dead last in my eyes. Then why do we think he’s up there? Because he’s more than just pass. And YES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PLAYERS on the playoff teams. KG, pierce AND Ray Allen gave him the keys early 2009. Bulls went to hell when Rondo got injured. Pelicans run was AD Boogie, Jrue then Rondo. Don’t get me wrong, I do see people’s views on him being 10th on the list. But for me, I would have him 8. Maybe 9 because Tony Parker is so underrated. I just want people to know what else Rondo has done in the 2010s era."
lou williams didn't get to be a substitute?
I’ll never forget Jimmy Butler getting the spot over Lou Williams and not playing in the game lol
lol. Your average NBA superstar and your average Olympic swimmer / fencer have very different experiences of partying vibes. I don’t think James Harden or even Lou Williams for that matter are going to be particularly impressed by a “festival vibe”.
"Idk I think there's a reason why Durant, Curry, CP3, Beal, Paul George, Dame, JJ reddick, Lou Williams, and Trae have all said that Holiday is the most underrated player in the league.   https://twitter.com/LockdownJrue/status/1419498186960420872?s=20"
Quickley is less of a PG and more of a SG like Lou Williams
"All the correct points have ready been made about SGA's advantages in height, D and playmaking.   I think Sexton could be an elite game changing 6th man.   As good if not better than a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams.   Thats the role Sexton needs to embrace.   Instant offense."
Lol I feel attacked. I was born in 1987 and the 2005 high school class is bad. The best player is Lou Williams.
"I think DeMar really cleaned up his play and is at his peak as a player currently, a real veteran with enough gas in the tank to not look old on the court. He's very much primed to be a great player in the playoffs on a contending team. If Lou Williams can have standout games on a well-led squad DeMar DeRozan will match this type of production easily because he's honestly a good bit better and younger. He came off consecutive career years under pop, played back2back 60%TS seasons and increased his AST% to above 30.   If he accepts to lead the Lakers when Bron isn't playing DeMar could really be huge for the consistency of this squad. His shooting splits from the midrange this year were 51/46/48 3ft-3p which is all around elite. I think DeMar's been forgotten on a not so exciting Spurs squad but he grew so much under pop and is playing winning basketball at this point.   Analytics view him as an All-Star level impact player and the Lakers will have the possibility to get him at a huge discount because nobody really cares about DeRozan. This may very well turn into a massive win if the Lakers don't have to give up KCP or if they can replace KCP with another floor spacer."
Lou Williams
"All offense? They'd still have 1 elite rim protector, 1 elite perimeter defender, and another above average perimeter defender.  How much defense do you think they need? The Sixers didn't lose in the playoffs because of their defense, they LITERALLY lost to a team who had Trae Young and Lou Williams on the floor at the same damn time."
"My bad. Let me fix this:   Lou Williams not only went undrafted, he was personally told by all 30 GMs that he was trash and no one needed him in the league. After grinding in rec leagues in Philly(why Philly when he's from Atlanta? Who knows), the Sixers decided the Rec MJ couldn't be any worse than Willie Green and Kevin Ollie, and gave him a contract paid out in blueberry muffins and monopoly money. Lou then grinded his way to a real contract and cemented his place in the league"
Lou Williams went 45th in 2005
Lou Williams surviving 16 years  as a super undersized SG is insane
Lou Williams and Lonzo team no question.
"The main reason was the bench. Ben took Trae out of the series. He wasn't scoring efficiently after game 1. But we had Dwight who was a -23, Hill who was a -17, and thybulle who was a -34.   We weren't getting anything from our bench, and Doc was playing 4 and sometimes 5 bench players at the same time. And what further exacerbated it was playing Thybulle and Dwight at the same time when neither can shoot, and Hill who shot 30% from the field and 22% from 3.   Lou Williams and Gallinari almost outscored our entire bench unit by themselves over the course of the series. And that's with them missing 2 starters in Hunter and Redish. If Huerter and Bogi were coming off the bench this series the numbers would be even worse."
"They give it to every former player, even Lou Williams"
"Again the people he checked, pestered and sometimes shut down this postseason:  James Harden   Kevin Durant   Jimmy Butler   Devin Booker   Trae Young   Lou Williams   Kyrie Irving   CP3  Some Revis Island shit right there."
He's a 6 foot shooting guard who can't play make and can't defend. They are decent bench players (see Lou Williams) but it's REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to be more than that. He's only league average when it comes to efficiency and it's hard to see him becoming more than that.
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
"Yes, but it's an accurate description of a lot good shooters in the league. Other guys with lower to Mediocre 3 point percentages but are still deadly and need to be guarded tight include Lou Williams, Luka, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and Bradley Beal"
Exactly. Follow the Lou Williams model. High volume shooting off the bench. I think Rose might be a good option for them if Chris moves on.
Lou Williams was scorching us off the bench when teauge was guarding him
Not sure about the fastest but Lou Williams and Lamelo Ball have pretty fast FT routines
"He's too small so no matter what he does for you offensively he's a liability on the defensive end and will be match up hunted to death. They already have an undersized guard in Garland.  It's just too much for them to keep them on the court at the same time and expect to seriously win games. Either one comes off the bench or they move one and get a player who fits better in exchange. To me Sexton is a 6th man type of player, like Lou Williams, IT, or Jordan Clarkson. He's just not big enough to stay on the court for really prolonged periods of time."
I’m going for my own age well comment on Johnny Juzang. The guy’s gonna be a kyle kolver/lou williams clone. And he has the length to develop a decent defense.
"I was just stating some facts about age and scoring volume, but that's good context, thanks.  Crazy that a sub-20 PPG average used to have you as a top scorer in the league less than a decade ago.    Maybe a better comparison would be that some of what people are saying about Sexton in this thread reminds me of the takes on Booker 4 years ago too.  He's an extremely talented scorer, and everyone is looking to make him into Lou Williams, who never in his career has touched being the threat at Sexton is at 22.    It's just pretty ridiculous.  Also, back to Dame for a second, he was also a rookie and then sophomore playing next to a prime all-star in Aldridge as the 2nd scoring options, and not for the shithole team that is the Cavs post-Lebron where he's literally our only player creating his own shot consistently.  Did a lot for his rise as a star to be on teams that had other competent players that contributed to winning and not, you know, Kevin Love on one healthy leg."
"He's a good player who will have a role adjustment after getting over paid on his next contract. I don't see him as a star, more of a Jason Terry/Lou Williams type complementary scorer who could help a contender with a big role one day."
That's really fair but from what the guy I responded to was phrasing it made Collins sound exactly like a prime Lou Williams. I think Collins is probably a little too good to ever be a 6th man (and going to be too expensive).
He’s already better than Lou Williams ever was lol
So you're saying he's basically going to be prime Lou Williams?
"Lmao why did you delete your comment?   Here’s my reply to what you deleted  They traded dlo cause they weren’t happy with him. They literally said this. They did not like him. Magic literally went and trashed the dude in the media. It was also a full year before Lebron signed, they didn’t even need to do it then.   Lopez would’ve been amazing next to bron. What are you talking about. Do you see him next to giannis? Lopez can catch lobs. He’d also give you solid defense and can shoot three.   And I agree randle would be a bad fit next to bron. But they just let him go for nothing. I can’t see any team doing that. The clippers got back Tobias harris, Avery Bradley, boban, and a pick which they used on shai. You picked the worst example to make your point. That’s exactly why I’m saying they should’ve re-signed randle lol. You could’ve got back something…anything.    Don’t forget shai is what helped them get PG.   Which clippers signing fell flat this year? Batum, rondo, ibaka were amazing pickups. They got rid of Lou Williams too when they got rondo. Kawhi asked them to get smarter and that’s what they did. Kennard was a 40% shooter too, so idk why you acting like he’s trash. His contract is just ass."
"Dame for Lou Williams, straight up."
"&gt;When you're a defensive liability who can put up a ton of points, that's a perfect 6th man  There's way more to it than this. This is basically a description of all of the top guards in the league  &gt;Is there any serious difference between CJ and prime Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford?  Yes. CJ isn't as bad defensively as Lou Will and is a better playmaker, by yeah prime Lou Will was excellent. On the other hand Crawford ain't the same tier, he has a lot of 6moty (some of which he didn't deserve), but he ain't the same as those two"
"He's not wrong. When you're a defensive liability who can put up a ton of points, that's a perfect 6th man. Is there any serious difference between CJ and prime Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford?"
Lou Williams and Ben Gordon are the two names that get throwing around our sub a lot.
Demar Derozan &gt; Jamal Crawford &gt; Lou Williams
"100%. I’ve been saying for a while, that’s the role Coby is best suited for. I can seem him having a nice career in a Lou Williams style instant bench offense role."
"its a shame more guys dont wanna play in Canada, I remember Lou Williams winging about having to get a Canadian bank account."
"They should’ve traded him back when they lost to the Celtics in like 2018 where he had a 1 point playoff game. Or after 2019 when Jimmy Butler and Embiid carried his bum ass against Toronto as he did nothing to contribute. After another playoff choke job by Ben teams don’t care about his fraudulent “all around” stats because the impact isn’t there. His value has plummeted because every can’t even be in late close games shooting less than 40 % from the line in the playoffs. He won’t even attempt a mid range let alone a three. The Sixers are stuck with this overrated “PG” because of his max contract. They should’ve traded him back then when teams though they could fix him. He only has confidence on social media and in open runs that’s the only time he’ll shoot. Defense wasn’t so great either. Trae, Huerter, Collins, and Lou Williams all went right at him in games 5 and 7. They’re stuck in 2nd round mediocrity with him. The process failed!"
"Lemon Peppa Lou (Williams), Red Velvet (Kevin Huerter), Ice Trae, John The Baptist (Collins)   Can you guess i’m a Hawks fan? Lol"
"Some of it is borderline hilarious at this point.  I remember my roommate had a podcast on and they were talking about whether or not Lou Williams is a good defensive player. And one of the arguments was that if you look at his defensive analytics numbers with Kawhi and Paul George on the floor, he’s an above average defender….  I almost fell out of my chair because I’m pretty sure with Kawhi and PG on the floor I’d be an above average defender analytics wise too."
What if it were one way defensive vs one way offensive  Ex:  Tony Allen vs Lou Williams   Ben Wallace vs Amare Stoudemire
He pretends to be Lou Williams until the contract is signed. Then he finally reveals his true identity.
No but a healthy Trae young probably does more damage then 40 year old lou williams trying to create offense in a playoff game while trae young is holding his leg in the corner  God the bucks run was so funny
A sixers fan of all people should see the value in having secondary ball handlers who can take pressure off the #1 option and help exploit mismatches in the post season.  We were able to run a lineup with Lou Williams Gallinari and Trae that completed a massive comeback because the 76ers did not have a reliable 2nd option that could take advantage and Embiid was so totally gassed he couldn't score even from the line at the end if the game.
LeBron  MJ  Isaiah Thomas  Lou Williams Chris Paul Dwyane Wade Al Horford Paul Millsap  Muggsy Bogues DeMar DeRozan Tony Parker
"Hawks for sure. Collins, Bogie, Hunter and Lou williams can be counted to make shots anytime, and Capela is a reliable and defender who doesn’t need the ball to be impactful."
LOL i just remembered LOU WILLIAMS past the 1st round faster than the clippers. hahaha
Can’t believe Atlanta gave up Playoff Rondo for Lou Williams.
"Not really. He made the right move to stagger Trae and Bogdan after game 2. After that there's not much else you can do when Gallo and Lou Williams, your dedicated 6th men underperform. Especially Gallo.   Idk about too long. The Knicks just had a better bench."
The Knicks should have gone for LOU WILLIAMS or EVAN FOURNIER! Or someone who understands offense is a thing!

Dude's peak is hardly better than Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams.
"KD was right, CJ isn't on the level of other 2nd options and needs to be utilized as a 3rd at best, in that Lou Williams / Clarkson kind of role."
Needs a prime Lou Williams type player who can come in and create on his own so the offense isn't just dead when Dame sits.
He’s worth 8M per year — same as Lou Williams.
Payne is playing like prime Lou Williams with this bench scoring
ainge wouldnt trade picks for real players so hes definitely not adding picks just to have some take kemba.  I wonder if boston can get by with kemba on the bench with the 2nd unit and playing 20 min a game...sorta like rose or Lou Williams have done the last few years.  kemba has to accept that though
"Nah, thats false..theres been other dirty plays by the hawks as well...but we'll ignore that because ultimately i dont think either team has done anything disgraceful.  Noel is not baiting and flopping at all? He falls all the fucking time and knicks fans cant stand it...every game this year he falls down doing basic shit. IQ, hasnt really baited anything at all this entire series. he did in the regular series, but he definitely hasnt much at all this series. The guy that's done it more than anyone is Lou Williams. Guy hasnt seen an open shot that he doesnt want to pump fake and jump into."
Lou Williams?
"Kawhi has been arguably the best player in the playoffs for the last 4 seasons. Not many players in the league consistently take their game up a notch from a 24-25 ppg to a full blown 30ppg scorer while playing elite level defense. The man got hurt because of zaza but there’s a chance he single handedly dismantled the warriors that year too on the Spurs. He was the best player in the nba when playing for Toronto. He also absolutely destroyed during last years exit outside of the final game which doesn’t wipe away his entire backpacking to drive them there.   You can forget how bad PG, Harrell, Lou Williams, and pat bev played last year. That man almost had them in the conference finals with a 500 pound gorilla jumping on his back.   Kawhi has been the best player in the nba for 4 years now but he’s not popular in the media and doesn’t sell as good so they don’t push him. Enjoy and appreciate what he is if you’re a basketball fan this is the Kobe/Jordan of this era he’s just not as cool."
"That’s some interesting logic, lol. 2019 Warriors struggled against Lou Williams. They then came around and went all the way to the finals. They would’ve won easily had KD and Klay not gone down. How are you making a conclusion off 1 game."
Why rhe fuck clipps trade Lou Williams smh
"Trae young is no where near the worst defender in the NBA, he isn’t even the worst defender on the hawks, Lou Williams is much worse."
The Knicks are just missing an offensive threat like Lou Williams.  They don’t have anyone that can create their own shot very easily so the slow half court style playoff games are limiting their easy buckets compared with the regular season.
Lou Williams flair too
"Lou Williams really fell off a cliff since the Magic City incident, hasn’t he?"
lol playing Lou Williams in the playoffs
"I think Raptors fans feel mistreated enough by some of our previous stars (Carter, Bosh), plus disrespected by some random guys (Carroll, Antonio Davis, Lou Williams, Turkoglu), so when a guy who wanted to stay is traded, we go overboard in wanting them to know that we appreciated them, because it matters to us that they have positive feelings about their time here."
Drake had a song called 6 man that was about Lou Williams back when he was a Raptor
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
&gt; Lou Williams  In what way?   He's been awful this year
"less efficient, way less cool Lou Williams"
Lou Williams tried it then promptly realized he didn’t have clout like that
he's not a point guard  he's a slightly better lou williams on a max
The Lou Williams strategy
"Revisionist history as its finest.  - The Milwaukee Bucks were arguably biggest favorites coming out of the East in most recent seasons &amp; made a lot of great additions to make their roster even better.  - The East being weak is a false narrative &amp; simply not true. Brooklyn Nets, 76ers &amp; Bucks were the biggest title contenders before going into this playoffs.  - Trae had much worse teammates than Luka last year, but didn't get any of those excuses. Especially when Luka had the best offense in the NBA last year and it persisted when he was on the bench. Every analyst had the Mavs above the Hawks this year, and now that Trae's team looks better suddenly Luka's team sucks and Trae is being carried by Kevin Huerter and Lou Williams."
"Not counting posts about the Hawks’ postgame, 10 posts on the front page right now are either young highlights, quotes, stat lines, teammates praising him, or his dad talking about he and Lou Williams’ relationship. It’s half if you count posts about the Hawks winning"
"Lou Will is a 3 time 6MOTY (imo that's a much bigger achievement than winning a chip as the 4th option).   Yeah Rondo has 2 rings but let's not forget he was playing with legends like LeBron and KG.  If you look at their stats in these Playoffs, Rondo has on overall Box(+/-) of -22. Lou Will on the other hand has a Box(+/-) of 0.  Lou Will has scored more points, steals, played fewer minutes despite being available for more games. Most importantly Lou Williams has been instrumental in winning games.  Rondo can create shots for others, not for himself. Lou Will can score at will.   It depends on the requirement as they have different playstyles, but as a Hawks fan I'll take Lou Will in these Playoffs over Rondo who didn't do well with us."
For sure. Lou Williams is a savant and connoisseur when it comes to the Atlanta strip club scene. He probably bestowed Trae with all his knowledge so now he’s pleased and has an extra bounce in his step.
Trae Young &gt; Greek Cheeks  John Collins &gt; Trash Money  Lou Williams &gt; Jrue ISuckToday  Hawks in 4
"Off the top of my head of guys who actually get some minutes: Conley, Garland, Sexton, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverley, Shroder, Conley, Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  And there's a lot more, but i don't want to google it."
"Rajon Rondo, Lou Williams, Dennis Schroeder, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Darious Garland, Devonte Graham……. Plenty of guys. The hawks have had 3 guys of these guys on our team alone"
"Loool u think trae isn’t surrounded by good players? He got bodganovic a three point shooter, Collins athletic player, Capella a strong defensive player and Lou Williams on the bench a good sixth man. Meanwhile Luka is stuck with porzingis who is just a fragile 7 foot who refuse to post up and just shoot 3 like a shooting guard."
Who woulda though bogdonavic Lou Williams and Gallo were the different between a shitty team and a ecf
"I'd say Andre Drummond, Hassan whiteside, Lou williams are some empty stat players"
Lou Williams is officially closer to the NBA Finals than his former team the Clippers.
Lou Williams gonna do playoff Lou Williams stuff
"&gt;Arenas and Lou Williams put it somewhat like this, ""If you had a time machine and could drop LeBron (or Durant for that matter) a few decades back, he would easily average 60  And if Jordan had a time machine to access today's medicine, PEDs, nutrition, physical training and even better shoes? What if he was able to get all of this and more than hitch a ride back in his time machine?   he would easily average 60"
Lou Williams can be really bad. But he can also be really good.
"Obviously. I love how objective Kerr is throughout the years. I've been watching NBA since the mid 80s fanatically.  Jordan was by far the best player of his generation and he is the greatest basketball player ever, but definitely not the best skill wise.  He turned the NBA global and super-commercial. No other US athlete had managed something like that in the worldwide stage. That's why he is the most important player ever for the game. But the best? Not even close.  The level back then was very low compared to the modern NBA. He could barely hit a three and didn't improve much even though he tried. And we won't even talk about his super selfish character. He wouldn't survive today being so egocentric.  Even he admitted in 2001 that his career wouldn't be the same if zone defenses were implemented earlier.  Arenas and Lou Williams put it somewhat like this, ""If you had a time machine and could drop LeBron (or Durant for that matter) a few decades back, he would easily average 60""."
Were there any big roster changes after Nate took over? Like did they add/subtract any new pieces outside of Lou Williams or change any major rotations?
"But normally contending teams are the only ones motivated to take on a veteran player borderline star player like this. Even then, the only role I really see Kemba fitting into on a good team would be the backup PG/scorer, similar to how Lou Williams was used on the Hawks...thats not that valuable of a role, especially for $36/37 million&gt;  A) If a team needs a PG, then they better be contending or else it would make no sense in taking on Kemba's contract.  B) If a team can take the dead money, that would mean that the Thunder are the ones compensating another team then? Give them picks to take Kembas contract off their hands? That seems backwards to the Thunders strategy  C) This is no one, no one wants his presence for $30+ million a year. Not sure what you were envisioning here."
Cameron Payne looks Like a young Lou Williams
"Good. Watching Harden and guys like Lou Williams not even try to score, but manipulate a foul call makes me so bitter. Ruins the integrity of the game. They should also have a post-game flop review committee that reviews possible flops missed by the refs during the game. If found guilty for flopping, they can get a post game fine or a post game tech that is added to their season total"
"Yeah, we've improved a lot in that department since the early days, that's for sure LOL  Not everyone is Lou ""Magic Kingdom"" Williams, thankfully. Toronto is a genuinely great place and I'm really happy more dudes are starting to realise that. Now if only it were cheap enough for normal Joes to live in haha"
It's rare that a player says something negative about a coach in public... even when the coach is terrible. Doc had a reputation for being good when Kawhi was signing because he took the Warriors to 6 games when his best player was Lou Williams.
"Announcer : The Las Vegas Harems are here tonight. James Harden, Lou Williams taken in during expansion."
"That's not all the way fair. Morey only traded for 2 established superstars in his tenure w/the Rox, CP3(awesome) and Russ(not awesome). D12 was a free agent, and Beard wasn't a superstar when we traded for him. So which players did he trade that you cared about so much, and which superstar did you not want?  Unless you're yearning for the days of the post-TMac/Yao era of the treading water Rox, then you can't hate on the Harden trade at all if you even want to count that one. FWIW I loved Scola, Brooks, KMart, Chuck, KLow, Dragic, etc.  1. In order to get CP3, Morey traded Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. I still adore Pat Bev and Trezz, and I got love for LouWill, but that CP3 trade led to the greatest non-Hakeem led team in franchise history. It's undeniable that trade was amazing, and even if you hate CP3, it was the best move for the team. I cared more about team success at that point than how much I missed Pat Bev and Trezz, and I became a CP3 fan.  2. I agree with you on the Russ trade tho, and I hated it in real time but tried to stay positive. We all saw how that worked out, and I still miss CP3. But that trade was on Frittata and Harden 100%, and I can't be convinced Morey wanted Russ especially at the cost of those picks. It is what it is, but Morey makes moves to get better, and he's generally on point unless the owner is a cheap bastard who takes out $200 million loans at like 35% lmao"
"Educating us by acting like popularity contest allstar appearances are more important than being able to stay on the floor at the end of playoff games, sure lol.  Dude had 32 year old Gallinari, Lou Williams, and Trae Young on him in game 5 and he didn't even attempt a single shot. Thats..not good lol"
What does Lou Williams have to do with Chris Paul though? How are they connected? If Kevin love got suspended you wouldn’t say this
"But people do sag way off Thybulle and don’t try and follow him. He stands in the corner waiting for wide open 3’s. Not to mention he couldn’t score on Lou Williams.   I never said CJ is a trash playmaker either. I said he isn’t a “very good playmaker” which is a clear cut fact.   Looks like you didn’t even make an attempt to read what I typed. Makes sense since you didn’t even successfully refute a single thing I said  Also use midrange stats, not distance. KD routinely beats CJ in midrange shooting. Embarrassing to use 3-10 and 10-16 as mid range when a lot of that are shots in the paint. Just shows your understanding is worse than initially suggested.    Thanks for proving that you don’t know what you are talking about!"
"Yep, and we've seen a big improvement since Lou Williams came over in the trade as his mentor. Really is a whole different player from the 1st half of the year to the second half."
No way is Game 5 solely on him. Fucking doc had around 15 mins of game time to adjust.  Lou Williams of all people started that whole run and never did he get defensive pressure
Lou Williams suffered an acl injury and was out the whole year. What in the fuck are you smoking?
"Casual take.   1-People need to understand that while the west is deep, outside of the 2 LA teams none of these teams overwhelm you with star power.  Utah is a 1 star team. Phoenix is a 1 star team with an aging quasi star CP3. They are what we hope for, they are winning based on chemistry and coaching, not just overwhelming talent. So that can be matched.   That’s the Hawks as well. The Hawks in my book are every bit as good as Phoenix and Utah and those are top seeds. The Hawks would smoke the Clippers (without Kawhi) and I’d take them over Phoenix too. Why?…  2- I said this even before the  lseason started that they were a ‘year 3 leap’ from Trae away from being really dangerous. Their vet signings were a home run and pound for pound as good as anyone’s: Bogi, Gallo, Lou Williams, Capela. The latter 3 have been on nothing but good teams in recent years   Then what separates them is their young guys which give them depth: Huerter (who shocked everyone but was already known to those in the know), Hunter, don’t forget Reddish, even Okongwu is better off raw talent than most teams’ 10th man.   3- Anybody should have been able to see that if Trae somehow became efficient, he would pose a lot of the same issues that teams have with Steph. Having to guard 40ft out, the threat of both the floater and the lob on the pick n roll. And then you surround him with 3 other not good but great shooters at all times . This is not a surprise"
Lou Williams 34 though.  What are they gonna do when he retires?
"But you said few guys used the midrange and it’s pretty clear that’s not the case. An assortment of guys is relying on the midrange to score more than Booker is.  Guys these playoffs averaging more midrange attempts than restricted area attempts include Embiid, Middleton, Westbrook, Randle, Tatum, CP3, Butler, CJ, Kyrie, Dragic, MPJ, Melo, Bogdan, Ish, Hunter, Marcus Morris, Gallinari and a whole lot of others  More midrange than three include: KD, Embiid, Westbrook, Butler, CP3, Rose, AD, Ish, Lou Williams, Tyler Herro, Tyrese Maxey, and Jabari Parker among others.  It’s just not accurate that Booker is one of the few players with a midrange game."
I liked it when it was 'how the fuck are we struggling to score when they're running Trae Young and Lou Williams'
You talking about the guy Lou Williams blew past to the bucket in the 4th quarter last night?   His defense is painfully overrated.
"He's the best shooter but he also got absolutely abused by Kevin Huerter on defense in Game 7. I just dont think you could theoretically play him and McCollum together in a playoff game, he would be a great option off the bench but I'm not sure if he would want to accept that role. Then again, the Hawks did just play Trae Young and Lou Williams together for stretches this round but that just said more about the Sixers abysmal scoring than anything."
"People take the narrative of “Lou Williams sucks in the playoffs” and then continue with it even when the player showed up  Williams helped the hawks win the series, no doubt about it."
Eh; it was Lou Williams two games before.   Whoever gets hot was being out on curry and doc didn’t adjust.
"This is crazy I just looked up the stats for that game and the Timberwolves held Trae Young, Kevin Heuter, Clint Capela, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdonavic, Lou Williams, Oneyeka Okongu, and John Collins to 10 points combined that game.  It's almost like they are two completely different teams and at that time the Hawks did suck."
"We lost this game three games ago.  You *cannot* lose both G4 and G5, man. I don't really care what anyone says, I think that the Sixers on paper were head-and-shoulders better than the Hawks, but to have lost all that momentum coming out of G3 is inexcusable. Losing those games erased all of this team's moxie, robbed them of any confidence, and ultimately played a factor in why they lost in 7.  Part of it is obviously on Simmons, who I have no patience for anymore. Outback Olowokandi and his defeatist mindset have totally kneecapped his ability to win meaningful games in Embiid's very-much-still-open championship window. It cannot happen. He is a deeply flawed player who, barring a radical change, will never see a conference finals appearance. When push comes to shove, he will gladly get shoved every time.  But that doesn't absolve Doc Rivers in the slightest. It's hard not to think about how our organization was torn between MDA and Ty Lue before Doc came on the market. Either one of them would have been better. Doc's stubbornness, his refusal to tighten his rotation, his cluelessness about what to do with this *very talented* roster, and the dark, ominous playoff-losing cloud that hovers above him were all major factors to this collapse.  I feel totally embarrassed to have this flair next to my username. The Sixers fought all year for the 1 seed so that, if we needed a game 7, it would be at home, and we squandered it completely.   Some scattered thoughts:  \- Any criticism of Embiid's turnovers is mostly valid, but ask yourself this: if you're Embiid, and your options are either force up something stupid, or pass it to Ben Simmons, what would *you* do? The fact is that, due to the lack of perimeter creation (organizationally magnified by the commitment to Ben Simmons as your PG), Embiid has to initiate his offense from 20ft out instead of 12ft. That's the issue. He's turning it over because Doc can't manage to get anyone else on the roster to help him establish position when he needs to make a play. His turnover problem is probably the 15th-20th domino in line, falling as a result of having Ben Simmons on your team.  \- I knew this game was over when our defense caused Atlanta to start the 4Q 0-10 shooting through \~6 minutes of play... and ended up with a 4pt lead. Down 5, you manage TEN consecutive stops (minus one trip to the foul line) over 6 minutes... and only make it a 2 possession game? Pathetic. Atlanta's defense is not nearly good enough to have killed our offense like that. It's Doc's fault, and Ben's fault.  \- That Ben play will define his career. He will never, ever, ever live that down.  \- This team pretty obviously needed Danny Green to work, because as good as Curry's shotmaking was, the Sixers had no solution for the way he got hunted on defense. Huerter was taking warm-up shots all night on Curry, which is also what happened in G5 with Lou. Danny going down magnified that he and Ben were our only reliable wing defenders, and Atlanta absolutely maximized the matchup. Huerter and Williams, for the series, combined to shoot 16-27 on Curry. You needed Curry out there... but it's on Doc to figure out a way to hide him better and keep Atlanta from getting the shots they wanted. Mission failed.  \- I'm not gonna do the referee thing, but after G3, they were just downright bad.  Credit to the Hawks for being those dudes, man. They fit together really well, they all trust each other, and none of them shrank from the moment. Wish I could say the same about Philly. Lots and lots of questions to be answered this summer."
"Tell that to Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, and Lou Williams. Most dominant Big 3 in the league"
Lou Williams had too many strip club wings before the series
"Except arguably their two biggest wing pieces, Reddish and Hunter, didn’t play.  Imagine if they were playing and you had a rotation of Trae, Bogi, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Heurter, Gallo, Capela and Okongwu.  All the while having Lou Williams, Kris Dunn for defense, Solomon Hill, and Tony Snell for “as needed” situations.  These are all at worst rotation players in the nba. This is an insanely deep Hawks roster."
What’d the clippers do tho?  They traded Lou Williams for rondo.  They traded their sixth man for a real pg.  so apparently they felt they needed a pg.
you forgot lou williams
"Props to their GM.   He realize that he couldn't just have a bunch of young guys on the court, so he paid top dollar for some vets then made a coaching change and went with a veteran at that spot before it was too late.  Trading Rondo for Lou Williams was a great decision too and exactly what they needed at the time."
" They finally got their superstar in Trae. Like Lou Williams said, that man is a future hall a famer. I think he really is proving it. That game he had 18 assists was legendary. He's like 21 I think and is in the eastern conference finals. Ice cold"
"Yes really, Hawks won games where they had Lou Williams and Trae Young on the court, 2 horrendous defenders.   But it didn't matter because the Sixers backcourt didn't have the offensive capabilities to punish it."
"So Trez went out in the first round, Doc choked another series where his team had legit championship aspirations, was the higher seed, and the more talented squad while Lou Williams made it to the conference finals by beating Doc and the Clippers finally made it to their first WCF the year after he got fired. You can’t make this shit up lol."
He can’t draw up actual plays for shit. Even when Lou fucking 40yr old Williams was on court with Trae they cant score on them. He’s just wasting star studded lineups year after year
Bruh what edit? Comment shows an asterisk if it's been edited after 1 minute and you replied 12 minutes after dude posted. Not his fault you got Lou Williams and Ty Lue mixed up lmao
I saw Lou Williams drive right around him to the bucket during the 4th tonight.  I think his defense is so overrated.
Lou Williams makes the conference finals
Lou williams getting Doc Rivers twice in a row
Lou Williams bout to go off
A Lou Williams is as rare as a Steph dunk
Lou Williams can dunk still? Holy shit...
"Booker also isn’t a complete mismatch on wings, unlike Sexton. Speaking of wings, Sexton is like a spicier Lou Williams."
Lou Williams passed up AN OPEN 3. Tells you the man's midget mind.
"Lou Williams looks tight, so does Gallinari."
"Yup. This is the playoffs, lou Williams is annoying with his decision making"
"If they lose to the Hawks, do they regret not keeping Lou Williams?"
Jones deserves it but I wish there was an “all-NBA” executive list so that Schlenk could get some love.   Not many people would have fired Lloyd when he did or made the Lou Williams trade mid season.
Could really use Lou Williams
"Yeah that Tom Brady guy never recovered from that ACL 13 years ago…  The list of successful ACL recoveries in sports is absurdly long at this point. It’s a routine surgery these days with very predictable rehab. All these guys you are listing had other injuries going on.   Rubio, Lou Williams, Rondo, Al Jefferson, David West…  ACL tears just don’t happen as much in basketball. But in football there’s tons of guys every year and they all come back fine nowadays."
Lou will listed as Louis Williams really threw me off
Imagine thinking you beat the refs in a game where Dwight Howard choke slams Lou Williams and they call a foul on Lou Williams.  And it stands after replay.
Otherwise: Lou Williams.
"This is the stupidest shit I’ve seen upvoted here all series. Yes you’re biased, and apparently the Sixers brigade in here after their win is real. It’s absolutely asinine to think the reffing crew actually conspired to rig the series in favor of the Sixers last game.   This is the same game where Embiid could *easily* have been ejected (and would have if he weren’t a star), where Dwight Howard surplexed Lou Williams and actually ended up as a foul on Lou (literally one of the most blasphemous calls I’ve seen in my life), where Trae shot a grand total of 1 entire FTA more than Embiid this game who is whining to the media, and where the Sixers went to the bonus with over 7 minutes of play left in the 4th.   How anyone could think that a reffing crew rigging it in the Hawks favor would actually let all these things happen makes me seriously question your ability to function in daily life."
"On the evidence of Doc Rivers not being able to punish the Hawks running a back-court of Lou Williams &amp; Trae Young, I think the Nets were right to take a chance on someone new"
The Lob City and Kawhi/PG teams really shouldn't give him hype &amp; status.  He never even won a 2nd round series with the Clippers.  The last time he won in the 2nd round was when he beat the the 8th seed Sixers in 11-12. A team that had Lou Williams as the leading scorer averaging 14.9 PPG lol.
"But is Hennessy really the spirit of the NBA Westbrook?  Is it really??  If anything is the spirit of the NBA, especially this game with Harden, its Lou Williams Lemon pepper wings."
Need to get Lou Williams back immediately
"Yes, when Howard picked up Lou Williams, body slammed him, and then Lemon Pepper got called for the foul it was truly oppression."
Yup. And Crawford took Mo Williams role. The circle of offensive minded 6th man point guards on the Clippers.  But what confused me was the year that Lou Will (and I guess Beverly) overlapped with Blake and DeAndre. So there was an overlap of eras so to speak.
thanks hawks fans for confirming how self conscious you are about it...   lou williams and gallinari.. a whole squad that depends on negotiating with the officials nightly to see if you'll shoot enough free throws to win a game...
"First of all you are correct on the Collins call that was a foul on Embiid. However, if you think you should be allowed to grab a big like Howard to keep him from getting to the paint for an easy bucket just because you are Lou Williams’ size you are mistaken. Him being thrown to the ground was a reaction to Williams literally being on top of Dwight.  Also in case you forgot Maxey hit a 3 in that possession that was called off for that very foul on Williams, a defensive player fouling “before” the shot."
"&gt;I mean, Lou Williams got a foul for being thrown to the floor by Dwight(I would love a clip of this btw). The refs were on some special shit last night and I thought it was a super inconsistently officiated game.           That was the 1st bad call for the Hawks, and it still worked in your favor because it negated the Maxey 3 that he made on the same possession."
"I mean, Lou Williams got a foul for being thrown to the floor by Dwight(I would love a clip of this btw). The refs were on some special shit last night and I thought it was a super inconsistently officiated game.   It's hard to fault Trae for hunting for contact in the fourth when he's been getting that call up until that point. Consistency is the most important thing to the players."
"This is a ridiculous take, you didn't watch Pat Bev, Lou Williams, DeRozan... Gobert is an interior defender that makes up for his teammates' poor defense and still had a defense either 12 or 16 points better per 100 possessions this postseason. 5-out is bad for him, since he knows that the offense will feast on Mitchell's poor defense and get easy buckets at the rim."
"Lou sits Mann down, shows him the [Vince Carter Olympic Dunk.](https://youtu.be/k_uZeCymShQ?t=15)  Now, little bro, find the biggest French guy on the court and go over him.- Lou Williams, probably"
"Philly’s defense was just so good. I understand Ben Simmon’s inability to do anything on offense, but his perimeter defense is what keeps him on the roster. One of his blocks on Young’s three attempts was insane. There was like 6 feet of space for Young behind a screen and Ben was still able to close the gap (in one jump) and get his hand on the ball. Absolutely nuts.   Atlanta succeeds when their supporting cast knock down shots. They can’t just rely on Trae to put points on the board himself. Bogdonavich hurt and only getting 7 points, Lou Williams going 0-5. Philly is gonna win game 7 if that happens again."
"Refs determined foul happened before the shot. Lou Williams personal foul, side out."
"The refs called the foul on Lou Williams but said Maxey hadn't started the upward motion of his shot when the foul occured, so no basket.  Which is lame as hell because you can watch the ref who called the whistle in live action, and he called it after the ball had left Maxey's hand."
"Did you see Lou Williams trying to argue he didn't foul Howard, like the ref should have just said ""Ok Lou I believe you, no foul, 3 points for Philly""."
"I think someone who deserves some praise tonight for Terance's progression is Lou Williams. Lou mentored Terance since his joined the Clippers as a rookie. Terance looked up to Lou, and when the news hit that Lou was traded, Terance posted a post about how much Lou meant to him. He referred to Lou as his Big Bro. And Lou has publicly stated that Terance was his young gun. He viewed him as his little bro. Lou William's was a BIG part of the Clipper locker room. He also help mentor Zubac on being more aggressive to the hoop and telling him to keep battling for rebounds.  So while this was a fantastic night for Mann, I think Lou Williams deserves some shine for mentoring and helping Mann's progression as a young player."
"Lou Williams finally came through for Doc. Yikes, what a poor game by him. The Sixers finally figured out that they could demolish Lou with Maxey. Maxey took the opportunity and ran with it (helped by Simmons and his horrible game)"
Lou Williams tried to shiv Dwight but realized Howard is too big and got hulk smashed into the ground.  Refs declined to call a double foul and instead took away Maxey’s 3 I guess as a make up?
Lol.  New Lou Williams putting it on old Lou Williams team
"Man I love guys like Clarkson, Lou Williams etc who just get red hot, don't pass and make ridiculous shots over and over lol"
"Lou Williams vs Tyrese Maxey, maybe a couple of ft made, so close.. and that blackout momentum killer."
"please explain how that was a foul on Lou Williams, should have been a flagrant on Dwight"
What if I told you Lou Williams pulled Dwight down and then flopped away from the play and they took a 3 off the board as a result?
"Foul on Lou Williams, Simmons has to shoot"
trae young gonnna come in or are we gonna have to watch lou williams try to run point more
Lou Williams the reason ATL losing
Lou Williams needs to stfu
Because Lou Williams was trying to plow through Dwight first.
Lou Williams fouling saved a 3 pointer he should stop arguing lol
Damn I never seen lou Williams so hot
They seriously called that on Lou Williams?
This is what Lou Williams is gonna say about “the lightskin guy” in reference to Kevin Huerter when they win the ECF
I was about to comment and say you left out Raton rondo but I completely forgot about the Lou Williams trade lol
"Suns faced the same situation in GM5 when Zubac was written out and they thought Clippers would simply fold. Granted, Trae is a much more impactful player, but the mindset is the same: ""They lost one of their key guys, it will be easier now.""   I don't see Lou Williams continuing to have such a high impact now that Bucks had time to make adjustments for GM5. Even without Giannis, I believe Bucks have a deeper roster, but it's not going to be easy."
The Lou Williams for Rondo trade possibly allowing this stat to happen at the 50 year mark perfectly is something that I find funny.
From [this](https://twitter.com/LAClippers/status/1118033956228624385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1118033956228624385%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fsweet-lou-williams-celebrates-largest-163035343.html) after Lou dropped 30+ pts vs the Warriors and one of the largest playoff comebacks. He followed it up with some celebratory nachos and equally tasty dm's.
IKR? Why do team like the Clippers sign All Time Great players coming off a championship and a FMVP like Kawhi Leonard and try to build around him when they can simply try to get out of the West with a team deep team built around Pat Bev and Lou Williams? SMFH
Lou Williams would have been big for them in this series considering the guy they traded for did not play well at all.
"Still not a feel-good story like they're selling...  Feel-good story is Giannis winning the title or a guy like Lou Williams contributing heavily and winning, not CP3."
all this to get destroyed by Lou Williams in the finals
I don't mind the Lakers but I find the Clippers unlikeable mostly because of some of their roster. I like Pat Bev and he did work for the Rockets. It's Kawhi and PG I don't like actually as well as the way they treated Harrell+Lou Williams and how they handled their meltdown last season.
Yeah they belong to Lou Williams and the Hawks lol
Lou ‘I can promise you that’ F’in Williams
You got pushed to 6 games by Lou Williams my guy. You swept 1/3 series prior to facing us. You definitely would have won but let’s not get too cocky here.
Montrez Harrell and Lou Williams are so bad on defence they are at times unplayable in the Playoffs.   Doc Rivers can't make adjustments
Lou “I guess I’m Starting Now” Williams
"&gt;""I don't know how this got interpreted as a diss to Toronto. Canada was and is a dope place to play, but it has its challenges. Any player on your current team will echo that.   So that's not a diss. It's just a fact that playing in Toronto is unlike playing for any other team in the NBA. That was the point. No diss. No disrespect.""  https://www.blogto.com/sports_play/2019/06/former-toronto-raptor-lou-williams-didnt-mean-diss-canada/"
Yeah because everyone wants to see Lou Williams vs Kris Middleton
"Hawks have a 100% record with Lou Williams as starting PG, can't argue with those stats."
How funny will it be if he's not and Lou Williams leads the Hawks to an NBA Championship? I'm here for it!!!!
This right here.  Everybody who shits on Lou  Williams over the last 3 years didn't watch that clippers/warriors series.
"Bud should be fired for the way he runs an offense and not making adjustments. Giannis demands 2-3 guys in the paint and he still can run sets that get guys open shots. Also, he does not make adjustments from game to game, if Trae young or Lou Williams is out there they won’t run action to the weakest defender. I’ve heard them say bucks just stick to the way they play.   That being said, whoever built this roster is part of the  blame. How do you not have shooters around Giannis?  Jrue is average at shooting, Khris is good but not great, then Giannis is kicking it out to Bobby Portis and Lopez for open 3s. Also they want you to think Forbes is some great 3 pt specialist and he’s not. Bucks depth and bench are garbage."
Buds place in the nba is as others said—a floor raiser. Unfortunately that’s the best he can do he’s not capable of taking them to the next level.  That does have a place in the nba in the sense that there are many teams that would love to be good enough to make the playoffs. Bud provides that. I bet if he was coaching New Orleans last year they’re probably .500? Not good for this level though   Agree doc is super overrated. He’s had great/good teams every year pretty much since that Celtics championship.  Some will say it was thibs defense as an assistant that helped win that title anyway. His teams are mentally weak and he loses big leads as we’ve seen  His best coaching job was the year before clippers got kawhi and pg. they had SGA Gallo Lou Williams etc and they made the playoffs as just a fun team.
"Don't forget Lou Williams leaving the bubble to get some wings, but got some breasts and thighs on the side."
The Bucks pick and roll defense is terrible. It's one thing for Trae to abuse you but Lou Williams was doing a lot of the same stuff.   Lopez has to be upgraded eventually for them
Yep. If plan A doesn’t work there’s no plan B. There’s a lot of armchair coaches on Reddit but you would think a good nba caliber coach would have a plan to exploit Trae young and Lou Williams bad defense and have a defensive scheme other than switch pnr and have your bigs guard guards but that looks like the game plan.

"I can tell you didn’t watch the game. The reason the defense was amazing last night was because Coach Nate finally played Cam Reddish who is an elite defender in this league, and he played OO more minutes who is our best defender against Giannis. You really think Lou Williams is any better at defense that Trae lmao?"
"Lou Williams has only made about 80 million in his career, so unless he invested really well, he probably can’t actually afford to be eating wings right now."
And I just found out the other night that Lou Williams has never made over $10million per year in his entire career. That's pretty mind boggling.
i cant believe lou williams scored 50 pts
"I don't want to say that this year's title is going to have an asterisk, but...  When a team wins Game 4 of the ECF with its top four scorers being the corpse of Lou Williams, a Bogdanovic, Huerter, and Clint Capela, you can't help but think it."
"I think this is more what I was getting at. Either Jrue isn't a top 30ish player, or Khris isn't, or something. But they can't both be on-ball top-30 guys surrounded by a good defense and still be underdogs to a team whose best player is... John Collins? Kevin Huerter? Lou Williams?"
Even the Hawks take isn't good.  Lou Williams is an awful individual defender just as Trae is.  Neither of them are making a difference guarding PJ Tucker and Pat Connaughton
"Hawks take is absolutely not sensible, Lou Williams is the exact same.  Cam Reddish playing tonight was the difference."
Lou Williams - 7 million   kevin huerter - 2.6 million   John Collins- 2.7 million   clint capela- 15.5 million   bogdan bogdanovic- 18 million   Ummmm should I even put the bucks starting 5 salary? Lol
"NBA players Game 4 reactions on Lou Williams :      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNplKF6Dqzk"
"The Hawks are built around Trae??? They still have Khris and Jrue who are all stars. Brook Lopez has good scoring ability.   Kevin Huerter, Bogdan, and Lou Williams are the Hawks playmakers. The rest is Gallo doing his weird shit.   The offense does not get barely worse tf. They lost 29 and 10."
Melo in the stop snitching video  Lou Williams and his wings
NBA reactions on Lou Williams big game tonight:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNplKF6Dqzk
"&gt;Again, there are fake narratives as it pertains to Luka because of people who love their great white hope.  Yeah I see now. This was never going to be a logical discussion.  &gt; No you don’t, ha. It’s not even close and that’s ok. I’m sure you’re good at other things in life though.   You're right about one thing. It's not close. But it's not in favor of you. But keep talking about your players with one liners in arguments like ""John Collins can't stay out of foul trouble"" and ""Lou Williams sucks at defense"" as such robust analysis.  I see you conveniently deleted your earlier post. Get some rest bud."
Lou Williams is a great offensive player
"nah, I rather watch Cameron Payne vs Lou Williams than KD vs LeBron. Lmao what is this question"
"I really like Lou Williams and would love nothing more than to defend this position, but No."
"Lou Williams is at best a wash defensively compared to Trae.  The biggest difference is Cam finally gotten significant minutes over Solo, Bogi looked a lot better on his bum knee tonight, and OO had great minutes against Giannis again"
And 2021 Lou Williams was starting
"I think it's kind of a toss up, maybe leaning towards the hawks. Jrue has been a no show in half the games this post season and Khris is super inconsistent. If he gets hot he could get them out of the conference finals but I don't know how likely that is. Lou Williams probably won't repeat his performance tonight and without Trae, the hawks playmaking is pretty iffy."
"Y’all realize we were starting Lou Williams, who is just as bad at defense right? Hawks just play team defense well, credit to Nate McMillan for that"
"We're replacing Trae's defense with Lou Williams, even if it is a net benefit on defense it's certainly not a large one."
There is no significant upgrade playing Lou Williams over Trae Young on the defensive end
"Who would have thought, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson being the best microwaves these playoffs.  Every contender needs a microwave on the bench, someone who can get hot all of a sudden to help carry missing offense, or to break a game wide-open into a blowout, turning an 8 point lead, into an 18 point lead with your starters sitting."
Lou “7 for 9” Williams
Lou Williams!
Playoff starter Lou Williams best player in NBA history
"Finally a coach with a smart enough brain to start Lou Williams. I remember when he was on the Lakers and all they had were [scrubs](https://i.redd.it/azb0lc5jowqz.jpg). Lou was the best player on the team by a mile, and dumbass Luke Walton still brought him off the bench. It was asinine as there was no other reason besides some unknown reason he is labeled as the sixth man."
Lou williams is a very poor man's Trae so the offense and defense can basically be ran the same. Giannjs missing changes everything.
Dude is getting cooked by Lou Williams lmfao
"Are you saying Lou Williams, who took Trae's minutes, is a better defender than Trae?  Or do you think that maybe Cam Reddish taking Solo Hill's minutes has a bigger impact (positively) on the defense?"
Fuck lou williams sound like he 17 years old fucking mad bitches
Lou Williams voice doesn't match his stature
Did not expect Lou Williams voice to be that high lol
Ima get a 20 piece lemon pepper from a strip club in honor of lou williams
Lou Williams vs Reggie Jackson in the finals is gonna be crazy.
"Hawks bench is elite - Lou Williams, Danilo"
Lou Williams is outplaying this fraud Giannis. Superstar my ass...cry Bucks lmao
"If the Hawks make the finals, than Lou Williams vs either Clippers or CP3 for players that couldn't win it all under Doc Rivers.  Doc Rivers must have the worst timeline right now. Even more than Bud, who deserves his own worst timeline."
And this year’s finals MVP Lou Williams
A Gallinari and Lou Williams led team is a fun team
What a shit show of a season. I’m gonna have to watch Reggie Jackson tear up lou Williams in the finals. God dammit
Who needs Trae Young when you’ve got…Lou Williams?
"Lou “ Booming outta South Gwinett, Six Man, Two girls and they get along” Williams &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rondo"
"From what I’m seeing, hawks are shooting 50% while bucks 38, also Lou Williams stepping up in trae young’s place"
How did lou williams go from looking unplayable in the playoffs for a lot of his career to this
5 players over 20 points? What?  Not a single player on either team has 20 points... Game high is Lou williams with 19
Lou Magic Johnson Williams
Bro having Lou Williams on your team most feel good.  Team looks more cohesive out there and everyone is getting involved . It's a blast watching Lou Will.
Lou “Trae Young” Williams
Lou Williams is playing amazing basketball right now.
"Lou ""Trae Young"" Williams"
Can Lou Williams like not fucking aimbot please and thank you
[Lou Williams rn](https://youtu.be/V4KBJF0fkZY)
"Clint Capela yelled, “There you go!” Nate Mcmillan gave a look of pleasant surprise red velvet belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Lou Williams hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Trae Young hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Lou Williams looks like a young Bubbs from The Wire.
Lou Williams 🙌🏿🙌🏿
Traes minutes are getting replaced by Lou Williams who is an even worse defender. Cam finally playing is helping and the bucks are just straight up playing bad
"I'm totally ok with the Hawks winning because Lou Williams goes bananas, but I'm strangely not ok with Trae Young doing the same."
Lou Williams has more offensive rebounds than Giannis this game.
streets saying giannis getting clamped by lou williams? 🤔
Its not like Lou Williams is that much of a better defender than Trae Young.  This Bucks team makes me want to kill someone.
noted playoff underperformer Lou Williams is perfect rn
Lou Williams 😤
Has Lou Williams aged a day in the last 10 years?
If the Bucks are down less than 10 at halftime they'll win this. Lou Williams is not going to play at this level for 40 minutes.
"lou williams hasnt missed a shot yet, macmillian should demote and promote him to starter before every game"
Lou Williams legacy game incoming
Lou Williams on the oglass lmao
did Lou Williams just get an offensive rebound
Thought Lou Williams was lining up the deep 3 there for a second before that Bogie 3
That’s literally my point. They look the exact same with a 34 yr old Lou fucking Williams running the team. I never said Lou was a good defender. I said Trae has a net zero impact
Just FYI Lou Williams dropped 50 on the 2017-18 Warriors
If the Hawks pull this out Lou Williams will never have to pay for wings in ATL again.
lmao Lou Williams instead of playing for the Clippers is playing for the Hawks
Lou williams going off what u watching
"When playoff McMillian has Playoff Lou Williams, they cancel each other out"
I’ll never be surprised by seeing Lou Williams on any team. If I somehow caught a BC Spartek Pleven game and Lou was out there I’d just be like “alright.”
Ironically Lou Williams is saving the hawks rn lol
Lou Williams is a bucket
"Lou ""bad in the playoffs"" williams"
Lou Williams hits two bad shots and now it’s a 2 point game instead of 10.
Holy fuck I love Lou Williams
Lol I didn’t even realize Lou Williams was on this team lmao
"Fuck, not lou williams. Dude kills my teams"
Quickley is already as good as Prime Lou Williams... wow
"This is going to be a fun series. Also, Lou Williams is on the Hawks? When did that happen?"
Does Payne look a bit like Lou Williams or is it just me?
"Harden wasn’t suspended. Kyrie wasn’t suspended. Hell, Lou Williams wasn’t suspended in the bubble for going to a strip club    This is a non story"
He’ll know the projected starting five and then Lou Williams off the bench for the Hawks at least
"I’m using something called ‘hyperbole’. It’s exaggeration used to illustrate a point, something that is taught in 5th grade or so.   It doesn’t matter if the event was distanced, tested, or required a full colonoscopy and endoscopy before attending. He was not supposed to be there and should be punished just like Lou Williams was when he wanted some Lemon Pepper Lou and like Richaun Holmes was when he took 4 steps out of the bubble to grab a food delivery. All of them were wrong, all should be punished, only 2/3 were."
"Ant needs to get some pointers from Norman on slashing into the paint with confidence. Once he can do that regularly, and the defender has to back up a bit to respect his first step, but then cannot challenge his quick release, Ant would be literally unguardable. He could continue to suck at defense for the rest of his life and he still would be guaranteed at least 6th man money for the next 10 years a la Jordan Clarkson or Lou Williams."
Clippers would be up rn if they had Lou Williams. Appreciate that trade.
"Rajon Rondo is the reason the Clippers are at least making the WCF this year. If they hadn't made that trade and kept Lou Williams, Mavs/Jazz would eliminate them."
"I could see that argument about Paul George or Patrick Beverly, but Lou Williams is pretty well liked throughout the league"
"He is, but it's like parts of Lou Williams career. He just works better off the bench."
I can see Herro being a Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford type role
Oh so Lou Williams can’t get wings at his favorite strip club but Lebron can go to his tequila party? DOUBLE STANDARD/s
"Bring back rights for defensive players. Offensive players should not be able to encroach on a defensive players space and has a foul called in their favor. It rewards bad offense.   Lou Williams, James Harden, Trae Young, and Lillard are all craftsmen to varying degrees. I don’t blame them for it but it sucks to watch (doubt I’m saying anything controversial here)"
Lol Lou Williams isn't and never has been even close to as impactful as Ben Wallace.
"That would only make sense if Lou Williams had won the scoring title 4x or so. But he has 0, and in his best scoring season, he was 14th in the league."
You’re comparing Ben Wallace to Melo when you should be comparing him to Lou Williams
"IMO CP3 is way worse than Harden (or at least was, Phoenix' game are too late for me), Harden at least draws foul trying to be agressive, CP3 is like ""welp my team is in the bonus instead of playing basketball imma run in front of someone and stop so he runs into me).  Also should've mentionned Lou Williams"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"I would agree that Lou is our backup ball handler, but it doesn't feel right referring to him as our PG.  Also, small sample size, but our highest ORTG/overall net bench lineup on the year was actually our Williams/Capela/Hill/Bogi/Goodwin lineup with pretty insane 148 ORTG and 98 DRTG."
I love Rose.. but Jordan Clarkson will win the 6th man Award this year without even a competition. That man been on another level coming off the bench. Somehow HE became one of the key reasons the Jazz been so crazy good this regular season.  &gt;  Clarkson just doesn't do anything but getting mad buckets as the 6th man.. Like a taller Lou Williams
"Clarkson shouldn't win, but when Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford are tied for the most 6MOTY's (compared to Ginobili's one and Iguodala's zero), there's no reason to think he won't win, nor is there any reason for a Jazz fan such as yourself to be upset about it."
Wait so the Utah Jazz have a Sixth man and a Seventh man... bruh  This reminds me of Schroeder going against Lou Williams and Trezz for 6th man
I think Lou Williams may have that locked up.
RoLo’s the Lou Williams of big men. Instant offense off the bench
That’s Lou Williams sir
I like Manu for his titles but Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford also deserve recognition as the only 3x winners of 6MOTY.
"Who needs step back when you can step forward  --Lou Williams, probably"
Have a special episode with Lou Williams eating wings in Atlanta strip clubs.
Lamelos Lou Williams level defense getting exposed this game.
"- MVP: Stanley Johnson  - ROY: Theo Maledon  - DPOY: Lou Williams  - MIP: Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  - 6MOY: Sekou Doumbouya  - COY: Mark Daigneault (according to Charles Barkley ""Who?"")"
matched up against lou williams every play because doc is stupid
Ingles is more of a Ginobli and Clarkson is more of a Lou Williams.
"I don't think pure scorer is a term reserved for people who can *only* score. IMO, its more about the variety of arsenal and tools a player has to put the ball in the basket. While LeBron scores a lot, he's not going to give you a double crossover step back 3 routinely like Luka, Harden, Durant and even Lou Williams will. LeBron is a physically gifted dude who gets most of his points largely from attacking the rim, cuts, simple pull up jumpers.  The ways in which he can score, and how good he is at them are relatively limited. Luka on the other hand can score in almost every imaginable ways. He has the most drives (and layups finished, IIRC) this season. He can go one on one at the perimeter, inside the perimeter, use the pick and roll, break the pick and roll, take on double teams and give it to you in all imaginable ways. He's mastered almost every aspect of scoring (much like Harden)."
They also got Lou Williams and Capela
I don’t understand why DPOY and two top candidates for 6th man should hurt Snyder in the COTY category.  Especially when Gobert was drafted as a project and the. molded into multi DPOY at least in part thanks to Snyder.  Joe had 1 foot out of the door on his way out of the league when Snyder got him and helped turn him into the best Australian in the league (that’s right Ben you heard me).  And Clarkson was a proverbial chucker who Snyder has reinvented into the newest bench scoring sensation a la Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford.  Those are all reasons I would say point toward Snyder as being a deserving recipient rather than excuses to take it away.
"Luka Doncic is a pure scorer, the dude averaged 29 a game in his sophomore season. I mean, people consider Lou Williams to be a pure scorer, and Luka is miles above Lou."
"For the Hawks it's gotta be Lou Williams for me. He's probably gonna be tired, and rationally I understand we need a younger back up PG option, but MAN I love that dude. Home town guy, certified bucket, and endless meme potential."
Lou Williams
At one point some people legit thought Lou Williams was a better player
Jamison has a lower chance than non-all star/sixth man extraordinaires like Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams.  He'd need to suddenly become popular in retirement for people to care about his career accomplishments and to pretend that he was actually a great player in his day.
They usually temper the whistle in the playoffs. This is why Lou Williams is useless to a playoff team
"There’s no bubble, Doc Rivers, Montrezl Harrell or Lou Williams this time. It took all of these things in unprecedented circumstances for them to lose in the 2nd round in which a lot of people like to conveniently forget they were up 3-1 in, they didn’t get that lead by accident.   A championship coach in Lue who’s willing to adjust and a motivated Kawhi and PG along with veteran teammates in Rondo, Ibaka and Batum won’t let that happen.  The Clippers will sweep the Blazers and at worst will win in 5 games if any NBA fan has paid attention to the complete matchup advantage they have they wouldn’t even fantasize about an upset because barring injuries there’s no chance the Blazers even push that series to 6 let alone win."
Poole Party is gonna be like Lou Williams but with less lemon pepper wings and more of whatever gen Z kids are into right now
"You know, 6MOTY potential feels right. Strikes me as a Lou Williams-type of guy, can be really productive off the bench even if he never develops much defensive presence."
They should create a team around Lou Williams then.
"I think that is why certain players excel in the regular season and underperform in the postseason. Imo, Lou Williams and James Harden are two examples."
"&gt;Your entire comments are literally “I didn’t watch it and can’t reference any play or game, but here’s why it’s impossible.  Not once did I imply anything of the sort.  If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him. He’s the second best post scorer in the league behind Embiid and in addition takes guys off the dribble quite often. He’s an elite, three level scorer which includes taking it to the rim, among other things.   I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a *positional mismatch*. A great example is LeBron targeting Lou Williams in those Lakers/Clippers matchups.  Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence. A targeted offence would have Jokic posting up Jordan Clarkson, Mike Conley and the like. Don’t get me wrong, Gobert can’t guard Jokic effectively. But Clarkson *definitely* can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent. Think of it this way: if Utah had the choice between Jokic posting up Gobert or posting up Donavon Mitchell, which one do you think they’d prefer? Obviously neither can stop him. But I think we both know who’d have a better chance at slowing him down. A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s *least* preferred defender.  Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?"
Lou Williams
Lou Williams dialing Colin’s number
"I think his case for usefulness is basically figuring out if he's Kyrie Irving or Lou Williams. He's not a playmaker, he's just a flat out undersized scorer so the question is will his scoring, particularly his ISO scoring, hold up in the playoffs? Because then he would still be very useful.  My feeling is it's not going to hold up to a Kyrie level based off the eye test.. he doesn't have that skill level that Kyrie has. Sexton compensates by playing hard and credit to him for that. But eh honestly I don't know and we may not know for a long time because it may be a while until he makes the playoffs."
"He facilitates well when he's given the keys to the offense, which the team prefers Garland who is a better natural passer. He plays defense and with a ton of effort actually. So I don't know where you got that from. Our defense is definitively worse with him off the court. He's no Lou Williams, where sometimes team's defenses got better with him on the bench. Shoot well is demonstrably false. He can be streaky but he's a solid shooter and often has to create his own shot. He has started off slow this year but he is by no means unable to shoot. You don't shoot 40% from 3 on catch and shoots by being unable to shoot."
Sexton is absolutely not worth that contract lol  Closer to Lou Williams than a max player
"that lou williams sneaky good jab step, a classic"
"I was just thinking this the other day. Trae is a franchise altering pick. Collins at 19 is excellent, Huerter in the same slot is great. Hunter and Reddish are great wings from the early and late lotto. I like Okongwu a lot though he still needs to prove himself.   Bogdanovic and Capela are excellent pickups via free agency &amp; trade.  Gallo seems like a misstep, Lou Williams seems like an odd fit. But outside of those moves, everything would garner an A- or better from me."
He got Louis Williams for him straight up and Sweet Lou has been great for you I thought.
Lou Williams only played a year with the Raptors.  He wasn’t even apart of the 2016 run.
Oh yeah no way 6th men of the year have ever been bad in the playoffs before    *glares at Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams
Lou Williams
Isnt wings over rings like an onion spoof on the lou williams chicken wing story?   I think youre thinking about streetlights instead of spotlights
"I think you have to look at actual vs plausible outcomes when evaluating a trade.  In this case, we saw a season of a plausible outcome, where Blake is an all-star player and gets the Pistons to the playoffs.  It was definitely plausible at the time of the trade that he stays healthy and really good through the rest of his contract when he'd be 32.  Injuries unfortunately meant we didn't get to see that as an actual outcome for the rest of the contract, but that's just evaluating the trade with the benefit of hindsight.    It's also only with the hindsight that Kawhi and PG got to the LAC that we shit on the Pistons.  If they swing and miss in the free agent market, then they traded away Blake to live in the land of mediocrity where Pat Bev or Lou Williams is still perhaps the face of their .500 team.  Not what I'd call ""worst trade of all time"" or even sniffing the top 10 or 20.  But that's way different than something like the Nets trade back in the day - https://nesn.com/2017/08/celtics-final-haul-from-2013-nets-trade-truly-is-a-sight-to-behold/  It was at best a huuuge stretch for it be plausible that Garnett and Pierce were worth first rounders, and it was never plausible that 37 year old Garnett and 34 year-old Pierce would keep the Nets good (or even be in the league) through the length of that trade, which included first round picks through 2018.  Then the actual outcome was pretty much worst case scenario of the Nets bottoming out while their picks built Boston into a contender.  The Nets got suckered due to their new owner being bad and pushing for something splashy to sell tickets.  That's one of the worst trades of all time.  Another terrible one is definitely the Kyrie-IT trade.  Cavs management just immediately caved not only to Kyrie being traded (had enough years left on his contract they could have just ignored the demand, rolled the dice on him playing eventually), but they also traded him to exactly where he wanted to be traded, which was one of their biggest contenders, and almost certainly did not get the best package they might have received for him.  That trade was obviously bad and panicky for the Cavs at the time, and only reason it doesn't get brought up more is that Kyrie's time in Boston went poorly, and the KD-Warriors kind of made the Cavs diminished capacity (and league parity in general) a non-issue that last year of Lebron on the Cavs."
Probably just an angry person in general. For what it’s worth I think coby should start trying to be our Lou Williams and find a true PG to take his spot at the starting 1.

"""I think if it's one, then it is Lou Will. What's the best they could get for him as an expiring? **A floor general and playmaker is what they need** and I think the best they could flip Lou for would be someone like Michael Carter-Williams who can be their playmaker and he is still under 30. **I don't think they can get a floor general mid season anyway**, so until they can sign someone in the offseason (like Lowry that can solve their issues), that's what I think is best.""  So...."
"Nah Terry has been legitimately good this year. His on the ball shenanigans have been limited, he can be a sparkplug or a late clock option in the offense when we need him to be but now that we have Hayward/LaMelo he's mostly off-ball and hunting spot-up looks. He has a knack for hitting difficult shots and creating things out of nowhere in a way that really helps our team - it's like a Lou Williams type role. Quite frankly I don't give a shit what the on/off numbers say, he's been better than Devonte this season (who's been forcing up difficult shots that he can't hit consistently)."
win win. we get morris and you guys get the next lou williams
"Just switched from Lakers - Nuggets, Clippers up 20+ without Kawhi and PG?   Lou Williams having himself a night or what?"
At least 2 of the smarts would be flopping at all times so I got Lou Williams

Lou Williams. Three time 6th man of the year. Never an all star.
Celtics bench has been trash for a couple of years. they desperately need depth. maybe Lou Williams has something left in the tank
"COTY is always the ""we didn't expect you to this so you get the award"" THe 6moy is easy since the usual candidates all had turnover. 2 of them on the lakers one as a starter and Lou Williams has been visited by Father Time"
&gt; Would the Celtics want Lou Williams for their bench depth?  I don't understand why any team with championship aspirations would want Lou Williams.  He's historically flat out trash in the postseason.
Would the Celtics want Lou Williams for their bench depth? But maybe they’d go for another wing defender/big man
Would you have said Lou Williams was a borderline All Star last time he won 6MOY? It’s really hard to properly evaluate skill when a player mostly plays against bench players. You’d have to put Clarkson into the starting lineup and see how he fared before even considering him being an All Star imo
"Lou Williams issue is that if he's not scoring a bunch then you don't have that good offense to offset his bad defense. But he's 34, father time comes for everyone, and small guards don't tend to age well. Lou is now the same age Allen Iverson was when teams stopped offering him contracts and his career ended. This might be Lou's last year."
"I was at the game when Eric Bledsoe [flopped](https://youtu.be/Ar-3r24sshI) when Lou Williams drove past him. It got challenged, there was absolutely no contact, and if they’re was, it was because Bledsoe put his face in the way of Lou’s drive (blocking foul on his face?). The refs decided that they liked they’re call on the floor.  They would rather lose all of their credibility than admit that they were wrong."
"Sure. That’s all fair and true, but that’s not how people talked about Book: a young player who just needs to keep improving. He was talked about as if scoring a bunch on a bad team MADE him a bad player. I think we’re forgetting how much Book has changed the narrative about himself. I know it’s Reddit but I had a guy LAST YEAR tell me that Book COULD end up as a Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford type. And people thought things like that solely because he was on awful teams. Not really fair. Watching it from a suns fan perspective is made me think more openly about guys on bad teams, trying to give them a fair shake."
&gt; Lou Williams (maybe less so now) &gt;   Is he really a role player though? Doesn't have a role player type of game at all.
"Underrated:  * Royce O’Neal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It’s like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
"The argument you just made for the stat being bullshit also proves that Harden had a far better supporting cast and therefore shouldn't be credited for winning more games than Westbrook that season.  As you said, Harden's backups were Lou Williams and Eric Gordon while Westbrook's was a no name that never played in the NBA again."
Book is just another Lou Williams. Maybe could be a 6th man on a really good team.
"Sixers fans used to really REALLY hate Lou Williams mostly because when Doug Collins was coach, our offense consisted of ISO Lou off the bench. 2011-12 Sixers were the saddest team in NBA history to make it out of the first round."
I specifically said the Spurs series because I feel that’s where he made the most money. Of course they were more important over the course of an entire season because they played more minutes.   Daryl Morey clearly saw enough to offer him a max contract because he realized they couldn’t comfortably pay him and keep Russell Westbrook/Serge Ibaka  You might think Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford are scrubs because they come/came off the bench but I gotta disagree.
So lou williams and Jamal Crawford are just the shit right?  Harden definitely wasn't as important as Durant and Westbrook don't fool yourself lmfao
AD cooks Gobert in the regular season (and the bubble)  Jazz regular season defense won't translate to the playoffs (AD's play will though trust me)  Clarkson will turn into Lou Williams come the playoffs for some reason  great analysis

Because there’s only so many things you can work on. As a role player today your priorities should be not being a weakness on perimeter defense and being able to shoot threes. Danny Green is far more valuable in today’s NBA than Lou Williams even though Lou can make plays off the dribble
Idk if it’s expected or not but Lou Williams.
"smh he doesnt even play defense, at least Lou Williams tries"
"would absolutely love that, Coby can be the Lou Williams type player and maybe go small with all 3 together in some rotations, Lonzo can prob guard the 3"
So Lou Williams for DPOY?
"Have you not heard the story?   In the beginning, Kawhi created the mid-range jumpers and the boards. The boards were without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the rebounds. And the spirit of Kawhi was hovering over the face of the boards.   Then Kawhi said, “let there be laugh” and there was laugh. And Kawhi saw the laugh, that it was good; and Kawhi divided the laugh from the sad. Kawhi called the laugh “heh uhhhh he huh” and the sad he called “Lou Williams.”"
"Lowry is an obvious great choice but I don't think Clippers have assets to offer, unfortunately. Malcolm Brogdon could be dope if the Clippers could find a way to match salaries, I don't think the Pacers can claim to be trying to contend this year or next. I would love to dish [Lou Williams and Marcus Morris for Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yxdjjcv6), but I don't think that would help the Pacers enough."
Lou Williams and Lemon Pepper Wings
"Just looking at some of the oldest players still in the league that likely could be had for cheap:  Iguodala (37)  Marc Gasol (36)  Carmelo (36)  JJ Redick (36)  Ariza (35)  Dwight (35)  Lou Williams (34)  Deandre Jordan (32)  Derrick Rose (32)  Blake Griffin (31)  Boogie (30)       The question is does he realize potential primes? like for the Celtics he could bring back Kemba, but does Tacko Fall become an even larger KG? or does he even reach current Dwight Howard level? or is it based on Prime that has actually happened to this date?       Either way,  Gasol/Boogie/Derrick Rose/Blake Griffin + Time Lord would pretty much be unstoppable. And that lineup is only $49m this year (2.5+2.5+8+36m) or only $15m if you take Melo instead of Blake.  So id still have over $95m to make a roster which i could make another super team out of and even if i bench Timelord, the old fellas are still competent role players without the Time Boost"
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Does anybody see Lou Williams back on the raps? Or is the bridge burned or too costly?
Go to bulls reddit.   It went from 10% of us had had it with him to 80%.   Dude is terrible and only a miracle makes him Lou Williams.
Do you know Math? Lou Williams had 10 in 2018.
8 steals hasn’t been done since Lou Williams* in 2018
"To play devil's advocate, if the Clippers were interested in trading Beverley and had talked to teams about trading him, it wouldn't have to be the Clippers who were leaking the story, it could be any of those other teams. Also, it does make some sense as to why the Clippers might be looking to move on from Beverley, given his age and how he's always injured (as he is right now).   On top of that, he's probably the most valuable trade asset the Clippers have that they'd actually be willing to move. They don't have any 1st round picks to offer, none of their youngest guys are thought of as great prospects (and they're all on tiny contracts anyway), Morris and Kennard are on giant contracts now, PG is untradeable this season because of his extension, they won't trade Kawhi or Ibaka, and I can't imagine they'd be willing to trade Zubac either. Batum and Reggie Jackson are on minimum deals, and Lou Williams is probably a risk to just retire at the end of the year.  So if the Clippers were in fact looking to make some kind of trade to upgrade the roster, Beverley is pretty much all that's left simply by process of elimination. So if you told me the Clippers weren't even looking to make any trades at all, then sure, obviously the Beverley rumor is BS. But if the Clippers are in fact looking to deal, who else is more likely to get moved than he is?"
"The headline of this post is just straight up wrong.  &gt; Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well  According to the unsourced Bleacher Report article... there's just one person who's ""ready"" to move on from Pat Bev?  Also it's strange to see that it's ""widely known"" Lou Will is available when that article is the only source saying that, sort of the opposite of ""widely known.""  Call me crazy but I don't know if a site called AHN Fire Digital quoting a speculative trade article from Bleacher Report is the best source for info..."
"&gt; “Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there’s a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well,” Fischer wrote.  Setting aside the source is a Bleacher Report article with little credibility, saying ""there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on"" is not even close to the Clippers making widely know Bev is available. Y'all stupid as fuck."
"&gt; i dont understand why they would  It's because the Clippers really have almost nothing to offer teams in trades to upgrade the roster and because Bev is 32 and is seemingly always injured. As a Clipper fan do you feel like right now as is the Clippers have this year's championship roster? Or do you feel like they probably need to make some tweaks. Because if it's the latter, then what exactly can they do to upgrade things?   The Clippers don't have any 1st round picks, and what players on the roster would they actually be willing to trade that other teams would really be interested in? Lou Williams has no real value cause he's 34 and expiring and very possibly may just retire, so what else is there? It's Beverley basically by process of elimination, unless you guys are willing to move Zubac (which I don't think you are).  So if you're the Clippers and you're looking at the roster and you're thinking ""we need to make changes"" then Beverley is the most logical place to start."
"&gt; he can shoot better than Rubio and plays decent defense  What's the argument then for why the Clippers suddenly get ""insanely dangerous"" if they downgrade at shooting and defense with Rubio instead of Beverley? Also, keep in mind that because of the hard cap a straight swap of Rubio for Beverley doesn't work, the Clippers would also have to add either Lou Williams to the trade, or both of Patrick Patterson and Daniel Oturu (while being unable to spend any money to replace those two empty roster spots because of the hard cap)."
with george's injury they probably hang onto lou williams now. between him and beverley/zubac i can't see them acquiring a better player due to no draft picks
No but for Lou Williams yeah the dude prioritizes chicken wings over hooping. He should retire as soon as his contract is up tbh
"&gt; i think he would fit right in  Except when it comes to the salary cap. A Clippers trade for Kevin Love is nearly impossible because of Love's huge salary, unless the Clippers want to send [Beverley, Lou Williams and Marcus Morris to Cleveland.](https://tradenba.com/trades/rjzVz1BpP) I'm guessing the Clippers don't want to give all that up for Love though. Another possibility is [Bev, Lou, Zubac and PPat for Love,](https://tradenba.com/trades/RFTRrmMmP) and again, I'm guessing the Clippers won't want to gut their team like that just for Love, although the thought of the Cavs taking on yet another center is pretty hilarious."
"&gt; The whole basis of the trade is this quote: ""Los Angeles has made it widely known that Lou Williams is available, sources said, and there's a cohort in that front office ready to move on from Patrick Beverley as well."" No sources were cited.  You know this is the same language as all the Woj tweets right? Nobody second guesses him because everybody knows Woj is legit. So the question here is, do you trust BR?"
With what? Do the Wolves want 32 year old and always injured Pat Beverley or 34 year old and on the decline Lou Williams? Keep in mind the Clippers have zero 1st round picks to trade.
Do people realize that Lou Williams has literally been one of the worst players in the league this season? and Beverley has had 2 healthy seasons in his entire career
"What about the return of Raptors legend, Lou ""Maple Pepper"" Williams? Throw in Patrick Patterson and Ivica ""close enough to JV"" Zubac. We can probably get Amir from the G League for peanuts too. It's 2015 all over again."
"It’s so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De’Aaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
Celtics could use Lou Williams for scoring.
Pretty sure there’s not really enticing offers around. Why not just compete? I rather keep what we have than just give him away for Lou Williams. That’s bs. Someone needs to pay a 1st and decent  legit prospect. If lowry wants to go that’s fine but pretty damn sure he’s happy here. Better be worth it
Lou Williams is 34 damn did not think he was that old
Lou Williams &gt; Arvydas sabonis from some dude on here 10 minutes ago
I would love for Atlanta to trade and get Lou Williams for Rondo and Atlanta pick up an extra draft pick.
Lou Williams &gt; Arvydas Sabonis  Greatest scorer to come off the bench.
Sounds like a shit show over Lou Williams of all people.
"I think Grant Williams has improved SO much. He shoots well now and defends with confidence. He will be even better when his reputation grows a bit and he stops getting the Theis treatment from the zebras lol.  I don't have anyone in particular in mind tbh. We need a PG who can just carry the scoring load on the 2nd unit. Jrue Holiday or Lou Williams or whomever. And we need someone who can stand in the corner and knock down an open shot (Korver from 5 years ago or so).  If we can turn the three trade exceptions we have, Kemba, and 2-3 role players into someone like that then I think we have a chance. As presently constituted, not happening."
"Lou Williams, Manu, Jamal Crawford all great 6th men"
Bev is injured a lot and as much as I like Lou Williams he kinda sucks in the playoffs much like Jamal Crawford did.
"Lou Williams has said if he gets traded he'd retire. So, good luck."
"Wow, does anyone else feel kinda bad for Pat Bev and Lou Williams here? They both seemed to really like playing for the Clippers and really tried to make things work on the team. Now they're being shipped out and it's ""widely known"" lol..."
Lou Williams to the Cavaliers!?
They've been trying to get rid of Lou Williams all year lol
"And it’s still a stupid ass point because those 6th-15th men now have better training and science to help them. Bench players didn’t just magically evolve into better humans in 2 decades, health/training/science has just become more accessible so that you didn’t need to be a a Jordan level athlete naturally. Also the bench players back then weren’t asked to do what players today do. Roles have changed as have the rules.   Take an average bench player from the 90’s, let him grow up in the modern era with training etc and he will be just as good as any other player today. Like damn people here act like everyone on the bench today is Lou Williams, harrell or other semi star players. We have guys like bismack biyombo soaking up minutes on nba rosters lol"
That's a trade for Zubac and Beverley is a stopgap for the point guard position. Lou Williams is expiring. If they threw in a good second that seems like a good deal to me.
"He can't play more than 25 min and has to sit almost all b2bs. He might be better than a Lou Williams overall, but not by much. And Lou's contract is really high.   A MLE might be the most he could get"
This may be crazy because he's one of the best players on the team but I have Murray come off the bench here and be super Lou Williams
he was expected to be a great hustle guy but he's been damn near defense proof. just a super reliant 20-25 basically every game. dudes a full on bucket and it's great to see every time one of the hard working guys explodes past what people expected. fuck the people who said he'd only be Lou Williams if he's lucky.
but I was told he'd be lucky to be Lou Williams 🤣
Lou williams has more points than bill russell huh
They could try for Drose by just swapping him for Lou.   Derozan might not be impossible if the Spurs are fine on Morris/Bev and Lou Williams. He's an expiring and they could let him off for cheap since he doesn't have many trade destinations. The Clippers are one of the very few teams with the shooting and defense to where he fits.
"Kennard is ideally a sixth man who provides scoring, mostly off of PnR. I don’t really like the fit with Los Angeles since it doesn’t solve their issue of playmaking. He’s not a true playmaker imo - not someone who could run sets and initiate offense. He’s the same “playmaker” that Lou Williams is: he has the ability to make the right decision off of a PnR."
Because hes lou Williams without the offense.
Clarkson is who Lou Williams wishes he was
"No, Frank Vogel and the Laker front office did a much better job of understanding McGee's limitations and hiding them than Scott Brooks and the Wizards brain trust has of understanding and hiding Beal's. I watched a lot of Laker games last season and Vogel was careful to keep McGee out of high-leverage situations. But he did get work and contributions from McGee, mostly in the first half. He similarly found ways to capitalize on and protect Howard. Both wound up being consistently productive in their roles.  WS/48 to me is useful mainly in broadly categorizing guys. Guys recording 0.1s over a season are solid pros, 0.2s are stars and 0.3s are unicorns (specifically, Wilt, Kareem, MJ, Lebron and Steph). Anything below 0.1 is a scrub. Gradiations within those categories matter, e.g. a 0.19 is way better than a 0.11. In building a contender you want a couple of 0.2s to lead the team, and you try to fill out the rest of your starting lineup and ideally your first couple of off-the-bench rotation slots with 0.1s.   The point is, there's nothing about Beal's advanced metrics that says he's the kind of player you can build a contender around, and a lot to say he's better cast as a supporting starter/rotation component. My suspicion is he could be someone's Lou Williams, at best.  But circling back to WS/48, Beal's last year was better than anyone's on the Lakers except for the guys on the Laker front line. But if you add him to the team in place of, say, KCP, what problem have you solved? I can't think of any that really matter. OTOH, what problem have you created? Well, in addition to any money issues, Beal's a defensive liability who in a high-leverage playoff situation would be hunted as mercilessly on switches as the LouWills of this world. That doesn't really matter to the Wiz because they aren't in playoff games, but mis-casting a role-player as a star is a big part of the reason they're not in playoff games to begin with."
VanVleet&gt; Schroeder &gt; LeVert &gt; Dragic=Lou Williams &gt; Dinwiddie &gt;Clarkson
USA OLYMPICS STARTING 5  Alex caruso  Pandemic P  RJ Barret  JamesJohsnon (Carusos bodyguard 😈😈)  Montrezell   6th man: Lou williams
Vanvleet Dragic Schroeder  Lou Williams  Levert Dinwiddie    I think Schroeder and Lou Williams are interchangeable. But I like Schroeder defense better
"I think Dinwiddie is hard to judge being injured and he seemed to be still struggling with his post COVID recovery, so I'm going to leave him out.  I'd say: Dragic, VanVleet, Levert, Schroder, Lou Williams, Clarkson.   That's not to say who has the most trade value, but who is the best player out of the bunch."
"As good as Trae Young is, i think Jamal Murray is just more scalable in the playoffs.    Trae Young's defense is Lou Williams level"
Lou Williams + 4 seconds gained in the Kennard  trade for George Hill is a trade I like. Not sure if OKC does it though.
lou williams a certified loser
Has Lou Williams made a field goal today?
Dwight Howard gonna murder Lou Williams.
"Lou Williams, 0/5, -15 in only 10 minutes played"
Lou Williams is literally leaning into him and then falls over
Lou Williams is literally leaning into him. What is this shit
Lou Williams is absolute TRASH
Lou Williams is the Hawks second best player
"Luka had the best offense in the NBA last year and it persisted when he was on the bench. Every analyst had the Mavs above the Hawks this year, and now that Trae's team looks better suddenly Luka's team sucks and Trae is being carried by Kevin Huerter and Lou Williams."
Btw Nate really shouldnt take out Trae and Bogi both at the same time. Its pointless also this is what happens if you attack Lou Williams everytime when he is on the floor looks like finally Sixers doing that
Lou Williams playing like an idiot
Lou Williams is fool's gold. One of the worst volume Playoff performers in NBA history
lou williams bricking
lou williams is selling the bag right now
Lou Williams great one night and shit the next
"I love Lonnie. Athleticism for days. But I'm not sure his consistency or lack thereof is due to just playing time. He's the type of player that only works in select lineups. He can't be your primary ball handler and while he is active and puts in a lot of effort on defense he needs to be in a lineup with at least one above average help defender. I think he works best in the Patty, first off the bench, role. In an ideal world he has a Lou Williams career giving you 15-20 a night, leading the second unit, and ability to play in crunch time."
I could see that. Personally I went once when it was Lou Williams leading it and twice when Kawhi arrived. Dirt cheap all three times relative to the Lakers even though we were a worse team during some of those games.  Especially during the Lou Will days. I could actually almost pay for the courtside (or maybe that it was right behind the courtside) tickets but decided not to since I still needed to pay rent lol.
I mean Mitchell is a chucker you could probably put Lou Williams on him and have the same result
"Pop (he may have lost a step, but let's just include him based on his track record)  Steve Kerr (the growth of the warriors from Mark Jackson to him is proof of that)  Ty Lou (LeBron is great, and Ty couldn't have won a championship without him, but he has a great talent for making adjustments that is understated)  Erik Spoelstra (brilliant tactician, can get the most out of any roster)  Nick Nurse (same as Spo)  Rick Carlisle (same as Spo, NN)  Monty Williams (yes, Phoenix has CP3. Monty is still a great coach for a young and underperforming team)  I think Stephen Silas can get there but it's tough to tell.  I think that's it. I don't think Vogel can win a championship with any championship roster, I think he won because he got the bubble and a healthy LeBron and AD. I think Doc won in 08 because of KG, and can't win without another singular great player who won't let his team lose games. I think Thibs can't get there. Terry Stots can't. Bud can't. And who knows with Nash."
"CP3 was widely regarded as an old broke down player with a terrible contract when OKC got him.  Horford wasn't able to fit next to embiid in Philly.  Who knows with kemba because I agree with what you said.  But if they give him time to heal up, he could be a solid 6th man ala Lou Williams.  That is a fairly valuable asset."
"I dunno how much we have to see defense barely matter in the playoffs before we stop using it as a key factor in these comparisons.  The Hawks ran a closing lineup of Trae and Lou Williams vs the 6ers, the Nets even just with healthy KD and Kyrie were primed to roll to at least the Finals with a terrible defense. Kawhi and PG are supposed to be two of the best perimeter defenders in the league and were getting ripped in half on a nightly basis by Luka and Donovan Mitchell when they weren't injured."
"It's a little insulting to mention players in that team and not mention Lou Williams, dude played his heart out"
Lou Williams has the fastest free throw release
Lou Williams and Gallo are up there too.
This is even funnier after watching Lou Williams shooting free throws last night. Dude quick releases it like the ref is gonna come try and block it.
Trae young and Lou williams are highkey carrying this team on it's back. If they keep playing like this the hawks might actually make it in the finals.
"&gt; The Texan's owner is super-religious so his guy is a pastor. Cuban's ""language"" is cutting edge number-crunching and tech, so his guy is a crypto-enthusiast and gambler.  What's funny is that the Texans regressed this year and Dallas haven't won a series in a decade.  I get the need to use analytics but it seems like in basketball every year there is a random ""where did this come from"" game from a role player that you can't predict in any model (Jeff Green getting hot from 3, Lou Williams going off last night, Cameron Payne playing well against the Lakers).  Or a random injury that takes a guy out in a pivotal moment.  Sometimes you just have to be able to live in the moment and go with the hot hand and not be so married to analytics and metrics.  I feel like basketball is the ultimate momentum game.  Sometimes the snowball gets moving and just can't be stopped.    Basically what [KD said years ago](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1184140634208329728)"
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
Lou Williams was right when it came to nerds talking basketball. Voulgaris doesn't even look like he ever played a game of horse in his life.
"Not one second did I believe that Clint capela, John Collins, Lou Williams, Gallo, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish, fucking Bogdanovic  Is worse than Kleber, Brunson, THj, Josh Richardson, Dwight Powell, DFS.  Not one fucking second. Every GM would rather take the hawks core then and now, just like they would take Luka instead of Trae if they could choose right now.  Your just on a fucking mission and you fail to see how weirdly you spin your take. The mavs players are shit, their boxscores look ok because of Luka, and you then put the Luka inflated role player stats to say his team is better. Whatever  Trae is fucking lit anyway"
"Cool. Contracts aside... would you swap Tim Hardaway, Jr for Lou Williams? And have you seen Gallo try to create a shot with less than 5 seconds on the clock? It's like he's dribbling a neutron star. Bogi certainly makes timely shots, but is mostly dependent on good ball movement for those opportunities. Kevin Huerter has definitely been improving in this area, so I'll concede at the very least his  burgeoning status as a playmaker. But... come on... are any non-Hawks fans salivating over Kev and his 11.9 per?   THAT is what I am smoking. Wanna hit?"
Exactly right.    Ben Simmons is the anti-Lou Williams.
"CJ McCollum. Only reason it won't happen is it makes too much sense for both teams. Trade for CJ, try to sign Lowry in FA. Enjoy new championship contender.   Portland fixes its defensive issues. Gets someone who will play with pace in the transition game. Gets younger. They also need to get a Lou Williams type of spark plug in FA."
"No it wouldn't. They are a deep team. Capela is a great center that is a lob threat and good defender. Collins is a 4 that can shoot from outside and score inside. Bogdan is a versatile combo guard. Gallinari is one of the better bench players in the league and can shoot from anywhere with basically anyone guarding him. Huerter, Reddish, and Hunter all all decently good young players. Plus they picked up Lou Williams who can be useful in certain matchups.  The wizards third best player is probably Rui Hachimura or Davis Bertans. After them, their roster gets bad real quick. They're so bad that Daniel Gafford, a dude they basically picked up for free was a big game changer for them."
"Lou Williams has been involved in 2 giant comebacks the past 3 yrs. Still cant believe that Clippers/Warriors shit, 31 pt comeback in the 2nd half against a team with Draymond Green/Steph/Durant/Klay"
Lou Williams with more classic Lou Williams quotes
Lou Williams Shake Miltoned you guys
I heard Lou Williams has 2(!) beat reporters and they both know about each other and are ok with it.
Imagine thinking Lou Williams is a point guard but not Rondo
"For me I hated Paul, Griffin, Rivers, Beverly, and Lou Williams. But now they only have one of those left so they're actually really fun to watch"
"It really wasn’t an outlier game if you look at his career. Context is important. The Wizards aren’t even a legit playoff team, and the Hawks, while solid, aren’t anywhere close to a contender. I like Tobi a lot as a person but he does not show up in big games. He never has and his game is not built for the playoffs. He played like shit in game 4 also despite putting up 20 because he and the four bench guys out there with him were abysmal defensively. In the last two games that lineup recipe, along with other bench heavy lineups, has destroyed big leads for this team. That is more on Doc than it is on him obviously, and this series could be over if Doc was even a halfway decent coach. How he does not know that we fall apart every single time Jo sits is beyond comprehension. It’s like Doc is literally trying to erase leads or build deficits for the team instead of trying to mitigate damage while Embiid sits. Ironically, Tobi really only plays well under Doc and has been even more terrible in the playoffs without him.   In sum, we are never going to win with Doc as coach or Tobi as a second option. Again, I really like Tobi as a person, but he is not close to an all star despite what people see in the box score. He’s basically a big Lou Williams who’s not totally inept defensively all the time on a max contract. Trading rookie Shamet and picks just to be forced into maxing him may have effectively ended any chance the Sixers had at a championship. The Sixers have done a lot of other dumb things since Hinkie was forced to leave too, but that move was the most costly. Obviously, Ben is a big problem in the playoffs as well. But we didn’t give anything up for him, and while he’s clearly overrated and overpaid as well, he is at least moveable without giving up additional assets. I would be very surprised if Tobi is at this point."
"Lou Williams was really who won the game for them. Missed a three to start the fourth and then just went unconscious, hitting six straight shots in barely four minutes."
"Watched the whole entire game.   Philly was actually right, I mean give propr to Coach Rivers on this one, he put in the starters around the 10 minute mark in the fourth. He knew that the comeback was on.  Philly in the first made like every shot, while Coach Nate was pissed about that, he motivated and energized our guys in the 4th quarter. As behind a dark cloud there is a silver lining, Bogy and Huerter were trash, so that meant that Lou and Gallo had to step up and they did. They relied on each other, Trae still had trust on them, while they had trust on Trae. 57 seconds left, Gallo hit that fade away, Trae trusted in him, when I watched that live, I was really scared. But in the end he made it, because that was his game.  And that basically was the reason why they won, they kept playing their game, while Philly just looked gas. Seth Curry was tremendous, but would you really rely on him, to stop a comeback from happening. He was actually the reason why the Sixers lost the comeback on the defensive side atleast. He always gets tricked by Lou Williams, and always got to defend Gallo. He gotta up his hustle, but yeah he did hit his shots, so he still contributed a lot. I mean 36 points by Seth shouldn't happen, but it was just his night,  &amp;#x200B;  We also outsmarted them on both the offensive end and defensive end in the fourth.  On another note, Tobias Harris was not himself this game. On game 4, he was that aggresive beast who wanted to score, or drive. But in the fourth, he was like scared of the ball, in the out of bounds call around the minute mark, he was just touching the ball, in hopes of a miracle, couldn't he have dove, or atleast played with more heart and grit? Exhaustion isn't an excuse, as Collins has played a lot for the Hawks team as well.  &amp;#x200B;  So TL;DR: Hawks still had more energy and grit, and just continued to play the game, while the Sixers did the opposite.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, it's just simply because of Simmons and Harris not showing up"
Yeah they shot bad and that's why they were down 19 end of 3rd. Lou Williams and Gallo caught fire with Trae on the bench scoring off ISOs...   And you're missing the main point... of giving credit to the team. We all can see how good Trae is but the Hawks really are just straight up hitting their shots and playing great defense with Trae out the game lol.   Most teams just don't have that when their best player sits.
Clippers really traded Lou Williams and two 2nds for Rajon Rondo.
Trae Young is so hilariously bad at defense that replacing him with Lou Williams of all players helps their defense.
"I still don’t see how it is. Especially when it’s Lou Williams who does it constantly. Not to mention, how do you see that and think, “yea normal shooting motion”. Just venting lol. Just so annoying to watch"
"Yeah I remember a Lou Williams , Gallinari team beating a KD,Curry,Klay warriors team in a play off game. We better wake up."
Lou Williams looking like Trae Old tonight.
"Lemon Pepper Lou ""Trae Young"" Williams"
Lou Williams is not a defensive upgrade
Lou Williams is on the court
Lou Williams playing defense
The Hawks have pretty much always had either Trae Young or Lou Williams on the floor at all times but the Bucks still settle for so many garbage jumpers...
"100% chance the Bucks win, but saying that, if Atlanta wins this should go down as one of the all time worst losses in Bucks history. Lou Williams is absolute hot garbage and will literally shoot us out of this game if at any point we are close. You cant lost to this fucking roster"
"""I got two words for ya: Jeff Teague and Lou Williams! Must see TV!"""
Lou Williams is starting
Who takes his minutes? Does Lou Williams start now?
"His usage is a lot higher and I keep wondering why they're not playing Rondo with him at all. They traded Lou Will for Rondo because they wanted a true point guard/floor general to alleviate the ball handling duties of PG and Kawhi. Lue continues to look like a genius, but if they're not playing him in a series with CP3 they could have kept Lou Williams."
"This year yeah, last years Clippers had coaching and chemistry issues.  Lou Williams and Montrez disappeared in the playoffs.  Lakers would have dominated with Rondo, Dwight, DG, etc."
"If Doc even made 1/5th of the adjustments Lue does, then there is no way in hell Denver comes back.  1) Play JMG more minutes instead of Trez  2) Play Zubac more minutes instead of Trez  3) Stop playing Lou Williams/Reggie Jackson together  4) Stagger PG/Kawhi better  5) Don't force feed Trez/Lou the ball when you have PG, Kawhi, and Morris on the court.  Pick any combination of those things instead of living and dying by your ""best"" (i.e. favorite) players, and Doc wraps that series up in 5 or 6."
"Well, it's about both opportunity *and fit.*  The truth is, Reggie is in the **perfect** situation on the Clippers.  When the team is fully healthy, he gets to start alongside 4 good to great defenders who can help cover for any defensive mistakes he makes.  He is at his worst when the defensive system gets a bit more intricate, but the Clippers typically switch on everything which is to his advantage.  If he wants to play with the bench unit, he has Mann/Beverly to shore up his defense (as opposed to Lou Williams previously) as well.  Offensively, the Clippers have so much fire power that it's nearly impossible to do anything but play 1 on 1, which is where Reggie cooks people.  Added play making would be nice, but ultimately, he gets so much freedom with the starters and bench that he gets to just play his game.  I'm not sure any other team would offer him the same opportunity for success.  The fact that Kawhi went down and the Clippers needed to find a secondary scorer made it even better for him."
"He's also been playing decent defense, which is wild.  I know Rondo has been fucking awful, but that Lou Williams trade was a godsend for him.  I remember the days that Doc would play Reggie/Lou/Trez lineups and he'd be absolutely baffled when the Clippers would get murdered."
Tbh wouldn't surprise me if he sits out and the Hawks win on a 35 piece from Lou Williams
"You're 100% right. A new coach might win them an additional game in a series, but they need to change the lineup if they're going to get out of the Western conference. McCollum can ball. He's a great scorer, but I think he's the type of player that's most useful as a sixth man Lou Williams type of guy. Come off the bench and just get buckets.   In the starting lineup he just doesn't provide the defense or size to complement Dame. His off the ball movement isn't that great, and he frequently tries the score on an ISO. Dame is just better there, and so CJs skills are frequently undervalued.   The trail blazers need someone that can complement Damian Lillard and nurkic. At this point stay away from Ben simmons, but someone like that would be a much better fit."
&gt; What a lot of people don’t realize is that Kobe would protect Shaq in defending the pick and roll. Kobe fought like hell to go through screens to protect Shaq from getting killed by quicker guards.  That and pick and roll wasn't run nearly like it is today.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2016/12/19/16077164/nba-pick-and-roll-lou-williams-kemba-walker-draymond-green-f9a1ec934a2a  Shaq would cough up a few more points per game against modern offenses.
Who we got for all-nba strip club team..? I'm blanking on a PF position.  PG: Lou Williams • SG: James Harden (could count him as point tho) • SF: Kawhi Leonard (don't know if he's frequent but he certainly makes it rain when he goes) • PF: ??? • C: Porzingis
"Lou Williams: ""I don't get enough for this shit."""
"Lou ""Keep setting screens till they switch Lou on me"" Williams?"
"They are better defensively than Trae Young and Lou Williams, and they are in the conference finals."
"There are tons of small guards above Trae. Lou Williams is 59 and plus 1.4 in d-raptor compared to Trae’s -4.7.   It looks like Trae was a positive against the Knicks, a negative against the 76ers, and now a negative vs the Bucks."
"Hawks fans leaving State Farm arena early is what really got me.  See, I'm 18 right. Grew up in a very lucky era for the Hawks and got to be a smug bastard all of my life.  But what the fuck was that at State farm from the fans? Atlanta Spirit?  I was there yelling GIANNIS IS A BUM a lot in that second half and nobody was there to yell it with me, and you can tell those boys in there could've used the hyping up of a full crowd in the arena.  Here's a story about my first Hawks game. 2015 RS, a massacre. 12 year old me was in the Hawks section, and so was one singular Bucks supporter.  He was having a fucking bad night. But you know what?  He stayed.  He stayed until that siren with his Milwaukee jersey and his scarf because that was his fucking team.  We should've been screaming for Trae every time he got the ball because when you're hooked and back as a last resort, you need to hear that.  When Lou Williams, with the most errors in the NBA is making ballsy plays and taking shots, why is it the crowd doesn't want to instill confidence? Why are we meek?  Here I am, fully sober, at the back of the fucking arena.  And I can't get any drunk bastards at all to yell Giannis is a bum with me?  And even my dad turns to me and says, we should leave to beat the traffic? Best believe at my insistence we stayed until that siren went.  I am just feeling broken over how Hawks fans were tonight. Where was the Atlanta spirit? I feel so defeated and miserable knowing that everyone who was a smug bastard would so happily disappear when things got bad."
Middleton wasn't scoring on Trae. But Lou Williams should have played over Trae or Bogi
Don't forget Lou Williams is a 3-time 6MOTY winner
Lou Williams should have closed this game
ya bout lou williams did that alley oop a few minutes ago clear evidence he needs to play the rest of the game
Lou Williams is Nate McMillan's version of Mike Malone's Mason Plumlee.
Having Lou Williams and Trae on the court at the same time is risky lets see if it pays off
Lou Williams was on the court for waaaaay to long this quarter
Jfc Lou Williams
"#CLIPPERS DUMPED LOU WILLIAMS AND HE ABOUT TO MAKE THE FINALS WHILE STEVE ""FAILURE"" BALMER FAILS AGAIN"
lou Williams looks like such a weasel
"I don't know why, but Lou Williams get's on my nerve. I think it's his face."
its funny how Lou Williams would most likely be unplayable in the west playoffs
Can't stand Lou Williams
Lou Williams is so good as a role player.
“Here’s the moment for Sweet Lou”.   Does he not know about Lou Williams playoff history?
Trae to the locker room is night night game over. Go to bed. Go watch pornhub. Go do laundry. This talentless scumbag Lou Williams is not about to win your team a game in the ECF
outside of that one comeback vs Philly I'd rather have rondo than lou williams 100 times over
I hate Lou Williams man. Like legit unhealthy hatred. His game is not a fit in the modern landscape of basketball and we play this dude huge minutes in huge playoff games.
lou williams on the floor so were definitely going to start losing
Lou Williams wasnt ever gonna challenge that
the hawks went on one lone run with Lou Williams dumb ass on the floor vs Philly and now were playing him extended minutes while he shoots us out of games with constant long 2s with his heels on the 3 point line and people think im being harsh. this piece of shit should be on the bench and ill be happy to watch him sign with the kings next year. draft a modern day backup PG and move on.  /rant
i hate lou williams. just trash ass offensive IQ. Why are you shooting long twos in 2021? Get this scumbag off the floor
Lou Williams made a business decision
If anyone is curious like me. Reggie Miller and Lou Williams' careers did not have any overlap
giannis took one look at lou williams and was like yeah thats not gonna happen
Lou Williams trying to stop giannis 1 on 1....never going to happen lmao
Having Lou Williams on Lopez is hilarious
Good on the Bucks for actually taking advantage of the Trae Young/Lou Williams backcourt. It should be so easy to bully those guys offensively
lou williams played for the clippers
"Have you heard about PnR?  Beverly was on another player too but Luka went for him every possesion until he was put on the bench for the rest of the series. Same thing with Lebron and Lou Williams in the regular season last year. Same thing how Kawhi went on Seth Curry in the playoffs last year.  Luka would call DFS for a PnR and then attack Trae. Luka would feast on a team like Hawks who have Trae,Huerter and Lou."
"JC is supposed to be that guy that'll be #2 for us, but the beauty of this hawks team is we have plenty of players (Lou Williams, Danilo Gallinari, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter) in our lineup that can heat up and be the #2 on any night.  The game will really be fought and won in the back court though, jrue and Khris is a nice duo and we gotta be ready to answer them if they start going off"
"In these Playoffs, his team has shown up in big moments so I wouldn't say that he carries them hard.  For example, game 7 vs the sixers and that one game where Lou Williams led a comeback."
I dont know if this counts. But Lou Williams is the veteran guidance Trae Young needed to exceed his projection as a first round drop. Hope more teams follow this trend of player development in the next season (looking at Cavs)
"I think it's just bad for the team morale. Last year, there were murmurs about how Doc was giving Kawhi/PG wayyyy too much leniency, and that rubbed off other dudes (Harrell, Lou Williams, and the rest) the wrong way. Maybe it had an impact on the team's epic collapse against Denver; maybe it didn't?   But you win as a team and you lose as a team. I understand that more production on the court gets you more leniency, but it's just a little weird for Kawhi to be so detached from the team. And we don't even know what his injury fully is?"
"Connaughton isn’t a pg, Merrill is a fine rookie but would get toasted by Lou Williams or basically anyone else he’d be guarding. I know nothing about Elijah Bryant.  Edit: I should clarify, Teague shouldn’t be out there either, so I do agree with your point about using Middleton to bring it up"
I would pay money to see him as a GM and to see him construct a team. I think he’d probably give Lou Williams a 4 year / 85 Million contract and would try to max out Derrick Rose
"He was like a serviceable Lou Williams type off the bench. But for the Lakers he might be a starter. Also factor the post-injury hill he has to climb to reach his former self, if ever. However when he was healthy he could be the 3-4 best player on the Lakers."
they’d obviously benefit from better pieces but they’re also just all soooo young. their vets are deadass Lou Williams and Solomon Hill and they’ve made it this far lmao
Who was better Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams?
"I’ve always saw Sexton long term career being a great sixth man, like Lou Will coming off the bench and averaging 20. And Williams was never making big money. Anyone paying this dude a max deal is crazy and if he expects that type of deal than the Cavs should just ship him off."
To think they could have Lou Williams at least.
We'd also could have Chris Paul vs Lou Williams only 16 years after their draft.
Nobody told her Lou Williams got traded😏
Reggie Jackson and Lou Williams are the role player embodiments of ridiculous shotmaking
"Mavs supporting cast played worse than expected and Haws supporting cast is player better than expected. That's it.  Go back in time and ask ""What would you pick, KP or Collins?"". Nobody is going to say ""Nah, KP is going to grab 2 rebounds per game, is going to shoot like Dennis Rodman and is going to walk like Jason Kidd's last year in NY"".  Young, Collins, Bogdanovic, Capela, Huerter, Gallinari are playing well to great. Then Lou Williams had a couple of great games. King Solomon does his job. I don't know, I can't think about a player and say ""Bench that guy, Nate"".  You look at the Mavs roster and it's. Luka, Tim Hardaway are great. Then Powell, DFS. Marianovic does whatever he can. Then KP, Richardson... overpayed, not well.  You watch those Mavs games and ""God, Rick bench that guy, and that guy... don't you have another guy?"""
"No joke, Bud is playing him because Teague is familiar with Trae and Lou Williams game. Eric Nehm reported this in an article in the Athletic. But said no regrets and indicated he'll keep using him."
I honestly think he should go full Lou Williams and just yeet it 2 seconds after the ref passes it to him. A long ass routine might be causing him to think too hard about it. But what do I know
Clint Capela  John Collins  Gallo   Bog  Heurter  Lou Williams  Trae  Lebron’s 2007 team was a junior high school squad compared to this Atlanta team.
"Oh it was obvious from the tip that Lopez should only play when Young is resting (and maybe not even then if Lou Williams is hot).  But that Bud recognized it at all is an improvement.  It's like going from scoring 30% to 50% on a test, it's an improvement, but it's still an F."
