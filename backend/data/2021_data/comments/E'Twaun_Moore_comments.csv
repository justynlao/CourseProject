"With the growing cap space, trades for a minimum contract are gonna be hard to do. And is there really any benefit in that case for the buyout player's original team? Instead of getting nothing, they'll just get someone like E'twaun Moore for Blake Griffin."
"yeah i think most comps stretch up in terms of skill/impact tho, like you never see an elite prospect and his comp is like E'twaun Moore or some shit lol"
E'Twaun Moore nice!  $54M from the magic
"I've repeatedly said that the 3 players to sign with cap space in New Orleans before Redick were Solomon Hill, E'twaun Moore, and James Posey. 12 years to use cap space on FA without a spike. We needed credibility."
"Redick was our biggest FA sign since James Posey. Literally, our 3 prior *cap space* signings before Redick were Solomon Hill (2016), E'twaun Moore (2016), and Posey (2008). Keeping Redick was about establishing credibility as much as anything else."

Pelicans are better with E'Twaun Moore change my mind
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
And Jae Crow  And Langstong Galloway  And E'Twaun Moore  And Abdel Nader  Also drafted at 10 Jalen Smith  And picked up the undrafter Ty-shon Alexander
Oh shit. Well we do E'twaun Moore or Jahlil Okafor
"If you're looking at guys using cap space, the last 4 have been Redick, Solomon Hill, E'twaun Moore, and then... James Posey. I think the next two are Peja and Bobby Jackson. And at that point, we're talking before CP3 was even drafted."
yeah people are thinking the Suns are actually gonna give Payton quality minutes and that is very unlikely. But he's an upgrade over E'Twaun Moore who the Suns were having run point as a 3rd stringer last year.
Suns had E'Twaun Moore running point as the 3rd stringer last season so I guess Payton is an upgrade. They'll also likely rest CP more during the season so having decent backup minutes is helpful.
"I feel like the league is lower on Hart than Pelicans' fans. It's like when I saw E'twaun Moore sign for 2.2 M in Phoenix last season. It was just like ""Really, that cheap? Seriously?"""
I honestly wonder what the thought process is here. I'm guessing Jones and Monty want another point guard who can facilitate the offense as opposed to just a pure scorer. I guess he's an upgrade to E'twaun Moore in that regard as the 3rd string back up.
"E'twaun Moore is balling, and Robbie Hummel is keeping in shape playing Olympic 3v3s. Can get the whole squad together!"
I hope they get E'twaun Moore. He's still pretty good and could contribute for sure.
"Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Jeff Teague, Kent Bazemore, E'Twaun Moore, Mike Scott, Langston Galloway, Wes Matthews, Ben Mclemore...   Really not as hard as you're making it out to be to just grab some cheap guys to shoot open 3s"
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
"I mean theres no way of knowing yet, but there are plenty of guys out there who might fight the bill -   Jeff Green, Melo, Forbes maybe, Rivers, Ellington, Temple, Ennis, Redick maybe, E'Twaun Moore, Korver maybe if he decides to return, probably several others I might be forgetting."
"""Good luck with that, my man."" - E'Twaun ""Dinty"" Moore"
Manu is literal proof that every pick has value. You're not supposed to get a HOF player at 57? You're doing good if you get an E'twaun Moore with a bottom 5 pick. Not a HOF Player!?!?
"Here are some players that Pelicans team gave significant minutes to:    E'Twaun Moore started. He's currently not playing for the Orlando Magic.   Ian Clark is out of the league.   Darius Miller is hardly playing for the Thunder.   Solomon Hill is like, the 10th man on the Hawks."
"Yes, this is insane to me. He averaged 28/15 with 2 steals and 2 blocks, took a game off the KD Warriors, and the starting 5 was AD - Jrue - Rondo - E'Twaun Moore - Mirotic"
"An E'Twaun Moore reference in your profile? Okay, now I'm more than biased, I love this dude"
"Pelicans were some next level scrubs. This dude started next to Tim Frazier, Omer Asik, Alexis Ajinca, Dante Cunningham, Quincy Pondexter, Solomon Hill, and E'Twaun Moore for multiple seasons."
E'Twaun Moore
I have no idea why we signed him. E'Twaun Moore was a much better third string option for us.
E'Twaun Moore. Greg Stiemsma
"Cut Lebron, Steph, and KD.  Start E'Twaun Moore cause that's all my team needs."

I met e'twaun Moore at a Qdoba he was a very nice dude.
You don't actually believe that E'Twaun Moore was at any point even remotely comparable to Jrue Holiday do you?
"Closing lineup? So, Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminski, E'Twaun Moore, Jalen Smith and Torey Craig?"
"I think they've also got some really good players on the deep bench that will never see the court. Monty decided and said publicly he was done sharing minutes with lots of players so he would stop playing them, but Jevon Carter, Nader, and E'Twaun Moore all looked like really good 2-way players when they got their turns"
"Cam Payne, E'Twaun Moore, and Langston Galloway, right?"
i'm just waiting for nola legend E'Twaun Moore to drop 50 tn
"AD had none of those three in New Orleans. He had Jrue then guys like E'Twaun Moore and Soloman Hill at the top of his guard rotation. His best team in 2018 had E'Twaun Moore starting and a bench made up of Ian Clark, Jameer Nelson, Dante Cunningham, Soloman Hill and Rondo. Head coach of Alvin Gentry who's pretty much never had success as a coach in the NBA.  I guess it's what people were saying except AD had 0/3 while Giannis looks to have 2/3"
"**Top 7 guaranteed protected for the Suns:**  Devin Booker  Chris Paul  Deandre Ayton  Mikal Bridges  Jae Crowder  Cam Johnson  Cam Payne  &amp;#x200B;  **Last protected slot:**  Either Torrey Craig or Dario Saric. Craig is a great spark plug and can hit the three ball well but Dario probably has a higher ceiling with his size, spacing, and passing ability. Saric is rather inconsistent though.  &amp;#x200B;  **So who would get poached:**  Whichever player out of Saric and Craig isn't protected would absolutely get taken.  Jevon Carter (his toughness on defense is great. When he gets in a rhythm/feel for the ball he has a decent shot)  &amp;#x200B;  **Possibly poached but not really rotation guys:**  E'twaun Moore (serviceable veteran backup guard)  Abdel Nader (haven't seen him in a while but we got a lot out of him when he played)  Frank Kaminsky (he's the tank)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unlikely to get poached due to inability to crack the Suns rotation:**  Jalen Smith (he plays a tough bruising style but is very raw)  Ty-Shon Alexander (I have never seen this man)  Langston Galloway (Probably has the highest percentage of and-1 3s out of total fgs made in nba history)"
E'Twaun Moore
Damn I remember E'Twaun Moore starting for the Pels next to AD when they swept the Blazers a few years ago. Now he's a 3rd stringer.
I'm on the Suns bandwagon big time. Monty and CP3 from the NOLA days. To a lesser extent E'twaun Moore too. Plus I live in Phoenix.   Need that Suns/Bucks Finals so I can get Jrue in there too.
"And if CP needs to sit, they can just fill some of his minutes with E'twaun Moore, who does a decent poor man's CP impression for the team."
Yes. Refs decided to ruin the game by taking Cameron Payne out. Next they're gonna eject E'Twaun Moore. Then it'll be obvious how rigged this is.
"Jrue Holiday carried this bum, Ian Clark, Solo Hill, E'twaun Moore, and Cheick Diallo to the second round single handedly. 2015 was a bum team with bum players doesn't count"

Stix looked like an actual NBA player, our guys who haven't seen the floor in awhile stepped up, and we won. Now we just have to hope the Kings still observe our SunKings alliance and pull it off tonight against the Jazz. At the very least, Utah is going to have to play their rotation players tonight.  GG San Antonio. Good luck in the play-ins."
Lol who would've thought E'Twaun Moore of all people would be doing this
E'Twaun Moore needs to check in to cover all the former NOLA players
"Fun fact: E'Twaun Moore is 18-of-28 shooting between 10 ft and the 3-pt arc this season, including the playoffs. Mid-range assassin!! ;)"

"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
"One of E'Twaun Moore, Jrue Holiday, and Solomon Hill will win a Championship after Anthony Davis"
"It was so close to continuing. Shaq retired from the Celtics on June 1, 2011. The Celtics drafted E'Twaun Moore on June 23, 2011."
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Uncle E is E'Twaun Moore I'm pretty sure.

"If Payne can't go, I'm afraid I have some bad news.  By the way, I remember Langston Galloway setting MSG on fire. Is he really worse than E'Twaun Moore?"

Payne isn't the problem; it's the non-payne minutes. Sunnies were rolling out E'Twaun Moore who did nothing but get cooked and turn the ball over.
"I'm an IU guy but it's cool to see E'Twaun Moore playing in a WCF game, saw him a couple times in Bloomington in his Purdue days.  Now the Clips just have to put my boy Yogi in the game"
"We still have E'twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, and Langston Galloway who are all decent players. Our offense will drop off some with Booker off the floor, but it won't die."
"I wouldn't write off Monty starting E'twaun Moore at starting PG with Payne still coming off the bench. I'd still expect Payne to get the majority of the minutes at PG, but the few games that CP3 missed this season that's the lineup Monty rolled out."
Someone tell the commentator that Mikal Bridges and E'Twaun Moore are different people and always have been.
Since we moved Crowder to the bench (and interestingly enough Kamisky to starter) we've been running a bench of  Cam Payne  E'Twaun Moore  Cam Johnson  Crowder  Saric
"2011 had Isaiah Thomas, Bojan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Chandler Parsons (who was good once upon a time) and E'twaun Moore.  2003 had Jason Kapono, Kyle Korver, Luke Walton, Willie Green, Zaza Pachulia, James Jones, Mo Williams. and Keith Bogans. There's two All-Star selections and nine championships between them, in addition to long careers."
We're getting roasted by E'twaun Moore in 2021

"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Eh. Chris Paul, E'Twaun Moore, they're practically the same player anyways.   Easy mistake to make when watching the game."
