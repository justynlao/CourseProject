"I mean you can yeah, look at the process Sixers, someone HAD to up points, so MCW, Wroten, later Ish Smith were those guys.  But I don't think you can apply that to any top scorer of a bad team"
"I can believe it on teams like the process Sixers when you suddenly had guys like Spencer Hawes, Ish Smith or Tony Wroten putting up numbers, or with guys like Monta or K-Mart who were playing no defense, while their team wasn't even better with them on the court"
Nah man. Ish Smith was blowing by him
"DC as a big city should have winning on it's radar. Every big city wants to have a winning sports team. Fortunately DC already has winning sports teams, just not in Basketball lol. But the annoying thing is that DC has the potential to have a great basketball team. Clearly two cornerstone players are here but right now the whole roster is a mixture of being a rebuilding project with pieces that want to contend. It's not right. It's a shame Atlanta absorbed such a high amount of FA last off season. Maybe someone changes their mind and decides to play in the nation's capital but really why bother when there are warmer cities that have cap space and the other north east cities are clearly contenders while DC just bumbles along with some of the best offensive players in the league.  Some of this has to do with just a bad FO though, like yes some of the young guys drafted have potential and some of them not showing their full ability falls on the coaching staff but good lord the supporting pieces, like could DC have made a better decision around what makes sense when you have a great offensive weapon already? Like yes bringing in Robin Lopez is supposed to boost defense a little bit but would it have been better to have taken Matisse Thybulle instead of Rui where Matisse looks like a defensive beast. Of course Rui still has potential and all that but man what is a guy like Raul Neto supposed to bring? A plug and play offensive player that is undersized and cannot do much else? Like is having him in addition to Ish Smith. Oh man and of course the year after we extend him Bertans the ""Latvian Laser"" is now shooting 32% from 3. Like wow if his production stays down low this long then that's an awful contract for a player that no longer has any upside."
Love the little man ish smith
"Ish Smith is just 2 teams away from the NBA record of most different teams played for over the course of a single career. He's already the first person to play for over 10 NBA teams in fewer than 10 seasons. Part of me wants him to break the record, but another part is pretty happy that he seems to have found a home in Washington. Man's been living out of a suitcase for the better part of a decade."
I'm assuming even through quarantine Ish Smith remained a point guard. Man's a professional.
Love Ish Smith
Ish Smith: I jerked off
"I'm not here to hype up Beals defense, but if you watched the game and watched Beal, the guy was easily having one of the worst games of career until that 4th quarter. After the Nets got up big in the first, he looked like he was out the door for not only the game but the team in general. Westbrook and even Ish Smith and Mo Wagner putting in the energy literally reenergized him. We'll see what happens if Westbrook can remain healthy"
Westbrook defense was top notch wow. Also lost count on how many times he and Ish Smith burned kyrie on offense.
"I know Brad and Russ are gonna get a lot of attention for this, and rightfully so, but let‚Äôs not forget how good Moe Wagner, Ish Smith, and Garrison Matthews played tonight too. They absolutely killed it."
"i think splitting the votes 3 ways between Russ, Brad, and Ish Smith will hurt all of their MVP chances. might end up being some scrub like Joel since the 3 best players in the league are all on the same team"
Yeah I had to resort to Google to make sure there wasn't a new Ish Smith I didn't know about lol.
Ish Smith really carried the wizards with his +16
"I feel like they've been pretty entertaining, although I was laughing my ass off at the amount of hype they were giving Ish Smith"
Why did Brooks put out Bertans. Almost rather have Ish Smith out there
"If someone who never watched a game saw this one, they would think ish Smith is the goat  Lmao the wizards announcers just said it too"
Ish Smith is a fucking Point Guard.
ish smith is a basketball player
It feels like ish smith has 30
"even when I am wearing glasses, ish smith is a blur"
Ish Smith is chaotic af lmao
ish smith is Kevin Durant from mid range and Russell Westbrook from 3
If a couple of 7 foot white boys and Ish Smith kill the last leg of my parley I‚Äôm gonna lose my shit
"I swear, Ish Smith turns into an all-star every time we play him"
"If Ish Smith was 6‚Äô4-6‚Äô7, he‚Äôd be the greatest player of all time"
"Ish ""Kyrie Irving"" smith"
Why are we getting beat by ish Smith üòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòê
"I think I've focused too much time on Westbrook's decline (he suddenly looks a bit athletic again btw for some reason) as being one of the main reason for Washington horrible start, but man what do they actually do in practice ? They don't have any idea of what to do on any screen actions, don't rotate, don't rebound, nothing, 5'8 Ish Smith is the only guy playing hard defensively"
Get Westbrook and Ish Smith some help? Idk what this wizards team is lol
This is the first time I've seen the wizards play. I like the way this ish smith guy balls. What's his story?
Ish Smith cooking
"Joel never played with Ish Smith, what the fuck are you talking about"
There is one Ish ‚ÄúIs a Point Guard‚Äù Smith for you
"To be fair, are there any point guards better than ish Smith?"
"Brad Wanamaker, Ish smith, tj McConnell, Tristan Thompson, dj Wilson"
"tbh the only 'bad' losses have been to Chicago/Orlando and maybe yesterday with the hawks.    12 losses  - 5 were there ones mentioned above ... 3 of them were very close games though.  - Losses to NOP/HOU/SAS .. we were missing half our roster.  - Loss to MIA we were missing Westbrook/Beal and Bryant tore his ACL a couple minutes in.  - 2 Losses to 76ers were close ... Embiid became unstoppable .. and some bad offensive execution  - Loss to Celtics ... was kinda bad too since they were missing some bigs  ---  Overall a few key issues  - Scott Brooks is a moron.  - Offensive system consists of give the ball to Beal or Westbrook and watch them do something.  - Defense sucks to, players aren't great ... but coaching is pretty weak here.  - Rotations seems pretty bad. Brooks insists on playing 2-3 PG lineups. He also often decides to play Westbrook with Ish Smith, Robin Lopez, and Jerome Robinson for some reason.   - Lacking a good defensive big. Bryant was good offensively .. but clueless on defense. We actually looked better on defense with Lopez.  - Bad defenders in general.  - Westbrook is bad, focuses too much on rebounding and doubling  - Beal is AVG in my opinion, but sometimes looks disinterested in defense when the team is doing bad.  - Hachimura is a bit clueless on defense at times.   - Advija has good instincts, but he's still a rookie .. and slow at times.   - Bryant is just bad at defense, makes a highlight play every now and then.   - Most of our bench players are just bad at defense too ... Bertans (can only shoot 3s), Ish Smith / Raul Neto  (just too small), Matthews ( good effort, but a bit frantic)   - Lopez is good at times, but isn't athletic so ... can be a problem.   - Bonga is a decent defender ... but doesn't get playing time, fouls too much though"
Ish smith
"you said he isnt efficient when he has been the most efficient at it in the league.  I never brought up PNR at all, Embiid isnt a pick and roll player but the best guard he has ever played with is Ish Smith as well.  Why are we comparing the PNR with post ups?  Posting up is much closer to an isolation play, Embiid isnt getting any easy lobs when he posts up.  Harden was at 1.12 ppp in iso last year with by far the most attempts.  Embiid at 1.1 under more comparable circumstances is an incredibly valuable play, would you say a Harden iso is inefficient?"
"I thought Ish Smith would be a solid starter in the league after he averaged 14.7 and 7 with the Sixers in 2015. To be fair, that was one of the worst teams in history."
"I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but the blame shouldn't be on Beal. They're a bad team. Westbrook has looked awful (I believe he will figure out though) and injured. Bryant is their third best player (where would he rank in the league? Maybe top 100) is hurt.  Ish Smith, Jerome Robinson, and Garrison Matthews are in their top 10 for minutes, How many teams would have these guys in their top MPG? 19 players have stepped onto the court for them already this season. What is Beal supposed to do? He is surrounded by a struggling Westbrook, injured players, and a bunch of 10-13th men. Do you want Westbrook, Jerome Robinson, Bertans, and Alex Len taking more shots? You think that solves the problem?   I agree Beal's 35/5/5 (on great efficiency) is inflated, but that's like all-time great season. He's putting up runaway MVP numbers. If Beal was putting up Lavine numbers then your overall point has some legs, but he's putting up insane numbers. Very few players can have a season that Beal is having no matter how bad their team is. So no, he isn't ""35/5/5 good"" but he's a top 15 player and shouldn't even be questioned for all-star/All NBA."
"Can‚Äôt pin these losses on Beal. Of course his numbers are going to be inflated if you‚Äôre missing Rui Hachimura, Troy Brown Jr, Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Russell Westbrook and Ish Smith"
"half our team is missing ...  although for some reason brooks played the other starters with Beal ... left our better offensive players on the bench    ... and played Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez with Russ ...  not sure how he hasn't been fired yet ..."
"No, even right now.  Westbrook is taking 18 shots a game and he's shooting the lowest from the field outside of Bertrans and has the worst TS% than everyone on the team that plays minutes besides Ish Smith.  Russ has been absolutely abysmal when it comes to scoring."
Ish Smith
Jeremy Lamb and Ish Smith
"People will say the Wizards, but we really should have expected with Scott Brooks as the coach.  We've been close down the stretch in pretty much all of our losses, if Brooks didn't put out brain dead lineups through the game it would help. Somehow thinks Westbrook will be good with Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Robin Lopez on the floor.    and TBH only the 2 losses to the magic/bulls each have been bad early in the season, were even unexpected. We've played a lot better since then.    Having close losses to the 76ers (2x), Celtics, and Heat (w/o Beal, Westbrook) .. aren't really bad losses."
Are we gonna do the thing where we pretend Ish Smith isn‚Äôt the clear cut favorite
"What‚Äôs weird is that wizards backup PG Ish Smith has 27,000 rebounds already this year."
"Yeah, it‚Äôs looking more and more like we should have kept Payton. I said it at the time and I‚Äôm still saying it. If you‚Äôre looking at a PG and going ‚ÄúMan I miss Tim Frazier. Why‚Äôd we let Ish Smith go again?‚Äù Theorems a problem."
Ish smith is the GOAT
"Deservingly so. He was quickly on his way of becoming Jamaal, or even worse, ish smith. Lonely life on the road."
"don‚Äôt forget salary cap too.  steph for ish smith and a second, who says no?"
fun fact... Ish Smith is a point guard
"Most of Ish Smith teams were garbage. Yes, a starting lineup would be a contending team but it wouldn‚Äôt be as good as this"
Maybe Ish Smith ?
Ish Smith  Bruce Brown  Issac Bonga  Tony Snell  Felicio
"&gt; so depending on your stance on Russ, that will either be good or bad for the wizards  Second games of b2bs and games where we have missed our starting players have surprisingly been our best the past few seasons. Garrison Matthews and Ish Smith will pop off with random 30 point games lol"
"bro Ish smith is the one that whenever I tune in, he looks like what people think Lou Will is lol"
Ish Smith
"Westbrook doesn't qualify because he's not shooting enough 3's (this is actually a good thing, considering he shoots 30%).   But comparing him to them doesn't do them right. When it comes to TS% Westbrook is #180 out of 185, with an astonishingly low 44.9 TS%; It's really unusual for a player that has such a high usage to have this low efficiency. The other players around him are players like Ish Smith, Devonte' Graham, Kelly Oubre, etc. that use a lot less possessions than he does, so the total effect of their inefficiency is much smaller.  To have a player use star-level number of possessions with scrub level efficiency is practically unheard of."
"Booker has a history of stat padding and runs his stats up whenever hes down 20+.   Lavines teammates are always injured and hes the only reliable ball handler/shot creator on the team. He can be argued either way, so its a maybe for me.  beal is on the worst constructed roster in the league and he needs to score 35+ a game to for them to have a chance to win. His best teammate since Walls first injury has been Ish Smith..."
"So who's failing the running portion? SlowMo? Boban? Conversely, who's setting records? Fox? Ish Smith? Wall?"
The Ish Smith fan club won't like that
"Welp they were the same age (harden 26 in 2016, Beal 26 last year). Literally Beal‚Äôs PG was IT who‚Äôs not in the league and ish Smith. He also had like Issac bonga at SF and rookie Rui at PF. Keep lying to yourself"
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
Ish Smith would like a word
Playing ish Smith with Westbrook is unforgivable.
"SAS is full of ish! If this was a white player he would only be saying how the player needs to be fined for missing work but because it‚Äôs Kyrie and SAS has been harassing Kyrie since he stood up for everyone before the bubble, it‚Äôs all this other bs.  Disney‚Äôs Stephen A. Smith needs to stfu!"
If we just gave an mvp award to ish smith that doesn't make him mvp caliber. Westbrook does not have an mvp caliber impact on winning
Too 5 of all ball handlers named ‚ÄúIsh Smith‚Äù for sure
I don't think Ish Smith is top 5 anything in the league
Too much Ish Smith rn you need the right amount of Ish
Ish smith is soooooo fast....
"To me, the move would be trading Ish Smith for a wing defender and then having Neto fill in those 12-15 minutes when Russ is off the floor. They have more than enough ball handlers that having 3 PGs is redundant"
They'd rather play players that have a real future with the team. Like 32-year-old sub-40% FG Ish Smith.
"For some reason they kept running Ish Smith l/Westbrook/Beal lineups when they had NO reason to. Don't get cute with it, Troy Brown/Avdija/Bonga aren't amazing but they're reason enough not to play Ish Smith in an awful defensive lineup scheme. Why would you play Ish next to Westbrook.."
"Ideally, you can at least construct an offensive roster with the team.  Starters: Russ / Beal / Deni / Rui / Thomas Bryant (I know he tore his ACL) - In a perfect world that's 4 shooters around Russ.  Bench: Ish Smith / Troy Brown / Mo Wagner / Issac Bonga / Robin Lopez - It's not a fantastic bench but whatever  I could have seen the argument that they could fight for the play-in but things have just fallen off a cliff."

Dude I just saw Ish Smith drop 9 against the heat.   But seriously Jerami Grant is nice. Add is RoCo and Christian Wood and they probably pull it off.
Ish Smith is all about questionable layup attempts.
"Brooks closed the Philly game with Ish Smith too, imagine your team is struggling because of defense and a point guard who can't score and then thinking the solution is to put a 5'10 guy who needs the ball"
Not with that Coach lol. Would probably sub Kobe for Ish Smith üòÇüòÇ
"No. He deals with doubles and is an elite scorer from every level, plus he‚Äôs efficient, so other guys wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to do what he does. What makes him elite is obviously his ability to score at an efficient rate, but just as much so is his ability to put the ball on the floor and move with the ball, drive to the rim, and get to his spots and create his own shots consistently. There‚Äôs not too many in the league that can do it on his level, especially when dealing with doubles and having nobody else on the team to go to unless you like Ish Smith as your 2nd option."
"That's not the point, back in the days he was a ""great when he tries, meh overall"" defender and his teams could leave with it because he played with great defenders, now he's mostly a ""meh the one possession per game he tries, horrendous overall"" and he no longer plays with Paul George, Roberson and Steven Adams but with Thomas Bryant, Ish Smith and Rui Hachimura."
trade backsies? i‚Äôll even throw in one lightly used ish smith
The embiid post up led to an and 1 layup on ish smith. An embiid post up against bryant is more likely to be an and 1 opportunity than a ben simmons layup against smith.
"Bro, no matter how much you may dislike Westbrook, how are you gonna tag this as ‚Äúserious‚Äù then suggest Ish Smith and Raul Neto are better than him lmfao. This is next level shitposting"
"If only Scott Brooks didn't play him with Ish Smith and Robin Lopez, which would have definitely prevented him from chucking up contested threes, 18 footers and trying to dunk on Theis and Tacko"
"Man Pritchard and Ish Smith were the only serviceable PGs this game. Also, I love watching Bradley Beal play basketball."
"What bothers me about our defense is the overhelp. I mean, I get the concept. But you really don't need to help if Giannis is the primary defender around the rim and give away an open 3.  Like it feels like you could have Ish Smith driving on Giannis and the whole team collapses. We need to be smarter about this, good teams can abuse it so easy with players that couldn't finish around the rim anyway."
Brooks would try to go even smaller than you and put Ish Smith at the 5

"He was barely handling the ball, Ish Smith had more plays in the 4th quarter."
"We need an above average IQ coach and our roster would be fine. We‚Äôve got one of the best distributing point guard in the league and enough shooters to fill out the rest of the lineup. The problem isn‚Äôt any of the players, it‚Äôs the dude who plays Russ with Raul Neto and Ish Smith, the dude who sits Beal for a long stretch while he‚Äôs got 57 points in 3 quarters, the dude who loses us games is Scott brooks"
Ish Smith looked better in the 4th than Beal lmao
"The Wizards actually came back from 10 down in the 4th without Beal and as soon as Beal came back, their offense fell off a cliff. He was definitely forcing shots and Embiid was literally eating them.   It was a little annoying to then see Twitter say ""Free Beal"" as if his team let him down. Ish Smith had one hell of a fourth quarter."
Ben Simmons was getting lit up by ish smith
"DSJ can really turn out as a great back up point guard. He is lightning quick, can push the tempo, I want him to be a bit more aggressive going to the rim, and clean up some of the forced 3pt shots. I think he can become something like Ish Smith with better playmaking skills, but if he figures out his 3pt shot, he can be a legit starting point guard.(his defence is actually ok)"
That's a pretty harsh assessment. He wasn't an NBA point guard yet but he was the closest thing that squad had to one. Until the Ish Smith trade he was playing too many minutes against starters but still only turning the ball over twice a game. If Tony Wroten or Kendall Marshall had been able to make it back from injury then TJ could have slid into the backup role sooner.
"**Continuing on my original post, here are some stats I don't use (and why):**  *Team* *stats (or derivatives) that shouldn't be used for player eval:*  * Defensive Win Shares * Defensive rating  *Small samples making them very susceptible to luck / lacking context:*  * dFG% for specific matchups * dFG% on shots not at the rim * Looking at raw on/off court data for players  *Okay to use, but better alternatives exist to measure what people often use them to try to measure*  * Steals - at BBall Index we use Passing Lane Defense &amp; Pickpocket rating to dig deeper into more granular styles of generating steals, rather than the high level generic one. But steals (per 75 or 100 possessions) are still good. * Blocks - they're often the highlight plays, but rim defense goes a bit deeper than just blocks. Impacting FG% at the rim, contesting a high % of shots taken at the rim, and deterring shots from even being taken at the rim are all really important too. * Defensive rebounds - with how many are uncontested, this doesn't tell us as much as we'd like it to. And some players get more/less due to positioning and box out tendencies, so there are lots of variables that just raw rebounding numbers (or rates per X possessions) won't capture.  *Impact stats that I prefer other alternatives for:*  * \[BBall Reference\] D-BPM, because it's limited to only the box score (and DPS from NBAMath is just this but using possessions instead of minutes) * \[NBAShotCharts\] D-RAPM, because it's limited to only on/off data and on single seasons can have a good bit of noise. But RAPM calcs are awesome (and Ryan is awesome) and in combination with box score ""priors"" produce some of the best performing impact stats. * Current D-RPM (the old one was good), because their integration of tracking data doesn't appear to have gone well and the results track really poorly with several others I know have solid methodologies. For example, Draymond from 2016-18 has top marks in D-LEBRON and D-RAPTOR. D-RPM has him 131st, 15th, and 412th in those years. Something's off there. They also continue to change it over and over without actually releasing any info on how it's calculated, so it's hard to evaluate the methodology. * \[Dunks &amp; 3s\] D-EPM, which hasn't released methodology publicly. It has good offensive data integrating a tracking box prior with RAPM calcs, but the defensive side has some strange results (like Dario Saric ranking 2nd, Ish Smith in the 96th percentile, or McCollum being in the 56th percentile). There's no luck-adjusting, which is why we see guys like Saric show up a bit too high (he shows up among the most lucky defenders when comparing RAPM to LA-RAPM)."
"I'll chime in, as someone who has for a long time wrestled with this as an Xs &amp; Os and former film guy that is also a big numbers guy. I run a consulting firm now that works with teams and agents on data &amp; scheme and that's helped shape what our public offerings on my site include and how they're presented. I hope this helps!  **Here are the stats I use when I analyze defense for a player**:  * *Contextual stats*    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Roles, so you know who's doing which jobs really easily. Jeff Siegel (Klutch) set them up and we calculate them now that his work isn't public.    * \[BBall Index\] Matchup Difficulty, because you can have 2 guys at the same talent level but ask 1 to guard elite difficulty matchups and can hide another one and their impact data will be impacted because of it.    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Versatility, because it's good to know how versatile defenders can be. This is particularly important for the playoffs.    * \[BBall Index\] Defensive Position (and our data on % guarding types of players by offensive archetype and position), because it's good to know what types of offensive players a defender is asked to take on. * *Interior Defense*    * \[BBall Index\] Rim deterrence for bigs to look at which anchor bigs are keeping opponents from shooting at the rim    * \[NBA .com/stats\] dFG% at the rim against vs expectations (based on 2S calcs made public on the NBA's site)    * \[BBall Index\] % of Shots Taken at the Rim Contested, which can tell us how active of a rim protector someone is    * \[BBall Index\] Adjusted Rim Points Saved / 75 possessions, to look at a per \~game view of points saved at the rim based on dFG% +/- on shots at the rim defended along with rates of defending shots at the rim    * \[BBall Index\] Block Rate on Contests (Block per rim contest) is interesting to know * *Perimeter Defense*    * \[BBall Index\] Passing Lane Defense to evaluate interception + deflection rates    * \[BBall Index\] Pickpocket Rating to look at on-ball steals    * \[BBall Index\] Loose Ball Recovery Rate to look at win rates on hustle situations    * \[NBAShotCharts\] Real Adjusted TOV rate, to look at RAPM style calcs to see how players are impacting the team's efforts generating turnovers * *Defensive Rebounding*    * Adj. Box Out Rate, so we see how often players are boxing out on opposing team shots while on the court defensively.    * \[BBall Index\] Adj. DReb Success Rate, so we see the win rate for players in rebounding battles on defense    * \[BBall Index\] DReb Success Rate +/-, which tells us how far above or below expectations that DReb Success Rate is, based on factors like their positioning on the court, teammate box out tendencies, how often those rebounds are contested, and the player's physical tools.    * \[NBAShotCharts\] Real Adjusted DReb rate, to look at RAPM style calcs to see how players are impacting the team's effectiveness winning the DReb battle * *Impact Stats*    * \[BBall Index\] D-LEBRON (LEBRON stands for Luck-adjusted player Estimate using a Box prior Regularized ON-off), which you can read about [here](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-introduction/). It uses RAPM calcs for on/off data instead of an estimate, uses the best weighting of box score stats public work had to offer to be a prior for the RAPM calcs, we stabilize small samples and use a role adjustment to do so to increase in-season accuracy, luck-adjust FT and 3PT shooting with stabilized multi-year player and location specific shooting data to increase accuracy (which is seen in the testing difference between RAPM and Luck-Adjusted RAPM), and will soon have an extra garbage time adjustment added in as well.    * \[538\] D-RAPTOR, though for small sample guys it doesn't appear to have the same sorts of padding built in and can show some wild results. They use RAPM type calcs along with a tracking stats based box component.  All of those stats (even the ones we don't calculate) are available at BBall Index and are contextualized with percentiles and letter grades (so you don't need to remember what's good or bad for all 280+ stats we have on those), so any eval of a player (offense or defense) can be done all in one place with all the info you need on a player's role/deployment, context, style, and effectiveness.  Context also matters a lot for impact stats. Just like if you take Ish Smith and make him a C in 2K his overall will go down, in real life if you optimize guys better or worse it'll play a role on their impact data. So for defense, defensive role (I eval how it matches to their skill set), Matchup Difficulty (compared to their talent level and where they probably should be), and defensive versatility (are they being over/underutilized).  A few examples where context impacted results:  * AD's defensive versatility this season is in the 300s. And no, it's not because he's been out for some games. We're not seeing him fully unleashed this regular season, and his defensive impact is lower than it's potential because of that. * Elfrid Payton is in the 99th percentile this season for Matchup Difficulty, which is waaay over where it should be to put him in any position to succeed. He's been an average defender in prior years that has taken a massive nosedive this year in D-LEBRON. This is a big part of why we see that. And there will be situations where a team needs to slot someone poorly due to roster construction/skills, but this is still context that matters. * Glenn Robinson III has a skill set best aligned to the Chaser role defensively, where you're an off-ball Guard/Wing defender that plays rotational defense and chases shooters around screens but isn't guarding at the point of attack a ton. The 76ers were poorly constructed last season and had him as an on-ball Wing Stopper, making his defensive impact drop and him underperform where he could be if better optimized.  I'm also more of an Xs &amp; Os guy than a data guy by trade, so I can also share a few areas on film I'm also paying attention to when trying to evaluate a player's defense.  * I let the data evaluate what it can and tell me what's happening in those areas. I'll dig into the why from a technique, skills, and tools standpoint. * I pay attention to off-ball defense to evaluate player positioning relative to where they should be based on the location of the ball and players, whatever actions are being run, and what that player's responsibilities are given their location on the court. Are they the would-be tag man, the guy that'd rotate down to help the tag man as he tags, the guy taking the pop if it happens, etc. * I watch for closeout, P&amp;R ball handler, P&amp;R screener's man, and off-screen defensive technique. It'd be a lot to type out here, but those are areas where on enough film and knowing the right teaching points you can see why a player's technique is good/bad. * If 2 guys are closing out to the same offensive player, someone's wrong. If the same guy is involved in a ton of those, they're probably messing up. THT this year is an example.  But in reality, watching games live you miss soooo much of this. I re-watch every Lakers game and notice 5x more than I do watching live, and I'm someone that's trained and paid for that type of analysis. The eye test watching live is a tricky thing to rely on. So using contextualized data along with film, and **film** not entertainment watching live, is the best approach if you want to be holistic.  I hope this was useful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions (you can find me on Twitter @ Tim\_NBA if you want to ask there)."
"Patty Mills   TJ McConnell  Ish Smith   Vucevic (some games he actually never misses its crazy)  Actually on a tangent, HOW FUCKING GOOD IS VOOCH?   Absolute stud man, looks like a pretty chill guy too. When he posts up and drops that right shoulder it‚Äôs fucking curtains, such a soft touch around the rim. Not bad on a basketball court either."
"Ish Smith, Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams and Daniel Theis."
Wait til they sell the James Harden bobbleheads. They're gonna be leftover Ish Smith bobbleheads with felt taped to the face.
"It was said a bit lower in the thread, but people tend to equate athleticism to vertical explosiveness, and Lin was never really a dunker. Wall and Westbrook were similarly fast and they‚Äôd get up regularly for sick tomahawks, while similarly quick guys like Lin, Tony Parker and Ish Smith weren‚Äôt exactly highlight-reel dunkers."
"This is what I was thinking too. People tend to equate ‚Äúathleticism‚Äù with explosiveness. So if they can see a guy with close to dunks like Lin at his height and a guy like Russ or Dame getting way up while being just as tall, it kind of makes Lin look extremely tame.  I mean, look at Ish Smith. He‚Äôs probably the fastest guard to come around in a while, but he‚Äôs not usually described as ‚Äúathletic‚Äù, just lightning fast. It‚Äôs weird, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it straight-up racist."
The disrespect to Ish Smith
"The problem is that he had to go to China (lack of offers in NBA) to continue hooping when guards like JR, IT, Trey Burke, **Reggie Jackson**, Ish Smith etc etc etc were still getting contracts. In the best-case scenario its a little sus and he is bad for locker rooms or some other intangible we don't know of, the worst-case scenario it's blatant racism.  He's not a starter for sure after his injuries, but the fact that no-one wanted him as a 2nd or 3rd string gaurd is insane."
"We were hurt by injuries at the beginning of year  - Westbrook playing injured  - Hachimura out with Pink Eye / Bertans out of shape and on minutes restriction.   Then we started turning it around a bit  - Thomas Bryant tore his ACL  - 75% of the team were out due to covid + didn't basketball for 2 weeks  - So lost like 4 games due to players being out ... and then the next couple games they were back .. still weren't in rhythm ( probably due to not playing any for 2 weeks).  Finally got some good continuity and turned it into a win streak.  - Better defense from the team in general ( Rui really stepped up )  - Moving Garrison Matthews / Mo Wagner to the starting line up provided some more energy and shooting to the starting line up. Also moved Lopez/Advija to the bench .. where they played better.  - Ish Smith being injured, meaning Brooks couldn't sabatoge with 3 PG lineups."
"I think if we played against a team that had Kanter, Vucevic, Ilyasova, Ish Smith we'd get obliterated lmao. Certified Nets killers"
Ish Smith too
"2 guards that can‚Äôt shoot. Ish Smith and Russell Westbrook. They both get heavy minutes but ish is hurt right now. I mentioned them earlier, show me some evidence of Bertans ineffectiveness please."
He‚Äôs shooting 37% on 8 3‚Äôs a game this year lol. He literally just went 9/11 3 games ago so he hasn‚Äôt been ass all year. That‚Äôs pretty good especially when you have two guards that don‚Äôt need to be guarded at the 3 point line (Westbrook and Ish Smith). Brooks needs to let him shoot way more.
"LeBron, Jokic &amp; Steph. Used to be Ish Smith."
And we were missing the GOAT üêê *Ish Smith*  An L is a L and a W is a W.  *EVERYBODY GET IN HERE!*
Ish Smith
Ish Smith is a dude that will drop 15-20 points and leave you asking what the hell happened. Definitely the type of player you want on a team that‚Äôs at a crossroads.
"I love Ish Smith man, he has a way of making everyone around him play significantly better when he's on the court by either scoring or facilitating. The guy can run a fast break and get to the rim like none other. I dunno if he's starter-on-a-contender caliber but I feel like he could be a serviceable starter to most teams and a huge energy guy coming off the bench to any team."
Ish Smith - a point guard.
ish Smith is good !!
Ish Smith. I'm sick and tired of these pathetic Ish Smith fanboys.
"The key component of this run has been Ish Smith being out. Without being able to run his experimental 3 guard lineups, Brooks was forced to run an actual basketball team.  Don‚Äôt worry, once Ish is back, I have faith in scott Brooks being the worst coach in the league and going back to playing ass lineups"
"Shout out to Ish Smith for being out, stopped Scott from playing a 3 guard lineup. Low key big part of this winning streak"
"i love shake but im just saying hes probably the best combo guard we have had since Jrue Holiday 9 years ago.  It is between him and Ish Smith, we just dont get guys that do normal guard things so its a big relief that we have shake."
"This stat just reflects bad luck. Before Kleber, Richardson, Brunson, Finney-Smith were in Covid protocol the Dallas defense was even good-ish and Luka made a nice contribution with his own improvement. With 4 of probably their best 5 defenders out, Luka had to be on the court with only KP as a potential good defender, who is still getting back from injury, no team rhythm and a brutal schedule. Like the Celtics and Miami, a team with too many players out gets into disarray and for Dallas the circumstances killed the defense and without time to practice it takes time to get it in order.  For the time being, every Mav on the court since around January 12th, took a nose-dive on defensive ratings.  Here a prediction: With the snow and postponed games, Carlisle had time to get full practices in the AAC for the team in and it will show real improvements come monday."
He currently has a negative on/off. Which should be criminal when his backups are fucking raul neto and ish smith.
"actually a very good point! I kind of spaced out AD, which is nonsense. I think if I had to pick 1 player to guard every NBA player I would pick Davis. He really does excel all over the floor. Giannis could reach that level too. He has the quickness/size/strength. But can he put it together with the mental aspect of defense before his athleticism starts to decline? Its possible. Davis did not enter the league as a premier defender either. Either one of those guys has a higher chance of being considered the best defender of all time than Rudy, in my opinion. Gobert is just too 1 dimensional, again, his 1 dimension fits perfectly into the Jazz system and they are an amazing team. But any fast guard would cook Rudy and its obvious. I would honestly struggle to bet against Ish Smith in a 1v1 against Gobert. He is just so flat footed and clumsy outside of the paint"
Jeremy Lamb and Ish Smith. Payton Pritchard is gonna join the list pretty soon.
"the wizards PG‚Äôs last year were Gary Payton Jr, Shabazz Napier, Ish Smith, and IT lol... don‚Äôt think you can complain about missing players"
"I don't really want him but we could get there with Thomas Bryant, Robin Lopez, Ish Smith, and Jerome Robinson ..."
Teague doesn't get consistent minutes to be considered a rotation player though...  PG: Ish Smith  SG: Svi  SF: Marcus Morris   PF: Paschall  C: Biyombo
[Nerlens Noel: Ish Smith Is ‚ÄòFirst True Point-Guard‚Äô I‚Äôve Played With ](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/03/31/nerlens-noel-ish-smith-is-first-true-point-guard-ive-played-with/)  MCW's revenge?
"Troy Brown Jr. ish smith, Robin lopez. Thomas Bryant and the 4 mill exception. Get it done. Thanks I‚Äôll be waiting to draft Andre Drummond as a wizard on draftkings."
"I really don't get brooks. 2 of his starters today have got DNPs a lot this season for some reason and he will randomly change it up although it looks to be a good decision this time vs playing ish smith, neto and westbrook together"
"On off is still heavily flawed and affected by lineups. Considering he plays a lot with the bench unit. Brooks was literally pushing out lineups with Ish Smith and Westbrook on the floor together.   I don‚Äôt use small sample size advanced defensive stats, just as you shouldn‚Äôt lmfao. All defensive analytics are noisy especially to begin a season or in a few game sample size. That‚Äôs a wild statement.   You ignored the 4 game sample size that thread is based upon, and then tried to use a flawed on off stat for the entire season. You then said I was grasping at straws for talking about what the thread is based on. Of course his advanced impact stats are going to be even more terrible than expected, my point was about how he has looked recently. We all know he was playing like garbage when he was actually hurt.   Stop it."
He guards more 3pts shooter than 5'11 Ish Smith who averages more rebounds in lss mins ?
But who's guarding Ish Smith
"&gt; He's still developing but is a solid contributor.  No, this is the problem...he's not.   He's a bad NBA player and he's not getting better.  This is like last year when I was on the ""Bryn Forbes is terrible"" train and nobody would fucking agree.   Just because somebody wears our jersey doesn't mean he's good and we have to talk ourselves into him.   You watch a guy like Tyrese Haliburton or SGA and it's just immediately clear that they understand the game of basketball and can play above-average minutes in this league.   We know what guys who start out like this look like long-term.  Here is 538's player projection for Lonnie...  Notice the WAR value they projected for this year? So far, his actual WAR is -1.1   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/lonnie-walker-iv/  In reality, if this level of play continues, he's more similar to Emmanuel Mudiay or Dennis Smith Jr or Ish Smith.  The track record of guys who play this poorly in year three is bad."
last season the Spurs were starting and playing Bryn fucking Forbes for 30 minutes a game. not every player that starts should start. idk how you guys don't see the difference between an ish smith type of player and a Ricky Rubio type of player.
ish smith and a second
"Totally agree with what you said about the 3P shooting there. Durant is an absolute specimen to be fair. I think Tatum has him slightly on pull up 3s though.  I think Tatum has at least mild success on anyone on that team, and Tatum on Kyrie would be interesting alright. Those quick little guards always get us in trouble though. The Ish Smith types. You'd think ""yeah put our guard who is an all-nba defender on them"". NOPE. Smart guards 5s better than points üò©"
Ish Smith
"Not sure to be honest if even Ish Smith could maintain his production from last season.  There was a stretch where the Wizards were 3-1 without Beal, Bertans, and Bryant- with wins against the Celtics, Nuggets, and Heat largely due to Ish among others like Jordan McRae."
u really think ish smith and thomas bryant would‚Äôve made a difference?
"And let who shoot then ? Ish Smith ? Neto ? G. Mathews ? I really don't know what they expect them to do, Hachimura has been playing great, Beal is always a beast, Bertans is on a slump tho and Deni hasn't been used properly. People want low volume from Westbrook, but who would take the rest of the shots in that roster ?"
So the Wizards need to play Ish Smith or Raul Neto more right? Who takes Westbrook's minutes if playing him is making them lose?
The covid infecting a few players didn't help. Ish Smith/Thomas Bryant were healthy last year plus Bertans has been pretty disappointing so far this season.  But yeah the Wizards have been pretty disappointing this season.
"I know it's fuck Scott Brooks on this sub but I think the Wizards genuinely want to win games. It's a directive from ownership/management and even the worst coach knows that playing vets is typically better than playing rookies (even if Avdija is better than Ish Smith, which I genuinely believe)  Unfortunately with this roster you're not making the playoffs"
"Tbf most of the team during this last stretch has been trash.  Like look back at the last 6 games,  who are these people? Bertans is either hurt or streaky.  Deni i guess needs to develop more,  in not sure what his role is. Robin looks better on offense but can't defend or even attempt to rebound.  Alex len is a big,  that's it nothing to add to that.  Neto is scrappy which is great but to small to defend.  Matthew can shoot 3s but his defense is either a foul or getting a charge.  Then we got gafford who seems to be a great pick and roll guy for westbrook but if course he gets hurt. Ish Smith doesn't fit at all, he passes up shots way too much. The rest are just bodies they throw in there.  Now i think westbrook has been trying to turn it up with beal and rui out but you're right, the during isnt exactly the same. And he's always been pretty inefficient but his free throws are terrible and he is taking alot of questionable shots. But ultimately i enjoy how he plays so idk why people always trip"
"Man it takes big balls to watch his team play every game, if I were in your shoes I‚Äôd straight up give up on the team until next season &amp; he‚Äôs gone  It infuriates me that he plays Ish Smith - Raul Neto - Westbrook together and I‚Äôm not even a wiz fan"
Watching Ish Smith next to WB infuriates me. Why is Brooks playing 2 guards who cant shoot??
Cause developing Raul Neto and Ish Smith is clearly more important
Thomas Bryant.  Ish Smith.
"This is a bit off the beaten path, but 2nd round pick Saben Lee has actually looked like he will carve out a long NBA career as a solid backup PG in the mold of Ish Smith.  His stats are nothing phenomenal, but he has a feel for the game and tenacity in getting into the paint/defending that is really impressive."
"Fine, Sixers GOAT Ish Smith would average 28"
I don‚Äôt even know what a good scorer is anymore. Ish Smith could average 24 on the right bad team
"Ish Smith is there to defend and set picks? Do you know who Ish Smith is?  You also don't seem to know what chucking is. Gill, Hutchinson, and Smith all have below average usage% and take a below average amount of shots per possession. In fact Gill would have the 4th lowest usage% in the entire league if he had enough minutes to qualify for leaderboards. That is about as far from chucking as it's possible to get."
"Yea I mean I noted why he shot chucked. It was bad shots but hard to blame him. I would go insane if Anthony Gill, Chandler Hutchinson and Ish Smith can't stop chucking.  They are there to set picks and defend. Not to shoot."
If the nets can get a player whose been on one team his whole career like a Giannis or ish smith they‚Äôd be undisputed favorites.
Are you saying Westbrook and Ish Smith midrangers aren‚Äôt the most efficient offense in the league?
Thats was a pathetic coaching peformance from brooks. 0 movement on offense and just spamming mid ranges for westbrook and ish smith
The wizards offense has 0 movement or actual plays. Legit went like 15 plays straight with the play being a russ or ish smith midrange shot
Ish Smith is the guy Mr Normal Collars brought in to *improve* the lineup
"I forgot which game it was where Brooks ran a 3 PG line up of Ish Smith, Westbrook and Neto. 3 guards with 2 guards who can't shoot. Brooks daring the Wiz to fire him."
Ish Smith is a point guard
They can't win without Beal so why bother? They can't win a playoff series unless one of those guys (Ish Smith or Neto) step up. So maybe think longer than your tiny little dick and realize there's more to winning than winning every single game and possession. How we'll did that work out for Thibs? You trying to Thibs this team into injury hell?
"Ish Smith, Kira Lewis etc"
"Usually it's ""Russ who is basically a 5'11"" Ish Smith,"" amirite?"
Cut Ish Smith and sign Rivers - Wizards
‚ÄúIsh Smith who is basically a 5‚Äô11‚Äù Russ‚Äù
wow ish smith really is complete trash
"If you include Embiid, the all-Process Sixers team in 2021 is not terrible     TJ   Covington  Jerami Grant   Dario  Embiid  Christian Wood  Nerlens  Richaun Holmes  Ish Smith  Jakaar  MCW"
1. Smush Parker 2. Spudd Webb 3. Sergio Rodriguez 4. Earl Boykins 5. Aaron Holiday 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Steve Kerr 8. Ish Smith 9. Steph Curry 10. Kenny Smith  1-5 are complete locks but the latter half can be argued and moved around a bit
We also had Isaiah Thomas and Ish Smith as our point guards last year lmao
"Chose either one of those explication :  \- Russ is a stad padding demon sent to destroy teams  \- Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown and Ish Smith were their 2nd, 3rd, 4th and  th best players last year (or at least the 5 who had the more win shares I didn't watch). Bryant has been out all year, Bertans was out of shape to start the year, Troy Brown was out of the rotation all year and Ish is the worst possible fit next to Russ"
No Thad young? No Pat Connigton? Holy fuck no ish Smith. Shit fucking lineup
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
"For whatever it's worth, even with Blake out, Andre was not the Pistons' first option, nor has he ever been. Pistons coaches have been variably open to trying to give Andre some touches in hopes of developing any semblance of a post game but they've all known better than to try to pretend he'd be a first or second option under any circumstances.  Injured Blake was still the first option for half of that series. Then it was pretty much anyone but Andre for the rest of the series. Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Wayne Ellington.   Andre's numbers can look deceiving; folks will interpret him as a certain option based off his scoring average. But his points are often a result of tip-ins or pick &amp; roll dunks. The times where he actually touched the ball as an option of sorts usually resulted in disaster on account of his incredibly low offensive skill (except for the few times where it works out, which then end up on a mixtape that makes him look like he's great).  Frankly, his TS%, for the type of skills he has, should probably be hovering around 65 percent or higher, because he has no business doing anything but dunking and tipping on offense."
"He played, and didn't dunk with Ish Smith, Derrick Rose,  Langston Galloway, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard. All guards who can throw a lob. Bruce does it frequently now. All that said the gravity the stars on the nets cause opens up alot of space. Blake just isn't good enough to outright beat guys anymore. He needs to be open and he wasn't for us. He's not a good first second or third option. But he can be a solid 5th or 6th on a stacked team. It's no conspiracy."
Ish Smith - Is a point guard
"Russ should start averaging 15 rebounds per game and make Bill Russell look as irrelevant as he made Oscar look. Then he‚Äôll make Stockton look like Ish Smith. Destroyer of legends, that Westbrook."
"At LT? Tyron Smith is like 20-30 ish pounds heavier than he is so not a ton more weight.  Tyron Smith is also shorter than I thought, legit thought he was like 6'8"
As a suns fan? Jamal Murray. Second options? Thomas Bryant and ish smith. Don‚Äôt ask me why
"I will never trust Ish Smith to ever handle a ball. However, he's the only man I want for a rectangular object"
Shit defence and maybe shit lineups  Doesn‚Äôt he play with fucking Ish Smith and Raul Neto for significant parts of the game
"Ish Smith, Dillon Brooks. Westbrook"
That game was a heartbreaker. I thought Ish Smith was gonna deliver a ridiculous comeback victory.
"Well this is coming from a black person as well but I feel like your take on it is super optimistic and in a perfect world that should be the case...but it‚Äôs way too hopeful and I feel like you kinda miss the point in a large way which kinda makes me sad  I know here we‚Äôre talking about players specifically but this is a topic going through an entire community. Will LeBron James be fine? Of course. Hell, Ish Smith will be fine too because you‚Äôre right...they have money. Every day they see how modern medicine works and they benefit from it more than most other people and that‚Äôs fantastic   But the skepticism isn‚Äôt in the medicine. The skepticism is in the people providing it and possibly hidden agendas. The skepticism is in not trusting your own government. These players can afford to trust the government but people in poverty can‚Äôt. Wasn‚Äôt there documented studies talking about how they were running tests on black people just to see how something would develop inside humans? Basically using black people as lab mice. Makes you wonder why black people specifically?  Now of course they wouldn‚Äôt ever do that on high profile players because like you said, they have millions, but at the same time we still got dudes calling players the n word at games, we had the cop slam a player, a cop try to slam Masai Ujiri and all this other stuff. For some groups your money don‚Äôt mean shit to them  *Then* we look look at even the riots. This didn‚Äôt involve players at all but we had mostly white trump supporters storm the capitol where it seemed like the president gave the okay but when black people were rioting and protesting they got different energy and the catalyst for those two incidences were so far from each other on a scale that it‚Äôs embarrassing  So I‚Äôm bringing all this up because all of this **history** is why black people are skeptical. There hasn‚Äôt been enough history to show that you can truly escape this. What happens these days is how people treat you really depends on where the switch was set to and the sad thing is nobody ever knows where that switch is  So if we had a little thought experiment let‚Äôs do it like so: if Lebron James got this new vaccine and was part of a large group of other black men who died from it...what would you say?  Would you be shocked because all the people died or would you be shocked because it seems like another thing happening to only one group of people?   Now compare that to if Tom Hanks died in a similar group. Nobody would ever think anyone was targeted in that group  The goal in all of this is to live in a world where both of those scenarios have the same reaction without anyone using history to point to foul play but I promise you right now that couldn‚Äôt happen. Even if LBJ was in a group of predominantly white people. People will still feel like something was off   So really I feel like the point of all this is to say that I just can‚Äôt agree with you at all and it‚Äôs painful seeing people just side with you like ‚Äúof course players should be ok with it. They‚Äôre rich!‚Äù As a black dude that shouldn‚Äôt be what you fight for. That‚Äôs not how you should earn your equality because if today all you need is money then who knows what you need tomorrow. And because of *that*...that‚Äôs why players have the right to be skeptical imo"
"George Hill, or a trade for someone like Ish Smith to run the bench offense"
"Ish Smith, Jimmy Butler, DJ Augustine, Kemba Walker"
right. but books playmaking was more than enough last year. if they had even an average backup pg i guarantee they woulda had a winning record. theres a reason that cameron payne breaking out for them had such a massive effect on their record. a guy like him or even just an ish smith or whatever from the beginning of the season woulda done wonders for their roster when rubio and book were on the bench
"I have TJ/Grant/RoCo/Wood/Embiid as my starting 5. My bench would be Richaun as my 6th man, Ish Smith, Okafor, JaKarr Sampson, and Stauskas. The bench after Smith and Holmes is a struggle. But this is a solid 3/4 seed."
"There was just a thread about this posted by Cranjis McBasketball on NBAdiscussion, the creator of LEBRON, and he concluded that out of the impact metrics he prefers DLEBRON and DRAPTOR, and this is what he said about D-EPM, which he put in the metrics that he wouldn't use for defense:  ""D-EPM, which hasn't released methodology publicly. It has good offensive data integrating a tracking box prior with RAPM calcs, but the defensive side has some strange results (like Dario Saric ranking 2nd, Ish Smith in the 96th percentile, or McCollum being in the 56th percentile). There's no luck-adjusting, which is why we see guys like Saric show up a bit too high (he shows up among the most lucky defenders when comparing RAPM to LA-RAPM). I like the offensive component of this though! Once a writeup is released it'll also be easier to evaluate. ""  Here's the full post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/lxmwf0/the\_set\_of\_data\_points\_film\_to\_use\_for\_a\_holistic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/lxmwf0/the_set_of_data_points_film_to_use_for_a_holistic/)"
he certainly is not worse than Ish Smith or Sato
"\*gets hired by the Wizards*  ""Ish Smith is the most is a point guard player I've ever seen"""
"He‚Äôd still be a 2x Scoring Champ, 3x Assist champ, and one of the best playmakers of all time even with his reckless drives and fumbles. He‚Äôs averaging 11.6 APG to Alex Len and Ish Smith. Between this season and 18/19 he‚Äôs put up two of the highest potential assist tallies of this generation. No one here is acting like he‚Äôs a good scorer, especially not in the Steph era post 16/17 and *especially* not with his FT% this year but he‚Äôs still a great player with an equally great amount of flaws."
I only went to the Wizards-Nuggets game on 1/4/2020  last season and I‚Äôm under the impression that Ish Smith is the best player on the team
"Why does Brooks hate Bonga? I would rather play him then Smith with Russ on the floor. Bonga can at least defend, Ish Smith is good at...dribbling?      The Len over Gafford move though..lol."
The man has favoured Ish Smith with Russ the entire season lmao.
"The last time i watched the wizards as the game against the bucks. I cringed watching ish Smith do anything, and his jumper is whack"
"yes westbrook having the ball is the reason the team lost, he only put up 34 points and 15 assists  how sad must your life be to hate on a man that has done nothing to you?  Gafford playing 10 seconds in the 4th and Brooks running Ish Smith and Westbrook at the same time is the reason for the loss"
Ish Smith played 28 minutes
Ish Smith played 28 minutes
"Scott Brooks has single handedly lost us close to 10 games this season.   1. He doesn't like calling timeouts ( leading to bad shots, and turnovers)  2. He doesn't like drawing up plays. Go Beal and Go Westbrook are his options.  3. He thinks playing Ish Smith with Russell Westbrook is good.  4. Adding on to that, he really likes 3 guard line ups including Westbrook, Smith, and Neto  5. He doesn't like playing Daniel Gafford who is our third best player."
Our coach leaves our 2nd and 3rd best players on the bench and closes out the game with Ish Smith &amp; Alex Len üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ
"I just don‚Äôt understand why have Ish Smith out there? Garrison Matthew‚Äôs, Rui, even Chandler would‚Äôve at the very least taken that open corner 3"
Zero spacing for Westbrook when you have Ish Smith and Len not being able to convert any open looks they get and then you have ish and Neto in along with Len. Pathetic.
Also loving the spacing of this Ish Smith Westbrook backcourt.
I am more mad at scott brooks man. Happens every single game. Literally got so frustrated to see WB throw it out to a WIDE OPEN ish Smith and he passes it to Neto. He can‚Äôt shoot so why on earth is a ball dominant guard who can‚Äôt shoot next to WB? And don‚Äôt get me started on Len/Gafford rotation.
Why is Ish Smith on the floor with him for extended periods of time? Why did Rui and Gafford get no playing time in the 4th? Scott Brooks is the real reason we lost
I‚Äôm so fucking tired of Scott Brooks. Ish smith and Len on the court for no damn reason
"Again, why is ish Smith out there?"
Ish Smith in there instead of Rui? Drug test Scotty
Why is Ish Smith out there?
What kind of lineup is this? Ish Smith and Neto on the court in crunch time with Russ  Are they trying to lose
Playing Ish Smith and Russ at the same time will do that
"I've gotta say, Ish Smith has proven me wrong harder than any player ever has. I figured he was beyond hopeless by year three, and here he is still a quality player in his 30s."
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt think floor raisers are a real thing should watch 1 minute of Ish Smith trying to feed Robin Lopez posting and re-posting for 24 whole seconds.
Who likes there favorite player more. Clyde wirh ish Smith or breen with curry?
"My guy is passing to ish smith, daniel house, and andre roberson creating straight buckets and elevating careers. WHY NOT!"
I am an honorary Process Sixers fan and to prove it I'm naming the entire 15-16 team one by one  PG: Ish Smith/TJ Mcconnell/Kendall Marshall  SG: Hollis Thompson/Isaiah Canaan/Nik Stauskas  SF: Robert Covington/JaKarr Sampson  PF: Carl Landry/Jerami Grant/Elton Brand  C: Jahlil Okafor/Nerlens Noel
Which young players though? Problem is you give the ball to Neto or Ish smith they'll always look to shoot most of the guys on this wizards team are selfish westbrook is the only one who will pass.
Ish Smith
"Ish ""josh"" smith"
Trae did all his scoring on Ish Smith that quarter.
Ish smith shoots way too much for my liking
Ish Smith midrange shot is so smooth
I agree with this. Ish Smith might be the best Trae defender.
"The lakers have depth, still had Dennis there, and a good defensive coach/defensive team as well as continuity. If the wizards had a defensive identity sure I'd give them a shot but the problem is they have the worst defensive team in the league (just look at there last 3 or so games for instance) and Trae will just abuse the pick and roll against guys like neto, ish smith, bertans, mathews, etc... like theres no reliable talent on this wizards team the only reason theyre where they are is because of russ, and beal. Oh ya Scott Brooks is also employed there for whatever reason thats a negative in itself."
"Your biases are showing.   &gt; he should have been able to make the playoffs more than once in 6 years  He made playoffs twice in 6 years. Your information is incorrect.  &gt; Top-tier floor raisers like LeBron, CP3, Harden, Jokic etc simply don‚Äôt miss the playoffs like that even when their teams take a shit ton of injuries, **unless they themselves get injured**.  AD was in fact injured. The 2 seasons he made playoffs in NO (2015 and 2018), he played 68 and 75 games respectively, which is 2 of his 3 healthiest seasons as a member of that team. Following your logic:  * Top tier floor raisers don't miss playoffs unless they themselves get injured  * AD makes playoffs when healthy, missed playoffs when he's hurt  Therefore, by your own words, AD is a top-tier floor raiser. ""But what about seasons 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019?"" Well, seeing that you don't count Jokic's first 3 seasons against him (which is fair, he wasn't a superstar yet), you should be partial by ignoring AD's first 2 seasons. That leaves us with:  * 2016 - Injured (61g). Best teammates were Jrue (65g), Ryno (66g), Eric Gordon (45g), and Tyreke Evans (25g). All 4 of his best teammates were injured, and you still expect them to make playoffs? Outside of those 4 you had trash like Ish Smith and Alonzo Gee getting rotation minutes.  * 2017 - AD was actually healthy (75g). Surrounded by Jrue (67g), Dante Cunningham, Ish Smith, Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, Langston Galloway, and E'Twuan Moore. Boogie only played 17 games. This legitimately is a playoff supporting cast to you? Give me a break.  * 2019 - Missed a few games due to injury, but the bigger problem was that he had his minutes limited and was shut down due to trade requests."
Ish Smith is a point guard
"Random Scrub Heat Killer. This includes Garrison Matthews, Ish Smith, the Magic, Anthony Tolliver and a bunch mire players I‚Äôm forgetting"
Prime Ish Smith was fast af.
"Yeah he'd be smart to play Bertans and Mathews, but he's Scott Brooks so he's gonna play Bonga and Ish Smith with Russ, so basically Russ will either have unsustainable shooting nights or he'll go 4/22"
"I expect Scott Brooks to scratch his head and call a timeout to tell his guys to play with more energy after putting out Russ, Ish Smith, and Neto to counter a Sixers lineup with Embiid."
"I've always been a big WB fan, but this year I feel like I've entirely shifted my NBA watching to the Wizards instead of watching various teams around the league.  Besides WB - we have:  \- Beal piling it on every game - 31.4 pts per game!   \- Bertans - LATVIAN LASER  \- Rising players in Rui and Gafford - latter in particular has been revelation since coming to Wizards, and to get him for Troy Brown Jr and Moe Wagner!!! He's been integral to this run.   \- A lot of solid vets and teammates - RoLo (CAPTAIN HOOK), Neto, A Gill, Len, Ish Smith - playing hard and not giving a crap about stats  \- Great team chemistry - everyone likes and playing for each other, going all out every game, hustling hard   \- I've said before that Brooks' game-to-game coaching is not good - but to have this team play this hard every night and with team chemistry at a high, have to credit him for that.  \- JK and Gooden being homers... but not unbearable homers, they're usually just stoked for the team (and esp compared to earlier in the season when they both sounded defeated most nights), and Gooden is good for a few random comments every night.   \- Entertaining style of play - they score a lot, don't defend that well, and don't know how to quit (or win a blowout).   It's been ENTERTAINING - and hoping the Wiz keeps rising, what a story after their crap start    to the season. Ignoring the triple doubles, you'll have to credit WB with a lot of the above - what a leader."
"\&gt;  Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back  That's Ainge's own fault . Could've traded Kyrie at the deadline and still got a lot for him. Horford was aging who cares. Hayward they could've gotten something back in S&amp;T (Myles Turner and some other pieces iirc) but chose not too.  After KD left the Thunder they changed the CBA to incentivize players to sign early extensions. Since then most stars have either signed early or worked out a trade. Beal himself has signed multiple early extensions with DC and can sign another one this summer or next, if he declines and says he wants to hit FA then he'll be traded for value. You're making up the least likely scenario  &gt;I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I‚Äôm not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)  Ish Smith carrying a load, that's hilarious lol. Wash have all their 1st rd picks other than the 2023 (protected), that represents an opportunity to add young talent every year. There are worse off teams who traded away multiple future picks, like the Bulls."
If only they could play Ish Smith and Raul Neto in Russ‚Äô place. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be at the top of the East instead.
Why does a player like Ish Smith exist? He is very short with no extraordinary skills to justify his lack of height
Ish ‚ÄúFastest player of all time‚Äù Smith
First Jrue Holiday is more than just a ‚Äúsolid role player‚Äù. Second In general the term role player is pretty general and describes 95% of the league (I mean it ranges from Draymond Green to Ish Smith). Knowing this there are better comps for Lonzo besides Jrue because their games are so different.
Ish Smith on the other hand...
Ish Smith is a point guard
I can't believe ISH SMITH: A POINT GUARD started a game in this season after being murdered on reddit
Ish Smith is fucking fast and he was even faster back then....and he just gets outrun like some nobody.
That Ish Smith step back got interested early on. The whole game was awesome.
ISH SMITH: is a shooting guard
"besides a hall of famer and an all star, we developed a guy who the league values as worth 2 firsts, a starting center, a solid bench guard, a solid bench big, (not to mention Noel who is one of the best defenders in the league) but lets focus on Ish smith?  Also not sure why grant shouldnt count, he was on his way to becoming quite a good player. Not everyone is instantly good.   This is not to say OKC isn't doing a good job with team building, I think they're doing quite well. But comparing the importance of SGA to OKC to the importance of Ish Smith here is just another bad faith process argument, certainly not the first, probably not the last."
"Beal is averaging nearly the same amount of points as he did last year with Ish Smith at PG lmao. You can‚Äôt credit Westbrook for Beal‚Äôs stats.  You also can‚Äôt just do a flat comparison of ‚Äúpoints created‚Äù because with Westbrook‚Äôs inefficiency he‚Äôs actually COSTING the team points/possessions.  I‚Äôm not a Westbrook hater to the degree that I think he‚Äôs a net negative, I think he‚Äôs a great playmaker and runs an offense at absolutely elite pace for every second he‚Äôs on the floor. But he‚Äôs very far from being as good a player as Beal is."
"&gt;while building around Ish Smith and Okafor  Yea man, exactly what was going on. Cant think of another guy they built around.   What an insane post lol."
That one turnover coming from being stripped when he was posting up Ish Smith. Virtually 0TO while passing on 20AST
What‚Äôs really crazy is that one turnover was when Ish Smith stripped Luka when he posted him up. 0TO from pass attempts is pretty crazy
"That was when he tried to post Ish Smith and got stripped.  He put on a passing clinic tonight, especially in the 2nd half when they doubled him 90 percent of the time."
Those Ish Smith minutes were terrible lmaoo
today i saw why scott brooks is a bad coach  he kept ish smith in the 3rd for like 10 minutes when he clearly wasn't contributing anything
"Whoa, give the thunder a chance to tank multiple seasons...... The Sixers also did play the best players on their team at the time, the Thunder are not; which is what people are saying is more egregious.  P.s- t.j. McConnell, roCo, ish Smith, and Jakar Sampson were all process players that are now on other teams doing well"
The Ish Smith Process Sixers would run this team off the floor
I love Canaan too but he is absolutely not a PG. Playing him as our starting PG was one of the reasons we started the season 1-29 that one year and played relatively better after trading for Ish Smith.
Dude what in the fuck are the Lakers doing on that possession? All 5 around the 3 point line and still nobody gets back to cover Ish Smith releasing. That's some high school shit.
Tbf that was an uncontested dunk after an outlet pass from Russ. But every ish Smith dunk is a cause for celebration.
"Damn, we got three absolute monster posters in one game. (Rui's, this one and Hutchison's) plus a dunk in traffic from 5'11"" Ish Smith"
"Ish ""is a point guard"" Smith.  Put some respect on his name."
It‚Äôs a good game when Ish Smith dunks it
"Our broadcast guys were seriously complimentary tonight about many things Wizards-related; Stu Lantz (analyst) kept hyping up Westbrook, Billy Mac (play-by-play) was talking about Ish Smith, they were giving props to Lopez, etc..."
"I want to clown the Lakers for losing to the Wiz, and spout a bunch of hot takes about how AD can't carry a team... so I will.  But the Wiz are legit, especially if Ish Smith is dunking now."
"Just want to take a second to say how nice it is to see Ish Smith still in the league. He was a 4-year player in college, went undrafted and is in his 11th season in the league. Feels good to see players find ways to carve out surprisingly long careers in the league."
Y‚Äôall really let ish smith and Westbrook develop chemistry
Genuinely didn‚Äôt think Ish Smith could get up like that. Nice
"I would add to the list of people who got time with us to develop when they might not have elsewhere....Korkmaz (26th), TLC (24th), Richaun Holmes (37th). Like it's not always about what was expected from them, as much as it's about how much did they get to see the floor.  Then you also have players that weren't getting time playing elsewhere that did at the 6ers. Like Ish Smith was with 7 teams in his first 4 years averaging about 8 minutes, then goes to 27 minutes a game with the sixers.  It's not a MASSIVE amount (a decent amount over a few years). But it's always great when you see some guy out there that didn't think they'd be in the league necessarily."
"I want to win. I came from old school basketball, so I like Drew Gooden, the floor spacer. I like Larry Sanders, the shot blocker. I like Ish Smith (is a point guard). It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing it to be malicious, but it‚Äôs how I play. It‚Äôs Milwaukee basketball. I can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù"
"We‚Äôll never be able to really tell when he plays next to Alex Len, Ish Smith, Garrison Matthews and Raul Neto.   Currently there‚Äôs no way to tell his value as a first or second option because the Wizards haven‚Äôt put a decent roster around him."
"Or Raul Neto, Garrison Matthews, Ish Smith, Alex Len  By the way, 2 of these players start for the Wizards and the other 2 play rotation minutes for the Wizards"
he went 9/24 and had 5 turnovers. if he never shot more than 12 times a game that would be nice. i'd rather have ish smith 3 pointers than russ shooting mid range bricks. he could play more reserved he just doesn't want to.
"Yeah dude, playing 270 out of 1888 minutes with Ish Smith really tanked Russ' stats  (and that's even if we ignore the fact that the ORTG of Russ + Ish is almost the same as Russ without Ish...but again, who likes facts right?)  Or maybe - just maybe - math exists and taking a lot of shots with poor efficiency is bad."
"&gt;Even worse, why is the offense better with him off the floor than on it?  It's possible that Scott Brooks plays Ish Smith and Russ at the same time. Actually, it's possible he plays Ish, Russ and Raul at the same time.  But I guess that makes too much sense for you lmfao"
Ish Smith is a point guard!
Are we sure Ish Smith didn't play for every team in a single season
Not from the fans but Jeff Turner use to call Ish Smith the water bug because of his speed. After Super Mario lost his luster he became Pooper Mario. And Coach Cliff is Thanos. Oh and Gary Clank the Tank Commander.
"ish smith is going way overboard to the other extreme tho  i think he is a low end top 10 player thorugh his prime on average   a player who usually doesnt give you a championship window by himself unless you combine hin with another top 5 or top 10 player and solid role players (okc in 2013, 2014 or 2016 despite not winning)  as i said he is not a lebron or curry but there is only a handful  of those level players at any given year"
"But based on what? Are you comparing him to Ish Smith or other MVP's? He's a fantastic player and easily was in the top 10 during his peak, he's just a level or two behind other MVP's. Saying he's a winning player is like saying water is wet, technically correct, but what's the context?"
"Ish Smith fucked it up, he was trying to get an assist and rebound in the possession to get closer to the triple double."
Ish Smith
"Damn I can‚Äôt believe the Russ, ish Smith, create a player wing, deni advija, and Robin looez backup unit struggled to score so much. This is shocking."
Steph clearly washed I'd take Ish Smith over him
Time to trade him for Ish Smith and send picks
I say we trade him for Ish Smith and send picks
"They are still a bad team because they've lost their 3rd best player to injury, their fourth best player was out of shape after signing his big contract and they have the worst coach in the NBA. But hey I guess Westbtook injured Bryant, forced Bertans not to train for 8 months and demanded to play in line ups with no spacing with Ish Smith and Isaac Bonga"
"Imagine having won 5 straight and still being 9 games under .500, lmao Kings special.   Bertans in the lineup instead of Rui gives you guys so much better spacing and offense.   Rui really should come off the bench and be the 6th man creator, less Ish Smith please."
Is Ish Smith a joke to you?
"I think we used up all of our lottery luck winning Zion. I was thinking more Tim Frazier, Ish Smith, Elfird Payton, etc. Somebody that floor general for most of the game, but isn't going to have the ball in their hands in crunch time. We could probably get all three combined well under the cost for Lonzo."
Destroyer of Worlds. Ish ‚ÄúDecade‚Äù Smith
i feel like ish smith has done that to every team at some point.
"Iggy the snek, Nurk the quitter, and Ish Smith destroyer of worlds (we don't actually have a hate boner for him, I just love bringing him up in these discussions because he killed us in a meaningless game one time lol)"
"33% from 3 isn‚Äôt elite efficiency. Also, you‚Äôre severely underestimating how bad brooks is. Put harden out there with ish Smith and Neto they are not taking the league by storm. Pair him with Lopez and Alex Len for the season. There are only a couple of nba level players on that team. Len couldn‚Äôt even cut it as the 3rd center for the raptors and he starts for the wizards. He‚Äôs even gotten some 15-20 pt nights just off Westbrook. He‚Äôs literally the reason some of these guys even deserve to play. Gafford wasn‚Äôt even playing for the bulls and he just had a career night off of feeding off Westbrook"
Hey look man Ish Smith kills alright. Any Celtics fan will tell you
Racking up blocks on Elfrid Payton and Ish Smith
Ish Smith
Ish Smith
"&gt;I don't know what other coach sucks for 3 straight years and still gets a vote of confidence from the organization.  Their best player missed 163 out of 236 games in that time frame.  How far is a team supposed to go with Bertans, Rui and Ish Smith as 3 of your best 4 or 5 players supposed to go?"
I wonder how an Ish Smith/Wayne Ellington/Trevor Ariza/Thaddeus Young/Jeff Green team would do
"Russ and Beal went 23-7 with Bertans, Neto, Gafford, Lopez, Len, Rui, Ish Smith as their supporting cast   I don‚Äôt think they sweep the Nuggets but they probably make it just as far"
"Devin Harris, John Wall, Tony Parker, Ish Smith, D Rose De‚ÄôAaron Fox  Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Kira Lewis makes that list soon"
ish Smith
Ish Smith has some nice dribbles and quick acceleration but boy his jumper is ugly lol
Kira Lewis pretty fast too and Ish Smith  &amp;#x200B;  \*edit forget about Monte Ellis
"[Masked Russ running the length of the court in 5 seconds while being hounded by Ish Smith, who's pretty fast himself, but gives up because he can't stop him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czm8sh73P5A)  Mf was a fastbreak in human form."
Ish Smith sleeper answer
"Nah lol Reggie really thought he was good üòÇ. Good to have confidence but don't oversell come on now Russell Westbrook here, I can see if it's ish Smith or somebody starting."
"Let‚Äôs see:   - Okafor,  - Noel,  - McConnell,  - Canaan,  - RoCo,  - Ish Smith partway through,  - Sampson,  - The guy who coined the term ‚Äúthe process‚Äù whose name I forget but tore his ACL or something [edit: Tony Wroten, thanks!] - Injured Embiid,  - Dario didn‚Äôt come over yet,  - Jerami Grant, - KJ McDaniels,  - Maybe Furkan Aldemir, and - Richaun Holmes.   That‚Äôs about all of the players I remember for sure."
Lamelo Ball and Ish Smith
We‚Äôll offer Ish Smith for Booker and a 1st.
Can you explain to me exactly how Bruce Bowen and Ish Smith are in any way similar? And Beverley is a lazy comp to Bruce Bowen. Completely different sizes and play styles.
Bruce Bowen was basically the 2003 version of Ish Smith or Patrick Beverly. Bruce Bowen was often referenced as a dirty player who played good/great defense. Explain how they are different.
honestly this whole post was just to make an ish smith joke but i feel like a lot of people got mad at the snubs lol
I thought for a second it was saying ish smith was looking for 60 mil
"Wtf, are you an Ish Smith stan or something?"
"I agree with you, was more of a joke on ""Ish Smith: is a point guard"""
"if he gets the job, MDA will have coached or assistant coached the following point guards:   - Nash   - Harden   - CP3  - Westbrook   - Lillard  - Kyrie  - Ish Smith   remarkable."
"In 2017-18, the Pistons were 27-18 when Reggie was healthy and 12-25 during a rather long stretch when he was injured. They were 4-12 in the games between Reggie getting injured and trading for Blake.  Drummond was putting up 16 rebounds per game. Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver were 2nd and 7th in the league in 3 point percentage, respectively. Luke Kennard looked like a promising role player as a rookie.  Ish Smith was good off the bench but far from ideal as a starter. And Dwight Buycks always had good energy off the bench but he just wasn't that good - he hadn't played in the NBA for nearly three years when he became our primary backup PG and he hasn't played in the NBA since. That gap at point hurt us A LOT.  I still think that team would've been good had they been able to stay healthy. Nothing spectacular but at least win a playoff series. That was my sixth straight season going to at least 10 games and definitely the most fun that I had. Blake did outstanding the next year but I also felt like they focused on going iso with him way too much and made Jackson's role almost feel irrelevant. I think a lot of it though had to do with a relatively new owner in Gores (total douche, for the record), who had just moved the team from Auburn Hills to Detroit, being more focused on the image and appeal of getting a superstar like Blake on the team.  Overly long response, but once I got going it just flowed."
"I vaguely remember Ish Smith having a few very good stretches in the regular season, but I am not sure if this was before Blake came to Detroit"
Nah I don't get sad when ish smith looks bad either
Adding Luka doesn‚Äôt solve any of their roster issues. Maybe 76ers in 6 off one of these 40+ point Luka games but you still have an atrocious defense and now you‚Äôre starting either Neto or Ish Smith so good luck
ish smith for jokic who says no?
Ish Smith is a goat
"I don't think there are any sensible arguments that could be made for this year's teams being better without those players that are injured. In this day and age I think the most likely scenario would be an iso-heavy, defensively-deficient star missing lots of time. The result there would be the offense moving to a more ball-movement-oriented style, with the team defense improving without that liability on the court. I don't think that anybody fits that mold this year, closest I could think would be if Westbrook had gotten injured and the Wizards somehow managed to beat the Sixers led by Beal, Ish Smith, and Rui Hachimura"
"Ah, so the old Ish Smith special."
"Dang thanks for the -5 downvotes everyone even though there are black players with the last name smith and Anderson, Ish Smith, Kyle Anderson"
"Lol we ain't gonna trot out ish smith, Neto, and Beal at the same time lmao. I hope you aren't expecting us to be worse than that"
Ish Smith wouldn‚Äôt do this either but I‚Äôm not sure it means too much to who‚Äôs better lol
"&gt; The only reason Brooks probably played Neto and Smith at the 3 is for offense.  I think you answered your own question.  Brooks' strategy seemed to be to try and win a track meet every game and push the series to 7.  Sixers play good D half court, but struggle in transition.  It was clear players on the Wizards were being coached to push the initiative in transition quite a bit, collapse the D into the paint, and either get an and-1 or kick out to Neto or Ish for a 3 attempt."
"True. I still prefer it over our fans extra cringe ""Trust the Process"" chants that they broke out last night when the only player on the court at the time who was apart of the process was Ish Smith, who played for Washington"
He failed to post up and backdown Ish Smith like 5 times in game 4. Not great.
We have no size at all on this roster. Neto was a 2 guard but playing the 3 all year. Ish Smith is too small.   We couldn't guard anyone because of that lack of size and it constantly killed us.
look we really dont need to worry about ben simmons dominating the court with his defense. sorry man but trae young isnt ish smith. in the 7 games young has had against simmons he had 27/4/10 on 48/35/93
"I think I could win an NBA game with a line up of - ish Smith, Danny Green , finney Smith, Rudy gay,  and thad young."
Are you hiding behind his vaunted 3 guard lineup with Ish Smith?
His defense is trash. That's why you gotta attack him. Sixers basically attacked weak Neto and Ish Smith.
Scott Brooks really letting Ish Smith get scored on every time for the past 10 minutes smh....Yeah put him on 6'10 Ben Simmons
simmons has been exploiting that ish smith switch all fucking game and scott brooks STILL wouldnt take him out. you fucking moron..
Ish Smith is so annoying defensively but I respect the hustle and barely seeing him complain like Pat Bev. Keep this one Wiz.
Ish Smith was the first player that came to mind for me too. His quicks and shiftiness makes him so much fun for me to watch.
can you imagine paying schroeder 4/84 when Ish Smith is basically a slightly worse version
Ish Smith is bettet than Tobias Harris.
Ish smith is fucking quick
"Real talk, Ish Smith. I been hating on the dude for a while but for a reliable backup or backups backup guard he pushes the pace well, distributes, and has a legit mid range jumper"
Harris can‚Äôt even dribble or score on Ish Smith lmao
Yea I was a Ish smith believer tho. I shouldn't have mentioned him alone more so that Lon Babby team *shudders* or his time here in general.
"Ish Smith balled tf out for us don‚Äôt put him in this conversation, we should‚Äôve just kept him instead of bringing in IT. That IT contract was a steal, but with the benefit of hindsight it just wasn‚Äôt going to work."
Ish Smith gave it a good go
"He has some awful lineups that just don't make sense.  A lot of the year he would roll out a lineup of 3 guards with Westbrook, ish smith, and Neto.  It was awful to watch as ish and westbrook both need the ball to do anything. After the Gafford trade and seeing how well he works we stuck with starting Len(until this last game) even though he is clearly the worst of our 3 centers.  Multiple times this season were we were up 3 in the closing seconds of a game and instead of fouling and forcing them to shoot 2.  We let them play and hit a 3 to send it to overtime. Our rookie Deni is a facilitator and for whatever reason Brooks decided to put him in the corner and make him a spot up shooter even though he's not a very good shooter. Just a lot of little things that it seems like most coaches would change when it doesn't work."
lol that's bullshit. Ish Smith deserves every bit of praise he gets.
"And to be clear, they were getting Harris switched onto *Ish Smith* (who is miraculously an important player for this Wizards team) and he was still losing the matchup more often than not despite a 9-inch height advantach and million-percent skill advantage."
"When he becomes the 2nd best point guard in his team, doesnt make sense to start ish smith over Westbrook"
Sixers really lost cause Tobias Harris can‚Äôt back down Ish Smith and Ben Simmons can‚Äôt hit a FT.
"Every time I watch Ish Smith, I am thoroughly whelmed."
"Seeing Tobias Harris fail to backdown Ish Smith multiple times was comical. Also once Danny Green drives inside, you know your offense is short handed."
Why the fuck is ish smith always getting backed down by Harris lol
"Ish Smith and playing out of control, NAMID."
Ish Smith DPOY
Tobi really can‚Äôt back down ish fucking smith
"someone need to make those meme graphics saying ""You just got blocked by Ish Smith"""
Ish smith is a block guard
Ish Smith really blocked Tobi
Blocked by Ish Smith. That's ROUGH
Did Tobias just get blocked by Ish Smith?
**Can someone tell me why Ish Smith doesn't hack Ben Simmons? Ben is 0/10 from the line.**
"luka, trae, ayton, *ish smith*, tatum, morant, cam payne"
Ish Smith is good too
"Dont run 3/4 guard lineups have atleast some size lol. And even if you cant stop them, playing ish smith next to westbrook and a big hurts the offense cuz then theres 3 non shoooters at all times  Against a good playoff defense simmons wont have easy low post buckets, the defenses later in the playoffs are too good to not make his lack of shooting a problem. Luckily for the 6ers only the bucks can probably take advtanage of his issues with their defense probably."
"Rui is pretty much a big man. He can‚Äôt guard wings, he‚Äôs pretty slow laterally. That‚Äôs why we saw the primary defenders on Tatum in the play in game were brad Beal and ish smith."
"&gt;I guess coaches arent allowed to make adjustments lol hes bringing neto and ish smith as the only perimeter players off the bench.  So how would you defend the Embiid Simmons Harris trio  &gt;And im saying against good teams simmons ends up hurting his team offensively, curry will never do that cuz hes a shooter  If hes filling his role how is he hurting his team?  If teams are Scheming his easy low post buckets away that means tobi is on a smaller SF or gaurd and getting his, or Embiid is one on one.  Ben taking away a long defender to neutralize him doesn't work against this sixers team because it creates advantageous matchups for the other players."
"I guess coaches arent allowed to make adjustments lol hes bringing neto and ish smith as the only perimeter players off the bench. And im saying against good teams simmons ends up hurting his team offensively, curry will never do that cuz hes a shooter"
Wizards have guys much larger than ish smith and neto to atleast try out. Even guys like mathews would probably struggle but he would atleast provide spacing that ish smith doesnt at all. Of course a 1 vs 8 is a wash but coaches should try different stuff out
"More Ish Smith, Raul Neto and Davis Bertans ain‚Äôt winning them the series mate."
Ish Smith for starting center
Ish Smith is already out there
Ish Smith is fucking hot trash
Ish smith has been very good in a rare positive for the wizard this playoffs
Lol that ish smith 3
"This game has such a weird feel. We‚Äôve got our bench lineup in, and on Washington‚Äôs side you‚Äôve got Ish Smith and Neto. Doesn‚Äôt feel like the playoffs"
Ish Smith single handily putting the Wizards on his back.
"True story, one of the only reasons I know (and hate) Ish Smith, other than the iconic ‚Äúis a point guard‚Äù post, is that on the 2K16 mobile app, if you get drafted by the Pistons, homie would never take the shot when you ran the shot clock down and passed trying to pad your assist stats."
"All this Ish Smith discussion is pretty interesting, but they left out that he is a point guard."
Love me some Ish Smith. Super underrated process Sixer
Ish Smith baking
Ish Smith: behind the back  Crowd: üò©üëå
Ish Smith is legit better than Westbrook in the playoffs
"Damn, finish that, was real proof that Ish Smith *is* a point guard."
TIL Ish Smith is still in the NBA.
"He‚Äôs not the fastest with the ball. Russ, Ish Smith, Ja and Fox are faster. But Shroder first step and burst of acceleration is def top 5 in the league on par with Ja, Lavine, Zion"
"Wizards tried to run zone but the Sixers got wide open 3s again and again. They eventually stopped to run zone. Wizards don't have the personnel to defend the Sixers full stop. Wizards is a perfect matchup for Sixers no matter how you look at it.   Sixers have all-NBA defenders, they can hide him easily compared to Dallas Mavs. If you give a ball to Ish Smith and Neto that defend by Seth Curry. Sixers will be 100% happy about this because Beal doesn't have a ball to scoring."
Q: What team does Ish Smith play for?  A: Yes.
Ish Smith is a point guard
"Clippers, I‚Äôll trade you Davis Bertans and Ish Smith for Paul George"
"Sorry, but no amount of scheme will bridge the massive talent gap between these two teams.  Beal is the only Wizard the Sixers are remotely afraid of on offense, and there is not a single defender in Washington that could even be labeled as above average.  And ‚Äúattack Seth Curry‚Äù is not a scheme.  Attack him in PnR?  ISO? The Post?  Let‚Äôs be real if the Wizards changed their game plan to go through Neto or Ish Smith against Seth Curry the Sixers would be perfectly happy with that.  Taking the ball out of Beal‚Äôs hands and running the offense through two replacement level point guards is not going to fly in the playoffs, sorry."
"Ish Smith is a Point Guard or really anything from [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hpxcr/dwight_you_can_still_change_your_mind/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) post is class.   ""Find a new slant"", ""TT, Shump, Nets Pick"", ""A lesson was learned"" were all pretty great too when they were popular"
That jekins dude looks like Ish Smith.
I heard Ish Smith was a point guard
"I am proud to say i followed the Sixers close during the Process era and even if they weren't good they were really fun to watch, blowout against Portland with Ish ""the dish"" Smith throwing lobs to everyone comes to mind"
Sheeeiiiiiiiiiiit. You ever heard Ish Smith and Bradley Beal?
"Beal doesn't really play off-ball with Russ - they're much more of a my-turn-your-turn.    Beal took a leap when Wall first got injured in 2017, in part b/c he had to start playing a lot more with the ball in his hands.  (The smartest thing Scott Brooks did in 5 years was force-feed Beal PG possessions - it was f'ing brutal to watch at the time, but it was a lost season, so he was forcing him to develop the skill in games).    Beal was 'in the wilderness' for too long btw Wall &amp; Westbrook, w/ Tim Frazier, young Sato, and Ish Smith as his PGs, so he had to learn to fend for himself.    Over the last two years, 38% of LaVine's 2P shots have been assisted - 40% for Beal.    Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tries, Beal cannot f'ing shoot off-the-dribble 3s, so a lot more of his 3s are assisted than LaVine's.    Watching Beal in the Nigeria game was almost embarrassing - the guy had genuinely forgotten how to play off ball.  He looked just like John Wall when Beal first started getting some initiator possessions - standing on the wing, trying to figure out when to cut, and looking like a teenage driver trying to figure out how to merge in rush-hour traffic."
Wizards Celtics game in 2020 in January in DC. Beal was out so I was excited for a likely Celtics blowout.  But instead ish Smith bullied us and we lost by like 10. Good time tho. Lots of friendly banter with the wizards fans around me.
he‚Äôs no ish smith
So was Ish Smith.
"A legit 5'9"" (probably would get listed at 5'10"") wouldn't be out of place in football whatsoever, considering the runningback position is basically stuck between 5'9"" and 6'1""ish outside of your Darren Sproles and Derrick Henry types on either end. Emmitt Smith, all time leading rusher, is only 5'9"" along with Barry Sanders only being 5'8""; going down the list of all time leading rushers, you have a ton of guys at exactly 5'10"" as well, without considering the fudging on older measurements.  Corner is another position manned by mostly sub-6'2"" guys, considering taller guys would've probably moved to WR; slot guys also tend to be in that 5'9"" to 6'1""ish range."
"oh agreed 100%. i just meant that prioritizing the playoffs even at the cost of a few wins wouldnt have been a bad idea for us imo. play a guy like ish smith if you have to, just let harden and paul get some rest here and there  but again, we're in the west where every game matters so its real easy to see why we never went that root and prioritized winning as many games as we could. but it was also real frustrating knowing that we needed harden and/or paul to have a good game otherwise its basically a guaranteed L. tho that was really true for harden almost his entire time with us, outside of 2018"
Bro no one wants the next coming of Ish Smith
Idk if it's more or less ugly than Ish Smith. On par imo
Bro you really think Ish Smith is a top 20 player?
"Won't get as much press, but he's also the teams best and most versatile defender.  Him being injured was one reason why Scott Brooks had to use a line up of Westbrook, Beal, Neto, and Ish Smith and 1 big.  All 4 guards were 6'3"" or shorter.  lol"
"Try to sign a veteran point guard like Lowry, Conley, or Dragic. All 3 offer leadership, can handle the ball and take pressure off Luka, hit 3s, play offball, and run 2nd unit to keep the offense going when Luka is off.    Try to add some 3&amp;D-ish wings like Oubre, Green, Tucker, and Porter Jr. to surround Luka.    I'd also try to trade Kristaps if possible. He gets played off the court in most playoff matchups and fit is weird. Let's pretend they're able to pull that off.    And maybe sign THJ? Idk. Contract year Tim scares me, but he's undoubtedly important to the team. Depends on the $$.    I think a Lowry-Luka-THJ-Tucker-Powell lineup with Brunson, Finney-Smith, Boban, and another Vet 3&amp;D guy is solid."
Ish Smith
"Outta the league is a bit far, but he quickly turned from an Ish Smith type to a Jarrett Jack over the last few months."
Lakers should seriously consider signing Ish Smith. Idk if he is a free agent but he is very underrated
Ish Smith so good he got mentioned twice
"they clearly did develop talent? see Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood(kind of), Ish Smith, Jerami Grant, Saric, Embiid, TJ McConnell  &amp; i remember point guards Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, TJ McConnell, MCW and Tony Wroten.   i understand you don‚Äôt like the process but what you just said clearly wasn‚Äôt true. Okafor has proven to be a bust on multiple teams, Noel never developed to his potential on multiple teams either. don‚Äôt act like this is strictly a sixers thing"
"Yeah looks like 7 trades in his case. I'd love to see Trevor Ariza (11 trades apparently(!)), Jim Jackson, and Keith Van Horn on NBA bills. Also Ish Smith on the penny or quarter (since he was sent to the G-League and signed back by other teams endlessly, no disrespect haha)."
Ish Smith is only accepted in America right now but I think you can probably get a couple of Jimmers in the Chinese exchange market.
Ish smith: is a point guard
Wasn't that Ish Smith? Or are we talking about two different Pistons ball boy AMAs?
"Imagine sitting through years of the process watching ish smith and Jahlil Okafor and loosing to the hawks lol, I would be mad too"
Simmons for Ish Smith
Ish Smith and that‚Äôs a compliment
"I don‚Äôt think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker‚Äôs points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker‚Äôs now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell‚Äôs Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
Dwight to Milwaukee was a great one. Ish smith is a point guard lololololol
"He could never shoot, but before he wasn't afraid to use his body and post up smaller guards. Hell he did it in the series before against us, whenever ish Smith or Neto were in the game he posted up and went hard to the basket.   This series after the second game he refused to even do that, when he should have been having five or six post uo against Trey Young every game"
"Dude...  The 76ers went the better part of a season with literally no one who could dribble the ball at an NBA level. When Silver forced their hand and Colangelo brought in ISH FUCKING SMITH of all people it was an instant and drastic improvement.  You can try to justifying this to yourself however you want but just know you are telling yourself sweet little lies. There is nothing remotely comparable to the embarrassment of the 76ers ""process""."
"He'll definitely get more than $12 million, but he's coming off a serious lower body injury and has been an injury prone terrible shooter on a bad team for his entire career.  40% FG and 30% from 3 isn't going to put him above Dragic, CP3, Conley, Lowry or Lonzo, and he's maybe going to be closer in value to Patty Mills, Schroeder or Ish Smith.  Unless he's really worried about further injury problems and is hoping for a long contract, this might be a bad idea. Playing with KD, Harden and Kyrie would mean a few less minutes, but also put him on the championship stage, get him a ton of uncontested shots to boost his terrible spilts, and probably be in a situation where he can take as much time as he wants to make sure his Achilles is right. Also, not too much running."
Has been ever since Ish Smith got eliminated
Who's behind him... is that... ISH SMITH!?
Ish Smith has been on like 11 teams
Ish Smith &amp; Wesson
Kemba Walker &amp; Ish Smith
"Speaking of watching players in warmups, I went to a wizards game where ish smith missed at least 10 straight 3‚Äôs and could barely hit any at all. In the game he made 1 at least."
honestly. they gotta trade giannis for a better supporting piece. giannis to dc for ish smith and robin lopez
Emoni bates and dajuan Wagner would already be top 150 players in the nba Mikey and amari right now are better than ish Smith or mcw were in their prime
I'd toss in Ish Smith too.
Idk if it's a pasta but I love the Dwight Howard come to Milwaulkee post. Shit cracks me up.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hpxcr/dwight_you_can_still_change_your_mind  Ish Smith: IS A POINT GUARD   Greek Rookie Guy: FREAK
Cam Payne feels like the new Ish Smith
No Hooke. He is the epitome of ‚Äúsolid and unremarkable‚Äù. Him and Ish Smith.
"There are lots of little guys in the league right now doing good stuff. Jalen Brunson, Ish Smith, Chris Chiozza are all solid guards in the league right now.   J.J. Barea and Isaiah Thomas were also huge for their team's success when they played."
ish ‚Äúis a point guard‚Äù smith
ish smith is Walt Fraziers favorite player!
Ish Smith is still in the league after like a decade and is probably one of the fastest guards in the league.  Tim Frazier is always some backup guard.
"On this sub, I don‚Äôt think it would be controversial to say Ish Smith is better than Simmons"
"Ish Smith, Jimmer Fredette, Lance Stephenson, Mo Bamba, Aron Baynes.  The perfect storm of Lance going off for 25 in a half, Jimmer making every open 3 and having a somewhat favorable matchup on defense, Baynes and Bamba catching every lob and getting every put back and Ish getting you 12-16 could beat a team that overlooks them but should lose every other game they're in by quite a margin.  Bench could feature: IT, Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, Jeremy Lamb, Bismack Biyombo."
"no team with a legitimately very good player is ever going 1-81. Teams led by Gerald Henderson and Ish Smith won 7 and 10 games respectively.   Surround someone like Jimmy Butler with the 437-450th worst players in the league, and there's still a chance he teams up with the third stringers and destroys everyone a couple times. You need to have no players that can take over a game for this to be possible."
"Where is Ish Smith, Brad?"
Charlotte. Losing our guard depth for ish Smith and a rookie is gonna hurt
Augustin and Ish Smith are NBA caliber players
"There's older PG that get signed, DJ Augustin is an old PG that's 5'10"" and gets signed or like Ish Smith    Teams want positive contributiors they don't care about age"
"Ish Smith  &gt;!For me its the Pistons, which I guess makes sense as he played longer in Detroit than any where else!&lt;"
"Pretty much. Maybe slightly less than unknown because we had the ability to bring him back and chose not to, despite having only Ish Smith at backup PG, so that kinda tells me the org didn't like what they saw."
Ish Smith as well
"Memphis drafted Hasheem Thabeet number two overall in the 2009 NBA draft. (The Curry, Harden, literally anyone else draft)  On February 25th, 2010, he was assigned to the D-League Dakota Wizards. He was then traded in February 2011 to the Houston Rockets for Shane Battier and Ish Smith. The Grizzlies also had to part with a 1st round pick in that deal."
1. Brandon Bass 2. MJ 3. Rip Hamilton 4. Ish Smith 5. That old guy at the YMCA gym
"despite being horrible from 2, he's actually not inefficient. most of those shots came from 3. He shot 55.2 TS% which is quite close to league average, and that's despite an absolutely horrible start to the season. Aside from his first ten games of the year, he shot 58 TS% which is actually above league average. That's the power of taking about 70% of your shots from deep.   Yeah we're gonna miss our guards a lot considering we replaced them with a non-scorer in Ish Smith and a rookie in Bouknight. If Bouknight isn't NBA-ready, I see us taking a step back largely due to our bench having no creators on it."
Ish Smith is joining his 12th team (ties NBA record) since his career started 11 years ago lol  at one point he'd played for 9 teams in 6 seasons
"&gt; The Pacers key players all dealt with injuries last year and they had a big upgrade at coach this offseason  The Bulls traded half their roster at the deadline and then only had LaVine and Vuc active together for 15 games because LaVine missed half the post-deadline games with Covid. If you want to argue that matchup based on disruptions in the 2020 season, it's hard to suggest that many teams had more instability than Chicago.  &gt; I don‚Äôt see how the Hornets got worse?  I guess that depends on your opinion on Kelly Oubre, but personally, I see replacing Graham with Oubre and Ish Smith as a lateral move at best, but with a strong chance to be a big downgrade.  &gt; And you‚Äôre acting like I said the Cavs are playoff locks. My point about them is just that they have pressure to be at least a play-in team this year.  Sure, but having pressure to make the play in doesn't make you a realistic threat to make the play in."
"Byron Mullens is the worst player I've ever seen have that level of usage on an NBA team. We've seen back up level player like Ish Smith being forced into way too big of a role on a bad team, but Byron Mullens was basically a poor's man Mike Muscala and was out here posting up and doing the Melo iso jab step dance from the elbow for that Charlotte team"
"&gt;That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   Yeah the big question mark with Hinkie is his talent evaluation/team-building ability which we never saw. The OP lists players that were part of ""The Process"" at one point or another but apart from the 1st rounders the only players that they identified and actually leveraged for on-court success or asset value are RoCo and TJ. It's not an achievement to have Christian Wood or Ish Smith on your team for two minutes when those guys were being passed around from bad team to bad team at one point.  Plus there was the criticism that you can take tons of fliers on guys like this, but how much are they going to get to show when playing alongside rookies and other fliers/journeymen instead of instilling good habits. It's not a foregone conclusion that Jerami Grant/Christian Wood/Richaun Holmes etc wouldn't become as good as they did on other teams but the fact they did blow up elsewhere doesn't retroactively make Hinkie look better to me"
Someone compared him to Ish Smith and I can‚Äôt unsee it now.
"You won't joke about this when you remember that Scott Brooks is now one of your coaches.    It's allllll fun and games until you look up and see Troy Brown, Westbrook, Raul Neto &amp; Ish Smith all playing together [actually happened]."
Imagine your team having to heavily court Ish Smith
Ish Smith is a point guard.
Van-ish Smith
"Ish Smith is one team away from having played for 13 teams, which I believe would be an NBA record."
Ish Smith is the Avatar
Ish Smith is a particularly valuable perspective because he already knows what every team‚Äôs culture is like from playing for them
Ish Smith clone man
If Ish smith is still in this league then why not
"Rozier is bad any time he is asked to handle the ball and make plays for others. After the first month or so of 2019-20, he wasn't really asked to do that at all and has been an impactful player since. He's become a phenomenal shooter two consecutive years, it's not just a fluke anymore. Playing alongside Devonte' Graham and then LaMelo Ball and Hayward, he hasn't needed to handle much and has just focused on being open.   Losing Graham has me a bit worried about this though- if Ish Smith gets hurt or is just not that good, Rozier is going to have to play backup PG again which is where he becomes terribly inefficient."
Ish Smith?  And before anyone says it I know he is a point guard
the other GOAT journey man Ish Smith
He is Ish Smith
"Bouknight shouldn't be much of a downgrade from Monk, even as a rookie. He's bigger, more athletic, and a better defender. Honestly I feel like he could be just as good as Monk was last year straight away.  I feel like most Hornets fans overrate Graham a bit, no offense. He's a solid player, but not really good enough to be a starter on a playoff team. Ish Smith is actually a solid backup, he knows what his role is and won't be pushing for more playing time, which is good considering Melo should be playing big minutes.  I understand why Hornets fans were not big fans of losing Graham and Monk for very little, but overall the team has improved."
CHA - Ish Smith  DET - Ish Smith  GSW - Ish Smith  HOU - Ish Smith  ISH - Ish Smith  MEM - Ish Smith   MIL - Ish Smith  NOP - Ish Smith  OKC - Ish Smith  ORL - Ish Smith  PHI - Ish Smith  PHO - Ish Smith  WAS - Ish Smith
Hornets back up pg is ish smith and back up sg is rookie bouknight. They need depth and I‚Äôd be ok for a 1 year plus one deal type thing. At worst some contender will have an injury and will need him in a pinch. Will be a good flippable contract or let it ride out after the year.  Edit: just read we got oubre. Eh whatever.
"What makes his trades/FA moves uninspiring to you? I think he's been quite savvy.   I know we don't usually land the ""sexiest"" names, and we never will, but for us to even get Hayward (and him *wanting* to be here) is a huge positive for us, durability issues aside.   It's not like Mitch has overpaid for a Diop-contract, or Nic Batum. He's done a very solid job with our cap space, and he's gotten us legit trade chip assets.   Losing Monk and Devonte is tough, but Bouknight's potential + Oubre + NOs 1st + Ish Smith is an upgrade all around. And that's all we need right now, as opposed to pushing all in and capping ourselves out (like the Al Jefferson years).   We have flexibility down the roster now, so when Hayward gets hurt, we aren't relying on Cody Martin to fill in for him."
"For 26/2 that‚Äôs not bad, I am worried about locker room presence around our young guys and to be honest I don‚Äôt think I can stomach seeing such a god awful stretch of shooting as he had last season. We were either picking up him or Markannen so idk we‚Äôll see.   I really liked the Ish Smith pick up, always fun to watch and he knows why he‚Äôs there. We‚Äôve had a decent free agency this year. Not Chicago good but alright which is good for us."
"We turned Devonte graham into a first round pick, ish Smith, and oubre? Sign me the fuck up mitch."
"We‚Äôre under the cap, so we don‚Äôt get the MLE. We used the room exception on Ish Smith though."
imo it's worse than last year's team at full strength. Losing two ball handlers that can shoot and score and replacing them with Ish Smith is a pretty severe drop off unless Bouk is a stud right away.
"I imagine this is what it would look like. If Bouknight isn't ready for full time backup minutes, Oubre plays more of a swing role and McDaniels takes on more minutes at the 3.  Ball/Ish Smith   Rozier/Bouknight/Martin/Martin   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels   Bridges/Washington/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones/Carey/Richards"
"if Ish Smith was 6‚Äô6‚Äù basically. Super quick, clever finishing + height + speed = deadly drives but takes too many jump shots."
"&gt;So wizards fans, how's deni? How do you rate him?  It feels like he has no confidence to make a play.   We drafted him into a Scott Brooks offense led by Westbrook, Beal, and Ish Smith so you can imagine we didn't exactly put him in a place to succeed through trial and error either. He's a playmaking forward, and we never got a chance to see if he could.  Next year is his real rookie season now that Westbrook and Brooks are gone. But in the meantime, we brought in Kuzma, KCP, and Kispert also. So he will lose minutes and become a bust if he doesn't show growth."
He‚Äôll be our backup PF. Washington and Plumlee are both better at C than Lauri.   We just need to spend our cap space or we‚Äôre gonna lose it since we need to spend ~14 Million in order to use the MLE room exception to sign Ish Smith.
"Hornets have the cap space, and pretty much said ‚Äúnah - we‚Äôll just take Ish Smith thanks‚Äù"
I‚Äôm just saying ish Smith can get you 12 assists every night and 2013 kawhi can give your best player nightmares is that combined a good player or a 6th man like a Lou Williams
ngl I thought this was Ish Smith
"as for single 30 point games, Charlotte had Hayward, Rozier, Monk, Graham, Ball, Washington, and Bridges last season (7 total). Unfortunately we let 2 of them walk and replaced them with Ish Smith so that's not being replicated"
Ish Smith is a decent backup guard get outta here with that Ish slander
Most teams didn‚Äôt play the Wizards for 5 games! Our best scorers at times were Robin Lopez and Ish Smith off the bench
Ish Smith has been on 12 teams in like 12 years he is terrible lol.  He should be like the 3rd string 14th man.  And i'm high on the Hornets specifically because I think LaMelo is a real one. But they definitely need a legit bench and Schroder would be a tremendously positive impact on that.  But If he demands to start then just let him start and Bring Rozier or Hayward off the bench as long as everyone gets 30-35 minutes why not just appease Schroder ego to get him to sign to the team?
We already signed ish smith and you are higher on the hornets than some of us. Most teams ahead of us made moves while we have lost depth and replaced them with worse players. Season depends on lamelos jump and health.
"You idiots clearly lack reading comprehension, I didn‚Äôt say Kuzma=Ingram max him. I said Ingram  became a max player when he stopped playing with Lebron. And that Kuzma could redeem himself next year in a new setting.  Y‚Äôall literally act like a heliocentric offense has never stifled a players performance before. Kuzma clearly has the tools to be an nba player and now he‚Äôs going to an offense that managed to make Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Davis Bertrans, and Daniel Gafford look good.   Talk y‚Äôall shit bruh. The fact that I‚Äôm defending Kuzma against Laker fans says all you need to know about current Laker fandom. Y‚Äôall might be the most toxic fan base in the league right now."
"He's kinda like Ish Smith though (maybe not as quick), he shot 35% from 3, but hes a slasher and a passer."
He was one of our best defensive guys all season. He goes hard every play and I think Ish Smith led by example there
Already got plumblee to replace the Big Handsome. We need guard depth after letting go DG and Monk for Ish Smith and Bouknight though. I‚Äôm just not stoked on Oubre or The Dennis.
"Hornets signed Ish Smith as a backup, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt potentially sign another backup.   We lost a lot of shooting this off-season, and have ~14 Million."
"Yep someone awhile back said if Russ even during prime years had 30-40 FGA the Thunder lost that game and it‚Äôs because he absolutely does this.    Put differently would you prefer a Westbrook 15 footer in light coverage, A Robin Lopez hook shot for 7 feet or an Ish Smith drive into coverage?  I don‚Äôt love that Westbrook jumper but it‚Äôs the best out of a list of bad options.    Doesn‚Äôt mean all of the bad shots are situations like that because they aren‚Äôt he does take some bad shots it‚Äôs just exaggerated because he takes an awful lot of best of bad options shots.  Only place that really wasn‚Äôt true so far is Houston where he shot highest percentage in a long time and cut down on his threes a ton.  Not only that damn near all of his attempts were wide open.  He shot a god forsaken percentage on them but they weren‚Äôt bad shots."
Who would start? Ish Smith?   Mitch just destroyed our guard rotation so any benefit of that is gone.
Ish Smith
"I would love to see Ish Smith on a 13th team, just to say he did it."
Ish Smith to the Hornets.
He had a chance to tie Ish Smith and Tolliver for the number one journey man ever if he had sign for another team.
"And Ish Smith is loved everywhere, he‚Äôs gonna be a great presence"
"Oh boy, Ish Smith...I hate the Charlotte front office bro"
Ish smith having such a long nba career is legit impressive
Nor does Ish Smith feel like 2010
Ish Smith is an isthmus.
No no no no. Ish Smith has NOT been in the league for eleven years. NO.
Ish Smith has played for 11 teams in 11 years
Damn I wanted Ish Smith he balled out last year
Ish Smith is also a Point Guard so he checks that box off too

Hometown kid Ish Smith welcome back to Charlotte!
"Graham for a Pelicans FRP and Ish Smith is a reasonable decision. Especially since I think Graham really wanted to start.  Losing Monk is a bummer, but it‚Äôs obvious that our coaches didn‚Äôt believe in him. He‚Äôs in a better situation and we‚Äôll be just fine in the long run."
"Ish Smith: NBA journeyman, /r/nba legend"
[26:58 forever my favorite Ish Smith moment ](https://youtu.be/9D3SEPQa6D8)
Has Ish Smith just tied the all-time record for most franchises played for
"I saw Ish Smith live when he was on the Pistons, and he had the best handles I've ever seen in person. Dude has the ball on a string like crazy, he's always been an underrated player."
"Jeff Green and Ish Smith could have a entire ""Who he play for?"" segment between the two."
Ish Smith has overcome adversity to have a solid NBA career. One of my favorite players.
ish smith is gonna get 1 year minimum contracts for the rest of his career
ish smith is a point guard
Ish Smith
Ish Smith making it this long in the NBA is not what I expected as a Wake fan. I loved him but an undersized guard who shot below 50% from FT and had a 5/3 career TO ratio doesn‚Äôt scream 10 year NBA player to me
Ish Smith is the goat journeyman  Wish Jeff Green stayed in Brooklyn tho he was really nice with them
"I mean. Maybe but we did need a backup, guard. I would have preferred ish smith or Shabazz."

Ish Smith: Is a point guard
Ish Smith
*Ish Smith
"we still don't have a quality center rotation. Plumlee is ok, but a bottom 10 starter, and there's no guarantee any of Jones/Carey/Richards are good enough to rely on for rotation minutes. We will likely be giving PJ Washington center minutes out of necessity again. I'm hopeful for Jones in the future, but he's a raw prospect at the moment.    We are also doomed if LaMelo or Rozier misses significant time, as we lost the two good players that would relieve them, and replaced them with Ish Smith, who can't score much. Last year, Graham and Monk could be trusted to step in and pour in some points off the bench, there's no guarantee Bouknight is ready to step in and give us anywhere near that kind of production if Rozier misses games.  It was a weird offseason. Keeping Hayward, re-signing Terry, and acquiring some 30+ yo vets imply that we're trying to compete right now, but crippling the bench unit offense and being content with Plumlee as a starter without a reliable backup gives the opposite message. If we were to compete, we needed to reconstruct and reinforce the center position this offseason, we just stuck some duct tape on it instead."
"among our rotation players, Ish Smith. Dude is going to be thrown into a role too big for him. I just don't see how we replace the scoring we lost by letting Monk and Graham walk in FA, unless Bouknight is a legitimately terrific rookie.  On the whole roster? Wes Iwundu. Has always been garbage, I don't see why that would change now."
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
now do Ish Smith
"very true, although some aren‚Äôt even offered a chance to prove themselves in the first place, some not at all and some not as substantially as they deserve, which confuses me. Like for example w/ Justin Patton he definitely seemed like he belongs in my opinion but just never got a chance since he got injured. And then some guys in college ball out n have mad potential but don‚Äôt get a chance until later on or not at all. Think Christian Wood, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Ish Smith"
"Then either one of the two happens:  a) He won't be bought out because Toronto has no fucking reason to pay him 19M in order for him NOT to take a quality 10-15mpg role for them;  b) Somehow he gets bought out and go to the Nets because if he's playing for vet min, he's going for a ring instead of the Luka and Friends 2nd round exit.  Either way, we are stuck with running Luka to the ground AGAIN because God forbid we trade end of the bench guys for the highest need in the roster. ""OH THEY HAVE THE EVER ELUSIVE FUCKING POTENTIAL. THEY CAN BE AS GOOD AS A GUY PLAYING POINT IN A FINALS 2 YEARS AGO, EVEN!  Fuck this shit. Lou Williams is making 5M. ISH SMITH IS MAKING 4.5 BUT DRAGIC WILL MAKE 2.7M HERE BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE ARE THE LAKERS NOW.  We will fuck things up because we have a glaring, gigantic need, and an obvious solution, but we will fuck it up because ""Moses tho, 20 rbs bro"".  This franchise is fucking my day and we are still 1 month away of preseason."
Ish Smith
yea I mean we preferred playing Raul Neto and Ish Smith at SF over him in the playoffs ...
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
smh the disrespect to Ish Smith
"Problem is that Saric is a perfect salary match along with Smith for Thad. Otherwise, the Suns would be absorbing $10M-ish, which they could not do.   Essentially, the Spurs would have to hold out for a first to absorb Saric's salary - basically paying $18M for a FRP....I don't know if that's a good value anyway, considering it will likely be way down in the 20's. They would REALLY have to believe in Smith to make this deal. And after all of that, they'd still have to cut (probably) Eubanks (along with Aminu and Hutchinson) to get down to 15.   They are already going to be eating $15M from those 2. It starts to get ugly the more you think about it. At least Aminu and Hutch come off the books after this season but adding Saric and his 2 years would be a very risky move. They also have Zach Collins who is holding down a roster spot to rehab all season as well.   All of this is pointing to the Spurs maybe looking at making a bigger deal but not sure for who?"
Ish Smith is a point guard
The Process lives until the day I forget that game where the Sixers almost came back from double digits to beat the soon to be 73 win Warriors led by Ish Smith and Isiah Canaan. Which is never. I'll never forget that game.
Speedy Claxton‚Ä¶ or his modern equivalent Ish Smith
"Basically everyone on the Hornets is a wildcard. I think we know what Rozier and Plumlee are going to give us, but essentially everyone else has a fairly wide range of outcomes.   - Does Hayward play 70 or 35 games?   - Does LaMelo blow up into an all-star, stagnate as a quality starter, or does he have a sophomore slump?   - Does Miles Bridges pick up where he left off last season and continue giving us 17-20 points on ridiculous efficiency, or does he go back to underwhelming us when Hayward is healthy?   - Is Ish Smith good enough to be a quality 20+ min PG or is our bench going to be a disaster with no quality guards?   - Can Oubre be the aggressive 3&amp;D wing we've been missing for years or is he an underachiever like he was in GS?   - Are rookies Bouknight and Jones immediate contributors off the bench, or raw prospects that will hurt us in their minutes on the floor?   - Can PJ Washington make the jump from decent utility guy to legitimate starter, or is he just going to stay ""just a guy""?  --  It's really hard to pick one. I'm going to say Miles Bridges. imo, if you don't have an all-star on the team and you're trying to compete, you need 4-5 guys that can consistently give you 15-20 a night. Hayward, Terry, and LaMelo can when healthy, Miles becoming that 4th guy would be absolutely huge for us."
"&gt;The point isn‚Äôt a comparison of KAT/DLo/Ant to Harden/KD/Kyrie as players  then this was a useless post.. i can say ""ish smith has a better 3pt% than curry"" then go in the thread saying ""but im not saying he's a better shooter than curry ! he just has a better percentage""  this is just bait 100%.. why would i bring up a stat that makes someone look like the better option when it's clear they are not.."
Ish smith is legit awesome to watch
"The ""Trust the Process"" years. That backcourt of MCW and Ish Smith was lethal the year they won 10 games"
"No my friend, you don't get to get rid of Ish Smith and hope for miracles. He was your miracle."
"Trae, Ish Smith, Jeff Teague"
Ish Smith  Dinwiddie  (Prime) John Wall
"So people who say this: do you think he was a bad defender who became good and then became bad again? Could it be that maybe he is exhausted from doing everything for his teams offensively, had a point guard rotation one year of Ish Smith/Isaiah Thomas, and had the worst coach in the league?"
"At this point, I wonder why Borrego starts LaMelo over Ish Smith. Seems to like Ish Smith in those big moments more than Melo lol"
"Ish Smith, that reversed layup was nasty."
ish smith really is a point guard!
"I count 9 in that time, bringing the total for career to 11.  Ish Smith remains king of the journeymen. Now in his 12th season, and on his 12th team.   Hypothetical and unlikely, but if he can maintain this insane pace of his, and play as long as Vince - he'd finish his career having played for 22 teams. üêê"
"My b, there was an old joke post trying to convince Dwight Howard to come to the Bucks in 2012ish?  And they ran down the roster, when they got to Ish Smith they just said ‚ÄúIsh Smith‚Ä¶ is a point guard‚Äù lmao"
"Did you know, Ish Smith is a point guard?"
Ish F‚Äôing Smith. It can be that hard to develop a 3 point range and not over dribble can it?
"Good to know you agree with me that Ish Smith and Lamelo are interchangeable players then.  As for team comparisons, in the East you don‚Äôt even need a winning record and they still can‚Äôt make the playoffs. At least we can cry together knowing both are teams are shit then!"
Ish Smith closes games instead of your star PG
Ish Smith &gt; any point guard that ever existed
"I can't find the stats, but it always feels like Ish Smith goes off against us."
Where the hell is Lamely? No one wants to see Ish Smith ffs
wht the fuck is ish smith running the offense and not hayward? what a putrid nba player jesus christ
Ish Smith with the ridiculous midrange game! The first one was legit insane. He was being swarmed and he was still able to nail the shot.
I can never decide how good Ish Smith actually is. One of those guys who can look like the best player in the damn league on his night
Ish Smith is gonna be annoying for other teams
Ish Smith robbed
Ish smith and Cody Martin ran the 4th quarter
Ish smith: is a pointguard
It‚Äôd be worse if the Nets won a game because of Ish Smith and Cody Martin.
* ISH SMITH: **IS A POINT GUARD**
Led by Charlotte‚Äôs finest: Ish Smith and Cody Martin
"we had a sizeable lead in the 4th that we never gave up, and melo told our coach to keep ish smith in the game, basically he just didn't need to play much"
"What was that team:  Ish Smith,  James Johnson,  Al-Farouq Aminu,  Jeff Teague.  None of them have been stunners but all have had 10+ year basketball careers."
ISH SMITH - IS A POINT GUARD
"I remember wishing the Sixers kept Ish Smith coz he and McConnell would've been a heck of a role player PG tandem next to Embiid and the big forwards (Simmons, Covington, Saric)"
I typed Ish Smith into the google to learn more about his game and it said he has network connectivity issues.
Ish Smith single handedly gave life to one of those Process squads. It was night and day when joined the team and brought us to be a legitimate NBA team for a few months (and that's really saying something for what we were before).
Ish Smith is prime example of how you can leverage an elite nba skill into a long nba career. His quickness with the ball keeps him effective enough.
I've been an Ish Smith believer for years. Dude is pure hustle.
nah bruh you just not seeing the vision  lamelo=KD Miles bridges=Westbrook  Cody Martin/Ish Smith= Harden
LaMelo did tell the coach to ride out Ish Smith in the fourth.
I wish Ish Smith would ride me out
Ish Smith is good.
"Fuck yeah I've always loved Ish Smith from his process days on the Sixers to all the other teams he's been on, very underrated and hopefully he just found the right situation for him to thrive"
"Ish smith has always been a nets killer, he‚Äôs been haunting me for years now lol"
Everybody gangsta until Ish Smith starts hitting jumpers.  Had that meme saved in my camera roll since December 2019 when he went off against Denver
ISH SMITH IS A POINT GUARD
Ish Smith: Is a point guard
It‚Äôs not good you don‚Äôt know Ish Smith lol dude is a baller
How have you never heard of Ish Smith
"Crazy to me how Ish Smith has turned out. Dude is undersized and could barely get any minutes outside of garbage time in his few years in the league, but he managed to turn himself into a legit backup point guard. He's also been on a crazy amount of teams, 12 franchises in 12 seasons."
hes not even better than ish smith ffs
That is my back up point guard and his name is Ish Smith and I love him.
Feels like Ish Smith been on every single team in his career
how the fuck do you not know who Ish Smith is? A point guard???
Ish Smith and Cody Martin
"I remember last year some hot take youtuber said something like ""what if Ben Simmons just drove to the basket more like Ish Smith - he'd be a much better player"" without realizing that Ish Smith has always been one of the better slashers in the NBA and Ben has never been even close to as good as Ish Smith at converting drives into points. And that's not a huge knock at Ben, Ish Smith is just completely underrated."
Ish Smith torched the Nuggets last season. The dude is a killer
"Glad I'm seeing Dune tomorrow night, because Ish Smith always kills us."
Ish Smith is a fantastic hustle guy
Did not see Ish Smith going super saiyan in the 4th quarter coming
Ish Smith is a point guard
"MIP alert. He bullied the entire Nets organization. Nets looked weak out there against the Hornets, literally. Like they didn't have big enough bodies. CHA looked muscular as fuck, led by this man who was getting everything he wanted with his strength. At one point they had a lineup of Plumlee, Bridges, Hayward, Martin and Ish Smith and it was like 4 football players against the Net's lineup."
Ish smith for lonzo ball and Zach Levine
"""Trade me to charlotte where I can have some real teammates like ish smith and cody martin"""
Ish Smith obviously.
"I honestly think we can go 82-0. I mean, would you look at this team? Let's start with the backcourt. You've got LaMelo ""Lamelon Baller"" Ball staring down Terry ""Scarence Terrence"" Rozier, slicing and dicing NBA defenses. Ish ""Prodigal Son of Charlotte"" Smith, locked in and ready to make defenders cry with his veteran smarts. James ""Bonknight"" Bouknight. Gordon ""Hair Jordan"" Hayward. When was the last time you saw a backcourt like that? And then the frontcourt. My god, it makes me weep tears of pure joy to read off these names. Miles ""Sky Miles"" Bridges. PJ ""The Capitol"" Washington. Mason ""Plumdog Millionaire"" Plumlee. Vernon ""Mount Vernon"" Carey.  And then the bench. Every time I look at this list I have to change my pants. I'm running out of pants. I'm going broke. Cody ""Which Martin is that?"" Martin. Kelly ""T$unami Papi"" Oubre. Thor. McDaniels. Jones. I'm running out of nicknames. Actually I had to go change my pants again. Lakers? They can go to the nursing home. The Hawks can fly off to the glue factory. Orlando has a team? This team doesn't follow the rules. It makes the rules. And they exercise the rule of law over the Eastern Conference. Read my lips, 82-0."
The Ish Smith game
Ish Smith‚Ä¶ that man scares me
Ish smith
Ish Smith is the greatest player ever
Ish Smith is a great backup point guard and a great story   He grinded hard to even get minutes for years and now he‚Äôs one of the better and consistent backup point guards in the league
only for Ish Smith to put it away :P
"He didn‚Äôt need to. Ish Smith and Cody Martin were playing darn well, and we have a back to back tomorrow"
"Lamelo playing ZERO MINUTES in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well Ish Smith and Cody Martin played tonight.  That sequence Cody Martin had where he generated 2 charges and hit all his shots pretty much ended the game too.  Miles Bridges scoring 32 after dropping 30 last game, sheesh we got a good one."
Because ish smith was absolutely torching the nets lol
Ish Smith
i can.  ish smith is a fucking killer whenever i watch him i stg

the nets really just lost a game because of ish smith and cody martin
Washed  Ish Smith betta
But I heard Ish Smith IS A POINT GUARD.
He wasn't signed to be a back up though. I feel like he would happily accept a back up role for us because he loves charlotte and he'd be an improvement over Ish Smith
"I don't have much faith in KPJ personally, tho I think you're right it's smart to be putting effort into developing him over starting Wall. If wall is really refusing to come off the bench you're probably right, but i do think he'd be an asset as an Ish Smith type bench PG, and I think running lineups of Wall at the 1  and Porter at the 2 like last year might be good for his developmenr"
Ish Smith beat the Nets 1v5. You guys will be fine.
it's funny cuz some of our fan base is clamoring to get him since he'd be cheap to soak up guard minutes while Sexton is out. I would prefer the rolling stone himself Ish Smith
ish smith
Anthony Bennett Payton Prichard Liangelo Ball Tacko Fall Brian Scalabrine Ben Simmons Andrew Wiggins Ish Smith Isaiah Thomas Jeremy Lin Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  Bol Bol
Ish smith should be starting
"Here are some of the Sixers process era players that weren't considered NBA players (by a long shot, in some cases) at the time..  * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Jerami Grant * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * Ish Smith  All of these guys went from being essentially G-Leaguers to contributing players.  Brett Brown isn't the guy that's going to lead you to a championship, but he's one of the best at getting lower tier players to improve and play hard.  I'd argue that due to his unique experience coaching one of the worst teams of all time, he's one of the most qualified of this particular situation."
"idk I feel like it's pretty hard to judge teams offensively without at least a competent point guard  there was a stretch with the nets when they were in draft purgatory under Sean Marks/Kenny Atkinson when Lin was injured and they had pretty much 0 offensive playmakers. not too say Kenny was an offensive mastermind in brooklyn or the onus of a good offense is entirely on the coach, but just like with the pre-Ish Smith process sixers, the gap between 0 playmakers and 1 playmaker is miles bigger than the gap from 1 playmaker to several"
Modern day Ish Smith
what if guys like Ish Smith or Westbrook knew how to skate or played soccer?
"I think Saben Lee can have an Ish Smith kind of career as a solid back up, with clear limitations but who sticks around."
Ish Smith too lmao
"Gordon Hayward, Mason Plumlee and Ish Smith make up 30 of our 54 years of experience by themselves, lol"
Ish Smith doesn‚Äôt play for us anymore. That was Beef Stew
&gt;Ish Smith: Is a point guard
"There‚Äôs the end to end speed and there‚Äôs explosive first step of quick burst of speed I‚Äôm not gonna dive deep into who has what too much but   PG: it used to be Rose, Westbrook and Wall. Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it‚Äôs still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven‚Äôt seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he‚Äôs not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."
Not that it means a whole lot but Ish Smith might be the fastest/quickest player in the league.
"Ish Smith gets the rebound and drives up court, outruns his defender, sauces the Center for a quick turnaround midrange jumper!   ....and airball."
Ish Smith
Ish Smith and all 30 franchises
"Real talk I don't think there were a lot of secondary ball-handler options that the Lakers could've pursued outside of vet min guys like Ish Smith.  I still think that a Buddy Hield trade was the way to go, but other than that if they wanted another point guard they would've had to flip KCP for Ricky Rubio or something along those lines."
Trade Westbrook for Ish Smith
"I think this is the ideal lineup:   PG: Jrue Holiday   SG: Jimmy Butler   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Jerami Grant    C: Dwight Howard   That team is filthy defensively, then you have a bench of Horford, Wood, Holmes, McConnell, Fultz, Ish Smith, and George Hill. If we're ranking off of talent alone, Hill/Horford/Wood arguably have higher peaks than Jerami Grant, but Grant is needed to fix that very tenuous spacing, plus he's a more versatile defender who fits alongside Dwight."
Imagine being Ish Smith in this situation.
I wonder what Ish Smith is thinking while this went down
"Russ was doing too much, but let's go over what he was working with outside of Beal:  Bryant: played 10 games  Rui: credited Russ with improving, literally your third best player as a second year player that isn't playing at all this year  Bertans: injured and played awful, was meant to be one of your key pieces  Deni Avdija: was one of your better players even though he didn't get much playing time. This is sad, he was a rookie that mostly brought defensive help.  Ish Smith: Ish is a solid backup PG, isn't meant to be more.  Alex Len: god awful  Robin Lopez: He's washed at this stage  Garrison Matthews: Started 24 games, played in 64, and is now in the G-league.   Gafford came in late into the year and they were winning.   Covid and injuries were not the cherry on top, your team was garbage.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2021.html  You can go through your own team and tell me how I'm wrong.  Outside of Beal you guys basically have none of your core players from last year and the majority of your core players from last year sucked. You replaced Russ with quality depth, adding in 3 new players, Gafford became a starter, you signed Dinwiddie, and Bertans isn't expected to be one of your best players anymore opposed to a damn 10th man even though he's being paid 17 million.  Russ and beal both played hero ball as your team was trash, quite literally.  Lakers this year, without Lebron, are again not really the best team because we went in on 3 guys and old players and the inconsistency to start the season is massive. Russ isn't a superstar anymore, but the problems go far deeper than him."
I loved him on the Pistons!! One of my favorite PGs along with Ish Smith.
"Want something even more interesting?  How about a line-up which includes Westbrook , Ish Smith , Neto and 6'4"" Jerome Robinson... Yes Brooks really played this lineup last year"
"They need to figure out how they can best contribute in an NBA game and work on it - Naji is theoretically a good defender but too often his effort on that end is lackluster and he'll float sometimes. He needs to be a Gary Payton Jr. type defender to make it in the NBA. And Kira could be an Ish Smith type that leverages his speed as a backup PG, but he's got to improve his decision making and figure out at least one consistent way to score in the paint when he drives."
"I mean we ran lineups with Ish Smith, Westbrook, Neto, and Garrison Matthews too ...   Scott Brooks is actually a moron ...   Lucked in KD, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka ...  and then lucked into Wall, Beal, Porter (before Wall/Porter injuries) .."
Ish Smith
"No Ish Smith slander, he was the saving grace of that season. The Sixers were 1-30 before they signed him, then they went and won the very first game he played for them."
Since LaMelo called out the coach after the other game the teams been playing with better intensity. Not one Ish Smith sighting in the last 3 games either.
I won't allow Ish Smith slander.
Bonga + Ish Smith + bag of chips for Grant
"You left out the part where he has below average vision on offense. If he was just bad on defense, that would be fine. We loved Ish Smith. But Joseph sucks on offense too."
We were better off with Delon Wright and Langston Galloway the last few seasons. Or even Ish Smith.  Like they're not good but they make teammates better. CoJo just plays for himself.
"Cade, Kira Lewis, and Ish Smith all have worse TS% this season"
"He hasn't gotten any non garbage time minutes yet. I feel like at first, we were winning, so JB was like, we're not going to mess with this formula. Now we're losing and he's like, we're not experimenting with a rookie rn.   I think he just wants Bouk to get an opportunity to play more than 5 minutes in a blowout to ease him into it. I want him to play. We aren't deep on guards like last year. It's Melo and Rozier, cody martin off the bench (sort of positionless), and Ish Smith, but even he's barely been in the rotation recently."
Hahahah give us the picks that you got for anythony Davis and we give you mason and ish smith
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedri≈Ü≈° | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varej√£o | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
I mean Ish Smith played 4 minutes
"No shade to LaMelo stans, but sometimes it cracks me up thinking of the them tuning into Hornets games and getting treated to The Ish Smith Show instead"
Ish Smith haunts my dreams.
"Nah, don‚Äôt lump some of us in with those delusional people. I‚Äôve been saying it‚Äôs GG the second I saw the first game. This team isn‚Äôt comparable to our 2020 run team. That one had its issues but everyone was on the same page and the attention to detail was there. We traded defense for offense but we don‚Äôt even have a better offense than we did a year ago but we now have a substantially worse defense. Westbrook has got to be biggest talent/athleticism to bbq IQ mismatch I‚Äôve ever seen. The only thing he does correctly is throw lobs, that‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs a terrible defender, puts no effort, makes lazy passes trying to be flashy, gets lost on screens, can‚Äôt shoot, doesn‚Äôt finish well around the rim, gets caught in the air with no where to go, runs a million miles an hour into the most obvious set screens, can‚Äôt dribble in tight spaces, has no post game or footwork and yet still doesn‚Äôt know his place. He ran into Carmelo like 3 times yesterday because he‚Äôs too lazy to move effectively. I would rather have ish smith. That‚Äôs not a joke."
"The Wizards won an additional 9 games in the 2021 season compared to 2020. That year they started IT for 37 games, a guy who quite frankly is not an nba player at this stage of his career. The others were a combination of Ish Smith and Isaac Bonga if i recall correctly, the only legitimately good player here is Ish Smith but even he is more of a back up PG  The Wizards upgraded from the likes of Isaiah Thomas to Russell Westbrook and only won an additional 9 regular season games. I don‚Äôt get why this is lauded as all that big of an accomplishment"
"he's looked passive at times this season, and that may well be attributed to the fact that he had COVID pretty close to training camp (during training camp? can't remember), and had symptoms, so he may be fighting a little bit of fatigue at times.   He can definitely do more than he is right now. He will kind of have to, because all of our offense is coming from those four, Oubre, PJ Washington, and sometimes Ish Smith. Any offense provided by anybody else is a nice bonus."
Kelenna Azubuike commented last game on his lateral quickness. He was able to keep up with Ish Smith while Ish was running forward and GPII was moving sideways. He's a good one.
He made ish smith look like he doesn‚Äôt belong in the league. I know that‚Äôs not hard but he didn‚Äôt even look a pg
kept up with a straight sprint Ish Smith while lateral sliding and stripped it
"Ish ""Fastest NBA player"" smith  got clamped by him too"
"This roster has some of the most confusing roster construction of perhaps any team in the league and it's really starting to cost us games. We decided to completely forgo the offseason by trading for Mason Plumlee and the results have been disastrous. Of course we are trying to pivot to almost full-time small ball but our highest paid players in Hayward and Rozier are both basically the opposite of the type of player you want next to Lamelo - ball stoppers, can't drive past anybody, not particularly good passers. Basically the only thing holding this team together is Miles being consistently nuclear to start the season.  I would go into the bench but let me just say Oubre and Ish Smith are not the type of players who should be the primary options against the staggered stars that basically every other team puts out against our 5 bench lineup. We should've just kept Monk because Kelly is just fucking terrible except the occasional game where he drops 5 threes"
Ish Smith just bounces from team to team lol. Dude is the Edwin Jackson of basketball
"Have fun with the formatting:  LAMELO BALL HAS¬†has already seen the future.  Two seconds earlier, he watched¬†[Cavaliers](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers)¬†center¬†[Jarrett Allen](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066328/jarrett-allen)¬†vault over¬†[Mason Plumlee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2488653/mason-plumlee)¬†to tomahawk a ferocious slam to give the Cavaliers a nine-point lead three minutes into the second quarter. He saw the Cleveland reserves on the bench rise in exaltation, scream hysterically, flicking their white towels. He heard the Quicken Loans Arena crowd roar its approval.  ADVERTISEMENT  Still, optimism flows from the eyes of Ball. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees it:¬†[Miles Bridges](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066383/miles-bridges)¬†sprinting down the middle of the floor.  Before the Cavs' reserves can even sit down, Ball¬†[hurls the ball 80 feet down the court](https://youtu.be/a1Fjk_s52Sc?t=171)¬†over all five Cavaliers and directly into the hands of Bridges. It's a Sunday afternoon pass on a Friday night, one that's thrown in what seems like a different time and space.  Less than four seconds¬†after Allen picks himself up off the floor following his throwdown, Bridges drops the ball through the opposite hoop with a reverse dunk.  ""He really is a basketball savant,"" says¬†[Charlotte Hornets](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets)' teammate and 12-year veteran point guard¬†[Ish Smith](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4305/ish-smith). ""You watch him make these calculated-risk passes, and I'm like, 'How did he even think about throwing it like that?'""  Sheer¬†chutzpah.  A 20-year-old with nothing more than an abbreviated NBA season on his r√©sum√© has the audacity to stunt the opponent's momentum with a pass that couldn't possibly have a success rate leaguewide of greater than 10%. Tracking platforms with probability scores -- eat your heart out. For the second consecutive game to start the season, the Hornets are behind early to a middling opponent. And for the second consecutive game, Ball is poised to drag the Hornets by the scruff of their necks back into the contest.

If the NBA wisely decides to clamp down on the plague of ""take fouls"" that halt fast breaks, it could just call it the LaMelo Ball Rule.  Asked how many possessions he'd like to play in transition in a 100-possession game, Ball responds, ""A hundred.""  ""It's fun being out there on the floor with him because he's not afraid,"" says Hornets forward¬†[Gordon Hayward](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward). ""If you cut and get open, he'll throw it to you. He's not afraid of that turnover. A lot of players hold back on those kinds of plays -- a baseball throw, an underhanded pass, threading the needle. He doesn't.""  Ball isn't defensive about anything -- it's simply not in his nature. But he's well aware of the question, one posed internally by a Hornets front office that nabbed him No. 3 overall, about his capacity to organize the brand of pick-and-roll offense that commands today's half-court game, especially in high-stakes situations.  ""I feel like you get that from just hooping,"" he says. ""You learn when to pick your spots -- knowing when to stay in the play, knowing when to break the play. You just play basketball. I feel confident coming off any ball screen. Any action like that? I'm solid.""  For the Hornets, Ball represents their best chance ever to have as the face of their franchise a high wattage talent who can truly change the fortunes of the organization -- a player who can maximize the potential of his teammates and draw national attention to what remains among the NBA's most anonymous franchises, and one of its most futile.  But this is the NBA's highest of high-wire acts. Everything that could go right with its prized new franchise cornerstone; Charlotte could get a full, healthy season from Hayward -- their multipurpose star free agent who came in with Ball during the past offseason; young contributors like Bridges and¬†[P.J. Washington](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278078/pj-washington)¬†could make jumps and add to production provided by¬†[Terry Rozier](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3074752/terry-rozier), who has been a revelation since arriving from¬†[Boston](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics)¬†a year before Hayward. Ish Smith could pace a fun second unit, and coach James Borrego could fully Spurs-ify the operation.  And yet, still, the experiment might fail.  ÔøºThrough the Hornets' first eight games, the 20-year-old Ball is averaging 20.1 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game -- and shooting a ridiculous 44% from 3.¬†Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports  THERE'S A CERTAIN¬†flavor of anticipation that imbues an organization a season or two into a rebuild if its armed with a player of Ball's caliber -- provided he's the real thing.  Ball's potential is the single most important variable in determining the Hornets' ceiling. Become an All-NBA point guard, and Charlotte should be a regular tour stop on the playoff circuit for years. But if he's merely very good, it will be difficult to break out of a suddenly crowded East, where in addition to the current powerhouses planted atop the standings, teams like¬†[Atlanta](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks),¬†[Detroit](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/det/detroit-pistons)¬†and¬†[Orlando](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic)¬†all share the same belief that a young, dynamic high-lottery guard can elevate them to relevance.  What Ball has shown the Hornets from his first hours as a Hornet has inspired them. Borrego recalls the first night after the draft last November when Ball arrived in Charlotte. The team's brass took him and a group that included his trainer and agent to Morton's The Steakhouse. Ball pounded his steak, then looked up at the table and said, ""Let's get to a gym.""  ""It's almost 11 [p.m.], he's just hammered his steak and he wanted to get his work in,"" Borrego says. ""By the time he and his team get to the facility, it's almost midnight. The next day, we looked at the cameras from the gym -- he was there until about 2 [a.m.] He hasn't been in town for a day, and that's where his focus was. His care factor about his craft is off the charts.""  From the moment he slides their team cap onto his smiling head on draft night, that team has about seven years to persuade him to stay -- and every team faces a different degree of difficulty in making the sale, because some elite young stars are looking for any reason to stay, while others are looking for any reason to leave.

Some NBA point guards might extend a middle schooler their mercy, especially if the kid is the boss' son. But Ball doesn't temper his competitiveness. As he sizes up his teenage combatant, Ball delivers the trash with a smile.  A crossover to the hole elicits a shimmy from Ball, one returned when his teenage competitor drains a shot. Throughout the late afternoon, the shimmy fest escalates to levels of benevolent absurdity.

But Ball is a budding NBA superstar, one whose fame predates his arrival into the league. Drafted by a small market 2,000 miles away from hi"
Hum diddly Dee - anyone to make a dunk lol   The liver mush boys -ish smith and Cody Martin
Wall was the fastest dude in the league at least  plus ish smith was around
I can't wait to never see Cory Joseph again. I wish we still had Ish Smith or something instead.
Ish smith would be the perfect guy to ask
"Agreed, and I might also put Ish Smith over Coby White depending on fit/experience needed."
No ish smith abused our bench when Cole was out of the game. The only time Charlotte out played orlando Cole and lamelo were both on the bench.
Thanks to ish smith lol. Lamelo only played 24 minutes and was -7. Ish smith played 24 and was +16. Cole Anthony played 35 and was +10.
"Trait/role:   solid screener - Marcin Gortat  backup PG - Ish Smith, Patty Mills, Nate Robinson  passing big - Nene, Joakim Noah"
Just cause hes not getting minutes does not mean hes not a good fit. No way I would never take a journeyman like ish smith in this protection
"Being the PG doesn't mean shit lol. Do you think Beal got less touches or TOP than Ish Smith in 2020? Do you think Beal getting an outsized number of touches? He's an undersized SG. He's dwarfed his PG in terms of touches and TOP.  The reality is, the best offensive player on your team is the best option.

Dame came into the league after longer in college. He came in with a developed game and played on a better team.

Sexton was averaging 25 ppg until the last game of the season when he got pulled after 20 minutes. It wasn't until Dame's 6 season that he surpassed Sexton's efficiency.

I'm just saying thinking he pans out as a 6 man is absurd. He's also a better defender than any of those guys were in their 3rd year. He might be 6'2 but he's got a 6'6 wingspan and he's got 10x the motor of any of those guys on defense."
Tbh it changes every night lol. Sure against Brooklyn it was ish smith
"&gt;Oh that‚Äôs the reason the coaching is better? Is that why the Wizards fans were begging for Brooks to be fired before Russ even showed up? I‚Äôm sure because of Westbrook‚Äôs ‚Äúlow IQ‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh volume,‚Äù Brooks was running three guard lineups with Ish Smith and Neto ‚Ä¶ right. But you watch though for sure.  This does nothing to argue in favour of Westbrook. He‚Äôs an inefficient player and the coach wasn‚Äôt good. Both of these things are true.  &gt;So the Wizards had a ORTG of 110 last year. Their offensive rating currently is ‚Ä¶ 106. Hmm. So that implies their offense was somehow better last year (or at least similar when you look at current rankings) than this year.  Their ORTG is so low because Beal has had a putrid start to the season. He‚Äôs averaging just 24 ppg on 45.3 TS% to start the season. He‚Äôs obviously not going to stay this bad for the whole year. He‚Äôs just shaking the rust off.  &gt;Currently their defensive rating is 102 (10th since that rating probably isn‚Äôt sustainable in general) compared to 112 (20th). You don‚Äôt actually think a guard defender has the ability to change a defense that much? 10+ ratings? Right‚Ä¶?  It‚Äôs gonna have that large of an impact?  You‚Äôre being disingenuous by asking ‚Äúdo you think a guard defender can have this much impact‚Äù.  You replaced one garbage tier guard defender (Westbrook) with an elite guard/*wing* defender (KCP) and another high level forward defender (Kuzma). Yes, I absolutely do believe that‚Äôs why the defence has improved.  &gt;And ahh, 6 games without Rui and Thomas Bryant versus the entirety of the Wizards teams literally not being able to practice for weeks because of COVID.   6 games is all we have to base conclusions off.  &gt;Or Westbrook himself getting injured,   Westbrook played the vast majority of the season. 65/72 games, literally 90% of the season.   &gt;Beal being in and out  Beal played 83% of the season.  &gt;them not having GAFFORD until the SECOND HALF of the season when they actually were good. Deni and Bertans being out a bunch. But, you watch the Wizards, so you should know that‚Äôs a false equivalency‚Ä¶ right?  You‚Äôre getting worked up over nothing. A team‚Äôs improvement can stem from multiple sources. Yes, I‚Äôm sure being slightly healthier is impacting the Wizard‚Äôs current success. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Westbrook is the *main* reason holding the Wizards back. There‚Äôs a reason literally every team he goes to gets worse.  &gt;You don‚Äôt watch the Washington Wizards and you didn‚Äôt last year.   Ahh there it is.  &gt;Your entire post was a commentary about Westbrook, nothing you mentioned had to do with the coaching schemes or roleplayers or circumstances of the Wizards last year.   Objectively untrue. I very clearly mentioned KCP and Kuzma being large defensive upgrades over Westbrook. Stop being disingenuous.   You‚Äôre getting defensive over nothing. Congratulations on having a decent coach. It really is something to be happy about. But saying Westbrook is bad doesn‚Äôt diminish the coaching upgrade. Like I said, both things can be true.  &gt;Why? Because you don‚Äôt have the context to do so. Stop trying to flex fake knowledge about a team you clearly know very little about and stick with the same ‚Äúmeh meh Westbrook bad‚Äù memes instead ü§°  Westbrook is bad, and anybody who understands basketball at even a rudimentary level knows this. You‚Äôre using emotions to argue against objective facts."
"Oh that‚Äôs the reason the coaching is better? Is that why the Wizards fans were begging for Brooks to be fired before Russ even showed up? I‚Äôm sure because of Westbrook‚Äôs ‚Äúlow IQ‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh volume,‚Äù Brooks was running three guard lineups with Ish Smith and Neto ‚Ä¶ right. But you watch though for sure.   Wait let‚Äôs talk about defense. Let‚Äôs use your logic.   So the Wizards had a ORTG of 110 last year. Their offensive rating currently is ‚Ä¶ 106. Hmm. So that implies their offense was somehow better last year (or at least similar when you look at current rankings) than this year.   Currently their defensive rating is 102 (10th since that rating probably isn‚Äôt sustainable in general) compared to 112 (20th). You don‚Äôt actually think a guard defender has the ability to change a defense that much? 10+ ratings? Right‚Ä¶?  It‚Äôs gonna have that large of an impact?   You don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with the trash coaching and 3 guard lineups I just mentioned that had Wizards fans on their knees?  **And ahh, 6 games without Rui and Thomas Bryant versus the entirety of the Wizards teams literally not being able to practice for weeks because of COVID. Or Westbrook himself getting injured, Beal being in and out, them not having GAFFORD until the SECOND HALF of the season when they actually were good. Deni and Bertans being out a bunch. But, you watch the Wizards, so you should know that‚Äôs a false equivalency‚Ä¶ right?**   You don‚Äôt watch the Washington Wizards and you didn‚Äôt last year. Your entire post was a commentary about Westbrook, nothing you mentioned had to do with the coaching schemes or roleplayers or circumstances of the Wizards last year. Why? Because you don‚Äôt have the context to do so. Stop trying to flex fake knowledge about a team you clearly know very little about and stick with the same ‚Äúmeh meh Westbrook bad‚Äù memes instead ü§°"
"Hmmm.... Going for the Pistons still obviously.   Favorite thing? [Ish Smith: Is a Point Guard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hpxcr/dwight_you_can_still_change_your_mind/). Also it isn't as serious as other sports subs generally. If I could change one thing, theoretically, the circlejerks on certain things being less prevalent would be nice.   Where would I rank the Pistons? Last in the rankings but first in my heart.   /r/nba specifically? Maybe 3 days a week. /r/nba feeds on my frontpage, daily.   Probably about 60 games in a full season average. So 3 out of every 4 games we play. How many other games? 3-6 a week.   Not gonna lie, I'm voting for myself and if not selected I'll go with whoever you guys choose.   Bonus points - an early preview post.   What happens when the team with the first overall draft pick plays without said first overall draft pick? O-fer. The only questions are ""How many games can we lose before our first win?"" and ""When does Cade make his debut""? Our D has actually looked competent at times in three of our four games, but we can't score efficiently which... isn't ideal."
don‚Äôt ever disrespect ish smith again üò° garrison matthews was surprisingly solid too
"Westbrook was playing injured early season, Lavine missed 2 more games than Beal, Thomas Bryant tore his acl 23 games in, Ish Smith missed 2 month, they only had Gafford for 23 games, Bertans missed 15 games. But, sure, continue telling me how everything went perfect for the Wizards."
Ish Smith
All I know is ish smith is gonna get the bag after his contract
"I have no idea. In a close playoff game, I don‚Äôt want Russ anywhere near the ball. But it‚Äôs not all his fault. Melo is washed in my opinion, plays no defense, and never met a jump shot he didn‚Äôt like.   I wish the lakers had kept their defensive identity. They could have found some minimum player ball handlers like an ish smith type of player"
"yeah we‚Äôre currently still missing Rui and Thomas Bryant. Pretty crazy how much depth we have this year, it was out of nowhere.   last year our bench was ish smith, garrison matthews, troy brown jr, bertans, and robin lopez"
"Ish Smith, fight me."
its our 10th straight year without a normal nba point guard or wing that can do regular nba things  ish smith on this team raises our ceiling by like 10 wins
"Ish Smith was insane down the stretch, made a ton of defensive plays"
"It sucked when the Wizards started gaining momentum (last mins of 3rd) the Sixers bench subbed in. Sixers still leading by 10. Suddenly, Ish Smith morphed into Steve Nash. And by the time the starters get in, the lead was a few possesions away.   Good thing Beal got tired at the end (missing some open shots). And Westbrook with two crucial offensive mistakes late in the fourth."
Scott Brooks loves Ish Smith
Yea i still don‚Äôt understand why Ish Smith was out there.
Ish Smith is always right!
"It wasn‚Äôt really Simmons. He was helping off Russ, but it was a whole team just shutting him down. Which is great, but then we get smoked by Ish Smith..."
"Ish Smith go there, but he was too small to challenge."
Process Legend Ish Smith
"whose got worse defense, Capitol police, or Ish smith?"
Russ threw some of the most atrocious passes in the fourth I‚Äôve ever seen an his defense was even worse. Ish Smith totally outplayed him that quarter.  At least Bradley Beal helped me in fantasy tonight.
"Even though he didn't score in the 4th much he was still setting up, i'd still rather he takes a shot at the rim with 3 people defending him rather than a kickout to Ish Smith or Westbrook taking 3s"
Let‚Äôs talk about Ish Smith though
Lmao the Wizards defense is so bad. Double Embiid and have 5'11 Ish Smith be the man rotating to defend the rim.
Ish Smith point god taking over
"76ers literally stopped playing defense.  I just watched Embiid move like 6 inches and put his hand halfway up to try and stop ish smith, a guy like a foot shorter than him."
Ish Smith nice with it.  With that being said get that 3-guard lineup the fuck off the court
Ish Smith nice wit it.  With that being said get that 3-guard lineup the fuck off the court
Why we getting cooked by Ish Smith lmao
"Ish Smith, Raul Neto, and Westbrook being in right now gives me aids cmon brooks"
Imagine getting cooked med rare by ish Smith in 2021
Bro ish smith is a baller
Ish Smith wtf
ISH SMITH IS A POINT GUARD
You know they‚Äôre trying when Ish Smith is actually playing defense
Ish Smith is cooking all defensive player Ben simmons
Ish Smith is for some reason scorching the Sixers
Beal's making everything... our coach is dumb ... instead of playing Rui/Deni when Beal's on the bench ...  He pulls a lineup of Westbrook/Ish Smith/Jerome Robinson/Bertans/ Robin Lopez ....
"Part of the reason why Westbrook is shooting so bad is because Brooks surrounds him with Ish Smith, Troy Brown, and Robin Lopez. He constantly plays him with zero spacing. Scott Brooks is the main problem though Westbrook was never an efficient player"
"drummond‚Äôs defense, he‚Äôs not a lockdown but go back and watch him on d and don‚Äôt focus on him, focus on how easily reggie jackson and ish smith get blown past. can‚Äôt really speak for how it is in cleveland doe."
"Aside from the just the dividing the pie logic, would it not water down the product even further? There are so many meaningless games in the NBA... random teams like the Wolves become black holes where players you kinda remember from college end up toiling in obscurity, playing meaningless games against other black hole teams like Orlando or the Wizards.   The NBA thrives on starpower... good players playing against each other as often as possible, which is why the playoffs are so amazing. Except for the primetime matchups, regular season NBA basketball is often hard to watch... especially with 48 minute games meaning that the best players only play 2/3 of the game, so you gotta watch dudes like Ish Smith play big chunks of games against dudes like Jordan McLaughlin. It just isn‚Äôt a great product... more teams means more Ish Smith‚Äôs vs. more Jordan McLaughlin‚Äôs more often.   Maybe more teams means more teams with Cap space and the stars get spread out, but I kind of doubt that happens. Stars will still cluster together. Maybe the ticket sales, merchandise, and TV deals will offset the further watering down of the product. I‚Äôm not business person, but I am skeptical of risking hurting the existing product (which by some accounts is already lacking and hurting ratings) in exchange for adding new markets.  PS I‚Äôve been musing for a while about how much better the NBA on-court product would be if it was like 20 teams instead of 30, and all this speculation about adding teams compelled me to try to coalesce some of those thoughts lol."
"Lebron James. 3rd in the league in DFG% (only Ish Smith and Patrick Beverley are better). https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=GP*GE*7&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals  Better defensive rating than Giannis, Ad, Draymond also. Sadly lbj won't even make an all-defense team because of narratives."
You really think you can get away with Ish Smith? Put him NO 1!
westbrook is without a doubt a lot better than the IT and Ish smith pg pair wiz ran last year ill tell you what
&gt; Scott brooks likes to run the Westbrook/Ish smith/Neto lineup a lot  That lineup has played literally 12 minutes this season.
Robin Lopez and ish Smith and a second rd pick
Ish Smith is a poor mans Ish Smith
When they‚Äôre playing well my 5 are probably:  Ish smith  John wall  Hayward  Siakam  Jokic
"How is this a relevant comment? No one is telling you to not leave Russ hate comments or criticism if that's what floats your boat. But at least keep the Russ hate or criticism gone from the threads that ultimately have nothing to do with him.  You see this play involving Ish Smith and Robin Lopez but simply because Russ is there in the video you had to make it about him, that's sad."
poor man's Ish Smith
They could start by : NOT PLAYING RUSSELL WESTBROOK WITH ISH SMITH WHO IS A 5'11 POOR MAN'S VERSION OF RUSSELL WESTBROOK.  Seriously it's ridiculous those 2 on the court together create open shots after open shots....for one another because nobody guards them
Ish Smith a huge plus for the Wizards right now
"I really don't remember him being this indecisive and pedestrian though. He straight up looks like ish Smith with his pass first mentality, but none of the handle"
I feel like Scott Brooks just tryna copy Billy Donovan last year OKC play with 3 point guards on the court at times  But instead CP3 Shroder SGA he got Russ Neto Ish Smith which is a terrible defensively.  Bertans plays the part of Gallo and RoLo plays the part of Steven Adams. So far they haven‚Äôt run any Spain PnR or horn set tho
"Russ with terrible shot selection the last 2 minutes  and our clown of a coach put in Ish Smith, Jerome Robinson, and Robin Lopez on the floor with him   ... WHY"
Ish Smith is a point guard
Giannis isn‚Äôt better than Ish smith from what I‚Äôm currently seeing.
The lineups have been really bad. That's why a lot of wizards fans want Brooks gone.  Russ needs shooting to be successful as he's not peak Russ anymore (obviously). Playing a non shooter like Russ with ish Smith and Lopez is not a good idea.
Ish Smith was fun to watch this year
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
He might be cooked but Scotty is playing him with ish smith and Robin Lopez. He‚Äôs not getting enough space.
He may just be washed but he‚Äôs also not being played in the right lineups. Scotty is playing him with ish smith and Robin Lopez which gives him no space to go to the rim. I wanna see him play with better shooting lineups before making any conclusions.
"Brooks really is bad though. Not that the team would be good with a different coach but he has some indefensible rotations. I should never see a 3 pg lineup with Russ, Ish Smith and Fucking Neto."
"He has the worst head coach in the league, and probably the worst defensive roster in the league too. When Russ is on the court with Raul Neto, Ish Smith, Troy Brown, and Thomas Bryant for stretches of time.... How are they expected to score more points than they give up? Whatever Russ and Beal do at one end is immediately negated at the other end. They're what people thought the Hawks would be this year on defense lol"
Makes me smile seeing Process era Sixers finding their way around the league.   Christian Wood  Richaun Holmes  Jerami Grant   Others like Tj McConnell and Ish Smith  Put some respect on Sam Hinkie's name.
"Honestly it kinda has to do with lineups sometimes.. I only follow occasionally when other games are on commercial but I‚Äôm seeing rotations of RW, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Jerome Robinson, and Robin Lopez???? Like Beal, Hachimura, Bryant, Avidja, Bertans are ALL on the bench. You‚Äôre telling me Brooks can‚Äôt rotate a couple of these dudes to play with Westbrook? I swear I‚Äôve seen RW/Smith/Neto a handful of times and I‚Äôm just... so confused."
"Deni looked amazing on both sides of the ball, great to see. Raul Neto deserves every single minute that Ish Smith gets. Thomas Bryant looks great on offence, but might be the worst defensive center I‚Äôve ever seen. And the team looks way better when Bertans is hitting shots and Rui is doing what he does."
"I dunno they looked good against us. Just looking at their per game stats seems like the roto is kind've a mess. I would have wagner and T.Bryant as my 5s. You rotate Rui, Bertans, Deni, Bonga at forward. You have Neto and Troy brown as your backup guards. I dunno that there's room in the roto for ish smith and robin lopez. Is wagner hurt? He's a pretty good player and kind've the perfect 5 to pair with Russ, he played game 1 but looks like he's hurt or out of the roto now. He's a dog and a switchy defender who's a better offensive than defensive player. He's not a star but he's a good role player you can pair with Russ in 2nd units.   They haven't been completely healthy yet but this is a decent roster with the right pieces to put around russ. Brooks should get fired if he can't figure out decent lineups with this personnel."
"\- Their defense is terrible  \- their third best player (Bertans) is out of shape, can't play 25+ mins, and has been a liability  \- both Beal and Bertans have shot poorly from 3  \- Russ has been terrible defensively, and while his mid rangers have fallen he's been completly unable to go to the rim  \- Scott Brooks' rotation are hilariously bad, constantly playing Westbrook with Ish Smith who is basically a poor's man Russ, those two might be the worst possible fit in the entire NBA"

Bruh ish smith was killing us too.
I thought ish smith was a point guard
"This lineup makes no sense. Ish Smith, Westbrook and Neto on the floor with Lopez...like why?!"
"Exactly this. Deni is a playmaker and I‚Äôve seen Ish Smith handle the ball more than him. Scott Brooks is truly awful, we have offensive potential but are currently ranked 17 cause the dude just has no plays."
"Clearly, Ish Smith should be primary ball handler, he is a PG after all."
"Don't get me started on Ish Smith, bro"
Ish smith says hi
Ish Smith is such a good backup PG. feel like he doesn‚Äôt get enough love
TIL Ish Smith was still in the league.
Ish Smith is up there too.
"It was not anguish at all for me. I enjoyed watching Roco, TJ, Wood, Holmes and Ish Smith build careers that they may never had if not for The Process.   I had season tickets and the games were a blast since everyone was on board with the plan."
Ish Smith
"I miss Ish Smith, I'd love to have him back in Detroit."
you really don't know who Ish Smith is? lol  you really don't know who Daniel Gafford is? lol
"Y'all really don't know about Ish Smith.  Except Pistons fans, you know."
Ish Smith might have the best in and out in the league lmao
#ISH SMITH STAY WINNIN
"i hear people shit on ish smith all the time, but literally every single game i watch him he is fucking insane."
Ish Smith looks like Bubbles from The Wire
Is Ish Smith even on this team?
Ish Smith looks like Masego
Lmao Marv can‚Äôt say Ish Smith without pausing in between
Ish Smith looks like Bubbles from The Wire
Did Marv just call Russ Ish smith?
"- We drafted MCW as a lead guard so we weren't going to sign another guard that year to take touches away from him  - We also had Evan Turner who was a primary ball handler and needed touches  &gt; Not expecting teams like that to sign Chris Paul, but you could've at least looked for a veteran point guard who could actually pass and open things up to give other guys opportunities  - When we got rid of MCW, we signed Ish Smith (a veteran) to compensate and help Nerlens develop as a PnR threat  - Mbah a moute was a veteran wing who was needed on that team as Covington hadn't developed yet and was still quite raw  - Mbah a moute and Nerlens actually lead us to have the 12th ranked defence that year which was our only point of pride  - Guys like Canaan were signed because we desperately lacked offensive firewpower, and at this point in the process we weren't about to trade away our picks to sign a veteran perimeter creator mid season...  - The next year was our worst year as we tried to play through Okafor and despite his best efforts, it was never going to be pretty. Okafor also unfortunately meant that our defence was terrible which was our one point of pride the preceding year (Defence plummeted to 26th)  - The next year was Embiid first year and we made a heap of trades to bring in experienced vets, they just happened to be terrible (Bayless and Henderson)  I just think your criticism is very unfounded. This team tried everything it could starting from an empty cupboard of assets. As soon as Embiid hit the court we were competitive and we haven't looked back"
"Yeah. That‚Äôs why you have to TRUST THE PROCESS. If it were easy, anyone could do it. It takes toughness and discipline to bear the critics and stick to the plan.   Or you can hire a Colangelo to come in and panic trade two 2nds for half a season of Ish Smith, sign Jerryd Bayless to a 3year deal, and trade a young &amp; promising Jerami Grant for nothing. Only good moves he made were a couple 1-year overpay deals for JJ and grabbing Ersan and Marco as buyout guys. He gets no credit for the Simmons pick."
i can‚Äôt stand ish smith pls god
ish smith looks weird af shooting fts
Ish Smith: Is a point guard and a leader
"i only remember early-career ish smith from 2K games. so i think early on it was the fact that no one wanted - dude was not good enough to even be a fringe rotation piece. but in recent memory, he was pretty good on the process sixers whenever i'd watch them play, hence why he hasn't moved around as much since then."
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
Ish Smith is a lot worse than you think he is
Tatum literally shot over Ish smith too lmao
"Ish Smith should be starting over Westbrook next game. He's a better player in crunch time, and it's not like you can do worse than Westbrook at this point."
"Ish Smith looked like a man on a mission last night, def should have gotten north of 30 minutes the way he was killing us"
They were matching up Ish Smith on Tatum at times. Tatum has 8 inches and about 50 pounds on him. Wizards didn‚Äôt have a chance
"Why not play Ish Smith even more instead of letting Raul Neto do nothing for 17 minutes? Why not even *try* playing Bonga when you're letting the other teams star go for 50?       Great game for Tatum obviously. I don't see Celtics going much further this year but it always helps to have your young star get this kind of experience. Feel like the next big step for him will be just being consistent in these big games and avoiding those occasional 3 for 17 games and he already seems to be in the middle of addressing that.           As an aside, the Chuck guarantee thing started out pretty funny a while ago, then it started to get pretty tired, and now it's just TNT producers trying to force the joke. Don't even get me started on the sound and commentary during the games yesterday. I remember during opening night of this season there were a lot of complaints about the quality of the broadcasts and some people actually defended it because apparently ESPN/TNT needed some time to get adjusted for the new season. So have they had enough time to figure it out now? I have no idea how to hold these channels more accountable to actually put out a decent product but I don't get why people ever give them the benefit of the doubt. They charge lots of money for one purpose and are unable to do it."
Idk man I feel like if you're asking Ish Smith to save your season you're pretty cooked either way.
Rui and Gafford were in foul trouble early.  Ish Smith was the hero tonight.
"Ish Smith, Walt Fraziers favorite player in the league üòé"
"None of what you‚Äôve said is in direct opposition to what I‚Äôve said.   I made no mention of freestyling or hero ball. You‚Äôre correct about the importance of role players. Hence why I said leave Smith in. It was more players like Bertans that let them down in this game. He went 1 for 8. If he went even 4 for 8 then suddenly that defence is a lot less zoned in.   My point was more that you don‚Äôt simply eschew every single thing your team is built around, change your offence temporarily to work around a different focal point from one night to the next. Structure is key.   To be fair to the OP, on reflection he hasn‚Äôt necessarily suggested that and simply said Ish should have got a few more looks. That I agree with. Think at first I read the OP as if he meant Ish should have been leading the offense."
"I think you‚Äôve took my post to mean just sling it to Beal irrespective of what‚Äôs open lol, that‚Äôs clearly not what I‚Äôve said. I even mentioned leave Ish Smith in.   And by the way, those Fred Van Vlert/Mario Chalmers games‚Ä¶those were once a season at best. There‚Äôs a reason for that.   I‚Äôm sorry but yeah you share the ball around but the reason Beal is who he is is because he can get his shot up irrespective of who‚Äôs guarding him.   Also, if you‚Äôre so intent on blaming coaching for this, what do you think coaches will run schemes on ALL YEAR? You think they‚Äôre scheming plays for Ish Smith? No. They‚Äôre running the best possible plays again and again to get the ball into Beal‚Äôs hands with as much room as they can.   Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work out"
&gt; They would've probably won with Ish Smith taking Beal shots but we will never know.  There is no value in statements like this because there's nothing that supports it and it's purely hypothetical. It's awful analysis.  They also lost by almost 20.  &gt;Russ actually had 52% TS   That's still bad.
Russ actually had 52% TS and Beal had 34% TS.   They would've probably won with Ish Smith taking Beal shots but we will never know.  Beal was just banged up and couldn't get foul calls.
"Ish Smith deserved to be playing in the 4th quarter instead of Westbrook.  Garrison Matthews and Daniel Gafford should have gotten more PT.  They probably lose anyways because the team talent is just bad, but it's better than watching the whole team just clank bricks all night"
This isn't true. Celtics put Tatum and smart all over Beal. He had no room to score easily.  This is like how guys like FVV and Norm Powell stepped up to score 20+. Same for like Mario Chalmers with the Heat.  Last year Lakers we saw big games from KCP and Kuzma that scored 20+. This game should've been the Ish Smith game.
Ish Smith. 17 points on 6-8. Benched most of the 4th. Why?
"Ish Smith was cooking us all game, pretty much the only guy whose motor was really running. I did think it was weird that he was pulled so early."
If only Westbrook played as well as Ish Smith this game
"You could see Ish Smith look at him and be like ""uhh, are we gonna stop, or... ok, I guess not"""
Ish Smith was a +5 in this game.
You say this like Ish Smith didnt out play Westbrook and kept the Wizards in the game.
He also tried to get ish Smith to pick him up 1v1.   Really a coaching clinic.   Maybe if the Celtics fire Brad stevens brooks can take over with his galaxy brain defensive ideas.
They deferred to ish smith instead of Russell fucking Westbrook in a pretty much playoff game. IN TRANSITION. Literally where Russ is at his best. He dropped the ball this game.
Ish smith too nice with it. If he grew 10 inches he might be able to guard Tatum.
Beal is playing on one leg and they're starting Alex Len at C. With Ish Smith and Raul Neto spacing the floor
Ish Smith though
He knew he didn't have legs for shooting or transitioning the ball up the floor. That's why they looked for Ish Smith on transitions instead of Russ. And Ish Smith did a great job at that tbh.
"Tonight was the first full game i watched the Bullets played. Aside from Beal trying making difficult shots and Ish Smith trying really hard, i didn't see anything encouraging. Westbrook reinforced the impressions about his game. Team defense was poor, with many players making poor mistakes, bad rotations... Even if they had won this game, they would have no chance of winning a series. Were the guys just having a bad game? Or bad coaching and no prep work? This team has been so hot of late, I'm puzzled."
Ish smith always kills us.  I remember last year I went to a Celtics game at capital one arena with Beal out thinking great chance to watch a Celtics blowout win and then ish smith dominated us
Or maybe Ish Smith should have started and played more than Neto
Ish Smith should not be guarding Tatum.  I guess the other strategy was to simply let him shoot open 3s.   Both are not optimal.
&gt;	outside of Ish Smith it was a pretty terrible game for the Wizards  Feel like I‚Äôve heard this one before
"Ish Smith was 6-8, Hachimura was 4-5, Gafford was 6-7.   Yet, the role-players who took the most shots were Alex Len (2-8) and Bertans (1-8). Alex Len somehow managed to take 8 shots in 12 minutes of play time.  Brooks needs to learn to make adjustments."
Was low key terrified of ish smith tonight since he always seems to destroy the Celtics. They seem to have a perpetual issue with the small spark plugs. TJ McConnell and JJ barrea always get buckets against them too
Ish Smith ended Payton Pritchard's playoffs lol. We won't be seeing him till we're desperate in game three against the Nets.
kept putting Beal and Ish Smith 1 on 1 on Tatum. it was too easy for him to get to the paint and pressure the wizards bigs which led to him drawing a million fred throws. rui being in foul trouble is crippling but you have to double Tatum at that point and force him to pass and be a playmaker
if ish smith started we would have lost.  he would have dropped 40 and carried them.  no doubt.  he is better than middleton when hes playing the celtics.
"No no no they adjusted earlier. Late in the 3rd he decided to put ish Smith on him. Then russell westbrook.  Then only when the game was firmly out of reach, he doubled. Scotty strikes again!"
Ish Smith should have been the #1 option after how he played in the 2nd quarter. Brooks is a coward and can‚Äôt tell Westbrook shit
Ish Smith is a great role player
Ish Smith hero balled his way to 17 points on 8 shots
"To be fair, Ish Smith historically has just dad-dicked the Celtics. No idea why, but he hates us."
Ish Smith is a Celtic killer
"Wizards' 3pt defense was just atrocious.  Beal and Westbrook weren't good, but none of the Wizards came prepared for this game, besides Ish Smith and maybe Brook Lopez.    Also the Wizards would've been better off with Rui fouling out in the third than ending the game with 5 fouls. Tatum was absolutely cooking Beal. Who else on the Wizards could've slowed him?"
Ish Smith should have gotten more minutes over Westbrook lol
Ish Smith is really the leader of this team lmao
Ish Smith a better leader than 90% of all players
Ish Smith fired up. Rightfully so. He was one of the few Wizards who actually showed up.
Ish Smith would be a top player if he was 6‚Äô5-6‚Äô7
Ish Smith is the fucking man.
Ish Smith a better coach than Scott Brooks
Ish Smith out here running circles around Westbrook
He‚Äôs getting outplayed by Ish Smith. At least Beal can say he‚Äôs rusty
When they had ish Smith pick him up 1v1 I started dying
Someone please get Ish Smith some help out there
"I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYIN THIS, BUT WHY IS ISH SMITH NOT IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW???"
Ish Smith has been the only good Wizard on offense tonight
give the touches to ish smith
Ish Smith has been better tonight
Ish smith has kept the wizards in this
If nobody got the Wizards Ish Smith got the Wizards
"Just as expected, Ish Smith carrying the Wizards"
A good coach would start Ish Smith tonight.
Man Ish Smith carrying hard
Is Ish Smith the twitchiest player in the league?
ish smith deserves a better supporting cast
Ish smith will not let them lose this game
I miss Ish Smith he's a baller
I‚Äôm not even gonna lie shout out to Ish Smith he came to play today
Ish Smith keeps making something out of nothing and his team keeps letting him down by refusing to complete the play
Ish Smith carrying
Ish Smith &gt; Westbrook
Ish Smith is surprisingly a pretty good rebounder for a small guy
Ish Smith a fucking baller
Bro Ish Smith is so fast wtf...
"It‚Äôs hard to simply target a single weak defender (Seth) when your offence just doesn‚Äôt have enough spacing or offensive talent in general. Luka is having success against the Clippers when he targets Zubac or one of the little guards because he is constantly surrounded by 4 shooters, or 3 shooters &amp; a lob threat in WCS or Powell. There also isn‚Äôt a playmaker on this Wizards team that is on the level of Luka.  By ‚Äúattack Seth Curry‚Äù do you mean attack him in PnR or in isolation? Because if it‚Äôs in isolation, then I don‚Äôt think a large volume of Raul Neto or Ish Smith iso‚Äôs are going to pull off an upset on this Philly team. Even if they do beat him off the dribble, again the Wizards don‚Äôt have enough spacing to take consistent advantage against this. Philly has elite help defenders in Joel, Ben, Green, Thybulle, etc. as well.  And in the PnR it‚Äôs much of the same, even if Curry is a liability on D, Philly has elite help defenders and Wizards don‚Äôt have enough legitimate offensive threats to consistently take advantage of it. They are honestly just too outmatched this series."
"Honestly they probably shouldn't start him, but they seem to want Ish Smith to run the bench units, and a Smith/Neto backcourt is wet paper bag levels of defence."
"But that‚Äôs also due to Brooks only plans involving Russ and Beal. Guys like Hachimura, Ish Smith, and Gaffird would do far better if they had a coach with a real game plan"
Missed both games so far. Why is Rui hardly taking any shots?  Only 6 this game while Ish Smith took 14.
Brooks about to play ish smith 45 minutes in game 3
"He‚Äôs playing the best defensive team in the NBA rn with his help (outside of Beal) being Neto, Len, a young Rui, Ish Smith, RoLo, Bertans   Your roster outside of Russ/Beal is just shit. Those 2 players carried this franchise to a 17-6 finish just to play the best team in the East.  I‚Äôm not tryna be a dick but it‚Äôs the truth. Neto and Len cannot start on any NBA team other than the Wizards."
Ish Smith is the best bad player in the league
"Ish Smith really has made himself into a solid nba player. He was so trash a few years back, props to him for putting in the work"
Ish Smith is just a solid basketball player.
Does russ have anything to do besides losing you this game? Seriously if he could just go chill at his car dealerships and let ish Smith take over you guys would at least be taking it to 5 games
Ish smith with the super finger roll
LMAO right?   Why not trade for Ish Smith? Dude looked like he had a way with words during that Celtics play in game
Gerald Henderson on the 2011-12 Bobcats or Ish Smith on the 2015-16 Sixers? Harris would be absolute dog shit as a #1 though
Hawks- Dwight Howard  Hornets- Dwight Howard  Rockets- Juwan Howard  Bulls- Jalen Rose  Mavs- Juwan Howard  Blazers- Juwan Howard  Lakers- Dwight Howard  Nuggets- Jalen Rose  Jazz- Jeff Malone  Celtics- Nate Robinson  Pacers- Jalen Rose  Knicks- Jalen Rose  Nets- Jeremy Lin  Cavs- Seth Curry  Heat- Juwan Howard  Magic- Juwan Howard  Warriors- Chris Webber  Clippers- Chauncey Billups  Thunder- Carmelo Anthony  Bucks- Ish Smith  Wolves- Chauncey Billups  Raptors- Jalen Rose  Wizards- Chris Webber  Sixers- Chris Webber  Spurs- Tracy McGrady  Grizzlies- Ish Smith  Pelicans- Ish Smith  Suns- Jalen Rose  Kings-¬† Chris Webber  Pistons- Chris Webber
"Welcome, Ish Smith"
Putting ish Smith on blast god damn what's he got to do with it
"To me, part of it is now Westbrook. Neto and Ish Smith do a great job sticking their man and closing out.  They need to tell Westbrook to stop playing free safety."
Schr√∂der is Ish Smith quick
"I literally said it in my post. Ish Smith had looked better this game. Obviously Russ is the better player but the man can‚Äôt hit water falling outta boat. Scott brooks gotta realize he‚Äôs the coach for the wiz, not russ‚Äôs guy."
"I‚Äôm not saying that the refs are the sole reason the game was somewhat close. Remember that Beal, Westbrook, and guys like Len, Lopez, and Ish Smith were hot as well. Just because refs may show bias doesn‚Äôt mean one side automatically wins."
Harden saved his legacy by joining a team where other people can actually play in the playoffs.   Westbrook joined a third rate team to make him look even more like garbage lmao.   Ish Smith looks like Kobe Bryant next to westbrook
"coming from an honest bradley brick  fan, his play is unacceptable and ridiculous, i‚Äôm going to become a fan of a real PG, like ish smith !!!"
is it a hot take if i say i would rather have ish smith in the game instead of russ now
westbrook has legit been worse than ish smith today
Ish smith is making some real bad decisions lmao
"huge error by ish smith, you can‚Äôt show that you don‚Äôt have no confidence in your shot right there."
Ish Smith watches YouTube videos at 1.25x
Westbrick is actively hurting the team. Just run Beal and Ish Smith
Ish Smith is just fun to watch
ish smith the GOAT
ISH SMITH &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WESTBRICK
"Ish Smith bout to come back on and carry the Wiz, though."
Ish Smith &gt; wb in this game
Because there isn't if Brooklyn is healthy. Not with Simmons being afraid to post up Ish Smith and Bradley Beal. The dude can pass but he ruins their offense
"Simmons not posting up smaller weaker defenders, dude being guarded by Beal and Ish Smith smh"
Love some good old Ish Smith!
"""Ish Smith for throo"" lol gonna miss Marv's gaffes"
Marv is getting worse. Ish shot from in front of the free throw line and he said ‚Äúish smith from 3‚Äù
Ish smith &gt;&gt;&gt; westbrook
Ish Smith is the best defender on the court
Ish Smith looks like Pat Bev with his life together
Ish Smith is kinda a dawg üò≥
I love Ish Smith. Guy plays HARD on both ends
ish smith is killing it
"Clear charge on Ish Smith, then a blatant illegal screen by Hill on Beal.  Philly already getting the benefit of the calls, and still down by 1."
"If we lose a game where ish smith, Raul Neto, and Alex Len are getting playoff minutes imma be pissed"
Loving Ish Smith.
Ish Smith drew that charge
Ish smith is elite defensively wtf
Ish Smith is a better defender than Rui. Wizards look so much better now
Ish Smith seems like he's taken some sort of like super caffeine supplement. Dude is just FLYING all over.
WTF Ish Smith blocking Tobias?
"Ish Smith swatting Tobi, what is this game"
Ish smith is a block guard
Celtics killer Ish Smith adding to his resume
Ish Smith just block Tobias fadeaway? tf?
Ish smith could play a full season in a middle school league and not get another block lol
Lmao getting blocked by ish smith
ish smith getting a pay raise after this game
Could we like not get blocked by Ish Smith? That's not a good look lol
"Ish Smith is just pure energy, can't hate that"
Ish Smith is a nice spark off the bench.
Ish Smith is the GOAT
Goddamn it ish smith
that ish smith travel
ish smith took 5 steps on that euro
Ish Smith carrying again
"Ish Smith has highkey been so nice in the play in and now today, he's so shifty"
Ish Smith is so quick damn
I miss ish smith man
Ish Smith has more heart than anyone on the Wizards roster
Wow Ish Smith is quick huh
Now they‚Äôre saying it was Ish Smith
The idea of Ish Smith is always better than the actual product. 1st he missed 30 games. 2nd advanced stats grade him as a well below league average offensive player. 3rd that deadly midrange is 39% from 10-16 feet.   Looney grades out better offensively and defensively. He also is a solid rebounder
"How many G league players are on the wizards? They have russ and beal. Thats 50pts on its own.. have hashimora, lopez who is very good in the post, have bertans who can shoot very well when he is feeling it..ish smith, gafford.. warriors have curry and draymond who cant score to save his life.. 7ppg dray, people see the defense but he is messing up our offense.. they have looney who cant score.. then u have wiggins , oubre and just G league players. Bazemore is a low IQ player who will never make a team better.. hawks, blazers, kings all got better when they moved off him"
Ish Smith has gone nuclear the last 2 games for the Wizards. I think he's going to have some more big games against the 76ers.
Ish Smith is a point guard
He'll be guarding Raul Neto &amp; Ish Smith - I think he'll be fine.
Ish Smith will be the best player on the court I agree
well you see...Ben had to make sure ish smith was locked up.
"Classic Ish. He‚Äôs so damn good at this kind of play. Due to the Ish smith: is a point guard meme, people really be overlooking him. One of my favorite pistons in the last ~5 years lol"
Ish smith
"Pretty sure when I caught wizard games where the wizards played Russ with Ish smith, Chandler Hutchinson, Rui, and Alex Len on the floor if thats not the worst spacing you've seen you shouldnt complain about the type of spacing the lakers will have this season."
"&gt;They traded away Russ and without him they don‚Äôt make the playoffs.  Eh. Russ replaced Ish Smith and Shabazz Napier in the starting lineup, that's why they went to the playoffs.   Replacing Ish and Napier with an actual middle of the road starter like Dinwiddie, Lonzo, or Conley would easily put them back"
Have you forgotten about the one and only Ish Smith?
"Right now, I'm wondering if a lot of the Pelicans issues could have been mitigated if Bledsoe had been the 1 instead and placing Lonzo more off-ball. Maybe Bledsoe wouldn't have checked out.       Lonzo is notoriously finicky to work in. Do you know how hard it is for a point guard to not fit with Jrue? Elfrid Payton. Rajon Rondo. Tim Frazier. Ish Smith. Seemingly every point guard that the Pelicans ran opposite Jrue gave acceptable production when the starter."
"The only PG on our roster is Aaron Holiday (crossing my fingers that we can re-sign Neto and/or Ish Smith for cheap). Dinwiddie might be an average starting PG, but we desperately need an average starting PG."
"If Ish Smith wins every game, I think he will win the NBA Finals"
&gt;Ish Smith  Killed me
Not the point. Obviously they were better with Westbrook than ish Smith. The point is that they severely underperformed due to Westbrooks poor shooting
"Man tried sneaking Ish Smith on here thinking we wouldn't notice lmao  Except, he's right, Ish Smith does belong on this list"
Faking Davis Bertans and Ish Smith. How much more help does this guy need
"Peak Ish Smith was definetely MVP level. He averaged 32 points, 8 assists and 100% win record on games played 4th January 2020."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards‚Äô season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  ‚ÄúThis is not a run-it-back team,‚Äù he said.  Now, it‚Äôs official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday‚Äôs NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won‚Äôt become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook‚Äôs outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose r√©sum√© includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he‚Äôs done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team‚Äôs culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal‚Äôs closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards‚Äô preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what‚Äôs now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming ‚Äî especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie‚Äôs incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn‚Äôt all. The Wizards‚Äô Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards‚Äô list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer‚Äôs free agency class is rich with capable point guards ‚Äî from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte‚Äô Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it‚Äôs confusing, but that‚Äôs not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They‚Äôre adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford ‚Äî though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it‚Äôs difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Ish Smith lmao. That's a name I haven't heard in a while. Where's he at now?
&gt;Ish Smith  Damn this list is nothing but facts.
yeah i agree. ish smith is mvp lvl
Ish Smith (x2)
Always a good sign having ish smith and lebron on the same list
Don‚Äôt forget Ish Smith Neto and Robinson
adding more to the trade will cause it to cap out. all the assets the lakers sent out is only getting you westbrook. the rights to kuz trezz kcp and 22 is the wizard's to control now. as we saw with them trading it for aaron holiday. indy might be added to the traded. expanding the trade will not get back you another quality players like buddy. maybe fringe players like ish smith.  the remaining assets lakers have are tht carsuo denis all free agents all will cause it to cap out if the sign and trade thing happens. in addition to that the hard cap is also a concern. cap right now is 120. the hard cap is 140. with the big 3 you have now you are at 118-120 so lakers have around 25 million ish to fill out the roster with i think 6 players signed.
"They‚Äôre upgrades for the Wizards and are all going to be able to do more given a bigger role. Washington‚Äôs bench was Ish Smith, Raul Neto and Robin Lopez in the playoffs."
"Yeah, the move is another 6'0 washout. We've got 2 rostered, just need 1 more  Who's keeping track from just the past 2 seasons? I am....  Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Cassius Winston, Chris Chiozza, Justin Robinson, Shabazz Napier, now Aaron Holiday."
Wizards ORtg was 17th in 2021 with Westbrook.   Wizards ORtg was 15th in 2020 with... Ish Smith.  And that's with Beal missing fewer games in 2021.
"And a better ORTG the season before, with Ish Smith running the show."
"&gt; 17th in ortg   17th with Russ isn't good.  Especially when WAS was 15th in Off Rtg 2 years ago, with Ish Smith and Isaiah Thomas playing PG, and Beal missing more games than he did last season."
"Hmm, over that same time span, idk. Impressive company he's kept.   Some players that came to mind:  Pat McCaw  D.Green  Jeff Teague   JJ Reddick (post clippers)  Dark Horse pick: Ish Smith - Journeyman extraordinaire. 11 seasons, 11 teams."
He's a SG or sometimes an SF depending on the lineup.  We literally don't have ball handlers and passers lol...Ish Smith and Raul Neto are our free agents and they are both 3rd stringers at best.
I'm sad.  But at least I still have Ish Smith
I‚Äôm from Ohio and loved Ish Smith for some reason which got me into the Sixers
"""What do you mean Dedmon, Ish Smith and Josh Jackson isnt a fair deal for Jokic?"""
"The Sixers didn't fall apart without him because of his defense, it's because he was the only PG on the roster. Replace him with Ish Smith and the they're still above .500"
"Well Ish Smith and RoLo are FAs, so that checks out"
Ish Smith: is a point guard
Ish Smith is more like a $1.20 tbh
"Point guard is #1.  Lowry makes a lot of sense, but he‚Äôs gonna be coveted by a lot of teams.    I wouldn‚Äôt even rule out a Dennis Schroeder return, but that seems very unlikely since there‚Äôs been reports of locker room tension with him.    I‚Äôm curious to see if Derrick Rose will re-sign in New York.  I also wanna know how much Spencer Dinwiddie will earn.  Similar for Goran Dragic.    Ish Smith and Bruce Brown are also good.  Bruce Brown is an RFA though.  Ish Smith could be a backup PG target."
"Lonzo really didn't fit with Jrue. When guys like Tim Frazier, Ish Smith, and Elfrid Payton play better, from a fit perspective, there's something wrong."
ish smith is 33? I just remember it like yesterday when he was going to draft meetings with team color matching shirts...
Fr though I feel like every time I watch a game with Ish Smith he plays great
"&gt; his defense has taken a MASSIVE leap.  I feel like the fact that he had 7 blocks in almost 2000 minutes last year is a massive red flag.       I actually believe in the offense, but that's just ridiculously low for someone with his body who has always had BBIQ issues. Ish Smith had twice as many blocks in half the minutes."
"They had to trade Capela because he was injured he had a foot injury that would have kept him out all season and before the Capela trade Russ was dominating with Capela in the lineup so that ""he only played well because of small ball"" thing isnt true MDA and the coaching staff knew what they were doing hes best as a combo guard instead of a pg who facilitates the offense.  The team just prioritized spacing much more so with schemes, offensive plays, etc... the wizards dont. And ya a stretch 5 would be nice for russ but again if you have lineups like russ, ish smith, beal, hutchinson and robin lopez youre not going to have great spacing and the wizards ran these types of groups continuously nor are you doing russ any favors.  Every team has some sort of lineup with good spacing 4 out 1 in or 5 out where it works/utilized well. Suns did it , bucks, nets, lakers (even though it was a mess in the playoffs that was the goal 5 out with AD at the 5 till he got hurt), hawks with a lob threat, nuggets, etc...  &amp;#x200B;  My point is if russ is actually utilized well instead of terribly (OKC, Washington) he'll be a threat again."
&gt;free up opportunities for the Wizards‚Äô young players  Ish Smith and Raul Neto? Because off the top of my head they're the only other ballhandlers on that roster
"Except LeBron had emotional ties and attachments in his hometown.   Luka conquered home, has some of his own non-cuban given money in his pocket, and is on the other side of the planet from home. He doesn't owe anyone or carry some sense of obligation. He can go full ish Smith if he wanted to explore the country past an airport/hotel/restaurant surface level.  He also idolizes Bron, and Bron isn't shy about reciprocating his feels in return. Where would you want to be as a rising international star? In a place with a manchild non-coach *coach* playing cool dad,  with a bunch of variations of the same blonde girl, or floating in the infinity pool overlooking the Pacific and eating tacos on Tuesdays with his idol.   The long cons been runnin since day 1."
Ish smith
Ish Smith is a free agent and he only has 19 teams to go!
"Westbrook brought 45m worth of volume stats.   With Wall and his supermax sidelined, the Wizards' two ball handlers other than Beal were Ish Smith and Shabazz Napier (who played overseas last year). Just replacing Ish and Shabazz with an actual NBA guard would elevate their team significantly."
They were guarding ben Simmons with ish Smith.
"That's because they replaced Ish Smith and Raul Neto, two 6'0, basically vet-min players with Westbrook.  Westbrook does provide ""value"" when he's replacing literal trash."
Congrats Westbrook is better than Ish Smith? Also had like 40m in dead salary.
"Eeeh. The Wizards improved the barebones minimum, but that's cause they replaced Ish Smith starting with $45m Russ. The Wizards badly badly needed guard help (if Wall was sitting), and Russ gave that.  Any average starting PG with the ability to play 30 mins for a full season probably would have gotten the Wizards there. A mid-tier Dragic, Conley, Dinwiddie, etc."
"Haha ohh 100%.  Ty Lawson is no where near NBA level and hasn‚Äôt been for 5+ years.   In my opinion, if he had an entirely different lifestyle and stayed focused on basketball and no nonsense, he could very well be in the league today. Not as a star or anything, but I look at a guy like Ish Smith and don‚Äôt see any reason Lawson couldn‚Äôt be at least that.    But you are totally right that it‚Äôd be a stretch even if he remained dedicated"
Ish Smith: Is a point guard
"&gt;Is Ben Simmons not a floor raiser over Fox? His numbers are pretty solid when Joel's hurt.  The DPOY and all star version of Ben Simmons yeah. The 2021 playoff edition of Ben Simmons is worth Ish Smith and a protected late 2nd round pick. Philly has him valued as all star Ben Simmons, the market has him valued as 2021 Ben Simmons"
ISH SMITH: *IS A POINT GUARD*
This would be the greatest scouting report ever.  Scout - Ish Smith: is a point guard  GM - fucking sold

Damn and the Ish Smith is a Point Guard comes from this too gheez
"Real bummer what happened to him. I'm pretty sure the Sixers bear some responsibility for his last knee injury because they let him continue to play on it (as they did the one time with Embiid). I always thought he had the talent to do what Ish Smith does - he was *elite* at getting into the paint, but what happened once he got there was always a roller coaster.  Team WHOP Forever."
The disrespect to Ish Smith!
He‚Äôs more like a taller Ish Smith
"You guys dont even like Russ lol. I really dont see the wizards game plan here. They have russ and beal plus a bunch of OK role players in rui, and gafford but the rest of the team is awful. They played guys like Raul Neto, Robin Lopez and Ish Smith who wouldnt even see floor time on a normal playoff team.   Theres no substance or end goal for the wizards besides a first round exit. And if a team is offering you kuz+THT and then for Beal picks with a young player along with the incentive to develop your young guys deni, rui, gafford, kuz, Bryant THT, your pick this year and next year you do it. Tell me please how thats a bad deal instead of settling for the 7th or 8th seed you are so gungho about?"
"Definitely ahead of Ish Smith, probably behind Michael Jordan"
"They just need another ball handler/ play maker off the bench   Ish Smith, Payne could be good options"
Why? They are already over the salary cap and thats with Schroder getting $15...He'll want $20. You can find a backcourt by committee for way cheaper. They'll more than likely sign THT and you can go out and get a combination of say TJ McConnell and Ish Smith for much cheaper.
"Was this the origin for ""Ish Smith is a point guard"""

&gt; Ish smith is a funny name  -KianNeon
Ish smith is a funny name
Boughknight certainly can't be any  worse than what Ish Smith just showed
"Cody Martin and Ish Smith are physically unable to produce offense.  PLAY THE FUCKING GUY YOU PICKED IN THE LOTTERY A FEW MONTHS AGO.  You‚Äôre the fucking Hornets. This isn‚Äôt like you‚Äôre the nets/lakers/bucks where you need to win every game because championship is the goal.  Develop your fucking lotto pick holy shit. You drafted him to handle, pass, and shoot. Let him do it!!!"
Ish Smith maybe not the best back-up PG.
Ish Smith sucks
Ish Smith bugs me because I don‚Äôt why he keeps getting new contracts and playing time when all he does is probe dribble in the paint to then kick to a teammate in a bad position against the shot clock
Allen and Love can't get the rebound with Ish Smith around
Dwight also the centerpiece of the greatest copypasta in this subs history. [Ish Smith: IS A POINT GUARD](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1hpxcr)
Ish Smith *is* a point guard
I love Ish Smith so much.
"Both teams had significant injuries to starters. Neither team looks like the type to give up when down (hornets were down 23, Pacers 11 in the 4th). Hornets have no one that can handle Sabonis in the paint still. I don‚Äôt know why Borrego didn‚Äôt play Bouknight at all (was he the highest draft pick with a DNP?) I didn‚Äôt expect Lamelo to come out as hot as he did. Ish Smith gave the hornets a boost from the bench but no one on the bench had a positive +/-. Duarte was absolutely ridiculous for his first NBA game."
I know zero of those players only one I seemingly recognize is Ish Smith... I'm guessing 76ers.
"true, but Oubre was terrible by a lot of advanced metrics too. -3.8 ORAPTOR is bottom 10 in the league among players with 1000 minutes. -1.5 OBPM is 31st to the bottom. EPM has him at a -2.2, just under Ish Smith and Elfrid Payton. Wiggins is roughly a net zero by most of those stats, which is about what I expected. I would love to know where you're getting your data btw, I can't find any way to exclude minutes shared with certain players without doing math."
"You too can be involved in terrible Myles Turner trade rumors, how about Ish Smith Biz and a first?"
"Lamelo's shotmaking was incredible, Miles is a god, Ish Smith not being washed yet is unironically HUGE for this team.  Hornets defense still sucks and imo they got away with a couple things during the comeback, but it doesn't matter if the effort is there and it wasn't in the first half, it was in the second."
ish smith is the best basketball player on the planet
Ish Smith
Ish smith
"I know that it‚Äôs one game but when I watched the opener, it seemed like LeBron wasn‚Äôt taking a back seat. So the need for Westbrick is 0. Agreed with you that they could‚Äôve gotten like an Ish Smith type of guy to run the offense when Bron is not around. That‚Äôs (and Buddy) an improvement compared to the playoff performance Westbrick pulled off."
"They obviously prioritized another ballhandler over spacing since a secondary playmaker takes a ton of pressure off of Bron.   That being said I have to imagine there was somebody cheaper available. Even like an Ish Smith (not a glamorous signing, but it's something)"
"I'll take 3/5. Don't know why I thought Ish Smith was on the Celtics, though."
No it was definitely ish smith
"A core rotation he had was playing Westbrook, Neto, and Ish Smith together. Underrated though"
Ish Smith  Can't really shoot or defend. Below average height. Mediocre point guard
"Yeah, the issue is that framing that you just used. Keeping bad players off the floor is at least as important if not more important than having good ones.   Having Russ isn't the needle-mover, it's the fact that playing Russ means that you don't have to play Ish Smith.   Beal was the one actually driving wins and losses, Russ just gave him enough competency that he actually had a chance to do it."
Ish Smith is nice as shit
"He wasnt bad as a backup for the hornets last season, just measurably worse than ish smith."
"I know it was hard to watch lol. Russ needs shooters to be a great player and we gave him Robin Lopez, Alex Len, and Ish Smith, often on the floor the same time"
Ish smith
Ish Smith the Celtics killer
Ish Smith did last 2 years. Can‚Äôt do that anymore
"I can‚Äôt say about the actual stats, but he was running with Robin Lopez and Alex Len as his big men, with two of Neto, ish Smith, and Beal. It‚Äôs expected that they wouldn‚Äôt push the pace that well. Irregardless his rebounds easily helped the team get easy baskets. You could always count on Rui getting an easy 2 points every game just off of leaking out and catching a near full court pass from Westbrook."
"fair enough, it's hard to find primary sources for that kind of thing.   Jerry coming in and immediately ""forcing"" Hinkie to trade 2 2's for Ish Smith to run point and then Jerry nixing the Okafor trade have been talked about so much I guess I consider it cannon"
he had fantastic %s when we had far worse than ish Smith running point
"Downgraded on 3 solid contributors (Graham, Monk, Zeller) to 3 guys who probably will be bums (Ish Smith, Oubre, Plumlee). Bench will probably struggle hard this year unless we get some solid contributions from at least one unproven youngster like Bouknight, Carey, Kai Jones etc. Even if the starting core is very good or even gets better than last year it's tough to see us lasting with so little depth. Plus the east improved massively this past offseason so competition is harder."
Which is a good when combined with Trae. I‚Äôm saying he benefits quite a bit from playing with Trae instead of Ish Smith
"At one point in the third quarter Dallas had their full starters in against Ish Smith, Plumlee, Mcdaniels, Kai Jones and Bouknight and they were running plays lol"
This game has just solidified that ish smith &gt; Luka
He‚Äôs gonna be in that Shabaz Napier ish smith type of class
I mean lu dort and SGA got serious minutes last year in okc  In 2015 the sixers were building around okafor and ish smith  I feel like okc has a better direction
Ish Smith back then was faster than the top point guards in the league. Ben Simmons speed won't matter if he's afraid of Trae Young
"Being able to fit anywhere doesn't mean you have the talent level to start everywhere.  Guys like Seth Curry, Ish Smith, Jeff Green - they can always carve out a role, but you may be in trouble if you give them 30-35."
"Here‚Äôs a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions‚Äô moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell‚Äôs deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn‚Äôt want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they‚Äôd just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You‚Äôd be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren‚Äôt gaining assets for it."
"nothing but respect for Ish Smith, who *is* a point guard"
I saw ish smith miss like 10 straight in warmups before a playoff game against the sixers
Ish Smith
He's barely a top 100 player in the playofffs since 2017-2018. He's a total fraud since his MVP season.   I would take Mike Conley over him easily since 2017.   Ben Simmons is awful yet he outplayed Westbrick so thoroughly this past playoffs.   Westbrick managed an awful 33% fg against us in the playoffs. I was more worried about Neto and Ish Smith.
No one is saying we would‚Äôve. But every nonWiz fan overestimates Westbrook‚Äôs contribution. He was undoubtedly our 2nd best player. But Beal was clearly the guy this season.    People morph valid critiques into ‚ÄúYou say you don‚Äôt like Westbrook but he doesn‚Äôt better than Ish Smith. Curious.‚Äù Like yeah no shit. He absolutely helped us to the playoffs. He absolutely did not drag us. We nearly made it the year before without him.
"Yeah but that's the thing about Hinkie no one ever mentions. He never came close to building the foundations of a functional team.   Hinkie, Colangelo and Brand all made the exact same mistake, they all overinvested in Cs, PFs and PGs who couldn't shoot.  * Brand is a fuckup because he spent all their cap space on a PF and a PF/C (Harris and Horford).   * Colangelo is a fuckup because he drafted two PGs who couldn't shoot (Simmons and Fultz).  * Actually Hinkie's a saint who never did anything wrong even though he drafted 3 Cs and a PG who couldn't shoot (Embiid, Nerlens, Okafor, MCW).      Hinkie wasted just as many key assets and built an incredibly shaky foundation that eventually needed to be torn down. If Embiid didn't fall into his lap then Hinkie would have nothing going for him.  &gt;all hinkie had to do in his last year was having a decent point guard  You're absolutely right.   It's all he had to do and instead he drafted Jahil Okafor, his third straight lottery C.   One of the big reasons given for his firing was that he refused to re-sign FA Ish Smith in the offseason and the team went 1-30 to start out the season. Then they had to crawl back and trade 2 seconds for him.  And Colangelo was a big part of that push to bring him back.   Then Colagelo was a big part of the clean up that needed to happen, dumping now-worthless assets like Nerlens and Okafor that Hinkie had held onto for too long.   Then Colangelo went out and got them viable #2, #3 and #4 scoring options in Butler, Harris and Redick."
all hinkie had to do in his last year was having a decent point guard so the team could be some what functional. Like when they got ish smith they were some what competitive.

I mean Russ had Alex Len as his starting center and Ish Smith as his backup PG
No Ish Smith mention smh my head
ish smith
Wiz fans been complaining about Ish Smith and Rolo being in lineups all year and its literally what got them into the playoffs.
His performance just last week against the hawks proves the wizards win in spite of him. Who tf plays ish Smith and Alex Len over Rui hachimora and Gafford for the final 8 minutes of a game when they‚Äôre both playing like trash?
ISH SMITH: IS A POINT GUARD
"I swear Ish has lowkey been a quality point guard for so long.   I have a weirdly vivid memory of watching a Pelicans game on opening night in 2015(?) where Ish Smith was legit their best player. AD was trash, whoever they started at PG was trash, Eric Gordon was trash, and Ish was out here trying to put the team on his back. Game was weird as hell.  Since then I've been on the ""Ish Smith should be a starting PG"" train, but he's still just continued to be a journeyman and never really gets the credit he deserves."
Idk if Ish Smith has the accolades to be praised that highly
24 assists with this roster is crazy üò≠ kicking out to Ish Smith

They didn't account for Ish Smith and Robin Lopez.
ish smith will win the wizards this game
he shouldn‚Äôt play a minute in the second half  ish smith better rn
i'm not totally sure if Bradley Beal in his current state is more productive to winning this game than Ish Smith
Wizards going to get the 8th seed from ish smith and robin lopez?
He did on Trae Young defense. Also played Ish Smith at the end. He just didn't play Gafford which was stupid.
"How do the Wizards broadcast team keep making these mistakes? First saying Westbrook is Isaiah Thomas, then listing Ish Smith as an NBA player, now this? I could do a better job"
"He's not a scrub, but Ish Smith always fucks us up"
"We owed a first round pick thanks to the Bynum trade the year before. Hinkie‚Äôs first offseason (2013) we had Jrue, the 11 pick, Thad Young, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, Lavoy Allen, Arnett Moultrie. I think that was it.  Hinkie left three years later and we had Embiid, Covington, the rights to Saric, Noel, Okafor, the upcoming first overall pick (Simmons), a Kings pick, TJ McConnell, a Lakers pick, a Kings pick swap, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Isaiah Canaan, a slew of extra second rounders, two more extra 2016 firsts (TLC and Korkmaz), Jakarr Sampson, Nik Stauskas, Ish Smith, Hollis Thompson. This was mostly from memory so I may have missed some stuff."
"I‚Äôve watched every game since I can remember. I watched a 10 win team that started players like Jakarr Sampson and Ish Smith. Heck Elton Brand was ON that 10 win team. If we consider this the process, it‚Äôs the damn process. It started with Embiid and then Simmons and it will end with those two. Not letting a Celtics fan tell me different. It fell apart in the middle because the NBA got involved. They needed to make an example out of the Sixers but have no issue with what‚Äôs really killing the league which is a lack of parity. Sixers figured out how to take a team from the bottom to the top while the rest of the league just kept forming super teams. If this team wins a championship, the 30 point blow outs just a few years ago will all be worth it as a fan. This has been the most fun rebuild I can remember and the best Sixers team of my life time for sure."
Ish Smith?
No. No.  Maybe we should trade him.  He's 23 he doesn't fit with our young core.  The Wizards are a good fit for him.  If we are lucky maybe we can get Garrison Matthews or Ish Smith in return.  If we are lucky of course.
