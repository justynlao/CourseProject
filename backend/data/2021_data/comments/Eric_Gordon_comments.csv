"I would say if Luka is the worst at this, then Eric Gordon is the universal master of every galaxy at this.   And this is coming from a Rockets die hard..."
Rockets fans always playing the victim. Ben Simmons Luka Doncic classified as PGs why would Harden get laughed at when playing next to Eric Gordon?
John Wall  Oladipo  Tate  Tucker  Wood  Eric Gordon  House  Nwaba  Mclemore  Cousins  Sterling brown  Mason jones  Kenyon martin jr  Dante exum  Kevin Porter Jr
"Man...Harden and Eric Gordon, every drive to the basket Gordon was yelling. He’s gotten better since we traded harden but it’s still irritating."
Y'all ever see Eric Gordon scream and whine during games? Is Luka worse than this?
Hey. HEY. That title belongs to Eric Gordon.
I just don't see the argument for that era of houston teams being contenders without Harden. They would have struggled to be a playoff team.  The last 4 or 5 seasons harden was averaging 30~ a game with 8 assists. Those houston teams had harden scoring 35 a game and then Eric Gordon or Clint Capela pitching in their 15. I just don't see the argument that houston without Harden was a perennial playoff team that had a bunch of guys stepping up. It's just not factual.
"Much different when that team has players like Eric Gordon, Oladipo, Wall and Christian Wood"

KG yelling out Eric Gordon was a “trash ass (expletive)” while sitting on the bench in a suit is fine but when Klay says something of the same nature with more family friendly language then it’s a big problem lol
Didnt we beat you guys last season with only eric gordon?
"do they still pick up Mo Williams in season?  this is like absolute peak physical lebron, I mean 09-10 cavs won SIXTY games behind bron and not much else. Rookie Blake gives you as much as 09 Jameson (more honestly), Kaman gives you  bout as much as 09-10 Shaq, depending on this scenario he's still runnin w/ mo williams  PLUS they got Eric Gordon playin about as well as he ever did, and old hat BD who could still give ya something here and there (especially if he had bron to play off of)  now that 60 wins was seriously inflated by an incredibly weak east, but even still in the west probly wins round 50  i think he does bout as well with the clips  I don't think he's getting them above spurs, lakers, mavs, but probably challenging thunder for 4th seed"
The only worry is he's an FA and someone could pay him if he's any good for us. I'd prefer someone already tied down. I like Eric Gordon and he's a good fit but he's definitely going to be unhappy with his limited role for us.
"To be fair, the 2018 Rockets were a masterclass in roster construction. One of the best PG defenders of all time in CP3, a good wing defender in Ariza, a junkyard dog in Tucker, Capela to hold it down inside, an underrated guard defender in Eric Gordon, and Prince Luc to provide defensive versatility off the bench. This Nets team is not constructed very well from a defensive standpoint."
... eric gordon?
"Eric Gordon is the biggest sook, plus be looks like a man baby too"
"If social media is any indication, Dinwiddie also doesn't want to be in New Orleans, and as he's currently injured. I wouldn't risk another Eric Gordon scenario."
Eric Gordon loses his mind every time he drives to the hoop. Love the guy but he loses his mind constantly lol
"Besides being injured, Dinwiddie has repeatedly expressed displeasure with the idea of being traded to the Pelicans on social media. After the whole Eric Gordon fiasco, I'm not exactly eager to bring in an injured guy who doesn't want to be here."
Kyle Lowry and Eric Gordon
"My favorite was them saying something like “played a lot of games in Houston, a lot more than he played here” about Eric Gordon."
My favorite was them talking about how many games Eric Gordon has played here  opposed to when he was there.
Eric Gordon screams the loudest on every drive.
They really need to use that trade exception to acquire Eric Gordon or Vucevic
"Uh no. Not at all. First of all that medical staff had no problems with rehab. In fact it was probably the single thing they were ever good at because they had so much experience in it. But also they made legit one major mistake (Breaux’s leg injury). Eric Gordon just didn’t give a shit. He was a lazy, selfish, unprofessional piece of shit. So yeah we’re gunna continue to hate that peanut head fuck. Fuck him and his dumbass brother. That’s why he can’t read."
cause fuck eric gordon
"He shit on this city. This city will love anybody who loves it back, but we will *never* forgive somebody who disrespects it. Ask Junior Gallete about that.   He also fucked around with his injury rehab for *years* to screw us over, didn’t play hard when he was on the court, and was just a general asshole for his entire tenure here.   If Eric Gordon wasn’t a dick, the AD era wouldn’t have been nearly as bad as it was."
DJ Augustin  Eric Gordon  Danny Green  Jae Crowder  Mason Plumlee  Actually has solid spacing and is solid defensively.
Right? Lol I blame the front office more for failing to bring in offensive talent before Rose tore his ACL. Rip Hamilton and Carlos Boozer just didn’t cut it and Butler was way too early on and defensive-focused at the time. Rose was basically the entire offense. If we got Melo it would’ve been better or even Eric Gordon.  Thibs definitely got the fall for the inept and toxic FO
I didn’t say shooting 3s was bad. I said watching a bunch of 30% 3 point shooters chuck 40 3s a game isn’t fun. While watching the rockets game yesterday Eric Gordon just wouldn’t stop chucking
"Can you do Harden, Cp3 and Eric Gordon? I have a feeling EG ouplayed Cp3."

"If Eric Gordon is a great defender, so is Harden lol"
Is Eric Gordon considered a great defender?
eric gordon is almost as shitty as tucker. stop passing him the ball and rockets win
Eric Gordon chucking the lead away
Eric Gordon has resting stank face.
"havnt really paid attention before, has eric gordon\`s three always been that flat?"
This man Eric Gordon has the funniest dribble style of all time when he starts to size up
This league is too soft for Eric Gordon!
"Demarcus Cousins, or Eric Gordon. I guess it depends on the day"
harden make eric gordon and tucker look really good huh
"Rockets throwing it away so easily. Wall out of bounds, Eric Gordon to a Blazer, Cousins to a Blazer. Need some security"
"that's the beauty of having Morey.  could be anything.   Never thought he'd turn JRich and Horford into Curry and Green.  Gave us space on floor and out of cap hell(sort of) in the first month here was here.   my guess would be something like George Hill to run point and shoot some 3's.   PJ Tucker to sure up bench.   That doesn't get them to the finals, but it does balance out things and gives them a shot.   Maybe even Eric Gordon.    Idk.  Lowry would be nice, but don't see it money wise.   Plus Raptors are going to be fine and make the playoffs."
"And I’m saying he’s played with complete freedom and had plenty of chances to expand his role or make his name more known, but he’s just not consistent so he was in a role where he didn’t need to be efficiently scoring night in and night out and didn’t have the pressure to carry the load and I think it elevated his game more than it hurt it. I don’t think Eric Gordon is any better than he gets credit for and I watch him almost every single game. He can pop off for 50 but he can also go 2 months shooting 30% from 3 while taking 8 a night. The only part of his game that i don’t see get enough credit is his defense, he’s also very good at not going ice cold come post season, but as a player overall he is very very streaky."
Eric Gordon and it's even worse cause of the stupid face he does
THJ is currently the 2nd option on a hurt Mavs team.  Clarkson is a bonafide 6MOTY candidate yearly. Not a role player.  Eric Gordon is on a trash team so his stats don’t matter.  Malik Beasley is on the worst team in the league rn so his stats don’t matter as well. No player who puts up 18 on a good team is a role player.  AD has a career average of 67.2% if his FG assisted. So that stat means absolutely fuck all. Hunter doesn’t have to create on his own because he has Trae fucking Young on his team.
"Plenty of role players average 18. Hardaway JR is 17.6, Clarkson is 17.9, Eric Gordon is 18, Malik Beasley is 19.9. Bonafide role players. Points per game over a 18 game sample size doesn't really mean anything.   69.5% of Hunter's shots are assisted, for example. Jaylen Brown, who just made the jump out of the role player group, is sitting at 52.6 assist rate. Those things and stuff like the eye test are more important in determining whether someone is a role player rather than raw ppg.   Being a role player isn't a big diss or anything. They make up the majority of players and good role players are absolutely needed to have a successful team. But stars are needed more. Having a star on your team always takes precedence over having a role player. Hunter is a very good player, but he's ultimately a role player.   If I'm building a team from scratch, and my choice to start the team is between Zion and Hunter, it's a quick answer from me."
Eric Gordon
Easily Eric Gordon
Warriors send Oubre to Houston for PJ Tucker. Bulls give them Otto Porter jr for Eric Gordon
"Was there, cried for kobe, and then cried when we couldn't stop Eric gordon"
"Expecting Eric Gordon, a career 42.5% (51.4% eFG) shooter, to maintain an eFG 5% higher than his career average, and 3% higher than league average, is a pretty big gamble.  Of the Rockets 16 games so far, only 5 have been against .500 or better teams, and they're 0-5 in those games.  So I wouldn't put much stock into their defensive rating right now."
"&gt;No way Eric Gordon would be able to shoot 56% from the field  He shot 54% a couple years ago, and has been over 52% several times ( all effective ).  56 would be a career-high, but a lot of guys are shooting career-highs this year.  &gt; Where's the defense on your hypothetical Rockets team?    The Rockets are presently 4th in defensive rating.  You can look this up, ya know."
"&gt; Let's also say that...Eric Gordon continues to post 18 points on 56% shooting  Why would we say this when it clearly isn't going to happen? Besides the fact that he's actually 46% right now, he's a career 42.5% shooter.  Also, who do you suppose will be playing defence?"
"Can't believe I'm watching a Rockets team, that on the same year Harden was on it, is now playing with:  Wall/Oladipo/Gordon backcourt.  Healthy Boogie able to put up 20/10 and it not be a surprise.  Shit is crazy. All these guys with so many injury problems. Especially Boogie, so many people wrote him off since he looked like a corpse in recent times coming off injuries and then getting reinjured.   Eric Gordon with his 500 injuries in his career, Wall and Oladipo with the major ones recently."
Eric Gordon!
"Idk. The rockets aren't really in a position to put a competitive team around Simmons. Idk how many picks/Swaps that was offered with him, but if you add simons to the current rockets they are not a competitor or close to it.  Wall  Simmons  Gordon/House  Tucker/Tate  Wood/Boogie  That lineup is rough. They seriously lack spacing and would have a Max and Supermax spot locked up for the next two years since I doubt anyone else wants to pay wall 41 million. Throw in Eric Gordon's contract and that is almost another 20 million locked up for I think 3 more years. During that time it would be hard to attract free agents, but we would be a back end of lottery or playoff team not able to add talent consistently through the draft.  I think I would rather have cap flexibility and a bunch of picks moving forward than Ben Simmons a guy that needs a very particular team around him to be his best, a team that we couldnt provide for at least two years."

"Eric Gordon.  Not even Rockets fans appreciate him.  He could probably be an All-Star in the East, but he just settles in to his role and does what he can to help the team.  His frequent injuries make folks think he's pretty worthless, too. But when healthy he is really good.  His game is very well-rounded, too."

Man averaged 22/3/3 on 45/36/82.5 splits (57% TS) as a 22 year old shooting guard playing next to young Blake for 64 games.

"We are missing Maxi and Porzingis who would be covering Demarcus, there's literally no chance he would be popping off like this if we had someone that could actually guard him.  Our two best wing defenders in DFS and Josh Richardson are also out so Eric Gordon wouldn't be feasting like this either.   I don't know how many times in the game threads we have to keep saying that 3 of our starters who are also our best defenders are out with Porzingis sitting this one. Are you sure you're a Mavs fan? You seem like you have no idea what you're talking about"
clippers eric gordon
Eric Gordon playing like he's going against Utah
Eric Gordon is infuriating to me.  He whines to the refs more than almost anyone in the league.  He does not show up in clutch moments despite being the 3rd offensive option during the Harden years.   Gordon never got any of the blame for the Rockets' failures in the playoffs.  Enjoy the 19 mil per year contract you are on because I am still pissed I have to watch you continually under perform every year.
The Lakers ran a box and one on Eric Gordon when Harden was off and Westbrook was on during the playoffs last year
"Dude, just say you dont watch the rockets and move on.   &amp;#x200B;  MDA's first year the rockets were very good, but there was no ""eventually Harden got his way"" because after finishing with the third best offense in MDA's first year, CP3 joined the Rockets the second year. That and the addition of PJ Tucker and Harden buying in on defense jumped the Rockets even higher. The third year, CP3, Eric Gordon, and Capela all missed significant time forcing Harden to go on The Ungaurdable Tour. I'm sorry you think he was better off letting Austin Rivers, Kenneth Farid, and James Ennis take those shots instead (since they started games in place of the injured starters). Finally, after CP3 was dealt for Westbrook, which was never given a chance do to a unique bubble tournament, Westbrook wasnt able to get into the flow with the Rockets. He then demands a trade because of the culture when he has no friends except for Spalding. Harden sees the Rockets have no chance at winning and demands a trade. From that point on he did act unprofessional but to act as if Harden ran this franchise into the ground, you aren't just wrong, but completely oblivious to the real world."
"Rockets fan should be pissed at Eric Gordon. Dude is overpaid and playing like shit. Inconsistency has always been his problem and getting injuries. The dude takes the stupidest 3s when he’s not making it, shooting two or three steps behind the line.  I laugh when commentators for the game say he’s an good 3 point shooter."

"I fear no man but that guy, &lt;insert Eric Gordon here&gt; he scares me"
that’s KCP I was referring to Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon
Christian wood is better than DJ and PJ tucker is better than that other guy. That's not even taking guys like Eric Gordon into account.
Eric Gordon still around. Hell maybe we can even get a vintage CP3 performance if they face each other in the playoffs.
Based off last year:  1. Bogdan 2. Fournier 3. Caris Levert 4. Danny Green 5. Eric Gordon 6. Gary Harris
Caris LeVert - Highest ceiling out of anyone on here but meh from 3-point land and injury concerns   Evan Fournier - Always been high on him; I think he gives you 80% of what Jaylen Brown does   Bogdan Bogdanovic - Solid as your secondary ballhandler but having a down year and defense isn't great  Hard to rank the last 3 guys: Eric Gordon / Danny Green / Gary Harris. All of them are decent defenders but streaky shooters.
1. Eric Gordon  2. Evan Fournier  3. Danny Green  4. Caris LeVert  5. Gary Harris  6. Bogdan Bogdanovic  Downvote me and tell me I’m wrong. I don’t care
"Booker this season is playing on the same level as Eric Gordon. He really needs to step it up. Otherwise, they'll keep blowing leads like this..."
Eric Gordon would be an awesome trade deadline piece for a contender to add
lmao Harden treating these boys like Pj Tucker &amp; Eric Gordon
Honestly think I would pick Eric Gordon over Gordon Hayward for Indiana
"Everyone says Giannis this Giannis that. But between 2013-2019. Giannis also only makes the playoffs 2 times with that organization.   And I am not going to blame the Pelicans for all of it but man did they have the worst luck. Players either were injured or didn’t play good.   Boogie, Jrue missed a good amount, Tyreek evaporatored, Eric Gordon actively tanked his value to get out, etc."
"hold on  &amp;#x200B;  how?  &amp;#x200B;  Who on his team was better than who the Warriors had? Just because your guys weren't playing well doesn't mean that they weren't better than who Harden had.  &amp;#x200B;  Post-achilles, 2 year layoff Wall, undrafted Christian Wood, completely washed Cousins, Eric Gordon who's been shooting sub 30% from 3 for 2 years, and 36 year old PJ Tucker are supposed to be better than Draymond Green, Oubre, and Wiggins?  &amp;#x200B;  like, you're using an extremely small sample size and drawing some fuckin weird comparisons from it"
We are down to gift you guys Eric Gordon and John Wall.
"Ok, would you rather Eric Gordon or PJ Tucker be taking those shots? I mean, give me a break"
"Chinese nicknames are the best lol.  Eric Gordon is ""Pi Mamba"" because his face is apparently so perfectly round you can use it to calculate pi"
Nah bro. He’s a great defender   You prolly don’t even watch him play. How can you be so confident in that take?  Are you basing it off of other peoples perception of him or actual eye test?  You can’t watch Eric Gordon play and say he’s a below average defender at best.
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.

Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
1 Eric Gordon please
It's not Eric Gordon unless he has a yearly knee injury that makes him miss a month.
"They’ve gotta move Eric Gordon while they can, I’d say there’s a very real chance that this is the last time that contract is positive value."
Eric Gordon
"Yeah I just replied to the other guy saying the same thing. The only players I see taking advantage is good and tall wing defenders like Kawhi/Simmons/PG. And maybe small and stocky guys like Eric Gordon, FVV but idk probably not by much."
"&gt;Dude do you really think we have good shooters?  Before the season with Westbrook, the worst 3pt shooter on the Rockets that had significant minutes were Eric Gordon and he even shot 36%. So yes, Rockets do have good shooters. Harden obviously made them better but the Rockets surrounded Harden with decent to good shooters. I mean the entire 2018 Rockets team shot 36% from 3's on an insane attempts."
"umm $18.5m for Eric Gordon is great  Heat, Celtics, 76ers, Nuggets, would all trade for him in an instant"
"Very similar mannerisms, and to reference the Eric Gordon circle head theory post from a few days ago, it looks like their main difference is the ovaluarity of Hart’s face vs the distinct circular tendencies of Murray’s head!"
"This is why guys like PJ Tucker, Danuel House, Ben Mclemore and Eric Gordon didn't get offended with his comments compared to the new guys John Wall and Boogie Cousins. He gave them everything he could"
"I wouldn’t classify Curry as the “ultimate ceiling raiser” and this season is proving that. Warriors are 8-13 against +500 teams which is 4th worst in the conference and the warriors have been blown out on multiple occasions. Curry relies on Kerr’s system too much and that why we see this team so non-agressive when Curry doesn’t hit his shots.  I’d classify Harden and LeBron as ceiling raisers because they have found success with lesser rosters in the past. Sure, harden never won a title with Houston but the man didn’t have a solid team and co-star until 2017-2018 which is a year that was looking like a victory for him before CP went down. post back injury “I still want my touches” Dwight Howard doesn’t count in my book. Especially when Houston’s most successful season with him was when he missed 41 games that season.  The Rockets are dog shit right now and injuries have def been a factor but Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Ben Mac, Danuel House, all look like shells of themselves without Harden controlling the offense. I feel you could swap Curry for Harden in 2015 and the warriors still win that title. Does Harden have a historic season in 2016 like Curry? Probably not but harden is too smart and good of a basketball player to not be successful under Kerr’s season with 3 all stars on his team (talking bout Iggy)."
Well then he's still wrong. LeBron would have no shot against Eric Gordon and Gerald Green in a 7-game series.
Eric Gordon
What if he was talking about Eric Gordon and Gerald Green?
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
damn lol crazy to think about how it was harden and eric gordon in a game 7 against one of the most stacked teams of all time
"By Jokic and Harden? Yeah that will happen. When the Jazz match Gobert's minutes with Jokic or Harden, of course the defensive numbers will be better when Gobert comes off along with Jokic and Harden, who get replaced by... Mason Plumlee and Eric Gordon  The Jazz were still better with Gobert on the floor than not. And considering he played 30 MPG in 2019 and 38 MPG in 2020, the sample size with Gobert *off* the floor is pretty small"
"Wed shit all over the jazz. Eric Gordon made mitchell his bitch and locked him up, gobert couldn’t do shit on switches and capella was fine on your guards, and you guys tried to sell out so hard on harden by guarding him from behind because you were scared of gobert having to defend outside 3 feet. Harden and Paul would run circles around the jazz, mike conley isn’t turning a back to back 4-1 loss into a series win"
I would give him a 2 year 50 million team option on second year mainly because of the decline of his game mixed with injuries. He’s not max worthy but he’s still worth at least 20 million a year considering players like Eric gordon are getting like 18 mil a year.
I think you win. Not even Eric Gordon Hayward could compete with that.
&gt; do people still think Dwight is good?  Depends how many more blowouts on national tv there are for Dwight to eat vs backups in garbage time like last night   What about Danny green for Eric Gordon? I would do it if I were houston. It’s a gamble if your Philly that contract could end up sucking again as soon as next year. But i think Gordon would help them more than Danny
Dude eric gordon has locked rudy the fuck up lol doesn’t mean anything
"Jrue Holiday... constantly one of the most underrated players in the league. Eric Gordon who just mailed it in in NOLA and suddenly became integral for the Rockets. Rajón Rondo in the playoffs. Boogie Cousins before his achilles robbed him. Nikola Mirotic who was solid. The big misses were Omer Asik's disease, Solomon Hill &amp; Etwaun Moore overpays. Stop acting like because we ain't have a top 2 all time player to pair with him that we had horrible roster construction. Boogie doesn't get hurt and the Pels are a force for the next 5 years.   Oh well. Seeing how him and Toni forced their way out, I'm happy with the core we have now. Top 15 3&amp;D guard and solid backup big away from having a force. With the assets to move whenever that guard becomes available and BI / Zion / Zo start hitting their peak."
You mean an injury prone Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson?
"Need the role/support players we sign/trade for to stop shitting themselves immediately upon landing at MSY.  It started with Eric fucking Gordon and continues today with Eric fucking Bledsoe. We’ve done some dumbass things to ourselves like Ajinca but man. Really doesn’t help when you go to the FA market, pay market price, then the player throws a hissy fit because he has to leave LA/Boston/Miami to play in New Orleans.   Not the Bledsoe is doing this - he’s just sucking big time lately - but Eric Gordon man. Fuck Eric Gordon."
Eric Gordon screams like he's being stabbed.    There's some natural grunts here and there but he actually screams like Tom from Tom and Jerry whenever Jerry whallops his tail with a mallet or something.  Literally believe it leads to him receiving less calls because it's *that* obnoxious.
"I always felt it was less a Harden thing, and more of the Eric Gordon or PJ Tucker type having career games against the Jazz."
As long as he isn’t matched up against Eric Gordon...
He had Chris Paul &amp; Eric Gordon
"What? I'm not talking about bench. I'm talking about the 2nd option on offense, which for a couple years was either like fucking Patrick Beverley or Eric Gordon. CP3 got injured, Westbrook was hurt and sucked balls. He's had some damn good playoff series when he's had adequate support, but some really bad ones when teams could throw 2-3 guys on him with little impunity because there was no way to punish them for it."
"What? I'm not talking about bench. I'm talking about the 2nd option on offense, which for a couple years was either like fucking Patrick Beverley or Eric Gordon.

He's had some damn good playoff series when he's had adequate support, but some really bad ones when teams could throw 2-3 guys on him with little impunity because there was no way to punish them for it."
Because he's scored 30 and 35 ppg on elite efficiency against the Warriors and the Lakers in the playoffs now and most of the playoffs his 2nd option was either injured or Eric Gordon
"Yeah, that's definitely pretty average in today's NBA. Amongst the 28 players this season attempting at least 7 threes per game he's 25th for 3P% (behind Beal, Oladipo and Eric Gordon). He shoots a high volume tho so it boosts things up."
"Harden getting double teamed, then dishing to Eric Gordon or PJ Tucker."
"Maybe it's my ""Pelicans being forced to trade for Eric Gordon"" experience, but unhappy players are not productive players."
"No way Morey is giving up Maxey if he was the piece that stopped the 6ers from trading for Harden.  Green for Eric Gordon would be a good trade for Philly if they are down on Danny though. Not sure what else they would have to throw in (prospect? pick?), but Morey obviously loves the guy and he is playing at a really high level."
Three point sniper Eric Gordon is shooting 10% from 3 this game.
I feel like we're on year 4 of Eric Gordon taking and not making his deep 3s.  Someone needs to give him an intervention.
"Where does Eric Gordon rank in terms of non-stars who complain all freaking game long? Like dude stfu you didn't get fouled, go play defense."
"Kevon looney has started 5 games out of the 21 he’s played in and averaged 14 MPG.  Wiseman plays more and has proven he has range from deep 2/even three. Draymond can’t shoot but I’d suspect they’d just use him on the screen and roll with harden every time.  Oubre is at 32% but it should go up after a horrible start, and it’s not like harden hasn’t played with guys shooting that poorly and still succeeded, see eric Gordon 31% for the 2020 season.  Wiggins is at 37% on 5 threes a game which is just fine. He does get guarded. Bazemore is at 43% and Lee is at 38%. You’re greatly exaggerating. These warriors minus steph are nothing harden can’t work with, he’s worked with worse before"
Eric Gordon is kinda nice defensively on guards
"in that stretch when he averaged 40+ ppg for months we had lots of injuries and cp3, capela and eric gordon were out. i would argue that at that time our roster was 100% worse than the wizards are now but we were still well above .500"
"Eric ""Pi Mamba"" Gordon"
What about Eric Gordon?
"&gt; Jokic has never lost more than 40.   Quite literally not true. Won 33 games his first season. You discount Gallo for health reasons but don't recognize Eric Gordon's? Gordon was not very good with AD. Jrue is solid but always a bit overrated and if your third guy to prove how great of a cast he has is Evan Turner then you're failing something big.   If you go year by year AD didn't underacheive.    In year one he won 27 games with Gordon only playing 40 games and shooting an eye catching 40% from the field.     He went 34-48 in year two with trash Tyreke Evans and Eric Gordon who was a bit better but still not good. Jrue was solid but only played 34 games.     YEar three ran it back and won 45 games. Gordon regressed further again and shot 41% from the field and 38% from within the three point line. Again, the Eric Gordon he played with is not the same guy HArden played with. Again tho Jrue only played 40 games and Gordon played 60.    Year four he won 30 games where again he had little to no help and a wave on injuries. Tyreke played 25 games, Jrue played 65 (only started 23), AD played 61, Gordon played 45. This season was a straight up mess with injuries throughout the roster and some truly awful lineups.    Year five he won 34 games with Jrue, Davis and 17 games worth of Boogie. Solomon Hill had the second most minutes played on this team and Et'wan Moree had the fourth most. Team was not good by any stretch.    Year 6 he won 48 even with Boogie going down. That team was rolling pre injury and I don't think there's any way they don't get to 50-55 wins if he stays healthy. That's also the one Jrue year where he played 65+ games. This year AD led them to a victory against the trailblazers in an embarrassing series for lillard. Jrue and Rondo played huge roles on that team, but AD was clearly the best player.   Year 7 AD's cast was back to being crap (just Jrue as Randle was still a negative), he complained and asked for a trade. He played 56 games and the team won 33 games total. Jrue played 67 games.  With the execption of the Boogie year where AD almost won 50 games I don't see a single instance where Jokic hasn't had a better supporting cast. If we throw out Jokic's first season where he average 10/7/2 (I'm a nice guy) his other seasons where he had a higher win total he had a better supporting cast. His 40 win season was his weakest cast but I'll take Gallo, Harris, Barton, Chandler any day of the week over the pelicans cast.  After that he added Murray and Paul Millsap.    &gt;He is the best #2 since Pippen but as a #1 option there is no evidence his teams would be much more than lower seed playoff fodder.  I mean Pippen was for sure a top 10 player so I don't see your point. Pippen&gt;AD&gt;&gt;Jokic."
"Meanwhile Embiid's getting swept in the 1st round by the Celts   And before you say ""SIMMONS WAS INJURED"", AD's team was injured every year in NOLA, from guys like Jrue to Eric Gordon to Boogie going down but he still put up better numbers than Embiid against much tougher teams in the West.  Embiid on those NOLA teams ain't even makin the playoffs most of the time, lmao."
"He won less than 40 games the majority if his time in New Orleans. Jokic has never lost more than 40. Even as a 21 year ild when the team was a bunch of kids, a never healthy Gallo and an about to retire Jameer Nelson.  In fact, that team would have made the playoffs if Jokic haf been the starter all year instead of us running the twin towers experiment all year.   People act like AD had no talent in New Orleans but that's not really the case. Eric Gordon, Jrue, Evan Turner among others. They def had some injuries issues but the amount of games they won during that era is still flat embarassing for a guy that people try and claim is a top 3 NBA player."
Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon is not an isolation scorer that will put us over the top for a chip lol
I was thinking Eric Gordon
"Lmfaoo i can def see why, for some reason just the rockets always have your #, I rmemeber Eric Gordon went off for like 55 last season on y’all like damn, and harden becomes god when he plays the Jazz. I still feel like that Rockets series is what has propelled Donovan to start hitting that next level, we saw it in the playoffs and we saw it tonight I think he can be a superstar soon"
"One of the best coaches and GM in the league, MVP Harden, Point God CP3, 6th man of the year Eric Gordon, Clint Capela, Austin Rivers, PJ Tucker and solid role-players. How is that team not stacked? They could have won the championship if it wasn’t for the Warriors superteam with 2 MVPs."
The Eric Gordon 4-12 Fg 3-9 from 3
"Now let's add context since you're just looking at statlines.   Give a team 2 weeks of doing nothing except game planning against him because they weren't worried about *checks notes* Jeremy Lin stepping up, and you're gonna see things like this happen.    Or no torn up shoulder, completely checked out Dwight Howard was gonna magically become Hakeem to take defensive attention off him? Nah it was gonna be future Hall of fame Eric Gordon that was help remove focus on Harden."
Yeah there have been tons of players beside AD that have been better than Eric Gordon /s
"&gt;  Eric Gordon (who was one of the Pelicans best players for years)  lol, this is #1 on the list of ""Things To Say To Prove You Dont Know Anything About the Pels""  We literally boo him every time he comes back to NOLA, more than we do AD."
"How is that entirely wrong?   Look at who signed with New Orleans during AD’s entire tenure there.   They didn’t have many assets, and letting someone like Eric Gordon (who was one of the Pelicans best players for years) walk for nothing would also kill them.   Certain teams can afford to lose guys and not worry. You can critique the signings they made, but at the same time if they didn’t sign some of the guys they did they would have been even worse. Also ignoring things like getting DeMarcus Cousins shows that you aren’t being objective either."
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
"They absolutely could have, but Jrue is a better fit next to Giannis and young enough to play with Giannis for the next 4-5 years. Jrue is a good defender and doesn't need the ball in his hands.  He's a shooter.  The other guy they wanted was Bogdan, another shooter.  Paul is more of an on-ball guy and would have taken the ball away from Giannis (which maybe wasn't a bad thing since it would have given them a second option in the half-court when Giannis was sitting?)  It wasn't insane, they were trying to surround Giannis with 4 shooters (Lopez, Middleton, Bogdan, and Holiday) and then run everything through Giannis which is exactly what everyone told them to do.  IDK, maybe they can still get Eric Gordon?  He should be available and shouldn't cost the moon. He's still young enough to pair with the other guys. He's not too expensive either.  Maybe Oladipo?"
more like Joe Harris is who Eric Gordon thinks he is
"Sorry 6 games you’re right, he played 5/6 games. Tough to win against an all time great *team* when your second best player is Eric Gordon"
"What do you mean? Eric Gordon has never committed a foul in his life, or so he believes"
Eric Gordon no calls are my favorite
Eric Gordon
"I mean, his own teammate Eric Gordon knew he didn’t really mean it and just wanted a change of scenery. I think the media would be more upset over that than anything."
"&gt;is more of a facilitator.  You do realize he led the league in assists in Houston playing with guys like Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Ryan Anderson, right?  His FTr was sky high (.561) in 2012 (last year in OKC) through 2017 (only drop off being 2016 when Houston sucked... Partly because refs were never giving him calls). In 2018 and 2019 it drops like a rock (.472) which is only about 3% higher than where it is now.  Swear to God 99% of people are stuck in 2015 memes and have no clue how much this man has been balling out the last 4 seasons."

"Have you ever heard of a trap game? The Jazz lost games like this all the time, even last year. Fucking James Harden sits against us and Eric Gordon scores 50. This Clippers team was still playing good basketball for 3 quarters. And yes, they would have beat half the league tonight including the woefully incompetent Pistons."
Ya Eric Gordon is a bucket or bust in any game it’s weird but yeah I get you they missed all the important dudes who know their roles. But pj I think is highly overrated man isn’t even that good of a defender anymore and can’t even make open 3s anymore we saw it all of last year. His age hitting him
"PJs value is his defense, every team would want a player like him, they also don't have Eric Gordon in that game too.."
That fucking Eric Gordon 50 point game
Eric Gordon is bad
&gt;Why would a team take Eric Gordon for free without assets on top?  Pretty sure the Celtics do it in a heartbeat. Their TPE is gonna expire and adding someone like Gordon ensures theyll have salary matching capabilites in the near future if they need to make a trade for a third guy next to the BJays. He would also become their 3rd/4th best player right now. Also Gordon is averaging 19 ppg on 47/35/84 with experience playing in big games. He's not a scrub.
Why would a team take Eric Gordon for free without assets on top? There’s also only a few TPEs that he can even fit into
"nah if the plan is to let Oladipo walk then Levert is more valuable 100/100 times  Levert doesn’t put them into the luxury tax next season, and Eric Gordon could be traded into a teams TPE or for a player making less which opens up even more cap space while also getting them some draft capital"
"Which isn't helping them win games now and is a total crapshoot that expires in one year.  If they end up with the corpse of Lamarcus Aldridge instead of a Harrison Barnes or Eric Gordon, they'll regret it."
"Eh, could still use an offball wing like Eric Gordon or PJ Tucker"
"&gt; we're taking the league's least 3 pointers at the lowest percentage.  For comparison, there are 12 players in the league who are attempting more 3s than your starting backcourt *combined* and 3 more players who are attempting the same number of 3s.  Sexland are collectively attempting 7.7 3s per game. That's the same number as Davis Bertans or Eric Gordon, who are both primarily bench players this season."
"They're saying Eric Gordon is *technically* a 6th man, and he has better stats then JC. However, minutes-wise, he's a starter."
Nah we’re gonna trade Eric “50 against Utah” Gordon for his bum ass
"Eric gordon, THJ"
Would be Eric Gordon but the rockets suck rn
"Has anyone else noticed the amount of love Harden is getting ever since he left Houston? Lol  But yeah, this was when CP3, Eric Gordon, and ext were hurt. The Rockets were 11th in the West and everyone thought Houston was crashing down. Then Harden went on this crazy streak and literally carried us back to the 6th seed in the West.  He’s should’ve won the MVP because of this streak, but it occurred early in the season and everyone brushed it off like it didnt happen."
Eric Gordon should be in the discussion imo.
Wouldn’t you rather have Eric Gordon?
Eric Gordon 2.0?
"Otto Porter I think would be very gettable and wouldnt cost enough for Danny to balk. But not sure they would want to pay as much as that would cost tax wise for this team which still likely wouldnt be good enough vs the top teams. Im probably not as high on the idea of Harrison Barnes as others for what will be the price.   Would you do Eric Gordon for that exception? $17 mil, you are gambling for sure 2 more yrs after this one on that contract but he's been good this year. He doesnt perfectly fit what they need but he would help.   John Collins is the other name I would actually legitimately consider in a trade with how he's improved on defense. Problem is he still isnt truly a 5 at the end of the day."
"This is like the 2nd year of his career on a losing team, and the 1st was his rookie year where his best teammates were Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman"
At least he hasn’t reached Eric Gordon levels of “Don’t want to be here”. Which isn’t saying better.
Yeah true. Just sucks that Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson were the best shooters they were ever able to procure.
KP reminds me of a 7”3 Latvian Eric Gordon with his quick trigger
Eric Gordon would help you guys
Eric Gordon was the only guy he had on that team consistently that could be considered a good shooter. They had other shooters that either didn’t play or harden made average shooters (like mclemore and Covington) look better with open looks.
Eric Gordon already takes most of his threes way behind the line.
Eric Gordon won 6MOY and the Three Point contest so I’d say forsure he helped on that as well.

Pi Mamba (or Round-head Mamba) = Eric Gordon
His best teammate in 16-17 was Eric Gordon...
This dude was like a 5 game hot shooting streak from Eric Gordon away from comparing EG to JJ Watt.
"lmao i remember that game, kuz had 37 or something. shades of eric gordon dropping 50 on the jazz when westbrook and harden were out"
"The Rockets only have 2 players left who were on the team last year (Eric Gordon and Danuel House) who are both injured (groin and ankle sprain).  And for what it’s worth, Gordon had a really good chance of getting traded this deadline if he didn’t get hurt, and House was involved in some trade rumors too 🤣"
It's a tribute to Eric Gordon.
"I think Eric Gordon had to be trolling there. Nobody could make that writing sound good, so he hammed it up."
See Clippers Eric Gordon
Cam Johnson is more like Eric Gordon if we're using these comparisons
What did Eric Gordon act (badly) in?
Eric Gordon
Man you guys should trade for Eric Gordon this offseason. Dude locks up Donovan Mitchell every game
Straight up.  Fuck Eric Gordon.
Fuck Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon
2019 hardens best teammate was eric gordon while steph had a terrible series..
"HE shot 24% from 3, not his team. On his volume, that's inexcusable...he was much less efficient than Eric Gordon in the 2018 WCF by pretty much every shooting metric, go look up the stats yourself.   Harden gets every excuse possible to dismiss his inability to elevate himself and his team in the playoffs...do we even need to go back to 2015 and relive how badly he was outplayed by Curry? Cause I don't think anyone magically lifted Steph's arms in the 2015 WCF and willed his shots to go in so he could average 31ppg against a 56 win Rockets team that year."
"2018 regular season yeah, Harden was the best player in the league...but playoffs? No fucking way.   2018 Lebron shouldn't even be compared to 2018 playoffs Harden...Harden got bailed out in the second round against the Jazz by CP3s insanely efficient shooting, then went into the WCF and shot 24% from 3 and worse overall shooting splits than Eric Gordon by a large margin..."
"Best 3P% season vs. 2nd best vs. 3rd best  * Draymond: 38.8% – 33.7% – 33.3% * Flip Murray: 36.0% – 31.7% – 31.2% * Mike James: 44.2% – 38.6% – 38.4% * Eric Gordon: 44.8% – 39.1% – 38.9% * Aaron Holiday: 39.4% – 34.1% – 33.9% * Roddy Beaubois: 40.9% – 30.1% – 29.2%  Didn't run some kind of advanced search, just a couple guys off the top of my head."
"As they should. They assembled a super duper team. Anything less would be somewhat embarrassing, that’s the pressure they are under and i assume they are cool with it. Harden has Kyrie as a THIRD option to rely on this year. Not Eric Gordon."
Lol at one point CP3 was injured and Harden’s second best player was washed Ryan Anderson. No Eric Gordon either. Rockets still made playoffs.
"&gt;Harden  The Rockets in 2015-16 were pretty bad (Dwight had started to decline). Trevor Ariza as his 2nd best player along with Dwight. Pat Bev as third best player?   Even last year, the Rockets beat the Thunder with Harden having a pretty terrible supporting cast. Eric Gordon and Robert Covington were probably the next 2 best players (and see how terrible they look without Harden). I mean the team fell apart without Danuel House. Westbrook was an absolute disaster in the playoffs.   Harden because of his style can minimize the negative impact of the supporting cast better than Steph can.   Apart from 2017-18 Harden never had a great supporting cast (CP3 had a weird decline in 2018-19)."
"Let’s look at their 5 season scoring peaks. From 2009-14, KD averaged 29.3 a game on 49/38/89 splits (which is a TS% of .617) and won 4 scoring titles. His single season scoring peak was in 2013-14 when he averaged 32 a game on 50/39/87 splits (.635 TS%).   Harden’s 5 year scoring peak from 2015-20 saw him averaging 31.7 a game on 44/36/86 splits (which leads to a TS% of .614) and won 3 scoring titles. His single season scoring peak was in 2018-19 when he averaged 36.1 on 44/37/88 splits (.616 TS%).   So Harden averaged more points than KD ever did while being slightly less efficient (but keep in mind that KD had Russ backing him up as a second option to relieve some pressure, while Harden’s best scoring teammate was either Eric Gordon, Chris Paul, or one season of Russ I guess).   I’d say Harden is the better regular season scorer, but KD has him beat in the playoffs. In other words, it’s pretty much a tossup. Especially now that KD has been dealing with so many injuries."
Impact guys with chronic or career altering injuries during ADs tenure  Eric Gordon - biggest return asset for CP3 and was looking like a potential upper level star in LA before coming over and getting hurt. Never looked the same after   Ryan Anderson - extremely good shooter and was one of our best scorers. Could never stay on the court and suffered through personal tragedies that I think also took a toll   Jrue - easily our second best player and a good running mate for AD. But we were lied to by the 76ers about his medicals and he struggled to stay on the court for most of his tenure. Definitely became a great asset and was worth a big deal  AD - wasnt as bad as others but he was always getting banged up  Boogie - Traded for him to make a major playoff push. Took time to get adjusted with him but when we finally looked like a team with everything clicking he got his Achilles injury that derailed his career    Sad mention:  Bryce Dejean-Jones - Wasn't a major impact player yet but was just 23 and showing some flashes of being a quality player for us in 2015. Unfortunately he made a pretty serious mistake and died during his rookie year. I dont know if he ever would have devloped into something useful but we'll never know
"The other reasons mentioned here are valid, but their only big push with both Jrue and AD was also when Boogie blew out his acl. Not to mention thats one of the years where we ran into the Warriors like others have said. The years they straight up missed usually had glaring holes due to previous years roster decisions too, like the Solomon hill contract or the boogie trade. Jrue also came in the aftermath of the eric gordon/tyreek evans/ryan anderson etc. Days which meant we needed more than just him to come in to be competitive at the start of his tenure. These are all secondary to the fact that dell demps was a bad GM and alvin wasnt exactly the perfect fit at coach year in and year out"
"Oh you don't have to convince me about that, Levert is ultra overrated for some reason here.  Eric Gordon is (way) better than both Oladipo and Levert this season, he's already on Houston's payroll next season, no need to overpay another shooting guard"
"How bout avery bradley, Eric gordon and a second round pick?"
This will make Eric Gordon and Danuel House the only remaining players from last season
"As a Rockets fan, when healthy he was pretty effective against the likes of Rudy, Jokic (beating him down the court), AD (Pels version), and KAT. It was just the Rockets intense focus on beating the Warriors and Green’s hyper-intelligent approach to dropping back on the lob threat and sitting on Clint’s legs that motivated Harden to develop an effective floater right before the Unguardable Tour season (where btw he had to play that way bc significant time missed by CP3, Clint, and Eric Gordon). Clint’s lob was the release valve the Rockets were missing when trading him for RoCo. The Rockets thought they could pick up Nerlen’s from the Thunder at some point but ironically CP3 and the “professionals” as I call them (Gallo, Dennis) had them winning so they retained Nerlens. Also now known is that they reportedly offered Isaiah Hartenstein and 2SRP for Wood last season to be that guy. Never got a Clint-lite or comparable in time for Harden and Russ to use."
He also came to the Pels and decided to not give af. Fuck Eric Gordon
"i thought he was great in his MVP season and phenomenal to watch but the mental gymnastics this guy is going through is hilarious.  lol so MDA was always like ""Russ we're gonna have you play with the less talented guys and only Harden gets to play with Eric Gordon to make his +/- look better"". like what an absolute conspiracy it must be against Russ."
"If the refs are swallowing their whistle the coaches are supposed to recognize it and adjust and find other ways to get guys in positions to score. Instead they kept chucking enough bricks to build a small village. a lot of those no calls are the type of soft ass fouls that guys get in the reg season and don’t get called in playoff games. That third 3 point foul was right to be called on the floor because the contact was initiated when harden’s dribble was on the ground, i see a play in there where eric gordon literally tackles curry for the ball and doesn’t get a whistle"
Agreed. And I think peak Eric Gordon on the Clippers &gt; Jamal Murray so far
Tbf Eric Gordon would have been way better if not for injury
Harrison Barnes and Eric Gordon?
"Just looked at all the 7th overall picks, and these are the players close to or better than Murray for me. Harrison Barnes (close), Stephen Curry, Eric Gordon (had solid years, and won a 6th man of the year), Rip Hamilton, Kevin Johnson, Chris Mullin, Alvin Robertson, Bernard King, and John Havlicek. From 1950s to today. So it's pretty rare, but not *that* rare."
"Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley weren't guys that the defense was OK with leaving wide open from three"
"Harden **led the league in assists** playing next to Lou Williams, Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon"
Just because teams were built to help harden doesn’t mean it actually helped him. Dwight missed 41 games in 2015 and Harden carried scrubs and has beens to the 2nd seed. Harden led a Rockets team to the 3rd seed with Eric Gordon as his second best offensive weapon. Difference between Harden and Curry is that James can play heavy minutes and impacts the game in more ways then just scoring. The Warriors run limited action with Curry as a facilitator and ultimately I feel that limits the offense. A pick and roll game with Wiseman would look nice but they hardly ever run plays for that
"Who where the shooters tho Eric Gordon, and who else ??"
"Lmao Curry's next best 3 players are arguably better than that 16-17 team's, Green Wiggins Oubre is better than Eric Gordon Pat Bev and Ariza lol"
Garnett shitting on Eric Gordon from the crowd.
The same exact team did it to Eric Gordon and got mad that he was mad about it
"Well, not really KD.  Even passing to a guy like Joe Harris instead of Eric Gordon is a massive upgrade"
Asik/Ryno/Tyreke/Eric Gordon build for AD went really badly.
Harden has proven to carry scrub teams to high seeds in the western conference. Check 2015 and even 2017 when Eric Gordon was his second best player. Curry hasn’t
"I feel like they were a bit ahead of the curve.  Durant of course was a no-brainer but I remember being surprised at both the Harden and Westbrook picks.  My recollection is that in 2008 Brook Lopez, Jerryd Bayless, Love, and Eric Gordon were expected to go ahead of Westbrook.  And that Rubio was expected to be the third player taken in 2009, with Harden being in a big glut with Tyreke, Curry, DeRozan, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, and maybe a couple others."
"Julius Randle too!  Rondo, David West, Baron Davis, Eric Gordon, J.R. Smith, Austin Rivers, Buddy Hield, David Wesley. (I guess you can throw in J.J. Redick now too.)"
"Not disrespecting Harden whatsoever, but if you compare the 2 teams... there’s a huge difference in having as your 2nd best player Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love (who was terrible that season). I’d prefer having guys like PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela over JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson any day of the week"
"Bill is right. Ben Simmons, Eric Gordon &amp; Christian wood is definitely a playoff team."
Nothing makes me giggle harder than KG calling Eric Gordon trash-ass.
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
"Harden had a better team, which is the main reason for the better record. Russ would've killed for backups life Eric Gordon and Lou Williams, not only that Harden had great pieces like Patrick Beverley and Clint Capela to fill out the squad.  People act like the Rockets won 55 games because Harden was that much better than Russ, when in reality the difference wins was due to better coaching and a better roster"
"What a dumb comment lmao. He’s 58% for his career as a rocket in the playoffs, well above league average.  &gt; last season against the lakers  Lmao talk about cherry picking, that game he still had like 21/10/4/3/2, literally his only bad game of the series and he still did that. For the series, he put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS while playing 4 on 5 against the champs, russ wasn’t even being guarded and harden was being hard doubled the whole time. He had 17 and 4 on 40% TS.  &gt; 2018 against the warriors  Ah yes just completely ignore that Chris Paul went down and he was facing 4 allstars with eric gordon on his side. What the fuck? Even then, he didn’t even have bad games. In game 7 he put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on like 4 different three pointers  https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU  They win that series if Chris Paul plays, something nobody was able to come even close to doing  &gt; 2019 he was just ok again  35/7/6 on 60% TS for the series against the warriors while his supporting cast was doing Jack shit, but yes he was just “okay”. Just admit you’re not willing to give him any credit and move on, you’re embarrasing yourself.  &gt; 2017   Yes, we know he was bad for that one game."
"We also dumped Prince’s 15M/yr contract with Allen clearing cap space and a roster spot. Also, it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that we got KPJ for a top 55 protected 2nd because we landed the Cavs Allen.  Levert is 26, injury prone, inefficient, and has 2yr/$32M on his deal. He’s not really great, we already have enough injury prone (Eric Gordon) or inefficient guards (Wall, maybe KPJ at this stage of his career). We did get Olynyk who has been surprisingly amazing for us as a starter with Wood out. Olynyk is also showing that he’s happy in Houston by both his numbers, plays, and statements. If we resign Olynyk, I think the Levert trade would be 100% the right move. If we don’t resign Olynyk, then the trade was a wash (we got a roster spot and saved cap)."

he reminds me of our situation with Eric Gordon. I'll never understand why some guys with all the gifts in the world take a four year vacation because they're not feeling the vibe.
"Not a championship team, but only 1 player from the 2018 Rockets WCF team that battled the Warriors is still on the squad (Eric Gordon)"
"Rondo can’t score, Tony Allen can’t score, Jrue can, Cousins was injured, Tyreek didn’t play, Buddy for half a season, Eric Gordon for a year?? like he barely had a starting 5 wtf. Ahh my bad he had Austin rivers too when we weren’t sure if he was gonna make it in the nba. Oh Etwan Moore too, now that you mention he did have a whole lot of help."
Reminds me of [Eric Gordon and Mike Breen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyb0PUoLWHM)
"Norman Powell, Lu Dort, Eric Gordon"
"No one got anything positive to say? I honestly love this as an anime fan and someone who appreciates OC (I skimmed through, y’all need to take the SAT so you can learn how to extract the substance of something without reading the whole thing).  I think Shawn Livingston is another good one for Hishashi op, it makes a lot of sense IMO. But Dell and Eric Gordon are great picks too"
"Per 538 Trae is the 6th worst defender. It goes Anfernee Simon's, Bryn Forbes, Dame, Lonnie Walker, Eric Gordon, then Trae"
Harden averaged 35 against gsw in 2019 and the 2nd best player on the team was eric gordon...
"CP3 era was a little weird.   There was a point the team had no owner. They spent the first year in Oklahoma, then came back to the city post-storm. It started off with George Shinn as the owner but he had his own weird drama. CP3 probably had a lot of reasons to leave, but his team having no owner (and being taken by the NBA) was a pretty fitting reason to want to go as well.   Then it went to a new owner in the AD era.   I think they did too little too late with AD. Dell Demps never put a great roster around him, and when they finally gave him a real team it was basically a last-ditch effort.   He was injured a lot---and has always been injury-prone, and the guys he started his rookie year with were a lot of dudes who had no interest in being there. Like a bunch of bad vets (Eric Gordon.)   I think it makes a lot of sense he wanted to play with Bron and reunite with Rondo. Rondo was like, one of the few good vets they had put around him in N.O."
Only Eric Gordon with his perfectly round head
"This is a bit of a long answer but I do think there’s a mistake in your logic, I agree with you that it can get into an endless spiral of “what if’s”, but sometimes what-if’s have answers.  Basically, 2018 Andre Igoudala did not shape the warriors offensive system like Chris Paul shaped the Rockets offensive system.  Without Iggy, the warriors are weaker, but they don’t fundamentally reshape their offensive regime.   The Warriors losing Iggy would be more akin to the 2018 rockets losing Eric Gordon, a valuable contributor to an existing system rather than a necessary player to make said system work.  Igoudala was a tremendous defender, talented at helping curry get open, and decent enough at scoring that he wasn’t a liability but that wasn’t his game. Perfect for Warriors, but without him they’re still trying to do the same thing.   Gordon was a very talented catch and shoot 3 point shooter who could also drive and score at a decent enough caliber that Harden or Paul could kick it out to him and it wouldn’t be a wasted possession. Offence didn’t run through him, they just used him as their main “other guy”.  So you can start to see why equating losing Chris Paul, who DID fundamentally change how the Rockets played offensively, is a bit misguided.  It is also worth mentioning that while the 2018 Rockets were tremendous both offensively and defensively, they primarily “won their games with offence”, in that they could rely on outscoring opponents even on poor defensive nights.   This is important because Chris Paul impacted the offensive FAR more than he ever impacted the defence, losing him was a bigger relative hit to the Rockets system than losing Iggy was a relative hit to the Warriors system.  So, you’re right in that what-if’s can get out of hand, and we can’t say for sure what would have happened, but I don’t think it’s smart to equate those two at all."
Didnt they do this when Eric Gordon wanted to go to Indiana but matched anyways?
"&gt;None of those vets were past their prime and could have been flipped for more assets in the long run.  Except.. they couldn't, because Odom retired 2 years later and both he and Martin only had one year left on their deals. You would have had to trade them at the deadline or give them extensions. Either way, not smart for a rebuilding team. Scola was signed long-term but dude he was 31, you were going into a rebuild. I have no idea how you would rather have him than 2 top 10 picks and a first. If anyone made that deal today they would be fired immediately.  &gt;Stern himself obviously didn't have that much faith in the Clippers deal or Eric Gordon considering he blocked New Orleans from signing Gordon to his rookie extension.  That is.. not at all what happened. Stern was hesitant to give him a large contract extension because after the first game he played with the Hornets they found out about a prexisiting knee condition, and that he reaggravated in his first game. This was back when knee issues were still seen as a massive problem. He had surgery that year and missed a lot of time. He only played 9 games for them that year. You're just completely ignoring this part for whatever reason.  Stern blocked them from signing the max, and it worked out great for the Hornets because he signed a smaller deal with the Suns as an RFA and the Hornets matched. Stern never wanted him to leave New Orleans, this was obviously the best choice for them to let him go to RFA.  I really don't understand how any fanbase can want them to trade their 26 year old superstar for 3 older vets. That's just bizarre to me."
"The NBA owned a majority stake in the Hornets (before they changed their name to the Pelicans) franchise, so David Stern was the de facto owner. Dell Demps was the gm, and he made a trade with the Lakers that was absolutely terrible:  Lakers get: Chris Paul (26)  Hornets get: Lamar Odom (32), Kevin Martin (28), Luis Scola (31), Goran Dragic (25)  Rockets get: Pau Gasol (31)  David Stern thought this was an absolutely terrible trade and vetoed it.  He instead set up a trade with the Clippers:  Clippers get: Chris Paul  Hornets get: Eric Gordon (23), Al Farouq Aminu (21), Chris Kaman (29) and an unprotected first round pick from the Timberwolves.  In retrospect, the original Lakers trade wouldn't have been *that* bad for the Hornets because Dragic ended up being a good player, but at the time he wasnt seen as a lot. Stern felt like the Lakers trade was a very bad deal for a team about to enter a rebuild, and that since Demps is not authorized to make a trade without ownership approval, it was within his rights to veto the trade. Eric Gordon was the 7th overall pick in 2008, and Aminu was the 8th pick in 2010, so at the time they were seen as good prospects, and from a rebuilding perspective it was a much better trade for the Hornets."
"New Orleans fans should be the ones complaining about being screwed. If we don't win the lottery for Anthony Davis, we have to build around Eric :Fuck New Orleans"" Gordon."
"Lmao you tryna tell me the league and the owners were like no lets not make our most profitable, popular and recognizable franchise with arguably one of the most popular players in the league on it (kobe) relevant again and drive up hype to the NBA   Yeah sure buddy.   It was entirely because that's a doodoo return for CP3 that traps you on a treadmill. Almost every team in the league would rather trade stars for picks and young potential over middling dudes who are good but not great and are old. Scola, Martin and odom were old dudes with no potential and were100% not first options or franchise players. Why trap your team to that 9th-10th place treadmill team status   Eric Gordon at the time was looked at as one of the next best young shooting guards. Like legit this was man was seen as a future top 5 SG. Aminu was a young dude with potential too. Kaman was a throwin in for saley purposes. And they got picks. You're missing the fact that they got a lottery pick which happened to be Austin Rivers but drafting well is a different discussion.   The clippers trade also doesnt lock you into a very low ceiling on your future with old dudes who aren't collectively good enough to bring you a championship. Like how are you going to tell me Scola and Odom and Martin are good returns bruh wtf.   The biggest sham isnt this vetoed trade, it's the fucking stupid target laker fans placed on themselves and deluded themselves into thinking the owners were out to get them. It was actually a stupid trade."
people always talk about Lowry but Eric Gordon thiccccc
"2017 Rockets had four: James Harden, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams and Corey Brewer."
yeah that's what I'm saying. he's not quite as thick as Eric Gordon but he's capable of playing up a position despite being short.
"I'm referring to the fact he can play the 3 because he's a lil thicker and has a +8 wingspan. I'm not saying his playstyle is like Keldon or Zion or something, I'm just saying he can play up a position up better than a lot of 6'4"" 2s, like an Eric Gordon or something."
"Ya that was the problem. The owners didn't like that it made the Lakers better not that they didn't like what NOLA got. It was an obvious overreach by Stern peasing mainly jordan along with cuban and other owners that didnt want to see Kobe and Lakers continue to dominate. The trade was fair and ended up being the better offer than what NOLA ended up getting.    Lamar Odom (reigning 6MOTY) Kevin Martin (20+scorer), Luis Scola (18ppg/8r), Goran Dragic (arguably still a better asset than Eric Gordan) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eric Gordon, Kaman, Aminu (less 2 second round picks)  That veto is one of the biggest shams in all of sports history."
Two other clear ones are Klay and Eric Gordon to round out a top five
Didnt Eric Gordon missed bunch of the games I remember everyone waiting for him for Rockets to pop
"I think he’s been my least favorite player to ever watch play ball for my team, he’s up there with Eric Gordon for sure"
Eric Gordon
I remember Morey talking about the analytics of taking deep 3s. He was talking about how Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon would spot up 4 feet behind the line on the wings to create more space for Harden.
"Came here to say ghis, indainapolis in the late 2000s, early 2010s leeser star quality but greg oden, conelly, george hill, courtney lee, juwan johnson, jeff teague and his brothers, eric gordon, im sure im missing some. They all played eachother and we all knew we were watching future nba players it was pretty cool for high school.... oh and josh mcroberts, eh prolly didnt need to say that one lol"
"Josh Mcroberts, Daquan Cook, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, and Greg Oden.  I don’t think this is the GOAT aau team just the best from that era."
"Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, Jeff Teague, George Hill, Gordon Hayward, Josh McRoberts, Greg Oden, E’twan Moore - all Indy boys within ~3 years of each other. The games used to be nutty"
I wonder how they would have fared against Eric Gordon and Derrick Rose's AAU team. (Kevin Love might have spent time on that team too).
How would you like 1 Eric Gordon or Danuel House
"Not sure if you realized but basketball is a team sport. I wonder how many games the bucks would have won in 2019 if Middleton missed 24 games like CP3, Brook Lopez missed 14 games like Capela, Eric Bledsoe missed 14 games like Eric Gordon and a myriad of other injuries to their role players."
That was a Dantoni play. With kyrie in the eric Gordon role.
Harden staying would've likely motivated the team and had a domino effect.  Wood has missed a load of games and will miss more.  Wall has missed a lot of games.  PJ Tucker pretty much quit on the team because Harden dipped. Eric Gordon has missed a lot of games.  They just don't have the consistency in there to win games.  They should really just trade everyone and commit to a full rebuild at this point.
Eric Bledsoe for Aaron Gordon is more to my liking but Magic would laugh at that
Eric Gordon
100% agree about Green. Makes no sense to trade him plus an asset for someone that doesn’t move the needle like Eric Gordon or Ross. Green should only be moved for a clear upgrade like Lowry.
"Did you see kyrie against the bucks in 2019? Or that just didn’t happen ?  Chris Paul got fucking injured after we went up 3-2, Wby are you intentionally leaving things out to prop up your stupid argument? Harden went against 4 allstars with 1 and still put up 32/6/6/4 and was fouled on half his threes in game 7, and we only lost by 9. The same team that 4-1d kyrie while he had lebron fucking James on his team lol. Hardens next best teammate was eric gordon  &gt; kyrie has never had the opportunity harden has had to have a team constructed around him  Yeah, because he’s not that good. Like there’s no way you are this sense.  Kyrie is a champion because he played with lebron. That does not make him better then harden in the slightest, harden would have beat the tougher warriors team had his teammate been healthy.  Kyrie isn’t a superstar, and has never been considered for MVP. You’re talking out of your ass"
I'll take the Lakers nobody can guard Lebron on that team and AD is gonna feast on that small lineup they use.  Still a close series because they had prime Eric Gordon but Playoff Rondo is probably what decides the series.
How come people always bring up splits but don't bring up the turnovers or the fact that he was 53%ts. He did not play well at all.  Saying there wasn't another ball handler is misleading as Eric Gordon was definitely a threat to go off the dribble in that series.
"Its insane to think that Harden's 29/6/6 is underperforming especially when he was the only threat as a ball-handler and primary scorer for 2 of the 7 games. His efficiency was down but it was a 7 game series, no one shoots their normal splits.   They lost game 7 by 9 points. Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza went 2/21 from three. Harden missed too but saying the supporting cast overperformed while he choked is disingenuous. They win that series and the chip if *anyone* played to their normal standards. So forgive me if I don't call Harden a choker for just barely coming up short."
Eric Gordon cause of his stupid fucking shot animation in 2k.
He was literally posting better numbers in 2017 with Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza as his best teammates.
I legitimately forgot Eric Gordon existed
Anfernee Simons and a protected pick for Gordon? Is that even close to reasonable? IDK Eric Gordon's real market value at all
"Ah yes, the Rockets big 3: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Eric Gordon"
Anyone else remember the Eric Gordon one as well?
"2016-17 Harden’s rockets won 55, with his best costar as Eric Gordon or Lou Williams  The next season he won 65 games with CP3. His teams didn’t miss the playoffs. And Durant shot 28% from 3, and 42% from the field when he lost to the Warriors, which is a choke IMO.  Both players r phenomenal I agree. I just think media has sold us on Durant is #2 or 1 in world narrative, but if you eliminate his easy titles, it’s really not that clean cut"
"I don't agree with that at all. Harden is a better scorer than Dame, a better playmaker and a better defender. I guess the only think that you could say is that Dame is a better shooter. Harden has also carried some insanely shitty teams to wins. Like that stretch a couple years ago when CP3, Tucker, RoCo and basically the whole Rockets roster was hurt and Harden went supernova and averaged 40+ ppg for a 30+ game stretch and singlehandedly kept the Rockets in the playoffs. Or in 16-17 when the Rockets 2nd best player was probably Capela or Eric Gordon and Harden still single-handedly carried them to 55 wins in the west. And he's done that so many times in his career.  But, regardless, I don't know how you can say Dame has elevated the Blazers in the playoffs. Since 2014 (his breakout season), the Blazers have lost in the 1st round four(!!!) times, including 2 sweeps and 2 gentleman's sweeps. Like did you missed all the shit Dame got in the media last playoffs for folding in the playoffs once again? In the other 2 years, he lost in the 2nd round and was swept by the Warriors in the conference finals. Whereas Harden, since 2014, has only lost in the 1st round once and made it to the conference finals twice. And its not like he had elite teammates either. In 14-15 when Harden made it to the conference finals, his 2nd best teammate was an over the hill Dwight Howard who only played half the season.  I don't think anyone would seriously consider Dame over Harden unless they were a big Harden hater or something. There's a reason Harden has been All-NBA First Team 6 times and a perennial MVP candidate while Dame has only made 1 First Team and has never really sniffed MVP."
Starting who?  KPJ/Eric Gordon/Tate/Olynyk/Wood?
"Ricky Rubio  Eric Gordon  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Clint Capela  with d rose/hart/ariza/pj/zubac off the bench would be a 60+win team imo. spacing,scoring,defense,depth,rebounding, etc. winning 60 games is a lot harder than it seems but this squad could do it"
"This man just said a 34-year-old Chris Paul, Eric Gordon and James Harden is a superteam lol this sub cracks me up sometimes"
"Yeah, case and point, his 2019-2020 season with the Rockets. When Chris Paul and Eric Gordon were out, the next best people on the team were pretty much G-Leaguers. Harden carried that team so hard and in doing so, set a ton of scoring records. That team was the worst Rockets team during Harden's tenure, and he still did everything he did."
"Yeah I remember Lebrons last year in Cleveland they played the Rockets, and the Rockets started Ariza, Ryne, baby Capela, and Eric Gordon. The Cavs would double harden on every play. The dude had 41 15 and 7. It was one of the best performances I’ve seen. He is a god damned maestro."
"That feels like forever ago but it's funny to think that guys like KD, Westbrook, and Eric Gordon also made their debuts during the Bush administration"
"Agreed. And not only lottery, all were top 5 picks. Durant 2, Harden 3, and Westbrook 4. Really the only pick that deserves some credit is having the sense to go Harden over Tyreek Evans.  Durant was the obvious #2 after Oden.  In Russ' draft. Rose was the clear 1. I'll give them credit grabbing Russ over Love, Gallo and Eric Gordon although PG was the biggest need since they had just grabbed Durant, Jeff Green and had Collison and Thabo  In Harden's draft: Blake and Hasheem Thabeet were the clear 1 and 2. Here's where I'll give them credit for scouting Harden as the better player than Tyreek Evans.  So yeah, to say this was some insane level of scouting seems a bit much. It was more or less just not fucking up 3 back to back top 5 draft picks."
"Tbh Rockets were without Wall, Wood, Eric Gordon and KPJ."
Probably means AD and Eric Gordon lol
"i can get behind that when eric gordon, gerald green and ryan anderson were at their peak you would see it but it did kinda fade deeper into hardens rockets run"
She read that shit like she was Eric Gordon in a 2k cutscene💀
"1. Bill Walton would be way higher, and possibly in conversation for being the best big of all time. As result, KAJ would be lower in peoples imaginations. At the very least, Seattle and Washington might not win their NBA titles when they do. 2. Connie Hawkins would be recognized way more as the NBA superstar who got cheated out of wowing the NBA. If he had 5 seasons as a top guy instead of one, you could imagine how we'd feel. 3. Pete Maravich would be remembered for some heroics in the playoffs instead of as a talented guy who couldn't handle his own success. 4. Larry Bird might have another ring or two, ditto Kevin McHale. 5. How good would Brandon Roy and Greg Oden be? Might end up rivaling OKC... 6. Bad Boy Pistons might threepeat. 7. Willis Reed might have been making more NBA finals with the Knicks. 8. Dave Cowens might've ended up rivaling Kareem through the 70s with the Celtics. 9. Unclear how great Bernard King would've been. Also, Ralph Sampson, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Penny Hardaway, Shaun Livingston and Eric Gordon. 10. Would Steve Nash have reached his peak earlier if he wasn't missing so many games early on? Also, what about Anthony Davis. 11. Arvydas Sabonis would've been a completely different guy when he came to the NBA."
"Their actually not a competitive team at all, you don't watch the Nuggets so you don't know why he's great. He didnt make the playoffs with a 46-36 record.  How come AD in his defense capabilities never been in the run for DPOY? Put Jokic on those Orleans teams he deffo gets more out of Anderson, Jrue and Eric gordon. Nothing wrong with the 2015 Orleans team, deffo shoulda at least taken 1game against the Warriors if Davis was a top5 player."
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."
"Your biases are showing.   &gt; he should have been able to make the playoffs more than once in 6 years  He made playoffs twice in 6 years. Your information is incorrect.  &gt; Top-tier floor raisers like LeBron, CP3, Harden, Jokic etc simply don’t miss the playoffs like that even when their teams take a shit ton of injuries, **unless they themselves get injured**.  AD was in fact injured. The 2 seasons he made playoffs in NO (2015 and 2018), he played 68 and 75 games respectively, which is 2 of his 3 healthiest seasons as a member of that team. Following your logic:  * Top tier floor raisers don't miss playoffs unless they themselves get injured  * AD makes playoffs when healthy, missed playoffs when he's hurt  Therefore, by your own words, AD is a top-tier floor raiser. ""But what about seasons 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019?"" Well, seeing that you don't count Jokic's first 3 seasons against him (which is fair, he wasn't a superstar yet), you should be partial by ignoring AD's first 2 seasons. That leaves us with:  * 2016 - Injured (61g). Best teammates were Jrue (65g), Ryno (66g), Eric Gordon (45g), and Tyreke Evans (25g). All 4 of his best teammates were injured, and you still expect them to make playoffs? Outside of those 4 you had trash like Ish Smith and Alonzo Gee getting rotation minutes.  * 2017 - AD was actually healthy (75g). Surrounded by Jrue (67g), Dante Cunningham, Ish Smith, Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, Langston Galloway, and E'Twuan Moore. Boogie only played 17 games. This legitimately is a playoff supporting cast to you? Give me a break.  * 2019 - Missed a few games due to injury, but the bigger problem was that he had his minutes limited and was shut down due to trade requests."
"Steph had dislocated finger on that series.   Eric gordon avg 20 ppg, cp3 17ppg, pj tucker 11ppg  Klay avg 19 ppg, dray 14 ppg, iggy 14ppg.   When kd down, werent the last 2 games should be fair based on the supporting cast production? If you give a pass for harden had 2 bad games on important time then I can also make excuse for steph in 2016 finals?"
it’s because it’s a player this sub likes  remmeber last playoffs when cp3 hit russ in the nuts and eric gordon in the nuts in the same series? and nobody said shit because cp3 was a /r/nba darling at that point and people hated russ/the rockets
I have a diff one. Pre injury Eric Gordon
 I still haven't seen Eric Gordon miss a shot against us.....
Means James harden and Eric Gordon won’t kill them in the playoffs lol
"Jrue and Boogie were also injured both teams he made the playoffs, and his teams were always banged up.   Eric Gordon, Jrue, Ryan Anderson, and AD were so hyped up in 2013-14 but only played like 20 healthy minus together lmao. In 2015 he had an MVP caliber season and took his team to the playoffs minus his 2nd best player in Jrue, and in 2018 he didn’t have Boogie at all in the playoffs and still stole a game from the KD Warriors"
"yeah bro haha i definitely know how that feels, the jazz are also pretty good at giving up career highs to the likes of eric gordon, simmons, etc."
Who Eric Gordon or pj tucker lol or Cj McCollum
"Andre came off that bench too! The fact that he didn’t win a 6MOY during that run is a travesty and he deserved it way more than Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, or Jamal Crawford ever did in that time."
The deal was eric gordon and a bunch of firsts
"People don't talk about it, but The rockets roster that Harden was competing with was not impressive at all. Players like PJ tucker and eric gordon were gettin heavy minutes that they wouldn't on any other team."
"Harden made G-Leaguers look like All-Stars for a stretch during 18/19 when CP, Capella and Eric Gordon were injured for a while."
"The Rockets immediate future really depends on the draft lottery this year. If they land a top 4 pick, they are on their way to what could be a quick rebuild with a franchise cornerstone from this batch of draft prospects. That pick dropping to 5 would be a disaster for them.   They are also paying Eric Gordon $19mil/year for three more seasons and John Wall $44mil next year and $47 mil the year after that."
Eric Gordon doesnt have 3 years left after this one  Because the last one is 0% guaranteed unless he makes an all star team
"Rockets say no because that’s too little for their star player  Timberwolves would be stupid to do this since they could’ve just traded for John Collins at the trade deadline, who in my opinion has a little bit more potential in the wolves system. Eric Gordon would be a good addition but it seems like were shooting ourselves in the foot if we do this."
"Exactly, he was assuming everyone will be static. Plus Eric Gordon is 28th and Wesley Matthews is currently 25th. Making a large volume of 3’s right now is a matter of longevity and not necessarily greatness."
"&gt;Im going off of how the series went in the first place. You cant just rewrite what happend in front of you.   What ""happend"" in front of me is that y'all had LMAM for 4 games compared to GSW only having Andre for 3. Andre was also way better in those three games than LMAM was in four.  When both teams were completely healthy, the Warriors blew the Rockets out twice. The Rockets did it once, and that game saw Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker shooting a combined 11/15 from three. They did not do it because of LMAMs -7 in 7 minutes.  The Warriors blew the Rockets out three times out of four times, with their fourth win being a nine point game.  The Rockets blew the Warriors out once, with their other two being barely scraped out wins of 3 points and 4 points.  This series was not as close as people like to think."
"Yeah they do seem to have some interesting opportunities. Could definitely end up being more like a bounce back like Memphis rather than an extended rebuild like Sacramento.  Porter looks like a solid piece, and it'll really help them if they can manage to get lucky in the draft lottery. Also nice job in drafting Martin and signing Tate.  Wall will be interesting since I actually think he can be a positive contributor. Frankly, he exceeded expectations this year. Still not great team basketball, but that might improve next season as he gets more comfortable and can trust the younger players a bit more.  Also what will be interesting: what they end up doing with Eric Gordon who could be used as a trade piece, or even, if necessary, trade Wood if they're offered something to good to turn down (Wiseman + picks for instance).  Plus they've got a few other picks that may end up being nice role players, or traded for other talent.  In the end, depending on where their draft pick lands, they have an intriguing rebuild to keep an eye on, and could possibly bounce back more quickly than Oklahoma City...though OKC could also end up with Shai, #1 and #5 in this draft lol."
"Eric Gordon barely played for y’all tho. If he was healthy throughout his tenure with the Pels, him and AD could’ve done some damage in WEstern conference."
"CP3 was washed and missed a bunch of time, as did Eric Gordon and Capela.   Honestly can you even remember who his teammates were during that run?"
"AD's dealt with even more key injuries in NOLA but got blamed for it; Jrue, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Cousins, etc"
Eric Gordon is great in this clip too. He’s clearly supposed to pass to harden and just has no idea how to react lol
"Eric Gordon and Jrue Holiday were/are key players for some of the best teams in the league? The other names are obviously not great, but those two are good."
"When did AD have a good supporting cast lol. In 2015 he carried a lineup of tyreke evans, eric gordon, jrue holiday, quincy poindexter, and omer asik to 45 wins in the West. His supporting cast every other year aside from 2018 has been mediocre to terrible."
"Constantly injured Eric Gordon as well lmao.  When he had a relatively healthy team in 2015, they got into the playoffs. Literally every starter of note got injured for significant time the year after in 2016, then they lost talent in 2017, before finally getting DMC and looking like a good team. DMC went down but they still got in the playoffs and made Dame look like a joke lol.  He had a lot of ups and downs in New Orleans but a lot of it was due to not having great players (other than Jrue, DMC, and I dunno... Mirotic?) and the injury bug hitting."
eric gordon is still so damn underrated and its just cuz of his contract. its so weird how people’s contracts impact the way fans view them like its EG’s fault he got the bag
He made the playoffs 2 times. The one everyone remembers when they swept the Blazers and lost to the Warriors. The other one this was NOLA starting lineup in the playoffs:  * Tyreke Evans - Eric Gordon - Pondexter - AD - Asik  This was KG with the Wolves all over again.  How many in that list actually led a team with this amount of talent to anything meaningful?
"You say that like it's a bad thing, Eric Gordon was a beast."
&gt; he's a talented   I'm starting to question this too after the game last night.  I think he's just gonna be Eric Gordon 2.0 at best.
"let me clarify u/puffx0r and u/makaveli80  I watched every game Harden has played in Houston. I didn't have a team and started following them after.  I didn't say his teamates were bad. I said overall the team had below average OFFENSIVE players. Or the players were extremely one dimensional  A great example is PJ Tucker. With the spacing of D'Antoni and Harden's scoring gravity and creation he got some of the easist possible three pointers, wide open corner 3's. That is literally the only thing he is capable of doing, he is well below league average above the break, his jumper isn't fast. He has an incredibly rudimentary handle, can't pass and bc he is groundbound and slow he has to shoot a tough low percentage floater instead of a layup  How did PJ look offensively without Harden and D'antoni? 4.4 pts on 36.6% from the field and 31.6% from three. All numbers are a career low.  We saw the limitations of the role players against the best defense in the league with the Lakers. When they doubled Harden the team was in trouble. They were comfortable shooting contested threes, attacking the closeouts, passing, cutting or finishing. Same issues against the zone looks.  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  To be clear there have been some good offensive role players like Ryan Anderson, but they were still limited. He went defense first on his minimum salary guys  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  It's not just Joe Harris. Shamet, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are all very good, and versatile role players on offense"
"That's just wrong. We have had really bad players some years, yes, but we have also had players like Clint Capela, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Eric Gordon (when he was playing well). They are not below average roleplayers. Also PJ tucker was absolutely deadly with the corner 3. Maybe not as good as Joe Harris but he was still above league average."
"Thing is, those guys are looked at as “reliable shooters” because of how the rockets played. There’s a strict reason pj Tucker hit the most corner 3s in the league when he was with them. Dude went barely holding a roster spot to a quality starter just because Houston used him to strengths and sat him in the corner on offense. No running off screens. No ball handling. Just spot up and do what you’re good at.   Eric Gordon, sure I’ll give you because he shoots a decent percentage from 3 and he had some pretty tough shots but Danuel is no better a shooter than most of the warriors roster. Dude shot 4 threes a game at like a 36% clip. Warriors have 5 rotation players that shoot at least 38% from 3 and Poole shoots 35%. Most of the warriors team could easily replicate houses shooting, especially since they already shoot better percentage wise, while also being asked to handle the ball and create offense."
"That and Mitchell against good defenders. I’m sure he’s better now, but the guy got locked up by Eric Gordon in the playoffs multiple times"
"Assuming the cap is no issue (it is but roll with it), what about Wood+Eric Gordon+2024 pick"
Thinks it more so to do with his potential. Guys like Otto porter and Eric Gordon have gotten maxes. Also he is a pretty big name which can only help in negotiations
"Taking AD from NO and adding KD would make the Pels a +50w team? Because that's what you needed in the west to have home court advantage. Half the years you would have Jrue and Gordon injured, your center getting Crohn's disease, guard Tyreke Evans as the best wing to ever play with you, insane contracts to players like Anderson or Solomon Hill.   Also he played in a division where you almost needed to win 50 games not to come last. You had to play against the Mavs, Spurs, Rockets and Grizzlies.  Look at starting roster that got bounced in the first round:  * Tyreke Evans - Eric Gordon - Pondexter - AD - Asik  You are telling me that you put KD on that roster and they get a high seed and win a playoffs series in the West? They didn't even have a decent PG because of Jrue's injuries. The lineup would be like this:  * Tyreke Evans - Eric Gordon - KD - Anderson - Asik  You truly believe KD would have won more than him? That team was Timberwolves' levels of awful."
"2017 rockets had good role players who shot really well from 3 like Ryan Anderson, Beverly, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams and Ariza. They also had pretty good centers in capela and harrell. Harden was great too but that is better than who steph has right now  I’m not saying harden didn’t have an impact but I don’t get the notion that harden is a better floor raiser than steph. They haven’t really had even caliber teams for us to test that theory out."
"He had to play with Eric Gordon, of course he looked bad"
What’s the comparable harden team to this warriors team? Harden in 2017 had pretty damn good role players next to him in Eric Gordon Ariza Beverly and capela   The only other argument is 2019 but even then Gordon capela and Tucker are really good role players and they always had a bunch of guys who can shoot the 3. Warriors don’t have that this year
Eric Gordon and Austin Rivers whenever they play the Jazz
CJ is 6'3 and Eric Gordon is 6'4 so it wouldn't really be that big of a change
CJ is starting right now alongside 2 other guards. The Rockets were starting Eric Gordon when they had CP3 and Harden.   If you have a borderline All Star SG like CJ you can make it work.
and instead they got eric gordon
"Yeah but Harden carried a bunch of scrubs to a top 4 seed in the West while Eric Gordon,CP3 and Capela missed a bunch of time. Brad is struggling to make the playoffs in the East."
"I'm not trying to sound snarky here, but this doesn't mean a whole lot. 3-point volumes are up across the entire league, and your comment presupposes that (a) Buddy will continue playing significant minutes when he hits his thirties, (b) that everyone else's place on the leaderboard right now will be static, and (c) that a new coach might come along and tell him to stop jacking up 10 3's per game. Eric Gordon is 28th all-time for 3's and he's also missed a hell of a lot of games."
"Yep. If you weren’t following back then, you’d definitely think the Lakers offer was better.  It would’ve netted the Pelicans Scola, Dragic, Odom (I think), and Kevin Martin.  Back then, Dragic was still a no-name before his Suns stint. Not to mention, the 4 players had player options and contract extensions coming up within like 2 years. There was the possibility that after those 2 years only 1 of the 4 players would still be on the team.  With the Clippers offer, they had a young potential All Star in Eric Gordon (that was the perception at the time) and Aminu along with other players. The Pelicans would’ve gotten 2 young assets whose future they could control"
"I mean thats how it should be if the league owns a team and is trying to find it a good buyer  They need to get as much assets as possible and what the Lakers were planning to give up would have tanked the franchises value to a new buyer. They'd be stuck with a bunch of average to just good vets with no real future while the Clips package (first round pick, a young star in the making in Eric Gordon, and the ability to be bad enough to get a high pick) all made it more attractive   The Lakers deal was highway robbery and was probably made by the GM so he could keep the team competitive enough to save their job in the short term. Which makes sense given the instability in ownership and the fact rebuilding teams with new management have 0 incentive to keep the old regime"
"like if anyone wants to complain about the CP3 stuff, really the only angle you can approach it from was that it was a bad trade.  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers package: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft, which was used to draft Austin Rivers. Upon the deal's   &amp;#x200B;  Lakers package: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  &amp;#x200B;  I wasn't really following at the time, but it seems like both packages weren't great. But i might favor the lakers package just for dragic."
"&gt; Curry only had lower stats because the he made the Warriors so dominant, he was playing 5 fewer minutes than Harden lmao.  Playing 5 fewer minutes also implies that the team could do well without him on the court for longer. It's well known that year that Curry's team was better, he had Klay and Draymond vs...2015 Dwight? Who only played 41 games? The Warriors were a deep and experienced team that year. You're ignoring all the context.  &gt;Per possession, Curry had better stats and was more efficient.  That's a lie. Per 100 possessions:  Harden: 37/7.7/9.4/2.6/1  Steph: 35.5/6.4/11.6/3/0.3  Those are absolutely comparable. Considering Steph had the better team, him having more assists makes complete sense. Harden still scores more and gets more rebounds. TS% doesn't change per possessions but it's a 3% change with Harden still above 60% despite carrying the team.  &gt;Also 33% higher TS% is more than a bit lmao.  Uh you mean 3%? Which isn't massive considering the huge role Harden had on that team. Harden still had a TS of 60.5% which is excellent.  &gt;Harden does not have a good case for 2015 MVP.  Another lie?   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2015.html  Harden almost won. He was a massively clear second, and only 250 points down despite Steph's 100 first place votes. He had 400 points more than 3rd place LeBron. Just because you don't remember what happened doesn't mean that it didn't happen.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2436979-the-advanced-stats-guide-to-the-2015-nba-mvp-race  Another article detailing how close Harden was to winning.  &gt;Harden was 8 games above Westbrook, while Kawhi was 6 games ahead of Harden, while Harden had COTY and 6MOY. Kawhi had no other all star on his team either, yet had 6 more wins.   You're once again ignoring all the context. Kawhi had Ginobili, Parker, Gasol, Aldridge, Danny Green, etc. Harden's second best player statistically was...Eric Gordon? Second year Capela? His team was way worse. That's also why D'Antoni won CotY.   &gt;Kawhi could've definitely won 2017 if that season's narrative wasnt so skewed by stats.  Well then you're partially agreeing with me. If the voting criteria was the same as it always is, the best player on one of the best teams (*Including context*), then it shouldn't have gone to Westbrook. Harden was carrying much harder than Kawhi was, on a much worse team.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2017.html  Kawhi is much further in voting from Harden than Harden was from Westbrook. If Westbrook didn't average the triple double, Harden wins that year. Harden's stats were almost a triple double himself: 29/8/11.   MVP has always been a combination of statistical dominance, high seeding, and level of carrying the team. Harden by far fit those categories the best *altogether* compared to either Westbrook or Kawhi that year. He lost to the lower seed due to another carry job (but worse than his) and stats. However, in 2015, he had very similar stats and the much harder carry job, but lost to the seeding."
"Yup lol. And none of them will address the flop on Eric Gordon that I posted. Just like when someone posted a similar clip of Harden not getting the undercutting-the-shooter foul when Klay undercut him, Warriors fans just started flair-bashing with cringey twitter lines."
&gt;	I feel terrible for Eric Gordon  No.
"I feel terrible for Eric Gordon, ngl. Honestly I'd love to have him in New York, he'd add a wonderful veteran presence and be able to push people around defensively from the 2 to 4. Hope he gets well soon and ends up either in a better situation like a playoff bound team or the Rockets turn it around by getting healthy and getting a free agent for next year."
Yeah only after the rockets entirely redesigned the team on a gamble over small ball.  I dont care about points assists or rebounds when his percentages were trash. The man straight up couldn't shoot 3's or freethrows. The lakers could just sag off of him and laugh at his pathetic attempts to score. Eric Gordon was so much more of a second option in that playoffs than westbrook's sorry ass  You are so off base if you in any way think Harden was the ballhog and the issue for the 19-20 rockets. He was the only reason the rockets thought they were contenders.
"Yeah, Harden Ariza, Ryan Anderson legit 15ppg player, Eric Gordon, Lou Will mid season and most important Clint Capela had break out year and team had success also due to him and Harden both taking huge step forward. If you take player by player, there are already in this stack of players better and complementary players to Harden than in whole Okc team that year, Gordon&gt;Oladipo, Ryan Anderson&gt;Kanter or rookie Sabonis, Ariza&gt; any other guard/forward in Okc, and Okc has advantage in Adams, Lou&gt;any other guard. And on top of everything else BB reference had Houston  expected W/L : 55-27 , and 43-39 for Okc. Plus Westbrook was leading the league in clutch points(and had 25-15 in clutch games) 6.2 on 45% to Hardens 3.8 on 36% (21-18). And Advanced states except efficiency and WS(that is tied to efficiency) were almost all on Westbrooks like value over replacement. While Harden was worthy of an MVP, Westbrook was more worthy due to a fact that he had historical season."
Eric Gordon was way more valuable at the time
"This is ancient history but the Chris Paul to the Lakers trade that David Stern vetoed would have been better than the package that New Orleans later got from the Clippers.  Clips trade: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a Minnesota 2012 first-round pick (#12 overall).  Lakers trade: Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Lamar Odom, Goran Dragic, and a Knicks 2012 first-round pick (#16 overall).  Odom and Scola were past their primes, but both of them would later be traded for first round picks. Martin was a solid player and Dragic was probably the best player in either deal."
It's still a big part of his game and isn't going anywhere.   Just less need and opportunity to do so when you share the floor with KD and Kyrie instead of Eric Gordon and Clint Capela.
"He never even made the All-Star team in all the years he was a 20 PPG scorer pre-injury. He also wasn’t even ROY (lost to Chuck Person) despite what the person above you says. He wouldn’t have been a HOF even if he didn’t get injured, given he never even made an All-Star team pre-injury.   He’s like Eric Gordon of this generation except he has rings. If anything the injury made him realize he couldn’t be a scorer anymore and he focused on defense in the stacked Bulls + Lakers teams at the end of his career to win those rings."
"They can’t even stop Eric Gordon, let alone someone like LeBron or Kawhi."
"Sure, but I'm using the context of the trade to make inferences. At the time, the vast majority of people would have considered the Clippers package to be the better package. Why would the Hornets take a worse package just so Lakers fans would be happy? The most valuable player on the table at the time was Eric Gordon."
"The NBA owned the franchise. They didn't ""Step in"". The deal they got from the Clippers was seen as a better deal at the time. Eric Gordon looked like a future star before he got injured."
" &gt; so this is asinine  The only thing asinine thus far is people (trying to be) utilizing percentages without knowing how they work.  from 60% to 66%, is the equivalent jump from 50% to 55% , or from 40% to 44%. In other words, do you math?  The higher the number is the less the difference (in percentage points) matter. A 90% FT shooter from 95%  (FT) shooter is practically the same guy. However a 45% from a 50% (FT shooter) is literally twice the distance (i.e. the difference in accuracy matters more in lower percentages).  So , no, there is diminishing returns by design. 2 extra FGs per game is not that much of a difference.    &gt; You're begging the question  I am not though. I say (quite clearly and many times) that whatever Curry does does.not.work. Is it because his playmaking is lacking or maybe his defense, or maybe many factors at once? *I don't know*, I am suggesting some things because something (or a combination of things) *must* explain why his impact is so small as evidenced by wins.  You keep on bringing up stats. I bring up wins. Because stats do not get you seedings, or championships, not even MVPs (not on their own), wins do. If you have two different metrics saying different things, I go with the one that is actually consequential, sorry. Curry taking away points from his teammates so that to pump his resume is not impressing, me , sorry. If he did it in a manner that brings wins, ok, but if not, yeah, check your stats again they are actually telling sth different than what you may think  &gt; which none of the other players you've mentioned have done  Harden playing with the shadow of CP3 (in that one season), half a season of Eric Gordon and Clint Capella do not make up a salary cap hit of a max player (actually less than, they got oubre due Klay's injury exception)? That guy was literally playing w g leaguers for half that season. Starting with them, at times. And yes a 65% win season is better than a 50%, quite better in fact because it implies wins over increasingly harder teams. And , no, I am not going to count Steph's frailty (compared to Harden's, say) for him, lack of ability to be on the court as often as others *is* one more characteristic that counts against you.  Steph is posting empty stats all season long and guys are on his jock. It would have been funny if it was not such a major distraction. I mean guys (and teams) are competing on a high level, and we get half the front page filled with a stat padding bottom feeder. Enough is enough at some point."
"Bledsoe admitted SVG told the team to do it, and he just forgot. At this point I would rather have Eric Gordon back. At least he had the sense to be ""injured"" the whole time instead of playing and actively losing games"
"I remember JJ Redick doing pretty well. And while Eric Gordon definitely wasn't good, you can tell he was at least putting in some effort."
"Eric Gordon, CJ McCollum/Dame, paying one of them is fine but both of them will be making like $67M a year, thats like half the team's cap space."
"Eric Gordon, D’Angelo Russell, Buddy Hield, Klay Thompso, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert"
Eric Gordon.. this dude is always hurt and when he does play he isn’t that good
"Yea, but no one on the Rockets could score unless it was on a kick out. Like that was their whole gimmick. With CP3 and Capella out (Klay/Draymond for the Warriors) then the next one was PJ Tucker and from a talent stand point would you take him or Wiggins? Eric Gordon or Kevin Looney?"
Starring Eric Gordon.
its like going to the finals. if you are not dropping at least 100 points then it hurts your legacy. you were close but you choked.   if steph drops 70 next game then eric gordon&gt;steph legacy wise
i can totally see shamet developing into a poors man eric gordon
"If we are counting only those 3 games, Eric Gordon is arguably the best player for the Rockets."
"Chris Paul, capela, and Eric Gordon all missed a lot of games harden was winning games with Austin rivers and faried as his second scorer. Wanamaker got minutes on a solid Boston team in the playoffs last year. Wiggins has been to playoffs draymond is a HoF. Warriors are a decent team harden was playing with bums don’t forget the Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon year you dig deeper fella."
"Harden's 60 pt triple double without Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul and only 10 minutes of Eric Gordon   Or his 61 pts in 31 minutes against the Hawks"
"Chandler's knees are broken, full stop. I feel bad for the dude, he wanted nothing more than to get on the court and shake his party boy rep.  What is frustrating is that the shot was there, whenever he did play, he'd come in, lumber around and can some jumpers. But he has bad knees and him being unsteady on those knees caused back issues too.  No matter the rehab, the treatments, he could never get there. He even did the german platelet therapy that got Eric Gordon looking decent, but it was all for naught."
Eric Gordon for no true reason beyond his fucking awful shot animation in 2k.
Eric Gordon
I remember as a rookie someone asked him who his player comp he tries to be like is and I think he said Eric Gordon which is pretty interesting. But the more I have seen him I kinda see why he said that. If he can have an EG type career as a mid first (even if he isn't as good) that would great
"I think Desmond Bane could be a good player, maybe like an Eric Gordon or Danny Green type of player"
"Because he literally gets cooked year after year in the playoffs and pulled out to the 3 point line on an island against guards and can’t do anything as the 3x DPOY. Harden, CP3, Eric Gordon and the rockets literally played him off the floor two years in a row by taking turns attacking him in iso. And he’s also making 250 million over the next 5 years so that’s where a lot of the criticism and lack of respect comes from."
You know what? I kind of hate the Rockets - mostly Eric Gordon - but that was a really insightful comment on your team. I kind of thought y'all were spiraling but seems y'all have some sense of direction at least.    Also fair point in Simmons.
"You can just tell this by watching games. It’s exactly the reason why most players who go off for the first half of a game can’t do the same in the second half. You need plays off, that’s why rarely anyone has dropped over 70 before.   I’ve definitely seen Harden in particular struggle with staying on par with his usual self in 4th quarters. Usually Houston had to slow down the pace of the game a lot, and he’d still defer to Cp3 and Eric Gordon some possessions. Sometimes Harden wouldn’t even get the final shot in a game as we let Eric and Gerald Green shoot those multiple times.   Jimmy Butler last finals. Had some spectacular games but this dude could barely even move in the last game or two against the Lakers"
Ball: Eric Gordon
He reminds me of Blake Griffin when he played with Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman.
"Rockets fans know how clutch this guy was. When House and Eric Gordon were building brick houses, Uncle Jeff was popping 3s and keeping us in games. How the fuck is he on a vet min?!"
"It’d be basically impossible to build a winning team if they went with the Simmons deal. People seem to forget that they’ve got Wall under contract till 2023-24, and that deal is pretty much the worst contract in the NBA. Wall would be a horrible fit next to Simmons, even if he turns his health around.   Eric Gordon is also 32 and under contract for 20 Million per year until the same year, 2023-24. As a result, they’d be perpetually over the cap and unable to sign any free agents for the next few seasons.    **For perspective:** By the time Wall’s contract was off the books, Simmons would only have a year left on his deal."
eric gordon?
"He could be traded on the QO, and then sign an extension as a Non-Bird FA. (I looked this up in preparation of Lonzo). But it’s not likely.         The only player that would have ever been willing to do that was Eric Gordon after 2011-2012, and considering how much Gordon hated NOLA, I think Demps should have made a deal with Phoenix."
"Harden was the offense. Eric Gordon often out scores both of harden and CP3, but harden was the one who carried them. CP3 was along for the ride."
&lt;3  So many former Rockets doing big things this round besides ironically the best one. We need to free Eric Gordon next.
No one else is a starter on a team normally starting Kyrie Irving and James Harden in the backcourt. Eric Gordon is 2x the player of Joe Harris. Ok man.
Dude....the only starter caliber players right now are Harris and Durant. No one else is a starter.  The team is down 4 ball handlers....Eric Gordon is 2x as good as the 2nd best net right now
"&gt;Not a ridiculous argument at all lmfao they had shaun livingston who was still excellent back then, ridiculous argument by you  Livingston can't shoot, which means the Warriors refrained from using him in their small lineups.  &gt;Looney still was going to get minutes regardless, he got minutes the next season in the series too. Not sure why you think iggy is on the floor at all times  Sure, but he played a lot more than he would have if Iguodala was healthy. And lol, I'm pointing out that when you have a guy who normally plays around 30 minutes, those minutes are going somewhere when he is out. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they went to Bell and Looney (who isn't bad, but was overmatched against Houston).   &gt;You’re really using that as an excuse? The warriors had looney in the paint, we had capella in the paint with Draymond playing free safety. The same shit applies. You make no sense  The issue is the Warriors would normally play small for very long stretches of the game, which they couldn't do with Iguodala out. How do you not get this?   &gt;That’s on them for abandoning there strategy, they had livingston so they still could have done it.  No, because the spacing doesn't work there. Livingston can't shoot.   &gt;You’re really overrating iguadolas defense, harden put up 35 on 60% TS the next series with iguadola playing every game, we just ended up losing because we were worse that season  That was a year later lol. Harden didn't shoot well with Iguodala guarding him in 2018, and neither did CP3. Are you really contesting that Iguodala is a huge upgrade over Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney??  &gt; “A bit of defense” lmao just admit you didn’t watch a second of lrmam play. He was easily our best defender or second behind tucker.  Yes ""a bit of defense"". Tucker and Ariza were both excellent, and Gordon was serviceable. Replacing LRMAM's minutes with those guys isn't some big downgrade.   &gt;I’m not arguing we were better or even more talented, I’m arguing that we deserved to win that series and you’re not going to say we didn’t because they were missing a 5 PPG old man compared to an allstar and a role player.  You didn't deserve to win the series first of all. Injuries are part of the game. The team that ""deserves"" to win is the team that actually went out there and got it done. Secondly, the injury to Iguodala was simply more impactful compared to LRMAM. There is simply no way you can argue that the downgrade from Iguodala to Looney and Bell (especially on defense) is the same as the downgrade from LRMAM to PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, and Eric Gordon. Combine that with the Warriors being unable to play small, which was by far their best lineup for years, and the downgrade is simply much larger. Houston was going home regardless of health. I'm sure you won't agree, so let's just agree to disagree. We'll never know who would have won for sure. You have your opinions, and I have mine."
"Which Rockets team are you talking about specifically?  The 2016-17 team was basically comprised of Harden-Pat Beverley-Trevor Ariza-Ryan Anderson-Clint Capela-Eric Gordon as its main rotation.   I don’t think a lineup of KD-Joe Harris-Bruce Brown-Blake Griffin-Nick Claxton any less talented.  Citing their PPG during a season in which they played with three guys that averaged 25+ doesn’t make much sense because of course their scoring burden was lessened. I’m talking talent and tools.  Claxton is in his second season to Clint’s third at the time, Joe Harris is the best shooter on either team, Blake’s passing out of the short role would have been huge for that Rockets team (as would Jeff Green’s ability to attack the rim or dish to shooters)."
Eric Gordon
"&gt; he's always hurt and in street clothes. And it's a fact. Guys consistently injured every year.   He's really not. He might get the occasional minor injury here and there, just like many players in the league, but this idea that he's ""consistently injured every year"" is just false. He had a bunch of injuries early in his career, but so did virtually everyone on those Pelicans teams (Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Ryan Anderson, etc), and it's probably because the Pelicans were the only team in the league that didn't have their own training or medical staff. Instead they were just borrowing the football guys from the Saints to handle that, no joke.   AD's injury this year was not only the biggest injury of his career, but was his first major injury in 5 years, and I'm guessing the 6 week off-season probably had something to do with it. People just want to laugh at the Lakers is all this is."
"&gt;he wanted Dwight Howard to come and run Pick and Roll. Howard instead wanted to post up and put up his own empty stats, intentionally fuck up screens before getting injured and missing a shitload of games.     Exactly. James Harden wanted him and the front office got him. That he didn't work out exactly the way Harden wanted him to is not on Morey. Plus, Nash had the exact same problem with Dwight in LA. Why did Harden think he'd be any different in Houston?   &gt;yes, and they almost won the chip when he was healthy. but then his hamstring went, he played horribly, and he kept barking at everyone even though he was shooting 30% from the field and cost them a series.     Again, how is this on the front office? Chris Paul has one bad series and Harden decides he's had enough of him? Why couldn't they work out their issues and run it back?   &gt;I don't understand this on a couple of levels. The role players he played with weren't elite. Harden made them LOOK elite on occassion, but under Moreyball the whole idea is that roleplayers switch on defense and they shoot 3s. Which elite roleplayers shot even 40% from 3? They just shot a lot of them all on the back of Harden's drive and kick game - which many, many teams do. 3&amp;D isn't just a Harden thing.     Capela was an excellent roll man and rim protector. PJ Tucker and Ariza were great switch defenders and a big part of the reason why the Warriors were forced to go into KD-iso mode for that series. Eric Gordon provided a great scoring punch off the bench and was a more than capable defender. If you want to critique their shooting percentages in that series, you also can't ignore the fact that Harden's TS% was 54%.   I'm sorry but if you want wing players who provide that level of effort on D and can also shoot 40% from 3, you're gonna have to pay a lot more than the 7-8 million. The Rockets probably wouldn't have been able to afford CP3 then.  &gt;not when they were supposed to be serious about winning a title. they had plenty of moves to make to solidify those teams with CP3. Tillman didn't want to pay tax and he didn't want to give up picks to fortify the team until Harden threatened to leave; which is why they attached picks to CP3 to get WB - it was a desperate move, rather than using those same picks to get actual elite roleplayers to play with them in 2018 and 2019.     But they were serious about winning a title, which is why they went to the conference finals twice in a loaded conference, won about 7 playoff series and posted 5 50-win seasons in the 8 seasons he was there. Morey made the best moves possible. His whole philosophy has always been to get the best player on the market. That's why they made the trade for Westbrook. Do you think that if he had been more stingy with his first round picks, Harden would've been more inclined to stay? Or that they would've traded for Chris Paul in the first place?   Fertitta definitely could've and should've been more willing to go into the tax but that's an ownership problem. The front office did everything they could've for Harden. They really valued his input and made plenty of personnel decisions based off of it, which is more than you can say of a lot of franchise players. Given how involved he was in that process, don't you think he should be held more accountable for their perceived failures, especially for not patching things up with Chris Paul?"
Rondo? Eric Gordon? Tyreke Evans?  They gave him some good players lol. He was either always unhealthy or couldn’t carry a scoring load.
"Jrue Holiday, DeMarcus Cousins, Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Austin Rivers, Rondo, Lopez.   He wasn’t playing with all scrubs lmao"
One time we gave them Otis Thorpe for Clyde Drexler.        Maybe they could use Eric Gordon.
"Yep, New Orleans *finally* hired their own training and medical staff back in the summer of 2019 after literally years of just borrowing the football guys from the Saints. I've always felt like them not using actual basketball experts was a big part of why so many of their players got hurt every year (Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Anthony Davis, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, etc).   As for the Suns this year, I think at least part of the credit for their health should go to the long layoffs they had last year. They had 113 days off from the stoppage in March till the bubble training camp started in July. Then they had a month of training together, played two weeks worth of games, and then got another 131 days off until this season started. Between having 9 months off like the teams that weren't invited to the bubble and only getting 6 weeks off like some teams in the bubble, I think Phoenix had an absolutely ideal setup coming into this season."
"I don’t know about you but I’d rather have Dragic, Odom, Scola and Kevin Martin over Eric Gordon, Kaman and Aminu."
Eric Gordon has that man figured out
lol yeah Eric Gordon completely locked him up. That 2018 team especially was stacked with great defenders.
Don’t get upset that Eric Gordon put your star in jail.
"I said that because you said ""Mitchell's rise since last year's playoffs."" Nothing whatsoever to do with Wade, no idea why you took it that way for no reason lol, that's why I said I feel like you're doing the victim thing cuz you're being really sensitive, and I'm over here actively praising both guys.   And all I said was ""he's always been that good,"" and I talked about the rookie playoff series as why. And you either didn't know that, or you forgot, because, he really has been this good ever since he got drafted.   Mitchell just gets absolutely fucking bodied by Eric Gordon when they play lmao. Glad he's not around to deal with.  And no, you're not talking sports lol, you're very blatantly looking to argue. Its why you automatically took offense, and to a guy telling you word for word, *no offense intended* no less."
Except this time he’s passing to 3 40% long range shooters instead of PJ Tucker and eric gordon lol
"now that eric gordon is outta the picture, Tucker has taken over the #1 spot for Resting Bitch Face"
Would you say yes to Wiggins and Minny pick for Wood and Eric Gordon? You get off the Wiggins contract and you still keep Wiseman who can take over from Wood eventually or you could flip one of them at a later time
"Houston would have been fine. Definitely not amazing. Westbrook struggled a lot with injuries at the beginning of the year. Eric Gordon was hurt, PJ was terrible offensively, Danuel House was hurt, Christian Wood got hurt. It would have been Harden carrying mediocre role players to a fine record and getting knocked out in the first round."
Aaron Gordon not Eric. You had me so confused
The only thing that made Eric Gordon good in Orlando was nothing short of absolute Magic
On the real   Eric Gordon used to put the clamps on Mitch back in 2018/2019 series  The stat I always remember is Spida shooting like 14% from the field with EG as his primary defender 1v1
"Christian Wood,  Eric Gordon for Wiggins and the Minny pick  Warriors get two guys who can help them compete"
Somebody in the West better trade for Eric Gordon to stop Mitchell.
"More that it was Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Mbah Moute, then Danuel House, etc..  Rockets were loaded with great defenders"
As long as the opposition doesn’t have Eric Gordon best believe Mitchell is gonna cook you.
"""Eric Gordon"" we pick up a new guard at the last second or somethin?"
He deserves it no doubt but curry also did he doesn’t have a mpj or Eric Gordon and they lost like 8 less games than them. Was very close imo
Rivers played well iirc when he got some more touches and handling duties. He had a good stretches whenever Eric Gordon would miss games.
"I think for small guards (under 6-3l we will see the raise of thick builds like Eric Gordon, Bledsoe, Mitchell, FVV, Lowry, CP3. Their base allows them to guard way bigger players.   If you're built like Pat Bev, 170 lbs 6-1, you can't play"
Can’t forget about Eric “unanticipated storm” Gordon
"Ik I watched the series, very big Eric Gordon fan I am"
"Harden isn’t the coach, he doesn’t choose how the team plays, no it’s not his fault. Eric Gordon has proven multiple times that he is better than just a catch and shoot player but when you force him into a relegated role of course he’s going to lose confidence and regress."
"You are absolutely correct. That’s one very underrated aspect of the lakers run last year—rondo was absolutely huge for them. Obviously they needed Bron and AD to be the stars that they are to win, but there was a very close correlation between how well rondo played and whether they won. Especially in the playoffs.   It’s so important in the playoffs because the game slows down, and when you don’t have creators the halfcourt playoff offense with your stars on the bench is a huge issue. I think last years rockets mainly had that issue because Eric gordon wasn’t healthy most of the season, he was that guy for them."
"I mean the Hornets are right there, I’m sure the Wolves or Rockets wouldn’t mind him either. There are teams in the league that could absorb his contract for a pick.   Hell, if you can get Eric Gordon for him it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world."
Maybe prime Eric Gordon but not the one that exists now.
Maybe a guy like...Eric Gordon?
Would have to attach some assets. And I'm not a GM so I don't know if the value would be 1 or 2 protected firsts or whatever... BUT  They should trade KP to the Rockets for Christian Wood and Eric Gordon. I think both of their games would fit well with Luka. Rockets aren't going to be good for a few years anyways so bring back some draft picks.
Eric Gordon
"There are too many factors to consider to be able to put the blame solely on the system. When Harden went down when we had CP3, we had CP3 who played our system a little differently and we had Eric Gordon who stepped up. When we were without both CP3 and Harden, we played a completely different game at a much slower pace without a primary singular ball handler, and we still won games.  It just depends on how the coach adjusts based on the roaster they have. I think what OP is talking about says a whole lot more about the coach and the GM than it does the system."
"Fuck it. Porzingis for eric gordon and some throw ins to match the salary, lmfao. We’ll be probably bad but we’ll be bad in style hahahha. Porzingis-Wall-Wood-KPJ-Tate/KMJ. And if any get hurt (since at least 3 are kinda injury prone), well it’s not my money anyway and we can tank for more picks while developing Tate, KPJ, KMJ, and this year’s pick."
"haha yeah man! if harden gave up the ball and ran around screens more we would have totally seen eric gordon, trevor ariza, and ryan anderson blossom into all-stars 😍 it’s his fault they never developed 😤"
Luka can carry a team to the playoffs with no one else who can create a shot for himself or others on his team when it matters most.  He’s essentially 2017 James Harden without Eric Gordon right now.
"incredibly goofy exchange, sounds like something you'd read in a terrible video game script. get eric gordon and dion waiters to act this out."
Trade Porzingis for Eric Gordon and Christian Wood. Both are competent and the Rockets front office might be open to doing dumb shit and tanking.
Loool Eric Gordon is a walking meme  Have you heard his voice
He apparently hasn’t seen Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon
Clearly you have not seen eric gordon play
Eric Gordon
Houston Harden vs the Jazz is pretty scary.  Now imagine largely a similar squad and playstyle with Kyrie and KD instead of an out-of-prime CP3 and Eric Gordon.  I think Utah's only shot would be to be red hot from 3 for 4 different games.
"What have the Chicago Bulls done in that time frame? James Harden’s second and third options in 2017 were Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly and they were up against Kawhi Leonard, Manu, TP, and Lamarcus Aldridge. Kawhi missed game 6 but LMA was still an ALL NBA caliber player. There’s a reason why the Spurs nearly broke the home record.There’s also a lot more to the 0-27 bs. Chris Paul was out and the refs made questionable calls and no calls that forced HOU to switch to perimiter over rim, of which one of the 3s during the 0-27 wasn’t counted when Harden drained a 3+1 over Klay but the refs called it as a foul before the shot went off causing the possession to reset. That shit changes momentum.Fuck you want him to do, take down Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Kevin Durant by himself? Don’t come at me with that bs."
That's a load of crap. Shooting a lot of 3s was the only reason they were able to compete with the KD Warriors despite having a way inferior roster to them. Nobody wanted PJ Tucker or Eric Gordon pulling up for 2.  The reason they don't have a title is CP3's health. That team was dominant.
"Ah Ben Gordon. Right up there with Gerald green, Eric Gordon and monta Ellis as the most unstoppable shooting guards on 2k13"
" &gt;Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry.  Ya pre cp3. A lot of those guys weren't there at that time lol. And Lou for one season... pi tucker didn't become a decent shooter till much later."
"If I recall correctly, I read on Twitter there’s been three of those from Breen in NBA history  Steph against OKC, Luka against LAC, Eric Gordon against UTA  To be fair I don’t think I’ve ever heard the Gordon one, or at least I don’t remember it. If anyone has a clip of Breen saying it I’d appreciate if you linked it"
"Bullshit. Trevor Ariza, PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Ryan Anderson, Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, etc. Rockets fans are the most whiny in the league, you’ve had the best point guards along with Harden and some of the best role players in the league.  You were owned by Golden State, Harden didn’t lack help, you were owned by Steph Curry."
Also Eric Gordon got one in his 50 pts game iirc
Kelvin Sampson? I thought he did well...until the scandals of course (the dude got Eric Gordon right from under the Illini's noses lol)
"You know who this “point of view” benefits the most? Like, which current player would get the biggest boost in his reputation?  Not Steph, but the guy he kept beating, **JAMES HARDEN**  Of all the accomplishments he’s had, especially since the 2016-17 season has always had asterisks in critics minds because he never won a championship.  He led a team with Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson as his best scoring teammates to a 50+ win season.  He was a Chris Paul hammy away and an unbelievable 27 straight threes missed from advancing to the Finals and most likely winning that year.  He had an absurd scoring streak of 30 straight games of 30 plus points because his team was rotating in and out of the injured list.  But nope, at the end of the day he’s never won a championship"
"A mix of bad coaching and literally being the worst matchup the Jazz can ask for.   Plus the Rockets always had our number no matter who was on the court. Eric Gordon dropped 50 without Harden or Russ, if I remember correctly. It’s just one of those things that some franchises can’t ever run away from."
Bruh Steph had Klay Draymond and KD  Harden in 2017 averaged a career high 11 assists when his best teammates were Eric Gordon and Clint Capela. Due to his efficiency and the fact that he won a lot of games I truly believe he should have been the 2017 MVP
"From a pure Harden perspective, 2019 was probably more impressive because of CP3's weird one season decline. He was playing Golden State even with Eric Gordon as his second best player.  Honestly I felt like both series turned on Draymond vs Capela. Draymond would just completely dominate that matchup.   Also Iggy going 5-8 in Game 6 from 3 and then missing his next 12 3s :("
"I’m saying they were past they’re prime during the season also, harden just made them look better.  The two good players I mentioned (CP3 and capella) still look good without harden. Those were his supporting cast. The rest pretty much look like dogshit, unless you need a good defender in pj Tucker. I really wish we could’ve traded Eric Gordon. He’s so overrated."
kyries range is underrated. reminds me of how eric gordon would always decide to shoot hella deep threes for no reason but kyrie actually makes them
Harden-Austin Rivers-Eric Gordon-PJ Tucker-Kenneth Faried
Harden averaged 11 assists in 2017 when his best players were Eric Gordon and a young Clint Capela try again
"Haha you think I'm stupid. The Rockets got to game 7 with Chris Paul and Eric Gordon making some very big shots in the last minutes, not Harden. Harden had 2 opportunities to close out the Warriors that year. Had bad games in both of them. You forgot about the Spurs series and the Blazers series beyond the KD-less Warriors handling him. Nice try."
"Of course, the three headed monster: Curry, Doncic and Eric Gordon"
nah eric gordon had one too im pretty sure
Too pricey for them. Someone like a Norm Powell would have been perfect. They don’t need another star as much as a quality scorer.  Maybe a cheaper version of Eric Gordon
Nah eric gordon is a bull driving to the basket. Zingis is bricking midrange jumpers against guys a foot shorter than him
eric gordon is solid
Eric Gordon actually can score lol
Eric Gordon plays/played defense.
Dudes just a 7’3 Eric Gordon out there
Upgrading from an injured post-covid Russ and Eric Gordon  to rhe greatest ball handler of all time and one of the greatest scorers of all time is quite a jump
Bigger contract than Eric Gordon got
"Don’t worry, Eric Gordon isn’t playing in these playoffs."
Harden wasn’t even the most highly touted SG in his high school class. That honor would go to Eric Gordon of all people.
"No, it wasn't. His midrange shooting was an analomy but he's been consistently great on an individual level despite playing along shittily constructed &amp; injured Pels teams vs top tier teams (the 67-15 Warriors who won it all and the KD Warriors who won it all).  Jrue, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Boogie Cousins and pretty much all relevant players on those Pels teams were always going down with injuries; the Pels medical staff is famous for having bad injury luck."
"Those rosters also had very few weak links, even the smaller guys (curry, CP3, Eric Gordon) would compete their ass off even when switched onto bigger players"
Eric Gordon for whatever salary and their own 1st and I think rox will throw in Tate
"lebron, ad, cp3, kawhi, kd sorta (if you don’t count his warrior years he only gets marginally worse on average) eric gordon also surprisingly is a beast in the playoffs. rondo…can’t really think of anyone else off the toppa my head"
"Yes - next year and the following. They also have John Wall and Eric Gordon making almost $70 mil a year combined for the next 2 years. Next year (and maybe the following) are the years to tank, especially if they lose their pick this year to the Thunder. Then starting in '24, they owe protected picks to the Thunder"
"Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, and Eric Gordon and Lou Williams"
Also Eric Gordon and Lou Williams lol
Rockets won 14 more games than the previous year (they were the 8-seed the year before and lost in the first round to the Warriors in 5). Everyone clowned on their offseason because Dwight left and they overpaid for Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson.   Vegas pre-season win projections for the Rockets were 41.5. Thunder were 45.5. Somehow by the end of the year though the Thunder supporting cast had become significantly worse than the Rockets in the minds of the media.
"But what if Wall is the salary matching component?   You actually have a reasonably cheap roster atm. If you could dump Eric Gordon somewhere you'd be in a good spot.    Player| Contract ---|--- Dame|43,750,000 Wood|13,666,667 House|3,894,000	 Porter Jr.| 2,130,240 Tate| 1,517,981 Martin Jr.| 1,517,981 Augustin|7,000,000 **TOTAL** |**73,476,869** **Cap Space**|**38,523,131**  Dame brings over an all-star friend + Room MLE + Vet Mins. Plus two more FRPs in this year's draft plus others you've still got from the Harden trade.    Only issue with this is that Dame would cost a lot more than just the #2."
"&gt;He took KD Warriors to 7 with just pretty much no help  In their 3 wins vs GS in 2018, Harden had 76 total points on 25/71 shooting, 6/38 from 3, with 11 assists and 12 turnovers lmao.  CP3 was their best player (hence why they fell apart and blew double digit halftime leads in back to back games without him) and Eric Gordon had a career best series + they had Capela, PJ Tucker and Ariza too btw"
I don't even hate Eric Bledsoe. I was just disappointed in him. Gordon though? Fuck him.
"They need Eric Gordon to complete it! He is a great player AND thick! Do it for the memes, don’t look at what he is being paid!"
"Ye Harden played with so many bums recently - two of his former teammates are as of right now playing h2h in the final, another one was in the ecf. All having keyroles on their teams. Not to name Eric Gordon, Westbrook, Ariza etc. All good players.."
"AD only had a good team around him in NOLA like 1 year in 2018 due to injuries and poor management. And that year his co-star went down with an Achilles tear. And in 2015, a 21 year old AD averaged 31.5/11 with 3 blks/1.3 steals per game on 61 TS%.   With his 2 best players being Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans….against the champion Golden State. I’d take AD over those other guys because he’s a 30/11 career guy with elite efficiency and DPOY caliber defense. Unless we think the likes of Quincy Pondexter, Norris Cole and Norris Cole is comparable to a good roster."
Either one of those guys gets traded but that's about it. I've heard rumors of trading our pick for a vet but nothing really comes to mind (if we end up swapping that pick for Eric fucking Gordon I'll die inside).
I love the expressions PJ and Eric Gordon give after a foul call
Eric Gordon was significantly more useful in that series than Kevon Looney. Gordon was already getting starter level run when Paul went down whereas Looney was an 18 MPG guy suddenly thrust into the starting role. The drop off from Iguodala's perimeter defense to Looney's is worse than any aspect of going from Chris Paul to Eric Gordon
"Would the Rockets consider 2 overall and Eric Gordon for 3 overall and Sexton? I feel like that helps both teams. Rockets get a G plus the 3rd pick, go get Mobley. Young core of Sexton/Porter/Tate/Mobley/Wood. And Cavs can take Green, who fits perfectly next to Garland. Plus Gordon brings a vet presence at SF, a positional need (and the Rockets get him off their books)"
"Didn’t say he was trash, but yes he is very overpaid.  Just like Eric Gordon’s contract is a negative for the Rockets. I still think Gordon is a good 3&amp;D role player but he’s definitely overpaid. And he makes like 6-8 million less than CJ (yes I realize CJ &gt;Eric but point still stands).  Look all over this thread man, I’m certainly not the only one saying CJ’s contract is a negative so acting like I made a scorching hot take is just silly."
"You're an idiot, kid. But ya, guess I forgot those mighty rockets squads pre-cp3 were stacked with talent; e.g., '16 when the second leading scorer was Eric Gordon averaging an astounding 16ppg."
"In the final season they surrounded Harden with John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, and Christian Wood. They were telling Harden that the window was closed"
That’s misleading. The best shooter harden had was eric gordon and he was insanely inconsistent. Tucker/ariza are average shooters. Pre KD the warriors had klay obviously but dray was shooting near 40% that year they went 73-9. Barnes was hitting. Iggy would hit some. They had shooting
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
"Eric Bledsoe, CJ McCollum, Aaron Gordon, Marvin Bagley, Andre Drummond"
"I assumed he just forgot to add the #2 pick b/c it would clearly have to be part of any trade with the rockets.  If they prefer Mobley or one of the other guys, and the rockets want Cade, they could work something out.  #2 pick, a future top 3 protected first and Eric Gordon and you still get the guy you think is the best in the draft. It’s a similar deal to what the Celtics got a couple years ago when they swapped 1 and 3 and that worked out pretty well for them."
eric gordon + FRP to move up to 13th would be idiotic by indiana. houston’s gonna need to shell out another pick to make that happen.
"&gt;No he \[Klay\] didn’t \[outplay Harden\] Not an ounce of help for harden  23.4 PPG on 45/44/86 splits and 2 turnovers/game + lockdown defense + winning the series in 5&gt;&gt;26.6 PPG on 41/31/84 splits and 5 turnovers per game.  &gt;My ass lmao. Harden was suppose to beat 4 allstars by himself without Cp3 lol?  Firstly, ""by himself"" is very disingenous here. Harden had 2 great defenders/good role players in PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza + Eric Gordon playing the best playoff series of his life and Clint Capela.  And I mean yeah you guys would have won if not for the massive B2B meltdowns in games 6 and 7. Ya'll were up 17 after the first quarter and up 10 at halftime of game 6 then ended up losing by 29. You were only down 7 going into the 4th quarter of game 6 then Harden had 0 points on 0/2 shooting with 2 turnovers in the 4th quarter, which you got outscored by 22 in.  Game 7 obviously was the 27 straight missed 3s with 10 by Harden game, which you also blew a double digit halftime lead in. And again, there's no way to say that having CP3 guarantees you would have won. Maybe you don't get off to such a fast start in either game if he plays."
Why on earth would you want 32 year old Eric Gordon Jr. and a first instead of Cade.
&gt; What part of no team wants an undersized shooting guard are you having trouble with?  Mainly that it's wrong.  - Jason Terry was traded for Antoine Walker directly off two all-star bids.  - Jeff Hornacek was the primary piece the Suns traded for Charles Barkley.   - Jamal Crawford was traded for Al Harrington back when he had averaged roughly 18ppg over the previous three years.   - Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman were the main pieces in a trade for Chris Paul.
"The website is absolute cancer so here’s the [clip](https://twitter.com/oldmanandthree/status/1407503008204722176?s=21) of him discussing his goals on JJ Reddick’s podcast.  Still in shock that we won the lottery, btw - though i can certainly be swayed into giving cade up if the rockets are generous enough to offer eric gordon and a future first"
Why do Pistons fans keep mentioning Eric Gordon?   We’re tryna trade him and our late pick to Indiana for their pick not Detroit’s   EG and #2 for #1 makes no sense at all
So they're not giving us Eric Gordon for Cade? Shucks
Dont think some people are realizing how good the offer would have to be for them to even consider moving down. Eric Gordon and the 13th pick is a completely unserious offer. SGA to move down to 6 is an actual real offer and I still would probably ultimately say no if Im Det.
"Real talk, is eric Gordon even a good asset that they can get a mid first rounder for him?"
Eric Gordon?  Does that add anything to the deal?
Notable positive trade asset Eric Gordon   Maybe 2 years ago
A team would give up a higher pick for eric gordon? o\_O
Who the fuck thinks Eric Gordon still has value?
blink twice if Eric Gordon is holding you hostage
How about just Eric Gordon for the no.1 straight up…
Just shoot me in the face if we move down just to get old ass Eric Gordon.
Use a late first to dump Eric Gordon is what my brain first saw…
Are the rockets so delusional that they think Eric Gordon is some positive asset?
It's Eric Gordon post-trade. Ask New Orleans how well that went back when Gordon was still on his rookie deal.
"Does anyone really view injury prone, 32 year old Eric Gordon whose getting paid 40 million over the next 2 years as a positive asset??"
"Does anyone really view injury prone, 32 year old Eric Gordon whose getting paid 40 million over the next 2 years as a positive asset??"
"So Eric Gordon, a late first round pick and the 2nd pick for the first pick? That sounds like a bad trade…"
Eric Gordon and a late first is not that attractive lol
"Wow, I forgot Eric Gordon existed. Is he still any good? I feel like he'd be a good trade chip to offer a bunch of teams if he has any gas in the tank."
lmaoo what? Eric Gordon?
Eric Gordon?? Lmao.
Late first+expensive ass Eric Gordon? Who doesn’t say yes to this elite package?
"They should pick a role player who worked with the coaching staff last season so it's an easier transition: Eric Gordon, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, or Malcolm Brogdon."
Is Eric Gordon even a positive asset? He's missed a lot of games the last 2 years and is 32 and on an 19M/year contract for 3 more years.
That Eric Gordon contract is trash Lol. Its gonna take an unprotected from a future year to get to #1
LOL Eric Gordon and a late 1st might net an expiring contract. That's some wishful thinking hoping to get #13.
"more Ford on the Rockets:  ""[The Rockets have] dangled Eric Gordon and one of their late first round picks to the Pacers in exchange for the No. 13 pick in hopes that a combination of 2 and 13 would be enough for the Pistons to move down one spot in the draft.""  https://twitter.com/SalmanAliNBA/status/1415711366170791938"
"""Rockets have dangled Eric Gordon and one of their late first round picks to the Pacers in exchange for the No. 13 pick in hopes that a combination of 2 and 13 would be enough for the Pistons to move down one spot in the draft."""
Come get Eric Gordon we don't want him damnit
"The comparison was always so wild, and people just kept running with it so irresponsibly no matter how obviously not true it was lol. ESPN's Paul Biancardi wrote a whole article about it, and Yahoo wrote an article about whether Bronny, a 6-foot rising freshman at the time, was an actual NBA prospect. I kind of imagined that Bronny would become like, a big, 6'3-6'4"" (without shoes) guard with a big frame like Bradley Beal, Eric Gordon or Jrue Holiday even if he didn't get as tall as LeBron, just because LeBron is so massive and Savannah isn't small really. But he looks kind of done growing at a legit 6'2"" and with average length and a much slimmer/shorter torso than those guys. His arms seem very small. There's a chance he has one last growth spurt, and I think that would change things and make him an NBA prospect if it gives him more bulk and 2 more inches, but can't expect that. I've watched LeBron his freshman and sophomore years, and he was just a ridiculous freak from day 1, and it was obvious. He was incredibly fluid like Michael Jordan or Kobe. He could change directions effortlessly and he was incredibly fast and on-balance and quick at all times. He could jump, but that part didn't even come all the way in until after his sophomore season. His frame was huge and he looked gangly and like he was still filling out even though he was already huge. bronny has always looked kind of heavy footed and kind of lacked the fluidity and explosiveness of a potential high major guard prospect or an NBA guy. However, he is a great defender, with solid passing skills and he plays a lot better than his highlights suggest."
"Eric Gordon I believe, Mike Conley was hobbled and I forgot what was wrong with the Rockets. In the finals 2 of the top 3 players were gone. Not to diminish what the Warriors had to do to win those playoffs that year, it's not the dubs fault that the other teams weren't healthy."
For the money he's asking for you don't risk on anything less than a sure thing. We don't need Eric Gordon and tyreke Evans part two.
He averaged 11 assists as well in the regular season. Probably would have won the assist title if he didn't get hurt seeing as those would have gone up once KD returned to the lineup  Also did 11 in 2017 passing to Eric Gordon and Lou Williams and won assist title that year
How is it karma for Eric Gordon not wanting to sign there. He was traded for CP3 then had a “knee injury” and missed almost the entire year and got a team to sign him to a max deal under the requirement of publicly saying that his heart was in that city (thanks for the max)  Lonzo just gonna try to do the same about getting the max or close to it. He just won’t be a bitch like Gordon on what New Orleans might or might not do with him.  Lakers treated Lonzo far worse than New Orleans. Only difference is everyone wants to live in Los Angeles.
"I didn’t trade for anything, so you can stop typing in a voice as if I have anything to do with the Pelicans’ decision making.  Eric Gordon *isnt* trash, our fanbase hates him because he literally skipped on rehab to get back at our organization for not letting him walk, costing himself more than anything else. He won 6th man of the year in Houston. He’s not an allstar, but he was a key player on a contender. He’s not trash, THATS YOU clearly trying to bullshit to paint me in a bad light.  I didn’t say Mirotic was great. But he’s a good role player. He’s better than Enes Kanter coming off the bench. He helped torch the Blazers when the Pels swept them.   Portland didn’t put LMA next to Dame. He was in Portland since 2006. Dame was drafted in 2012. And he left 2 years later. How many Allstars has Dame played with other than LMA? That would be 0.   Is CJ and Nurkic really a lot better than Holiday and Mirotic? Or Holiday and Cousins? Or Holiday and Randle?   I don’t hate AD or blame him for leaving, the team missed on signings all the time, and the ones they didn’t miss on got hurt. That’s why they literally fired every member of management from the AD era.  Also your Zion take is horrible. He’s 21. He’s played 85 games. “The Pels are wasting him.” Lmao he was so out of shape his first year he couldn’t even play. He was virtually a rookie this year. How the fuck do you waste a rookie? Steven Adams is a starting caliber center on a 2 year contract at 17mil. He’s going to be salary for trade filler."
I think times of changed from the Eric Gordon situation players have way more influence and control. It will be a S/T probably
"He’s a restricted free agent anyway. Either he takes the qualifying offer (almost never happens with even the best players, let alone someone with Lonzo’s injury history) or the Pelicans can keep him if they choose to match whatever deal he signs elsewhere. Doesn’t really matter what he wants (like when Eric Gordon wanted to leave NO to sign with the Suns). It’s weird how so much of this sub doesn’t get that  EDIT: Gordon even asked the Hornets (at the time) to let him leave for the Suns and they didn’t let him go Lmao"
Eric Gordon is trash. Your fan base fucking hates him for a reason but you are clearly ignoring that to try and paint Ad in a worse light.   Mirotic is not great. He was a role player who was -30 for the bucks in his last playoff series in the nba.    You traded for half a season of cousins after wasting almost a decade of Ad. That’s a case of too little too late.  Why not list all the dumb shit free agents your team signed to “help AD”. Asik? Solomon hill? The list goes on with awful overpays for trash or mediocre players who handicapped your cap space     &gt;Portland is a consistent playoff team because of dame   Why not take a peek at who dame played with. CJ McCollum and LMA for example are better than 99% of the people AD had to share a court with.   The Pelicans front office was and still is trash. They’re already wasting zion as it is with dumb shit like extending Steven adams
"I mean Jrue Holiday and Eric Gordon and Demarcus Cousins and Nico Mirotic are all good help. They had a good 3&amp;D wing in Quincy Pondexter who got a staff infection after surgery and never played again. They find another good 3&amp;D wing prospect in Bryce Dejean-Jones who was shot and killed. They did put help next to him, it just didn’t work out.  The 76ers hid Jrue Holiday’s leg injury from Pels in the trade, and their owner lost a law suite in court and had to pay the Pels 3mil in court ordered payments for damages, and the league had to make new rules regarding the transfer of medical records for trades. That Injury plagued him for years, he basically had 2 years of his career lost to it, then he missed another year because his wife had a brain tumor. Like what are they supposed to do? They got Julius Randle too, who carried the Knicks to the playoff just a year later.   Portland is a consistent playoff team because of dame, the team around him isn’t all that good."
"Yeah, that's not true. Morey has a list of bad trade/returns that the city of Houston hasn't forgotten. The Ryan Anderson contract, the Eric Gordon extension, giving up a first rounder for Terrence Williams, drafting Royce White and Marcus Morris.  He's hit some home runs but in no way is his reputation ""god-tier"""
"I’d say three: Steph, Dame, and Trae.   Lebron and Eric Gordon are next on the list of 30 foot three frequency, but both only shoot half as many as Trae."
what did Raptor have Christian Woods and Eric Gordon?
why would anyone want eric gordon? expiring contract?
Doesn’t Eric Gordon play for the Bucks? /s
"Wait are you saying the Rockets are offering Eric Gordon to the Pistons for the first round pick, even if you swap the picks that still playing low ball big time."
What are you talking about didn’t you read the post? They offered Eric Gordon!!! lmao
And that extra asset is…. Eric Gordon?????
"This Eric Gordon is some kind of something. Boy, this Eric Gordon is all anyone is talking about. So sick and tired of hearing how brilliant that Eric Gordon is."
um they could have Eric Gordon hello
"There is a reason why milwaukee got rid of Eric Gordon and replaced him with Jrue Holiday. You draft Cade on the rookie contract.  Don't be foolish to trade for a mid tier caliber player like Gordon.  Houston would have to offer 3 unprotected first round picks, including the 2nd pick this draft, to begin the conversation for the #1 pick."
But they could have ERIC GORDON plus the number one pick leftovers. /s
"Wiseman is younger now than Ayton was when we was drafted. Look at the list of players who have gone 7 overall in the last few years, Steph, Jamal Murray, Julias Randle, Killian Hayes, Harrison Barnes, Eric Gordon, Harrison Barnes  It actually has one of the highest hit rates of any draft pick"
"they dont know bout Eric ""Cade Cunningham"" Gordon"
"But that's not what the OP I replied to originally is saying, nor did the article state a 3 way trade. And even then the cost of getting rid of EG's contract $58M/3 is going to be expensive. There's virtually nothing the Rockets could offer the Pistons that they would want, and who'd give up anything of value in a 3 way team trade for Eric Freakin' Gordon?"
Can't forget Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon is the way.
It really depends whether they like Mobley better than Cade. Cade’s going number 1 so trading down to get your guy is the move. Not sure if Eric Gordon is the right guy to offer though lol
What does Cade do better than Eric Gordon?  Will he ever develop his face to be rounder than Gordon’s? I highly doubt it.
"""*Would anyone be interested in an Eric Gordon?*"" - Rockets  ""*Why?*"" - Everyone Else"
1st overall pick for 2nd overall and Eric Gordon? Seems like a punt trade in fantasy
Lmao yeah Eric Gordon really moving the needle
"Idk if they changed it. When I first read the article, it said Houston was looking for the 1st pick with talks involving Eric Gordon.   Obviously it wouldn't just be him involved but it was funny."
Article mentioned Eric Gordon lmao.. what is he supposed to offer the Pistons at this point?
Eric gordon has been in trade rumors for like 3 years
LFG Eric Gordon for Cade 1 for 1
Westbrook Harden and Eric Gordon isn't the greatest defensive lineup. It gets worse when you realize the big on the floor was Robert Covington.
"They ran small ball 3 guard lineups frequently last season with Harden, Westbrook and Eric Gordon. Austin Rivers also played with Harden and Westbrook. They had Robert Covington as the big in that lineup.  They occasionally ran CP3, Harden and Eric Gordon, however, they didn't do that too often because they had Ariza at the 3."
"Muscular shooters with nice forms - Harden, Eric Gordon, Ben Gordon   Bledsoe was actually near 39% off catch and shots in Milwaukee during the regular season . His form is kinda ugly tho"
"that's like saying an old ass MJ would still play like the goat if he suited up right now. stop it. that spurs team played basketball where everyone took their shots, but Kawhi was definitely phenomenal.  kevin Martin was only there for 1 season and you're shitting me if you think andre Roberson and Steven adams are good. that OKC team was nothing but durant and westbrook who dealt with injuries cause of pat bev  the houston team that took Durant to 7 games was underrated as hell. Eric gordon was balling out, cp3 was balling out, capela was great, and pj tucker kept hitting all his 3s."
"Actually if they never trade their unprotected first round pick to the Cavs to get rid of Baron Davis they could have got Kyrie #1. You can then probably trade Kyrie for CP3 and keep Eric Gordon (or flip for another wing) or even better don't trade for CP3 and build around Blake, DeAndre and Kyrie on rookie deals."
Eric Gordon + 23rd or 24th pick
"Harden played without Eric Gordon, Clint Capela and Chris Paul for multiple stretches at a time while maintaining elite offensive TEAM efficiency. Curry could shoot crazy well for month and still only had a mediocre one. And again...Curry's hot stretch was for a month and they missed the playoffs. Harden took his team to the 4th seed while averaging 40 for 3 months on elite efficiency."
"CP3 fell off that season, he was playing worse than Eric Gordon  Capela heavily underplayed that series  And Game 6 Curry just turned super saiyan  2018 was the Rockets best chance"
Yea I did and I saw Kobe leading the effort but Artest hit big shot so he gets finals MVP!  This reminds me of someone who tried to tell me Eric Gordon was better in 2018 than James Harden
"&gt;What? This makes no sense the majority of offense is based off ball movement and iso shots are for bail out late shock clock moments not consistent winning basketball.  do you even watch or understand basketball?  Go watch the Nets this year, or the warriors during their 3 peat, Steph generates open shots for Klay, KD, Dray, it doesn't matter, because he can ""create his own shot"" drawing doubles, same goes for KD but his playmaking lacks compared to steph,  this is basic iq, come on dude.  also you don't seem to understand that being able to create your own shot =/= iso ball, it literally means you are a threat which normally draws double teams(look at curry, Lillard, KD, Harden), Klay literally plays the same roll as Eric Gordon did on the Rockets"
"He had more than 30 points or more in 4 of those 6 games, and he never had great teammates in any of those games. Its  2016 against GSW his best teammate was washed up Dwight Howard  2017 against Spurs and in 2018 against GSW his best teammate was Eric Gordon(CP3 was injured in game 7)  2019 his best teammate was CP3 who was pretty bad that year, even Eric Gordon outperformed in playoffs while Harden was averaging 35 points against the KD Warriors  2020 against OKC his best teammate was an injured Westbrook who averaged 14 points on 43% TS that series   Also no idea why you keep downvoting like me having 1 internet point less on reddit matters 💀"
I'll also add that they're trying to sell the fucking team as well because they're under the pump from every other owner who is sick of funding the Hornets put of their own pockets  &amp;nbsp;  A bunch of 30 year old vets who are close to expiring and would leave your city in a heartbeat isn't going to make anyone buy. Eric Gordon looked like he was going to be the #1 SG and the upside of that was going to put butts in seats and that's what made it easier to sell the team.  &amp;nbsp;  But of course the homer you're responding to- like many other Laker fans will always pretend like they want what's in the best interests of 2013 Hornets
Few more:  Eric Gordon/Cam Payne   Trevor Ariza/Torrey Craig  Gerald Green/Cam Johnson (kinda)  Ryan Anderson/Dario Saric
The other players on the team don’t change your natural position tho. Harden is a natural 2. But he played the 1 with Eric Gordon. The 2 with cp3 etc etc.
"I dont think this is a disagreement on Tobias its just about how would the offense look if EG was there instead. I think I would be closer to where you are if we were taking about being some tertiary option in an offense EG might be better at it than Tobias. But for Philly that's not what it would be, Tobias was the no 2 option in the half court and EG would have to be it due to the nature of the limitations of the roster. And Eric Gordon as your no 2 would have alot of the same issues Tobias did while just being worse at it as a shot creator. They asked too much of Tobias as a shot creator which is also why all those limitations showed.    EG will always take more 3s than Tobias but a big part of why his 3 point volume is so high is its a byproduct of others creating those spot up looks. In Philly wouldnt exist nearly the same way especially since he isnt Duncan Robinson moving off ball  exactly"
I liked the idea of Eric Gordon for Danny Green as a fake trade at the deadline before Gordon got hurt....but alas that's always the problem with EG. Im not a big Tobias guy either but this is probably selling too low
eric gordon? gotta be a /s on that 😂
if we trade simmons i would be interested in getting anderson in a second trade  i would have traded tobias 28 and seconds for eric gordon. that was my dream.
"Yeah, it’s this for the most part. Harden was the primary ball handler with absolutely NO secondary ball handler. for many of those years it was Eric Gordon or Beverley as the 2nd best ball handler and neither of them are playmakers. I swear to god every time Gordon got the ball when Harden was on he turned it over.   There’s not many superstars as good as Harden that could carry those Rockets teams before CP3 got there, especially in the West. Harden was getting full court pressure on every possession and he never had a Kyrie or Love to help him out. A washed Dwight with back injuries and then like 3 years of nothing close to an allstar"
"Harden got called a choker the year after 0-27 happened even though he averaged like 35/6/6 and was dueling KD for most of the series for best player. Meanwhile CP3 stunk it up for 5/6 games, capela got played off the floor by a player half a foot shorter and the rest of the team (sans Eric Gordon)can’t even create a shot but harden got the blame"
"&gt;Losing the the Warriors in 2018 is NOT a choke  In game 6 he was up 17 after the 1st quarter and up 10 at halftime. Ended up losing by 29. Game 7 he was up 11 at halftime then missed 10 of the rockets' 27 straight 3s.  &gt;he took them to 7 games  In the Rockets' 3 wins vs GS in 2018, Harden had: 76 points, 11 assists, 12 turnovers on 25/71 FGs, and 6/38 3 pointers. Eric Gordon had 65 points, 4 assists, 1 turnover on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 pointers in the same 3 games.  Does Eric Gordon also get some huge legacy boost for ""taking the 2018 warriors to 7 games"" like Harden gets credit for? Chris Paul was the Rockets leader and best player this series.  &gt;I can easily bring out three bad/terrible game by Superstars recently  No other superstar has the long history of constantly disappointing in big games almost every year like Harden."
Sorry for hating but I don't think Pat Bev and Eric Gordon are really win-now guys anymore. They've done their winning.
"&gt;It's because ESPN forced the narrative that you squandered AD's career  Do you feel like they didn't squander the years they had with AD? Even if you discount the horrible acquisitions via trade and the bad contracts they handed out during those years (Omer Asik anyone?), at the very least they shouldn't have waited till he left before signing a dedicated medical and training staff for the team.   Up until AD left [they had been using the football specialists from the Saints to monitor their basketball players.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/01/08/report-pelicans-medical-staff-panned-for-being-too-football-centric/amp/) That's most likely what led to the Pelicans always being among the league leaders in games missed due to injuries every year. Guys like Eric Gordon (173 missed games in 5 years in NO), Jrue Holiday (159 games missed in 7 seasons there), Ryan Anderson (98 games missed in 4 years there) and Tyreke Evans (45 games missed in 2.5 seasons there) were routinely missing half the season every year with injuries during AD's time there.   It seems to me like the narrative that they squandered AD's career there is a perfectly valid one rather than something ESPN made up. Even former commissioner David Stern said that they were a poorly run team and that [Dell Demps was ""a lousy GM""](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/david-stern-pelicans-dell-demps-a-lousy-general-manager/) who would probably lose AD due to his incompetence. This wasn't just something ESPN invented."
Eric Gordon lost his step 10 years ago and has made the best of what he has left
Eric mf Gordon
You didn’t answer my question. What would you have like to see the rockets do differently the other years they were contenders? Trade Capela? Eric Gordon? Ariza?
"lol right, and we didn't have an Eric Gordon."
"&gt;myself that I couldn’t bring a championship there because that’s what I put the jersey on for every single game. But the community work really lets me see the impact I can have on the city. We’ve been through some tough times with \[Hurricane Harvey\] and all types of things. And just being able to come back now and be there for people and support them, I’m going to do that as long as I can.  As a lifelong rockets fan, I'm glad he did it. We were in for a season of mediocrity and I would've hated to see Harden waste a year of his prime trying to win with John Wall and Eric Gordon. It just wasn't going to happen. Real happy about our rebuild and hoping Harden can get his ring in Brooklyn."
"&gt;all-star g-league roster and put on 2 servicable/good players who can potentially have a monster game, like Eric Gordon and Zach Lavine  Yup this has been tested, the bulls won more than one game sadly"
"I'd just take an all-star g-league roster and put on 2 servicable/good players who can potentially have a monster game, like Eric Gordon and Zach Lavine. I feel like with a bad enough roster, you need both Zach Lavine to drop like 50, Eric Gordon to have like 80% three shooting, and the other team to have an unremarkable night. If the stars align, maybe they a team with a defense poor enough as to where the g-leaguers can maybe contribute, like the Kings.  Edit: Against a top-heavy team like the Mavs, maybe you can have one of your g-leaguers Cobra-Kai the other team's best player and just take the suspension."
"2019 Harden vs the Warriors was the best I've ever seen him play. He had to create on every single play. CP3 had massively declined (Eric Gordon was the 2nd best Rocket in the playoffs).  Harden was going against Klay, Iggy, Draymond every play and he was consistently breaking down the defense on every play.   I thought he was way better than in 2018 (where CP3 was equally good if not better against the Warriors).   And for all the 5 out game the Rockets play, they don't have great shooters (Eric Gordon was the only playable elite shooter)."
"I have no stake in this war but i feel like this post is bad. You cant just compare the numbers. All the bad calls for the Warriors are a lot more 50/50, ""let them play"" playoff basketball type of things.  The bad calls for the Rockets are questionable, and in the case of Eric Gordon getting hammered, which to me is VERY questionable. Many of the calls against the Rockets were also taking away free throw opportunities.  Im not going to say its rigged but I think they got a much shorter end of the stick"
"Nah, man.  You have to take a step back and see the bigger picture.  When your 3s are off, why do you keep jacking them up?  Because if you go to the rim and get hammered like Eric Gordon and they refuse to call it, you have to settle for 3s.   The no calls change the entire game.  GSW can continue to be as physical as they want on D because Scott Foster's crooked ass ain't going to call anything, and HOU has to settle for outside shots no matter what because you ain't finishing at the rim with guys hit-sticking you.  If you can't see the NBA wanted GSW to win that series and Scott Foster did the job he was assigned to that game to do, it's just willful ignorance."
MAAAAAAANNNNNE FUCK ERIC GORDON
"John Wall, definitely  Eric Gordon still looks quick especially when driving to the rim."
I think John Wall and Eric Gordon have lost a step.
I thought Golden State was gonna win game 4 and 5  Eric Gordon saved us both of those games lol
"Here's [that post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/) about potential missed calls on both teams:  ------  Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.  #Calls going against Rockets:  1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.  2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.  3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.  4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).  5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)  6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)  7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)  8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.  #Calls going against Warriors:  1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.  2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.  3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)  4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)  5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.  6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).  A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:  https://streamable.com/el34r  https://streamable.com/vtmzu  https://streamable.com/uv829  https://streamable.com/9fqlg  https://streamable.com/junss  https://streamable.com/2peej  https://streamable.com/53mhy  https://streamable.com/cuojo  https://streamable.com/07r5o  Bonus Harden trying to draw foul when there was none &amp; just looking like a fool:  https://streamable.com/ca5v5  https://streamable.com/jffyc  Oh and, inb4 Rockets fans accuse me of bias again, and calling me a Warriors fan. Would a Warrior fan post these?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lyh34/ariza_gets_called_for_a_blocking_foul_on_durant/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ly16n/curry_draws_3_free_throws_from_capela/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lfvoo/draymond_going_back_to_his_bad_habits/  The entire game is freely available online, if you're so angry why don't you make your own compilation? And u/unklebuckets, still waiting for [your refs lowlights thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mf8tv/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_33/dzn4mpy/?context=3), or any of the 1+ million subscribers to make one.  Edit: [Summary of the night](https://i.imgur.com/fHlyNne.jpg) lol. Credits to u/wetjumpshot"
"Eric Gordon one was a legit foul, true."
"We have way too many win now vets (Eric Gordon, House, DJ, Nwaba, Theis) to finish last again.  I wouldn’t be mad if we did because that’s another top pick but I don’t see it"
"Harden is not a better basketball player than Curry. That’s just crazy. This over dribbler still lost with non-garbage teammates like CP3, Eric Gordon, Ariza, and Capela. Then he also played with Westbrook or a prime Dwight Howard in Houston. Before that, Westbrook and KD when he was young. In OKC, he disappeared. Then with Houston, he always fell short since his game is built for the regular season with that foul baiting iso style.   He was also dumb enough to not be in shape at the start of last season which caused him to get injured at the end."
Nah. More of an Eric Gordon sort of feel
"I really wish more players would just go all out and attack cities. Rivalries like that can be fun. Like, New Orleans heading Eric Gordon or Cleveland hating Joakim Noah."
Eric Gordon?
"Even Eric Gordon took his player option in order to get in on the spike of 2016 (and more money), and he hated us with a passion."
Eric gordon is still on the rockets
Eric Gordon is the last man standing for Houston
I know the only Rockets players who were on the Rockets then are House and Eric Gordon. Kinda ironic since those two have been in more trade rumors than anyone else on rosters these last couple of years.
"alright, go back another year then to 2019 finals. cp3/gordon/ariza/tucker/capela is def better than Lowry/siakam/vanvleet/gasol/green. You have to remember that this is younger siakam, he was a 16 ppg player at that point, and vanvleet was averaging 11 ppg that season as well. Harden's supporting cast was better than that 2019 team. Given the player that siakam and vanvleet are now its easy to overestimate that team but you have to consider who those players were during that run. Additionally, I think you are underrating Eric gordon. He was a really important player during those runs and was averaging 20 ppg vs those teams in the playoffs. Ariza was a lockdown defender that could punish teams with spot-up shooting, tucker was a defensive beast and didnt miss from the corners, capela was breaking out and putting up good numbers on very very good efficiency. CP3 after Houston took okc to the playoffs and almost beat harden with a worse team. Its easy to look back and underrate a supporting cast just to make harden look better. Just remember that those teams were dominating for a reason.  Also there's no way that you can even compare harden's 2018/19 team to the 2011 mavericks. lets not act like he was dragging these teams"
The fact that the game was still within reach for the Rockets and ended with only a single digit lead while the Rockets went 0-27 should actually be embarrassing for the Warriors a bit. How do you almost lose when the refs are gifting you the game and letting you literally tackle Eric Gordon when he drives to the rim and they’re waiving off made threes that should have been four point plays?
"&gt; CP3, Blake, Kawhi, PG, DJ, Elton Brand, Maggette, Kaman, Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Norm Nixon, Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman, Lamar Odom, Lou Will. Shit… you might be right.  That's 16, add Jamal Crawford, Eric Piatkowski, Montrezl Harrell, JJ Reddick and that's 20. He might have a case for top 20-25 with Miles, Richardson, Bledsoe, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, etc. But then again, Reggie Jackson, Batum, Mann, and Zubac might make top 20 now."
"Carmelo won’t be forgotten I think because of his strong ties to LeBron and general memeability. And the fact that he played in a huge market.  I think the guys you mentioned and more so borderline/one time stars like Rudy Gay, Eric Gordon, DeAaron Fox if he stays in Sacramento, or CJ McCollum will be forgotten.  Also, this post is Roy Hibberts music"
Rockets in 4 if they're healthy and it's not close  Who's guarding Eric Gordon?
"This is what was actually going through PJ’s mind here:  Usually at the end of close games, when the ball is going to be inbounded, players don’t pick up the ball and wait for the refs to hand it to them, so they have more time to set up their offense to pass the ball into. This is why it took Vonleh a second to realize he could take the ball too. For whatever reason, PJ had a complete brain fart and didn’t realize Eric Gordon JUST through the ball in, so he was expecting a ref to come over and pass the ball to the inbounder."
"I’m assuming Eric Gordon doesn’t count as a star, and that’s unfortunate.  But dude was a heavy solid player that I constantly expected to break through that threshold.  Pretty sure he’ll be thrown into obscurity if he hasn’t been already.  Injuries, man"
"Eric Gordon, mans was balling in high school"
"Eric Gordon has always been good attacking and finishing at the rim, but he was sensational this past season (dude shot .747 from 0-3 ft). Such a shame he (and the rest of the whole damn team) got injured."
"Yeah, and in this hypothetical his best teammate won’t be eric gordon"
"Coming off the bench should not be viewed as an indictment of a player and in this case it speaks highly of Gordon’s lack of ego when the Rockets were better off diffusing offensive possessions between Harden Paul and Gordon.  I insist that Gordon is a better defender and overall scorer than a ‘3 point shooter that’s about it’ label would insinuate. To your point I am often coming to Harden’s defense as living in San Antonio he is thought very little of by most Spurs fans. I’m a giant proponent of James Harden’s value as a basketball player and am almost always coming to his defense even though at this moment I’m doing so for Gordon. I think it is sad that so much of the basketball community views non-superstar players as almost that of props and any discussion on them is done with an ulterior motive to talk up or talk down upon a superstar player.  it may be difficult to believe but I’m defending Eric Gordon because I think he is better than you say. I can guarantee you it should be attributed to ignorance (I don’t think so myself) than attributed to me talking up Gordon in order to make Harden look worse. I swear it’s almost impossible to talk about any player LeBron James ever played with or against without people claiming the only reason you’re talking about them is to make LeBron look worse or better. Yes, there are people who talk about Eric Gordon and only do so to talk about Eric Gordon. It has nothing to do with Harden. I’d much rather you attribute my difference in opinion with you to ignorance than anything related to Harden. Again, I don’t think it is ignorant and Eric Gordon was a player I viewed as undervalued for years. I have nothing invested in him as a player or any of the teams he’s been a part of I just think he’s better than many people do. That is until the last couple u healthy seasons he may be permanently declined from."
"That’s because you haven’t watched Eric Gordon since he played for the Clippers. Dude had two good seasons and then has had injuries that meant he was never the same.  By the time Gordon came to the rockets he was a 3 point shooter, and that’s about it. Dude even came of the bench in some of those Harden years.  This is just another Harden hate opinion or simply it’s simply based on ignorance.  And sure some of the third best players listed are debatable but that’s not really the point is it?"
"LeBron- Jerry Rice: Great longevity, rings, often said to be 2nd best ever   Michael Jordan- Joe Montana: Undefeated in the finals, 90s legends   TMac- Eric Lindros: Talented but always injured.   Wilt- Babe Ruth: Record breaking legends from a bygone era   Kobe- John Elway: Franchise legends with draft threats. Not in the GOAT convo but still all time greats  Larry Bird- Bobby Orr: Boston legends with relatively short careers. Both won 3 consecutive MVPs   Stockton- Larry Fitzgerald: Tons of longevity records but didn’t win a ring. Awesome players but not considered best at their position.   Dirk Nowitzki- Eli Manning: Great Player with an insane run against an amazing team. Good longevity too   Ginobili- Pavel Datsyuk: Geat highlight reel, won rings but wasn’t the main star   David Thompson- Josh Gordon: Amazingly talented, career was cut short because of drugs"
Eric Gordon always balled out against the Warriors  He had 19/3/3 on 57% TS
I mean he just tried to do to much. They were converging on him whenever he had the ball. I can’t really blame Harden for not beating KD warriors with Eric Gordon as his running mate.
"That reminds me of a tweet about Eric Gordon. It said something like ""Eric Gordon makes me sick. He is the worst player of all time for seven out of 10 games and he turns into steph those other three just to make his averages look good"""
"Because his team was garbage and the few good players were injured. Jrue was injured half the time, including a playoff run where AD had Norris Cole as his Point Guard. Boogie was injured his other playoff run where he faced the KD Warriors and still put up a respectable fight.  Jrue, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Boogie and so many other players constantly were hurt on those already shitty NOLA teams, and that's also backed up by the Pelicans franchise surrounding AD with the shittiest medical team in the NBA.

"&gt;  Harden had Eric Gordon  I swear to god people 20 years from now on Reddit are gonna be like ""Curry had no help he was playing with Zaza and Mo Speights"""
"Yeah it’s almost like Kawhi had the benefit of playing on amazing teams for his entire playoff a career, and Harden had Eric Gordon."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

You are not making the point you think you are. It was good because of Harden alone.  The second best player on that team was Eric Gordon. Harden took a team to the third place in the west with Eric Gordon as the second best player.
"&gt; who funnily enough got a much better package from the Lakers trade for New Orleans in hindsight to what they actually received.  Let's not even get into this revisionist history nonsense. New Orleans wasn't even getting the second best player in the trade. Pau was going to Houston.  New Orleans was going to get Lamar Odom, who was out of the league almost immediately. Kevin Martin who was a perpetual loser and never played a meaningful NBA minute. Goran Dragic who at the time was a backup PG getting less than 20 minutes per game.   The best player they were getting was Luis Scola who was 30 years old.  Compare that to Eric Gordon, a young SG who could score but was hurt sometimes, Chris Kaman who was hurt but an ALL-STAR just a year prior, Al-Farouq Aminu who was the 8th pick the year before, and what became the 10th overall pick?  It's not even a discussion. Can't let Lakers fans rewrite history and pretend like they offered the better deal."
Dude literally took the KD warriors to game 7 and lost by single digits with Eric Gordon as his number 2 and people like you are still saying he didnt do enough. The whole thing is ridiculous
"I don’t understand the Harden comparison then, when was he not the lone superstar? Are you referring to CP? Because Jrue and Middleton are certainly in the same tier. Or are you referring to Eric fuckin Gordon and PJ?"
"As a Rockets fan this is kinda unpopular, but I put a good chunk of the blame on Harden and MDA as well. I just refuse to believe that Bron or KD are gonna sit and watch their team miss 27 straight 3’s and do nothing. I watched Eric Gordon be more aggressive in that 2nd half and actually get to the rack. Yea a few calls could’ve went our way, yea CP3 could’ve been healthy but that was a very winnable game. MDA just watched it all happen."
"Disagree. How quickly we forget he was once top 5 in the MVP race, &amp; crucial to an ECF run (which he was then injured for, &amp; facing Lebron anyway lol).   For that experience, &amp; potential for leadership / mentorship alone, he deserves a roster spot. I.e. if scrubs like Jared Dudley, Udonis Haslem, &amp; others are in the league, former MVP candidate Thomas should easily be lol.   Also, stating a man who’s been out of the league “genuinely believes” he’s starting caliber is not only illogical, but speculative. Do we genuinely believe a guy who’s out of a job in pro basketball wouldn’t take any contract &amp; role he could get?  His defense is trash, no disagreement there lol. But that’s not what you’re signing him for. His offensive is valuable enough, especially in today’s league. See Kennard, Lou Will, Eric gordon, etc. &amp; that’s not including the value of his aforementioned experience etc.  Does Thomas deserve a starting spot? No. Does he deserve a spot on a 12-15 man roster? Yep. There’s easily 2-3 guys out of any team’s 15 - especially bad teams - where he could fit"
Only time I don't is when Eric Gordon is on. He had no idea who Sengun was and had to look up at the scoreboard to see JC's name lol
Eric Gordon was right
"I'm gonna take what I think is the minority opinion and say rockets.  Harden in 2018 was just on something different, even though he's on both teams. We also forget how good ariza was on that team. Nets have starpower, but I say cp3 steals a game, eric gordon steals a game, and rockets win in 6 (or lose in 7 because curse)"
"How does that destroy my point? Mike D'antoni joined and the roster pretty much turned into the perfect D'antoni team with Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson and Lou Will in the middle of the season. No Dwight missed 41 games in the previous year, in 2016 he played 71 games. And we are having a discussion bro why you downvoting lol."
gelo gives me that eric gordon vibes
"Eric Gordon, John Wall, and PJ (who played with us a little less than half the season) are all kinda old."
"Semi-Unpopular Opinion: The Rockets missing 27 straight 3s and losing Game 7 was a byproduct of being gassed out. Their smaller defenders like Eric Gordon were too busy trying to run Curry off the 3-point line while wing defenders like Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker were unbelievably physical guarding KD. I don’t think it’s necessarily a coincidence that they also blew 2 straight double-digit first half leads in Games 6 and 7 as well, their legs couldn’t keep up."
"Even then it was a lot of people assuming that Gordon would progress and Demar would not, people were really low on Joe Johnson (way better than Gordons peak for sure), and Manu and Hardens bench roles didnt help their reputations despite being a savvy vet and a promising talent, respectively.   It was more of a ""if Gordon takes another step forward he could potentially become great"" not a heir apparent situation, thats all im saying. I remember being really high on both Eric and Ben Gordon around this time."
That’s 2K voiceover GOAT Eric Gordon.
I remember thinking what if Eric Gordon was with them?
"I once saw Eric Gordon, Indianapolis native, walking alone through Broad Ripple, popular neighborhood in Indianapolis, decked out from head to toe in his Clippers warmup gear. It was weird."
Also the gap between DeMar and Kawahi is smaller than Eric Gordon to fucking CP3
Nah Eric Gordon was a pretty big disappointment for us. He didn’t play often and was uninspired to say the least when he did
"Same Eric Gordon who shat on the entire city of New Orleans? Not sad at all, more so amusing."
"They traded Eric Gordon. I'm pretty sure they found out on the team bus right before this, and during this clip he's still on the team bus dealing with the shock."
He honestly reminds me of Eric Gordon a lot. Good defensive guard with streaky scoring and can sometimes put on blinders.
Still got Eric Gordon too when you need some 3s. He’ll probably be a trade deadline guy for a contender though
"This is true. His extension started at 16 while fellow draftees Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon, and Kevin Love started at ~13 mil. Chances are Rose wasn't going to get to 16, because like you said he wasn't winning MVP (his max might have jumped up because of that, not sure) or making the all-star team. However, I still think they would have resigned him and figured it out later."
Eric Gordon gets sadder and sadder the more he scrolls this thread.
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
You mean the dude that led the league in assists passing to Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly would be able to coexist with Kyrie and KD?
"Yeah that is tough for Oladipo but he is doing that trying to get to a contender, and I think he has accomplished that with sticking in Miami.  The Pacers and Rockets were no where near the level he wanted to play at - dont see anything wrong with this.  Eric Gordon could have probably done this too but he opted for the bag."
"John wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, DJ Augustin and Christian wood don’t match the timeline.   Then again he has 2 more years before his deal expires? I would wait until his last year if there are signs that he is not going to resign. He can also provide good experience for the rookies same as the other players mentioned above."
Eric Gordon?
"Eric Gordon, Voice acting legend. If you haven’t seen it, search it up"
Literally our entire team is there and the guy they chose to interview is Eric Gordon
eric gordon has zero charisma lol
"Eric Gordon averaged 18pts last season? Damn. If I had to guess, I'd say 8."
Eric Gordon looks straight off of 2k14
eric gordon could be the father of some of these dudes
eric gordon got a funny voice lfg
I just hope Eric Gordon is having fun.
Josh Christopher is pretty much Eric Gordon
"&gt;The wild card is health, which is stressful given their shortened bench and AD's history  AD's ""history"" is really overblown. He had a bunch of knick knack injuries early in his career, but that was back when the Pelicans were using the medical and training staff from the Saints rather than a dedicated basketball staff. Back then virtually everyone on those Pelicans teams was always hurt, not just AD. Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, etc were regularly missing half the year with injuries due to the Benson family being too cheap to hire trainers that specialized in basketball players.   AD got hurt this year, but it was his first real injury in five seasons, and it came after the shortest off-season in pro sports history. AD never had a chance to recover from the bubble run and get ready for this past season as the Lakers only got 6 weeks off. He probably should have just sat out the first two months, but the league needed him to be there for their opening night game against the Clippers and the Xmas day game against Dallas, so that really wasn't an option. And I don't need to tell a Jazz fan this, but basically everyone got hurt this year, it wasn't just AD. I'm comfortable thinking last year was an anomaly rather than what we should expect going forward.   As for the Lakers depth, they're not at all thin on the bench like you're saying, but rather have many, many options there. A lot of their players are older, but they're all rotation caliber guys who can be counted on to play 20ish minutes per game if needed. I wouldn't be surprised if the Lakers lean on their depth along with their top end talent to let both LeBron and Westbrook rest a lot this year. I could see the Lakers spacing their minutes out so those two don't share the floor much, and so each player maybe only plays 30 mpg. The rest of the guards (Monk, Nunn, Bazemore, Ellington) should be able to fill in the remaining 66 guard minutes, while Melo and Ariza can fill in for the bench forward minutes. Dwight and Gasol can probably play 30ish center minutes combined between them. I think the Lakers regular season rotation is going to be just fine."
"Melo averaged 25/7/4 on atrocious splits.  33/18/80 splits for 15 PPG on 16 shots(his rookie year so you can give him a pass even though it is atrocious)  42/0/81 splits for 19 PPG on 16.6 shots  33/0/75 for 21 ppg on 19.8 shots  48/50/80 for 26.8 ppg on 19.6 shots  36.4/25/83 for 22.5 ppg on 22 shots  WCF run: 45/36.4/82.6 for 27.2 ppg on 20.1 shots(he did great and nuggets did great in return)  46.4/31.6/88 for 30.7 on 23 shots a game  In total he averaged 24.5/7/3 on 42.4/34/82 splits.  That was his nuggets history. Those averages look a lot better because those 16 playoff games, where Nuggets 10-6, comprises a lot of his Nuggets playoff history because outside of that one run the Nuggets were 6-24 with Carmelo.  Knicks were 7-14 with Carmelo(and after 2013 never made the playoffs with him again.  Those Nugget teams did lose some great teams, but they were incredibly talented themselves and a big part of their issue was Carmelo not being as good as the opposing superstar. He was the weaker player more often than not and that was the difference.   Melo not being that star, that superstar, was part of what held the Nuggets back. Yet you wanted Mike D'Antoni to go away from his offense, which was successfully literally everywhere he had a talented team, for Carmelo who has had success literally nowhere. That doesn't make sense. Even if Lin wasn't that guy, Carmelo was NEVER  that playmaker, so having the ball in his hands all the time wasn't going to lead to the results it should have. With Carmelo out, Lin led them to some victories and when Melo returned his role was reduced incredibly. Riding the hot hand even when Carmelo returned would have been more optimal, even though Lin did slow down after teams caught on that he was mostly only able to go left.   Knicks were 8-15 with Carmelo leading the way before Linsanity. After Lin was apart of the regular rotation they went 16-10. That's quite a turnaround right? So they were 8-15 then were 24-25 after Lin was apart of the regular rotation and finished 36-30.   To put it even more in perspective, they were 8-1 in that stretch without Carmelo playing and 9-3 without Carmelo in general. So for the year, they went 27-27 with Carmelo. This guy doesn't sacrifice because he wants to be the star, and you're supporting the notion, but they did better without him and did as average as you can do with him. That doesn't mean the team would be better without Carmelo entirely(well, unless they kept those initial pieces), but Melo's star status never matched his actual ability. His refusal to play defense or be more of a team player, including becoming a better playmaker, is a large reason he didn't have post-season success and why his teams were weaker than the counterpart.   They wouldn't have Chauncey, you're right. They could have included Fields though who was coming off an impressive season as a second round pick(and before injuries derailed him) or just flat out added more picks. CP3 was traded for Eric Gordon, Kaman, and Aminu and a single first round pick. Eric Gordon looked like a star in the making at the time, but that trade isn't impossible to beat even without Wilson Chandler."
"edit: for what it's worth, we're having a discussion and I wish people didn't downvote you. Many people on this sub weren't old enough to watch properly back then, this is(even in disagreement), at least a solid discussion for those times and gives at least some insight to people.   No, Karl is a known dickhead, as I said, but in terms of Melo's time in Denver he was not wrong. Unlike the players you listed, the majority of Melo's playoff performances outside of 2009 speak for themselves. Those teams had no business always being knocked out in the first round. Even in terms of regular season success, they had their best year after trading Melo.  Bzdelik was fired because of Melo. It is well known. Read the links. Read the history. It wasn't just because of Melo, it was a beef with his star player.  And instead of Chandler they could have simply included Chauncey instead of using their amnesty clause on him and added more picks. Gallo was the main piece of that trade, so it would be Gallo vs. Eric Gordon as the centerpiece and while Gordon has the edge, Gallo was still a very good young piece.   D'Antoni wanted a point guard centered offense because his offenses tend to thrive under those conditions. Melo didn't want a reduced role or even want to consider. Just like Melo didn't want to come off the bench on the Thunder. All because, as he says in the quote, he was the star. That is being a diva my guy.  He didn't work out in LA because Nash got hurt two games into the year and was hurt even when D'Antoni came in. He also didn't get a training camp with the team and was signed after 5 games into the season. On top of that issue, Dwight Howard never actually fully recovered from his back issues so our defensive suffered. Dwight also didn't want to run much pick and roll even though he excelled at(well he did prior to the back issues). Did he beef with Pau over Pau's role? What did he want from Pau? To stand out towards the three point line. Sounds like he was ahead of his time in that regard, but at the time it seemed weird and a poor decision(Pau would later begin a stretch big). With all that said, they still made a massive comeback behind Kobe's greatness...and then he tore his achilles. D'Antoni never worked out on the Lakers because of a myriad of injury issues and the lack of training camp, not because of his scheme or asking Pau to go to the three point(as he was right)."
who didn't want to stay. Were they supposed repeat the Eric Gordon mistake?
Eric Gordon. He wanted to go to Phoenix and they matched. It was a miserable experience for everyone involved.
"Yeah, I was mostly talking playoffs, where Russ was injured and most definitely dog water. I'm just saying that I wish that Harden ran it back with a healthy Russ because maybe through some butterfly effect bullshit Rockets could realistically have a chance to win a ring.  Literally all of this is speculation but, I think James Harden, Russ, Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, and Christian Wood are better than the Suns and Bucks. I really loves Russ so I'm tired of seeing missed opportunities keeping us from a ring (CP3, Russ being injured his only playoffs here, Fertitta's existence)."
You figure out who is good for spacing by watching how the defense treats them. Westbrook doesn’t get guarded. Eric Gordon does.
Eric Gordon nailing the 3 afterwards is an underrated great part of it too
Well that’s sorta because there’s context to the stats. Like Eric Gordon only shoots 34% but that’s sorta because teams actually defend him. Whereas most teams in the league welcome westbrook shooting 3’s and he still only makes them at a 31% clip.   It’s sorta like Gordon is at 34% because of defense and westy is at 31% in spite of the defense
"A few years ago Microsoft gave out tickets to E3. During the week they hosted events for the fans that won tickets. At one of the events they invited a few current and former athletes. Ariza, Eric Gordon, Brian Urlacher, and I think Barry Sanders. They were all cool. They mostly chilled and talked with fans. I got a pic with Ariza.   A friend of mine once ran into Westbrook in LA. They rode together in the elevator. That was it LOL. My friend was too nervous to talk with him."
"Let's not act like that's the only reason he's getting assists though. The last time Harden wasn't sharing the floor with an All-NBA point guard (CP3/Westbrook) was in 2017 where he led the league in assists at 11.2 apg. His best teammates that year were Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Ryan Anderson."
Dude they didn’t make the playoffs with AD The jruth (before he got the respect he deserved dude been balling since phili) Eric Gordon Ryan Anderson and Tyreke evans. They aren’t going to be a contender as stacked as the west is I doubt they’ll even be a playoff team they lost like half their games last year alone in like the final 5 minutes because of general inexperience and lack of vets. They certainly aren’t a destination and hanged their future in almost 40 year old Kyle Lowry. They need a complete wipe of roster rebranding and ownership/management
"Besides Dwight and maybe Eric Gordon, what other prime players has Houston signed?"
Lmao of course you make it racial. Also Eric Gordon averaged 20 ppg that series lol. Lukas second best player was Tim hardaway jr lmao. Luka is 22 and pretty much has played as well as harden the last 2 years and is 10 years younger. It’s close but it’s not unreasonable to put him ahead of harden.
"You know that Rockets team has CP3, Capela, PJ Tucker, Ariza, and Eric Gordon right? Have you looked at Doncics teammates?"
Because the thriving trees will forever make more money than the barely surviving trees in the nba. Hate to say it but there’s no appeal in going to small markets for people that want as much money as possible. And if they do go is because there was a culture raised there and they have expectations ie giannis and MIL the past few years. NO had their chance with AD Jrue Eric Gordon Ryan and evans and couldn’t even get to the playoffs it’s a terribly managed team and no one wants to be there long term unless they are comfortable without being in the line light or getting deals for marketing. No one wants to be there
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
John Wall + Eric Gordon
"Sure, if they want to take John Wall or Eric Gordon and zero picks or young players, that’s not a problem at all."
"Harden shot 24 percent from 3 and went 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Houston even started looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6 &amp; 7 cause Harden was so bad. I get it you’re not mad you lost, but Harden still choked lol"
"Nets unprotected picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026. Bucks unprotected picks in 2023  Add Jae’Sean Tate, Eric Gordon and DJ Augustin and that’s a fantastic package for Simmons."
"Yeah I actually don’t hate that idea.  Healthy Eric Gordon is still a good player.  Leaves Sixers pretty light on primary ball handlers though.  Could look at a three team deal and send Wood to Toronto and send Dragic and Gordon to Philly, Simmons to Houston and Wood to Toronto.  ESPN trade Machine says it works."
Why? I kinda like Eric Gordon and Christian Wood for the 76ers.
"“Eric Gordon for Ben simmons, take it or leave it”"
His form reminds me of Eric Gordon 👀
please explain to me how john wall and eric gordon are SCRUBS
Eric Gordon isn’t a scrub just needs a new team
"Are you serious? dude has been insane and carrying his team ever since he left OKC.  in 2013 and 2014 he carried teams who had no business being anywhere near the playoffs to them.   in 2015 he carried a wash up Howard and a bunch of role players to the conference finals averaging 27/8/6 on 61 ts%  in 2016 he dragged a team with Eric Gordon as his second best player to the playoffs and won a game against a 72 win team.        in 2017 he dragged the same shitty team to the second round of the playoffs and lost a 6 game series to SAS.   in 2018 he took Durant GSW to a 7 games series with Chris Paul as his second best player.      The list goes on man. Harden with Chris Paul took a team that Lebron, Kyrie and Love couldn't win more than one game against too 7 games. And Chris Paul didn't play in two of those. Harden has been balling out for the last decade basically."
"PG Luka Dončić - Mavericks #1, SG Devin Booker - Suns #2, SF Dillon Brooks - Grizzlies #5 (lmao), PF Al Horford - Celtics #7, C Jusuf Nurkić - Trail Blazers #3, 6th Duncan Robinson - Heat #6, 7th Eric Gordon - Rockets #4"
"I think they should do it, and throw in Eric Gordon. Or Christian wood"
"(1) Curry  (2) AD  (3) MPJ  (4) Eric Gordon  (5) PJ wASHINGTON  (6) GTJ  (7) Matisse Thybulle  &amp;#x200B;  Imho this is a championship team  I based it on [2kratings.com](https://2kratings.com) as you said  And EG would be a perfect 6th man right here, both gtj and matisse could rotate sg minutes, as matisse is the near perfect pairing with steph. while we have a walmart shooting klay in mpj. and ad is just ad, can fit anywhere"
Example answer:  PG: Patrick Beverly (6th on Wolves)  SG: Buddy Hield (4th on Kings)   SF: OG Anunoby (3rd on Raptors)  PF: Jonathan Isaac (2nd for Magic)  C: Nikola Jokic (1st on Nuggets)  6TH: Eric Gordon (5th on Rockets)   Bench: Lauri Markennen (7th on Cavs)   Xth/nd would be there rank on there respective team. The player doesn’t have to be that exact number like Kyrie is the bird best player on the nets but you could take him as your first best.
"&gt;g league rejects  Such as CP3 (a top-5 all time pg), Clint Capela (PER of 23.8 - a limited but still useful stat), PJ Tucker (who was literally a starter on the Bucks team that you claim was stacked in 2021) and Eric Gordon.   Bro clearly you're delusional. That's not all-time talent but it's certainly not a bad roster and it's not far off the bucks who had: Middleton, Bledsoe, Brogdon, and Lopez.  Harden didn't carry alone - CP3 was huge for that team"
&gt; Yeah that's kinda the point. Once Paul got injured you guys didn't even look competitive.   15 point leads at half of both games against the best team ever? With eric gordon as your best teammate?  &gt;  If you'd given Giannis a top 5/6 point guard of all time in 2019 he would have won a ring  At this point you’re clearly trolling but I got time. That was Paul’s worst season of his career. Giannis had middleton who made an allstar game and all nba team while Paul didn’t. 2019 giannis had way more help then 2019 yet he got swept by Jimmy Butler. Foh
From what I've seen he was a good roleplayer with flashes of an All-Star. Like what Eric Gordon is capable of doing sometimes.
"The about half of the players on our roster, multiple of which are likely to be starters or play significant minutes, are either on their first or second year in the league.  Also, we’re likely going to get even younger by trading Eric Gordon and DJ Augustin at some point this season."
"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
Which is hilarious cause they could have had Eric Gordon and our first 4 rounds that went to OKC instead
"Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, Lou Williams, and PJ Tucker fucking suck too      You act like his supporting cast was worse than LeBron’s 1st stint in Cleveland"
Damn PG getting traded for Eric Gordon?
"**Let the clock run out**  Eric Gordon is being paid $18,218,818  in 2021-22 and $19,568,360 in 2022-23.   Similarly, John Wall is being paid $44,310,840 in 2021-22 and $47,366,760 in 2022-23.   Neither Wall nor Gordon are good enough to start winning them games. Play them off the bench, let your young core develop and run out the clock on their contracts"
For me as a Pelicans fan Eric Gordon.
[Eric Gordon created his own shots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwU0wUueHvI)
"You can't really compare efficiency between players from almost 20 years apart, and 1 whose supporting cast was Mutombo and McKie vs the other whose supporting cast was Chris Paul, Eric Gordon (playing out of his mind), and Clint Capela."
Except Harden was basically double teamed the entire series and Eric Gordon was left to his own devices.
"Idk what point you’re trying to make. Harden is the number 1 player on the team which means the other teams defense is mainly focusing on stopping him, which is completely different from Eric Gordon and Chris Paul."
"&gt;I think being up 3-2 on KD/Curry Warriors is just as, if not more, impressive than making the Finals in a historically weak conference.  From the Rockets 3 wins against the Warriors in 2018  Harden: 76 points on 25/71 FGs, 6/38 3 point shooting shooting with 11 assists and 12 turnovers  Chris Paul: 63 points on 22/53 FGs, 10/23 3 point shooting with 16 assists and 6 turnovers  Eric Gordon 65 points on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 point shooting with 4 assists and 1 turnover  It doesnt make sense to say any of these performances were better than iverson's carry job. His 2nd leading scorer was Aaron McKie. And reducing how impressive it is because it is the east doesn't make much sense. The sixers finished the season tied for the 2nd best record of anybody in either conference"
"From the Rockets 3 wins over the warriors in 2018  Harden: 76 points on 25/71 FGs, 6/38 3 point shooting shooting with 11 assists and 12 turnovers  Chris Paul: 63 points on 22/53 FGs, 10/23 3 point shooting with 16 assists and 6 turnovers  Eric Gordon 65 points on 18/44 FGs, 10/27 3 point shooting with 4 assists and 1 turnover  Are Chris Paul and Eric Gordon better than iverson too?"
"He’s a point, man. The team specifically trained him to be one in the G-League, and he’s tweeted that he’s the team’s point guard. Your opinion is meaningless to that fact.  So you’re saying the Rockets *need* to play a backup PG over the other reserve guards in their rotation, why exactly? Why should Eric Gordon get his minutes reduced to compensate Wall?"
"Eric Gordon is also in the guard rotation, as are young players like Armani Brooks and Josh Christopher. Why should the Rockets be forced to play Wall over guys they want to be part of the future?"
"John Wall, Eric Gordon, a pick for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey and salary filler honestly isn't bad for either.   Simmons isn't fitting in Philly from their perspective and I think Wall would be a good fit if he stays healthy, and EG would be a great fit. They throw in Maxey to make playing time for the win now 76ers, and filler to make the money work. I know both teams are going to look hard at the negatives that come with these players, but both sides are dealing with things that dot work, and both would have a high potential upside."
Easily my least favorite Pelican not named Eric Gordon. Dude's hands were made from stone lathered in butter
"For this season it won't make a difference. Potentially for the next two seasons it could be a slight issue but they'll trade or buy out Eric Gordon eventually. They have a few team options too in the next couple of years but nobody too expensive. In fact, next season they'll be paying even less salary, despite having all of their important players back.  In a vacuum, they could pay wall this season and next without ever getting into tax, and then wall will have to decline his option if he wants to play, which is not a terrible thing to do if they can't agree a buy out"
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"There’s a huge change Jalen Green is a better guard as soon as he plays a RS game.   KPJ could be better, he’s already more efficient than Wall.  Eric Gordon would probably be more valuable to pretty much every team too.  Hell at least DJ can hit a 3.   The rockets have plenty of guys to give PT to"
"Harden wasn't as good in that series as people remember. In the three games they won, he totaled 76 points, 11 assists, 17 rebounds and went 25/71 from the field and 6/38 from three. Eric Gordon and Chris Paul bailed him out repeatedly."
"Why stop there, send Eric Gordon to GSW for Otto Porter JR. I want all 3 Porter Jrs"
"There’s still a minimum next season so the $47million number doesn’t matter, it’s how much over the minimum they are. So they would need to trade Wall to a team and take in less than $11m back, and then between now and forever not sign or draft a single player without sending out equal strategy.  If Fertitta really cared that much, why wouldn’t he just send out Eric Gordon for actual assets in return? It gets them to the league minimum, but you keep all your assets as well"
"&gt;his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela  Gordon has declined a lot lately, but he did earn that big contract when he got to the Rockets.  I think Capela gets a bum rap, he was hurt and shipped out so suddenly he's another bum?  I think he just proved his worth over in Atlanta and that his early success with Harden / CP3 wasn't a fluke (well, I might have just jinxed him lol).  Dray and Klay are better of course, but people like to talk as if Harden was playing with literal G-Leaguers the entire time in Houston."
I was gonna say...their backcourt is just loaded with young player who could benefit from more playing time. I wonder what’s gonna happen to Eric Gordon?
I wonder what happens to eric gordon too
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"&gt; Harden however has dragged some underwhelming Rocket teams to high seeds in the western conference with some of his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela.  Those were All-Star teams compared to the debris Harden dragged to the playoffs in 2013. The other 4 starters were Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, Omer Asik and Pat Patterson. Their 6th man was Carlos Delfino. Someone named Greg Smith was in the rotation.   None of those guys is as good as Draymond or Wiggins, probably not even Oubre. That's a roster that'd lose 70+ games without Harden. They went 45-37."
Is there a reason you didn't mention Draymond or Maple Jordan? 2 guys who are clearly a large step above JTA and the previously mentioned Eric Gordon and Clint Capela?
"That is exactly correct, Curry got a lot of criticism this season despite his incredible year because his Warriors team didn’t even make the playoffs despite a bad roster with numerous injuries. Harden however has dragged some underwhelming Rocket teams to high seeds in the western conference with some of his best teammates being Eric Gordon and Clint Capela. Curry however just fits so well with other high end talent and 3 rings speaks for itself, it’s hard to quantify his off ball spacing value that makes his teammates jobs much easier. Harden is all strictly on the ball value."
What is the trade value of these players:  Derick White  Kendrick Nunn  Delon Wright  Alec Burks  Eric Gordon
"Eric fucking Gordon cause of his stupid impossible shot in 2k, and the fact in one of the older 2k's when players would haze you, he was always the fucker that would haze me while he was putting up like 5 PPG and I was leading the MVP votes."
Yeah we can compare them when Luka is pulling Clint Capela and Eric Gordon to top 3-4 seeds every year in the toughest conference ever.
"The Pelicans had a partnership with the Ochsner hospital - the largest hospital in the gulf south usa. Ochsner has an entire sports medicine wing, the doctors and training staff there cover high school, college, and pro games. Their staff cover the Saints yea, but they aren’t “football staff.”   The training staff isn’t the reason Ryan Anderson had a freak neck injury because someone on the nets ran into him.   The training staff isn’t the reason Jrue Holiday couldn’t stay healthy (the 76ers played him while injured and hid it from the Pelicans in the trade. They were sued and lost in court BTW and had to pay damages to the Nola owner and the league has since changed rules regarding the transfer of medical records). They also aren’t the reason he missed over half a season because his wife had a brain tumor.  The training staff wasn’t the reason AD kept getting little injuries (just look at his time with the Lakers, nothing has changed).  The training staff isn’t why Eric Gordon refused to rehab his knee.   I’m tired of this take making the rounds."
"Rockets - Thunder 2019, last game of the regular season - Eric Gordon missed a wide open PJ Tucker on the inbound with 2 seconds left, if the Rockets win the game they finish 2nd, avoid Golden State in round 2 and Harden might’ve won MVP"
No chance. Eric Gordon is a more expensive version of Seth curry at this point. He's injury prone. And so is wall.
I just realized I haven't used Eric Gordon in 2K for over a year.
66 million is over half the fucking salary cap nobody wants Eric Gordon and John Wall for that dude
Eric Gordon would’ve been an all star without injuries
"Why are they not a Ben Simmons destination? I think he'd be a fantastic fit next to Green and KPJ and that's a great young core.  Would the 76ers be interested in some version of Eric Gordon +/- Christian Wood + picks? Or a three way trade where Wood goes to another team, another solid role player to the 76ers, and picks to the Rockets for Wood?"
"Respectfully, it took a freak occurrence of 27 missed threes on top of CP3’s major injury for them to be put away by Golden State. The Cavaliers were nowhere close to the level of either team, and as much as I respect Lebron as a player I don’t think he’s going to fare better than he did against the Warriors that year. The wing defense and rim protection was amazing, and it was the last we saw of both Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza as high level role players."
"Yeah like, I understand he's not a good offensive player in the post, but can they at least try when it's Terrance Mann or Reggie Jackson on him ? When it was Eric Gordon or Harden I understood okay those guys are strong, but against LAC they could've at least tried"
Starters:  Wall- KPJ- Green- Theis- Wood  Bench:  Eric Gordon/Tate/KJ Martin/House/Sengun/Augustin/Nwaba/Brooks/Khyri
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, two 1sts (top 5 protected) and two seconds"
Enter Eric Gordon and MJ.
I don’t think the Rockets have much that the 76ers would want. Eric Gordon+House+Wall+ 2frp
"Uhhhh, John Wall and Eric Gordon I guess"
When I think of Eric Gordon I just think of [this video](https://youtu.be/bn36pc87EiU)
"Harden legit got doubled all full court all season for 5 years in Houston..I've never seen anything like this in my life.  Literally, 2nd game if the season, 1st quarter and they doubling harden full court. Even with those shooters in Houston, none of em besides cp3 and maybe Eric Gordon could play off the dribble. Was easy to close out on those guys, including cp3 since he short and has no elevation on his J."
Eric Gordon was a very solid on ball defender for the Rockets during our contender years
He played 0 defense. Think Eric Gordon with less shooting.
Eric Gordon buzzer beater 3 vs the Sixers a couple of years ago. Morey was sitting right behind me too.
Eric Gordon kinda was forgotten when Harden arrived.
"&gt; Lastly, professional oddsmakers are giving the team +400 odds to win the championship, imputing a 20% chance. If you're going to call a team with 20% chance of winning the chip at the beginning of the season a ""superteam,"" then there are several superteams every single season.  Yes, it's just that the Nets are a better superteam.  &gt; A. Davis: as the best player on his team before joining LeBron, his squad made the playoffs only fucking twice in 7 seasons, R1 and R2 exits, none of which can be blamed on major injury loss. His first Lakers season, the team was 6-2 without him.  You can give **some** context to his Pels run though. His 2 best teammates during much of his tenure was Eric Gordon who didn't want to be there and missed around 30 to 40 games every year. Then he had Jrue Holiday who had serious injury issues and missed a bunch of time because of his wife's illness. Never had 1 even decent wing in the team, they sign stupid contracts all the time and even had their brand new center, Asik, got Chron's disease.   The Pels before 2018 where run by the same FO as the football team and where an after thought. Worst runned team in the league. When they got their shit together, Cousins goes down with a career altering injury. MVP level CP3 won only 1 playoffs series thanks to the same organization.  This was the starting lineup with whom AD played in 2015 playoffs against the Warriors:  Quincy Pondexter - Eric Gordon - Tyreke Evans - AD - Asik  He has been a All-NBA 1st team in 4 out of the last 5 seasons before 2021 when he was injured, has finished top 3 and 5 in MVP voting before and has an All-Time great postseason with the Lakers in 2020 before getting fucked by the short rest for 2021.  Completely sad that I have to even defend AD to a Lakers fan, WTF. Kind of done with this combo if you don't even respect your players and want to underestimate them like that."
"&gt; If you have James Harden and Chris Paul on your team and can't find anything other than contested 3's, then yes I think that's a flawed offense.  0-27 happened with Chris Paul being out of the game though. I believe he hurt his hamstring in game 5 and 0-27 was game 7.  Harden was basically the only ballhandler they had outside of maybe Eric Gordon who is REALLY streaky to say the least, basically everyone was ice cold from 3 (Ariza went 0-12 that game)."
"I think Iggy had more value than Dragic does at this point. Teams always value defense and leadership. I mean he got a 15 mill contract immediately after the trade. Dragic isn't going to get the MLE from anyone at this point.   The issue with Dragic and his expiring deal is that it has less value because of what Toronto can do with it. They can't take back more salary so that severely limits them. Trade for an expiring deal in the situation you are describing is really more to unload some future salary, skirt tax etc. So they would need to take back more salary in those scenarios.   Dragic is making 19 mill. So you are going to have to trade at least one sizable salary to salary match unless a team has some cap space. Or someone making 14-19 mill. All the players in the 14-19 mill range are better players IMO. The only trade that makes sense is a dump of Eric Gordon with an asset. Maybe Bertans.   So go down to players making around 10 mill and Bagley and Powell are really the only players that are kind of worthless to their teams and I don't think Kings are going to deal Bagley in that type of deal. Oh and you still have to attach another sizable salary to salary match which very well may be something you value. And then Toronto wants something they value too right?   Meanwhile Raptors can't make any other trade or move of worth that increases their salary. They are 155k short of the hard cap right now.   I'm sure the Raptors have worked every possible angle and that's the reason for the lack of the move so far. I think this has been a game of chicken to see if the Mavs would include something of worth in trade so they eat Powell's salary for next year.   IMO whatever the Mavs have offered (Powell + WCS) is probably the best offer they have gotten and will get but they again don't want to do that deal because of future salary.   Raptors could look to buy someone else out or trade them to someone else for tax relief.... But that will cost the Raptors an asset.   Essentially if Raptors want to sign someone or make a trade that increases salary they need to buy Dragic out at some point. Or trade him for whatever they can get."
and that’s Moreys fault? Sounds like you dislike James harden and cp3. Nobody on the Rockets really flopped maybe Eric Gordon sometimes  And that’s rich af coming from a raptors fan
I would definitely do John Wall and/or Eric Gordon and 3 FRPs for Ben. I might even throw in a guy like Tate.
Malcolm Brogdon  Jimmy Butler  Mikal Bridges  LeBron James  Myles Turner  6th man Eric Gordon
"LOL Okay..... Harden, without Chris Paul and his starting PF is supposed to beat arguably the best team to ever play.... he also cannot make his teammates hit open shots when he is doubled and tripled and kicks to open players.... then again his best teammate in game 6-7 was Eric Gordon, who is really best suited as a 6th man."
"well that is just putting one side's slant on it, the other slant is that it was a trade made by the person with authority to make a trade (the GM) and then OTHER COACHES/OWNERS on teams UNINVOLVED got all upset and made a big deal about it and then the NBA vetoed it and they got a different deal that sure we can argue about how good Eric Gordon is or whatever but its not like the new deal was SOOOO much better, if the Lakers had offered the clipper deal it probably gets vetoed too."
Revisionist history. Eric Gordon was a budding star who suffered multiple injuries that sapped him of that level of play. He was one of the more valuable assets in the NBA at the time.
Eric Gordon wasn't a role player at the time.
"Absolutely nobody thought this at the time, you're completely looking at the value with hindsight. Eric Gordon was by far the best player in either offer at the time, he was 22 years old coming off a 22 PPG season and was widely expected to be a future star. Just because his career was completely derailed by injuries after the trade doesn't make the offer magically worse if you look at it with the knowledge at the time."
"Right and by that logic New Orleans should have traded Anthony Davis to a team that could give them role players they could flip for late firsts instead of just taking the young star in Brandon Ingram.  Those late 1sts could have been anything, even Brandon Ingram / Eric Gordon."
with hindsight yes but at the time eric gordon was 22 years old averaging 22 a game he was far and away the best asset in either deal
"Eric Gordon was a young star and was the best player on both lists.  Odom, Scola and KMart were 28-31 and good starters. Dragic was nobody back then. Kaman was an ok starter.  Hornets were looking to rebuild if they traded away CP3, and most teams would take a budding star and picks over a bunch of good starters who are on the edge of 30."
Here's the comparison of what Hornets would have gotten  &amp;#x200B;  |Lakers|Clippers| |:-|:-| |Lamar Odom|Chris Kaman| |Goran Dragic|Eric Gordon| |Luis Scola|Al-Farouq Aminu| |Kevin Martin|2012 FRP (Austin Rivers)| ||2 2nd rounders|  How is the Clippers deal better?
Eric Gordon at least had potential
"To be fair, Eric Gordon used to be really good."
I’ll sell Eric Gordon house nwaba and whoever else who isn’t younger than 27
"U keep saying the other 3 guys but I have told u several times that the Hornets wanted to build a future, not grab a SG who was gonna be FA and 2 older forwards, Eric Gordon had tons of potential to be a guy to build around, none of the guys u mentioned for the Laker trade had that potential. Case closed"
"&gt;the first trade really didn’t have any blossoming young talent, that’s what the Hornets needed, pieces for the future  Goran Dragic is still playing in the NBA today! He wasn't 22 but he + Kevin Martin + Luis Scola is a way better trade than Eric Gordon and Al Farouq Aminu. Eric Gordon was overhyped as hell, imagine Devin Booker before last season's playoffs. THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD OF A PLAYER AND YOU'RE TRADING AN MVP CANDIDATE.  Again, the injury concerns were also there."
"Eric Gordon was seen as one of the best young players in the league, the first trade really didn’t have any blossoming young talent, that’s what the Hornets needed, pieces for the future, they get Aminu and Gordon two young promising players and the eventual 10th overall pick. At the time in terms of looking towards the future and rebuilding that was by far the better deal"
"What the hell? No.  The trade for Chris Paul would've netted New Orleans...  1. Lamar Odom, after he played his best season and won 6th man of the year 2. Kevin Martin, a young 20 point scorer 3. Luis Scola, who was above average at PF 4. Goran Dragic, who was good enough to help lead the Suns to a 50 win team  Bro that's a near playoff team, add 1 mid tier lottery guy and the team is pretty good. Some of those guys were expiring contracts, which was ALSO good, because back then, a guy with an expiring contract was gold for teams that wanted to play in the Free Agent market.   Okay with that said, Stern vetoed that trade of multiple good players for...  Eric Gordon, who was constantly injured and had some injury concerns prior to the trade, also was mostly empty stats on the Clippers.   Al Farouq Aminu, a project player who was BAD when he was in New Orleans and made himself into a journeyman.  Chris Kaman, who was close to washed.  ABSOLUTE MADNESS -- THE ONLY ONE OF THESE PLAYERS TO MAKE AN ALL STAR TEAM AFTER THIS WAS IN THE OTHER FUCKING TRADE HE VETO'D."
"Eh not really, the only true piece that would have benefited the teams for years to come was Dragic. Otherwise New Orleans got Eric Gordon who at the time seemed like a young promising player and a 10th overall pick"
"To be fair, a big reason why they don’t want to play him is because they already have KPJ, Jalen Green, and Eric Gordon.   By playing Wall you are taking minutes away from guys you are developing, and Gordon who is a lot easier to trade."
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Eric Gordon the best part lol. Love 2k15
&gt;*Agreed. Lonzo was a restricted free agent. The Pelicans could have kept him if they'd wanted to match the Bulls offer sheet.*  NOLA has had a bad expierences with this in the past...  Like Eric Gordon situations can really sour a locker room. I'm not in a hurry to have more of them.
This is what happened I think — Pels didn’t want another Eric Gordon situation
eric gordon is on the table at the rockets of the bulls are interested in a pure scorer who is a win now option
"Yea I agree I think they should semi blow it up. I think they should do a Simmons/Harris for Wall/ Gordon/ Wood and picks. This keeps the sixers competitive. They can run a lineup of Wall-Curry-Green-Wood and Embiid and Eric Gordon would give them great bench scoring. This also frees up long term money with Wall and Gordon both have 1 more year after this season and Wood is a nice young player entering his prime on a great contract. Sixers would go into the summer of 2023 with Embiids contract, Christian Woods cap hold, Korkmaz, and Maxey. I dont think there is any move the Sixers make that will make them contenders outside of getting Lillard."
I swore Eric Gordon was gonna be a star..had a great career though!
"""The drill is, as always, is 'Is the player you're getting back more valuable than the potential you could get in the draft?'"" said Clippers general manager Neil Olshey. ""Our analysis at this point in February is that it was more valuable to get a 28-year-old All-Star point guard that we have for the next few years, cap flexibility to make sure we take care of business and re-sign DeAndre Jordan and have flexibility to take care of Eric Gordon as well, as opposed to speculating on another kid that's 19 years old with one year of college experience.  ""And I'm not that high on the draft to begin with this year.""  That’s his analysis and he was dead wrong flat out. He’s talking about Mo Williams. That’s a bad evaluation no matter what. They would have been better off letting Baron expire. There was a lot of value 1-15 in that draft. He just made a poor move."
"They started 6'3"" Eric Gordon at the 3 for most of the year lol"
"Don’t pretend like Davis had scrub teammates. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Boogie Cousins, Rondo, Mirotic and even a healthy Julius Randle. Yes there were plenty of unlock injuries, but there were also plenty of solid lineups that lacked a true Alpha  Those 18-19 Pelicans could’ve been special if AD didn’t quit halfway through the year. Three guys averaged over 20ppg plus they had Mirotic balling out and even had Christian Wood for a couple weeks"
Eric Gordon auditioning for the Mavericks so hard
Like Houston doesn't? The only player who was star status who has ever signed with Houston is Dwight Howard. Next best is Eric Gordon.

You need to get Christian Wood somehow. He's an effective version of Porzingis. Eric Gordon would be a nice pickup as well.
"kinda feel bad for eric gordon being on a tanking team, but money is money"
yeah but eric gordon has like 11 shots right now
Eric Gordon roundass head gonna flip the game
Eric Gordon doing a great job getting his trade value up
no matter the outcome of this game shout-out to Eric Gordon for pumping his trade value as much he can
Eric Gordon built like a mechanic
Eric Gordon was a significantly better prospect at the time than you’re giving him credit for.
"It doesn’t make sense because the team was sold after the trade happened, why would trading him to the lakers matter to the value if he already got traded when the team was sold? Kevin Martin was a 20ppg guy, gasol(to Houston) wasn’t not close to being done, Luis scola would give you 17ppg at least, Lamar Odom was a solid 15 ppg off the bench, dragic wasn’t dragic but he was ok. These players weren’t old and were really solid and probably would’ve made the Pelicans better. The clippers gave up Eric Gordon, Chris Camen and al farouq aminu and a pick, that doesn’t make the Pelicans more valuable. I think the lakers package is better and would’ve made the Pelicans better but the league felt otherwise. An nba team would’ve sold for a lot even in the early 2010s"
"What doesn't make sense? That trading for younger players is more appealing than trading for a bunch of older, mostly past their prime dudes? Dragic was the only ""young"" guy in that trade and he wasn't a big component of the trade. Eric Gordon was viewed as a future all-star. He was great on the Clippers.  Lakers trade was a disaster, that's why it was vetoed. Stern even says Demps was a trash GM in one of the interviews about it."
"You proved yourself wrong lol. It is clear you still don't know how to read the stats you yourself posted so I'll humor you.   [Here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PASSES_RECEIVED*GE*50) is all the guys in the league who receive at least 50 passes per game, sorted by passes made. You can see Ant is at the bottom of the list, ahead of only Herro, McCollum, Ingram and Beal. Yet he also plays more minutes than all of the guys below him except for Ingram. Edwards is on the floor more than most guys and receives more passes than most guys but isn't passing.   But that's a small sample size, so let's look at last year. [Here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PASSES_RECEIVED*GE*38:MIN*LE*34) is the same link, but of guys who received at least 38 passes per game (Ant was at 40.2). And to be fair to him, I capped the minutes per game at 34 since he was only at 32 MPG last year.   If you're look for Ant on that list, you have to go to the 2nd page, where he is once again at the bottom of the league. This time there are only 3 people who passes less than him - Eric Gordon, Derrick White and Devin Booker.   It is very clear that of guys with Ant's usage, he passes the ball among the least in the NBA. So maybe instead of telling others they don't watch the Timberwolves you should pay more attention to what's happening in the games you watch."
"james harden took a box of scraps to 6 games against the Spurs. im sure he could destroy the east given lebron’s teammates. In the end the only thing stopping Harden’s path was  OKC POR GSW GSW SAS GSW GSW LAL  were it not for the warriors, him and eric gordon would be the goat backcourt"
"The Harden situation is completely different. If you're an owner in the league, you should want to win at any cost. Tillman Fertitta only cares about selling tickets and jerseys. He has publicly stated that the greatest thing about being in the basketball business is that it only goes up.  This really started when after the 17-18 season, he didn't wanna re-sign Ariza even though that was the closest the Rockets had been to winning it all in a long time, and Ariza had done the best job playing defense on KD out of pretty much anyone that year. That was the beginning of the end. From 18-20, Harden put up insane stats, broke records, and yet the team never went anywhere. At one point in 18-19, when CP3 and Eric Gordon were injured, Harden was literally playing with G-Leaguers because Fertitta couldn't be bothered to pay the price you need to win a championship and get better role players.  Once they traded Westbrook and Covington, and Morey went to Philly, you could tell Tillman was gonna blow it up. And he was willing to waste even more of Harden's good years for fucking nothing. He even told Harden at a dinner that he would trade him somewhere he could compete for a ring, and then went back on his promise and never moved him in the offseason. That's why Harden had to play the ugly game, because of broken promises and a greedy owner that doesn't care about winning, and in order to not spend the rest of his days on a roster that was even further from winning a championship than the previous years."
"For years, people said Eric Gordon would be a star… then he become a 3 and D guy…but he was largely terrible."
"That Rockets team is really underrated, they were a great team.  - PJ Tucker was a beast and although he has noticeably declined was an instrumental starter for the Bucks championship squad  - Capela has single-handedly transformed the Hawks defense  - Eric Gordon was a legitimate 6MOY candidate  - Then you had solid 3D wings  Most other NBA seasons that Rockets team is the Championship squad."
I’m surprised no one has gone after Eric Gordon. He can’t be happy in Houston rn.
Eric Gordon is available… just saying
"You mean the Jrue Holiday that was always injured around AD? the Randle that wasn’t good until season 2 in New York? The Christian Wood who’s not really all that anyway? Plus most of the time his supporting cast was injured, like Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans and Ryan Anderson when they were actually good."
I got so pissed seeing Green running to catch lobs while you had Eric Gordon hoisting up threes. Green is deadass a lob threat he should be at least getting 2 lobs a night
Kevin Love and Eric Gordon are both gonna be Lakers by March book it
"ngl, I always forget about the Eric Gordon one, lol"
&gt;I don't know why he's not more valued by contenders -   &gt;   &gt;1. He can shoot   &gt;   &gt;2. He can drive   &gt;   &gt;3. Used to playing off ball and on ball   &gt;   &gt;4. One of the best PG defenders in the NBA (just see Steph and Mitchell's numbers vs the Rockets in the playoffs). OKC's offense was basically give it to the guard not guarded by Eric Gordon    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;His shot is inconsistent though
Definitely better than that random Eric Gordon one too.
"&gt; We aren’t gonna be good but we kept it close with what should be a solid Bulls team in a game where Lavine popped off.  Seeing the Pistons play tonight is an eye opener for me. And this is without Cade Cunningham. Saddiq Bey is a contributor already. And I would say a future all-star. He's not some rookie anymore.   Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant are going to carry the team. And we haven't seen Cade play with them yet. Pistons are a shooting guard away from being a playoff contender IMO. I can only think of Eric Gordon being most likely available. But of course, Pistons can do better.   I am not sleeping on this team."
I thought Eric Gordon looked good shooting the ball as well. He obviously doesn’t fit with the teams timeline and he seems like a guy a contender would want. Does he not have any trade value because of injuries?
*Eric Gordon and Dion Waiters have entered the recording booth.*
Lebron and Eric Gordon should have a contest to see who’ll complain to the refs more
He’s more of a shit head for going back on his word. He publicly said Demps would have full autonomy to manage New Orleans and then he goes and does “Basketball Reasons.” Then he doesn’t even express faith in his own trade by not letting New Orleans offer the rookie extension to Eric Gordon.
"trade him to Houston for Eric Gordon, Christian Wood and picks"
Eric Gordon owns the jazz
"Eric Gordon, Allen Crabbe and Otto Porter are recent ones that come to mind."
Rockets are going for the tank again 100%. They probably waive or trade Wall at the deadline and try to trade Eric Gordon to anyone who will take him.
Eric Gordon?
Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon actually goes by EJ
Eric Gordon?
"He likely would have gotten traded for something last deadline but a drunk driver killed four of Danuel House's family members right before that, so they weren't trading him then. Now it seems they are likely trying to sell a bit higher on him, or have him available as a throw in with Eric Gordon."
1. demar derozan 2. mike conley 3. tyler johnson 3. jared dudley 3. darius garland 3. brad wanamaker 2. eric gordon 3. dorian finney smith 3. evan fournier 4. jaxson hayes
Eric Gordon look like too.
I also have Curry &gt; Harden overall but that's simply not true lol  KD &gt; Chris Paul  Draymond &gt; Capela  Klay &gt; Eric Gordon
"Right, because Eric Gordon and Clint capella = kd, klay, dray"
Bruh I remember these Pelicans fans trying to convince everyone that Tyreke Evans/Eric Gordon/Ryan Anderson/Omer Asik was a good supporting cast for AD &amp; Jrue and that you’re just a small market hater if you disagree  They’ll never be honest about it
Eric Gordon on the bench
Eric Gordon
Remember when Eric Gordon dropped 50? Didn’t matter a whole lot a week later
"Josh Smith Game 6 against the Clippers in the 2015 WCS.   “Josh Smith played liked how Josh Smith thinks he plays.”     14 point 4th quarter. 3 for 4 from 3pt. Back to back step back 3 pointers to cut Clippers lead. Plus a steal and clutch block.  Eric Gordon 50 point career high versus the Jazz without Harden, Westbrook, or Capela."
"For Westbrook I got Fisher, James, &amp; he joined the Rockets after losing to them then the Lakers after losing to them, so there's quite a bit of players there, but I'm excluding when joining a team after losing to them. Even if we count them, there's only Harden and Eric Gordon that overlap from when he faced them to joined them. From joining the Lakers, I see about 5 players that overlap, still nothing on LBJ's 20."
"I think people overestimate his age because he is probably most memorable for his extremely good defense in the 2018 WCF, particularly switching onto James Harden or Chris Paul or Eric Gordon."
"The guy made it clear he wanted to go to Chicago. Should the Pels have matched and then turned it into a *real* shit show? I think we had enough after the Eric Gordon situation, thank you very much."
It’s all good. I just didn’t care to pay ball bc he wants to be paid to be a high level pg which he wasn’t and that’s fine… he is also very inconsistent and I am glad we accepted sunken cost and didn’t pay him ala Eric Gordon/asik situations.    I hope it works out.. if not it’s not the end of the world.  Cheers!
"Pelicans did a solid job building around AD. Could have done more, but it is what it is. Let’s ignore the injuries to him, Boogie Cousins, and Jrue. Ryan Anderson was involved in an collision and had to get neck surgery. He was never the same again. Btw, they stole him from the Magic. Anderson won MIP and probably wasn’t gonna re-sign with them. Pels signed and traded a complete nobody in Gustavo Ayon to get him. We saw how good a fit Mirotic was with AD. Imagine he played with heathy Ryan Anderson in the early years. Then we have Eric Gordon who has been injured throughout his career. They probably should have traded him at one point as he was ready to leave when he signed the Suns’ offer sheet. Omer Asik got a serious infection that caused massive weight. It was found out that it was Crohn’s disease. Got overpaid during the 2016 offseason. A lot of money to be paying someone that is unable to play. What if they had someone else with that contract that could play? Too much dead money so obviously it would cripple a team.   All 3 players were starters for the Pels. I can’t put too much fault on the team because of multiple injuries. They did a good job in trying to give Tyreke Evans a change of scenery as he was not looking good in Sacramento. And he ultimately got injured as well."
He should have paid Ariza. Houston was dead in the water once they had Eric Gordon matching up against KD.
"The CP3 thing got weird after the owner situation   Pelicans probably had more injuries than anybody during ADs time there. Eric Gordon, Tyreek Evans and Ryan Anderson were basically injured half of the time. They finally had another all star and Cousins blew out his leg.  Zion has only played 1 full healthy season so far."
"Eric Gordon &gt; Seth Curry  Yeah, I know. But EG can handle the ball reliably, is a lot sturdier on defence, and can score on drives a lot better than Seth can WHILE being just as good of a 3 point shooter… sometimes.  Seth Curry is way more consistent, I totally get that, but the upside of EG is way better, and I honestly think your medium-night EG is a more valuable piece."
"Bud you're not turning this on me. You're the one being a prick. I just said something about it because who the fuck goes out being an asshole to a guy who did nothing wrong with the Pels? Save that hatred for, like, AD or Eric Gordon or something."
"No disrespect to Giannis, but IMO Harden really deserved the MVP in 2019 although obviously the last game of that season kinda hurt his chances. He really did carry a trash Rockets team (with no CP3, no Eric Gordon who were the next best players) and put up insane, historical numbers while doing it though."
"&gt; 3rd stringers and G League players   Lmao yes Patrick Beverley, Ariza , Dwight, Capela, Eric Gordon, Lou etc all such bums. Harden had some of the best role players to complement his play style. When did narrative start that he had bad teams? After he kept underperforming over and over again?"
That team was filled with guys who were capable of creating their own shot though. Rockets apart from Eric Gordon and CP3 (whose role was significantly different) had no iso scorers.
Zach lavine&gt; Eric gordon
"I just think the ""0-27"" logic is lazy.  It's actually more logical to say the only way a team that led the NBA in 3pts goes 0-27 is if the refs interfere.  They missed 3 fouls on 3pt attempts - one of which harden actually made off the backboard and the ref wrongly blew the play dead.  Then there's instances where the Rockets pump faked and drove to the basket, emphasized by the play where Eric Gordon got literally speared mid-air by Raymond and didn't get a call.        The calls swung the game, it was a massive emotional moment.  The calls that were missed were heavily weighted in GSW favor.   The 0-27 is hateful and lazy, not objective or empirical."
"It happened with Eric Gordon and that was literally the commissioner not expressing faith in Gordon after trading for him. So yes. But you're more likely to get a pass if you trade for a guy on his rookie contract like Ingram, Lonzo, or Hart.      Even if you make it incentive-based, this max should have been in ink yesterday."
And then you risk Ayton getting pissed off and becoming the new Eric Gordon. Great move.
"You're confusing stats with situation.  If you swapped their situations, putting TMac on a modern team where he has literally the most spaced out 3 point shooting lineups ever, and send Harden back in time to the Orlando Magic, who would absolutely have killed to have players like Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker, never mind CP3 or Dwight, isn't it pretty likely we're having this conversation in reverse?  &gt; Has he proven to be better at carrying teams than Harden  TMac in the 2003 playoff averaged as many points as the next 3 scorers on his team combined, and somehow still gets shit for taking a massively favored team to 7 games."
"Yeah, I view his ceiling is a Caris Levert type (maybe more consistent/less injury prone).   However I don’t really view him as a high level starter to be honest. I think a realistic projection for him would be more the Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Jordan Clarkson type role as a spark plug bench scorer.   He could probably be a starter on some teams (bad/lotto teams), but ideally on a good team his role would be a 6th man type role as a bench spark plug.   Who knows though, the guy was a high ceiling prospect who has improved every year so far. So it wouldn’t be too surprising to me for him to beat my expectations. Easily the best draft pick the Warriors made since they won a ring."
"I think over last season he's shown to be a pretty reliable option as a secondary ball handler when playing with the main unit and a jolt of scoring for the bench. I think it's reasonable to (offensively) expect a Eric Gordon type, a Jordan Clarkson with a bit more point guard ability.  Now, if he's actually bombing stuff like in this first preseason game..."
I vote for Eric Gordon.
Who were the all-stars? Chris Paul on one leg playing only 58 games? PJ Tucker? Eric Gordon? Clint Capella? I was unaware any of those players were all-stars
2017 Eric Gordon
"It kinda does mean they are good... you want to rate someone higher than someone else when their skill sets doesn't make people around him better or equate to team success as much as the other   The same people he played with base of your statement James harden made use of. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson,  Austin rivers. Julius Randle left and became an all star as well.   Christian wood was close to winning mip before getting hurt. The warriors weren't even a thing when he was drafted in 2013... So for 7 years the warriors were the problem when he only made the playoffs twice..."
"When he played my high school (Lawrence North vs North Central game; Eric Gordon was on our school’s team), I held up a sign with his head superimposed on Shrek’s body with a caption saying “Greg Ogre” because he’s ugly and looks old af. I remember him noticing it because he was shooting a free throw and I was sitting near the front bleachers. He did not like it lol. But, he was 18 at the time and the concept applied even then."
"Yeah he is the washed veteran, flicking oldie now.  He means Eric Gordon is so well rested he will play with the energy of two rookies."
Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr  Eric Gordon
"KPJ, Jalen Green, Wood, Theis, and Eric Gordon gonna eat"
Anthony Edwards got compared to Oladipo and Eric Gordon
"&gt;AD went to the playoffs all of to times and managed getting to the second round once, after beating a poor Portland team with Jrue and Rondo playing out of their minds.  His team was injured a lot, especially his only good few players (Jrue, Eric Gordon, Boogie), probably due to the Pels not having a real NBA medical staff.  &gt;Embid has gone to the semis basically every year he actually played. Portraying that as them getting “equally far” in the playoffs might be the most disingenuous presentation of facts I heard in a while.  And losing to an average Hawks team, losing to a baby Celts team and losing to the Kawhi Raps (great team, albeit he had Jimmy Butler leading his team and he still came up short). He also got swept in the 1st round to a baby Celts team without Hayward.   He's also shot poorly in the playoffs, has been shutdown an entire series, is a turnover machine at times, performs worse in a lotta 4th quarters and gets beat on defense a bit. AD's game in the playoffs becomes more valuable on both ends, offense &amp; defense, while Embiid's drops off.   Embiid doesn't get any credit for beating the play in Wiz, D-Lo Nets &amp; washed D-Wade led Heat, especially when his team won games in those series without him."
You really gonna name Norris Cole over Tyreke Evans and ignore Eric Gordon?
"I hooked up w Evan Gordon’s ex girlfriend a few times while he was at ASU.   I was invited to a party a couple months after that and ended up hanging out with him and his older brother Eric Gordon. The subject came up that I’m the guy who took Evans girlfriend and things started to get a little uncomfortable but then Eric chimed in with “Bro, me and ***** fucked her too. Leave dude alone”   Evan left shortly after and I ended up having a pretty fun night"
"Eric Gordon looked like he could be an all-star early in his career. He's been a servicable roleplayer since but really thought he'd have more of a Bradley Beal career arc.   Alec Burks was someone I thought would be a 20ppg guy too that looked promising early in Utah but then like a lot of guys being brought up here, just got mad injuries and never quite got back on track to develop into more than a spark plug scorer type."
Eric Gordon    Kuzma   Cavs JR Smith  FVV
"Yeah, the Suns should look to get a vet shooting guard to come off the bench, like Eric Gordon."
"Eric gordon not getting bought out, a team will have to trade for him"
"I think Dragic and Eric Gordon, are for sure going to be bought out."
Oh yeah man I really wanted Eric Gordon 2.0.
they’ll tank after they raise the value of Wood and Eric Gordon
I bet Eric Gordon knows his name now XD
"We drafted four 19 year olds in a single year, two which are guards  We have KPJ, a 21 year old we are trying to develop and see what he can do at the PG position before his extension.   We also got Eric Gordon in the mix, and if you add Wall it becomes way too many cooks in the kitchen. Rockets want Wall to play a mentorship off the court and Wall agreed with it until now."
Eric Gordon for Kemba Walker and Quintin Grimes
Eric Gordon would actually be a solid bench piece. He's still a decent floor spacer. I think his percentages will go down but he should still be good for 35-40%
"I would actually trade for Eric Gordon if I were the Suns, trade away Payne + Shamet and a protected first maybe. He is a legit 16 game two way player. Yes you are giving up some scoring, but I'd sacrifice some scoring for a really good defender who could guard the likes of Mitchell and Murray in the playoffs."
Eric Gordon is actually good  John Wall………… has his moments
Why not use a 2 for 1 coupon and add a used Eric Gordon too?
"Question for the Clips fans in here, would you trade Kennard for Eric Gordon?   Basically getting a proven veteran version of Kennard who is better defensively. Luke is probably the better shooter, but EG can do more off the bounce.   Plus if your main competition going forward is the Warriors, why not get a guy who is very familiar playing them in 2 high stakes series.   Plus you’re bringing him back home to where he started his career."
"It's even weirder and funnier that a team refuses to play John Wall but looks at DJ Augustine and Eric Gordon and says ""yeah guys go out there and chuck as many shots as you want"". Then of course the Theis/Sengun situation."
Eric Gordon cause fuck his jumpshot animation in 2k.
"I'm really surprised Eric Gordon is still in Houston. He was a rad 2 guard pretty recently, I think"
"shiiiiiit, I've got a team full of those dudes already.  I'd rather the Wiz trade for like Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Eric Gordon or fucking TJ Warren at the deadline than send him to Portland for a partially washed Robert Covington."
"Also the weak ass technical on oubre for throwing his hands up right after Eric Gordon freaked out on the refs and nothing happened. Oh well, wasn't our night"
"Sure let’s just take a fine tooth comb of every call while we’re at it, that’ll prove everything.  Remember when Eric Gordon didn’t put the ball on the floor but they didn’t call continuation? Let’s pile that on there."
Horrendous defense by the hornets but that Eric Gordon foul call was egregious. Refs called game.
It’s just muscle memory from playing in Houston with Eric Gordon clapping for the ball.
Eric Gordon is still super good but he also needs playing time prior to any trade.   DJ Augustin barely plays (12/minutes a game) so the minutes are going to have to come from young players.
DJ Augustin is playing 15 a game. Eric Gordon is playing 30. This team does not have a bunch of prospects that need time   They can still burn away Garrison Matthews and pretend he’ll be something and find Wall a role.
"They will still get to play. Who would you rather get minutes, dj augustin or John wall? It makes no sense  that the rockets won’t play wall but will play Eric Gordon and augustin."
"Eric Gordon cause of his stupid fucking jump shot animation in 2k ruining me in online leagues.   That fucker could be wide open and his shot animation was so delayed and weird that you'd brick everything no matter what. Even though he was like a mid 80-something overall player and one of the best shooters in the game, he was absolutely worthless."
"Eric Gordon 😢😢and there’s a small chance Wood is gone.  Theis signed a 3 year deal, I don’t see the FO shipping him out this early"
Christian Wood  Jae’Sean Tate  Eric Gordon  Kevin Porter Jr  Jaylen Green  **Checkmate**
"Having seen the Warriors against Portland in some playoff series, McCollum will probably go off and have one giant game in a series, but mostly he's just a streaky scorer who adds nothing else. I don't view him much differently than like an Eric Gordon or Lou Will level player. There may be that one game per series where he's scary, but then you forget he exists outside of that."
Dude looks like Eric Gordon
"We also had Ariza, runner up 6MOY Eric Gordon, and Luc. Two genius offensive players surrounded by good defense and good shooting. Not to mention Butler and EG are great offensive players in their own right.  Fuck Thibs man, what could have been."
Robert Covington?  Eric Gordon?  God bless the small ball rockets
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"If you want to be realistic, here it is.   Clippers still thought Baron Davis was a starting level PG, had Eric Gordon, still take Blake.   Memphis has a lineup of Conley-Mayo-Gay-Randolph-Gasol in place. Take Harden to add depth to their weakest position.  OKC set at PG and SF, take Derozan to play SG  SAC still wants a PG and takes Curry  MN at 5 &amp; 6. Need everything but PF and C. Take Holiday and Tyreke Evans  GSW takes Teague"
I'd be scared if the Warriors get a good scoring vet like Eric Gordon coming off the bench.
Few months later: Eric Gordon
"&gt;he is giving the ""developing"" minutes that he took from Wall to give to KPJ (who holy shit is awful at PG) to Daniel Thiess and 🤢 Eric Gordon.   Don’t you guys want Silas playing young guys like KPJ all the time?  &gt;We have no paint presence, can't shoot, AND can't pass. We also can't defend.  This is a talent issue primarily.  Maybe it’s just me, but it didn’t surprise me that Houston only has 1 win. Even if they had a top 10 coach. If anything, the FO should be getting heat for sitting Wall."
"I got down voted to oblivion in the Rockets subreddit saying we should cut the dead weight of Danuel house and Eric Gordon and go for some positive locker room influences like Lin and Shumpert. People seem to think that playing green + sengun 40 mins a night will automatically lead to development, but I don't think that's true and doubly not true of you have a spineless coach like Silas."
Eric Gordon is atop the list of players that Houston would consider moving that contending teams would want... tf?
Explain why you think Daniel theis and Eric Gordon make the Rockets more talented than the Magic
"I feel for him, but he doesn’t lead and always makes excuses. Doesn’t take accountability, consistently has horrible rotations. Every out of timeout play is genuinely horrible. Team wise running Eric Gordon as your pg doesn’t help, but still you can just tell he doesn’t have the locker room. I would be down for Pierce or Kenny Atkinson."
Their squad is on that level.  Eric Gordon isn't the Eric Gordon of years past. KPJ is hurt. Theis is solid if the team around is solid. He's never been a game changer.  Sengun is 19 and in a new league. They are poorly constructed top to bottom.  What coach could win with this team that Houston can get mid season?
"Excuse me but their half court offence is literally on the level of the process 76ers. You can't tell me Jalen Green,KPJ,Wood,Theis,Sengun,Eric Gordon,etc should result in that level of basketball.  They have lack of playmaking on the roster but they have a few guys who like the 76ers now could function as a PG as a group."
"Cause their team is terrible. Their best players is a rookie.  Next player is an above average rotation player in Christian wood.  Then old Eric Gordon.  They have a talent problem.  Three guys worth a damn and the rest suck.  Kind of hard to develop a winning culture.   The last guy to blame is the Coach.  Maybe the GM, maybe Ownership, the players, the lack of solid G league Players to pull from. Also do the rockets GM and Ownership want them to be good? Especially since only two guys will be on the roster in two years."
"Tell that to Silas who plays Eric Gordon and Daniel Theis over Sengun, Garuba, Brooks, Christopher, etc..."
"he might be a bad coach but i feel like their roster is the reason for their horrific start   their 5 leading minutes guys are Christian Wood, Jalen Green, KPJ, Eric Gordon and Jae’sean tate. in what world was that team ever going to be competitive lol  maybe a better coach is like 3-14? maybe?? idk lol   again i’m not against firing him if they think he sucks. it’s just that roster is fuckin terrible"
"What in the world made you think the Rockets would be fighting for a play in spot? They weren't that great WITH James Harden, who went on TV and said they weren't good enough. They quit playing John Wall to play their young guys exclusively. They traded basically everyone but Eric Gordon. I don't know how you seemed to believe they would be competitive. Rebuilding takes time."
Eric Gordon is going to be in this league a long time
I feel the exact same way about Eric Gordon for some reason. I'm glad he's stuck on the worst team in the league.
"Please tell me how the offense can be passable if they don’t have a legitimate nba level starting point guard. Even when KPJ comes back their point guard play is erratic, inefficient, and uninspired. Their wings can’t create offense for themselves and the only guy who can is inefficient and inj prone (eric gordon). I honestly want to understand how you can expect more than what is being shown here. Even the process sixers had more gritty players (and some are actually talented and net positive players )than this team."
"Took them to 7 games, and was the only team to do so. Also, are you really valuing Eric-fucking-Gordon over Chris Paul?"
"Houston tanking hard for Paolo.   In a few years when John Wall is gone, Eric Gordon gone, you’ll have Green, Sengun, Garuba, Tate."
"Penny hardaway, Kobe, Wade,TP, Manu, Clyde drexler, Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Marbury, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Westbrook, Curry, Kyrie, Harden. Those are some of the ball dominant guards those players you listed played with.   AD has played with Jrue Holiday, Rondo past his prime, Jimmer Fredette, Austin Rivers, Tim Frazier, Quinn Cook, Eric Gordon before he left the Pelicans. You also just compared him to the greatest centers of all time, so that's a pretty high bar. Also putting KD in that list pretty much destroys your entire argument, might as well throw in Kwahi, Bron and TMac if you're just throwing in wings as well."
Lmao what?! Yeah the Rockets with Eric Gordon as their second best player were gonna stop the KD Warriors. How do y'all come up with this shit?
"Play John Wall instead of Eric Gordon in the starting lineup, move Gordon to bench, give DJ Augustine's minutes to Gordon, cut House and give those minutes to Gordon too. Also too many low ceilings guys getting minutes. Brooks, Garrison Mathews, David Nwaba."
"I remember at the start of that season him, Harden, and Eric Gordon were bombing from way deep."
"Then yeah, he totally could.   Most recent time this kinda happened was with Eric Gordon. He did not want New Orleans to match and they did anyway. He didn’t sit out though, he was just super unhappy"
"AD played with starting lineups of Tim Frazier, half a season of Eric Gordon, Dante Cunningham/Quincy Pondexter, and Omer Asik for most of his Pelicans career."
*Eric Gordon has entered the chat.*
Probably not true given how loose his handle is and the lack of passing acumen but he’s played next to ERic gordon who has had the ball more
It's really not the same team though. Like Im the only player that was on both squads is Eric Gordon.
Eric Gordon last night missed at least 3 open layups. It was extremely bad

"u mean houston's stuck with eric gordon, surely"
it’s less about his and more about the state of the team. i think we should trade eric gordon too and i love eg
"I don't think people realize how brutally awful and unlucky you have to be to win &lt; 10% of your games.  Houston has a lot more talent than the Process Sixers at their worst, and the 7-59 Bobcats.  Side note, I feel so bad for Stephen Silas. He signed up to coach James Harden, not Eric Gordon"
Eric Gordon appears to be point shaving out here.
They don’t need to be giving Eric Gordon minutes to try and win them the game. They don’t care if they lose. They need to let Jalen Green and their young guys develop and you don’t do that by running every play for EG. Rockets aren’t trying to win
you can give much needed minutes to young prospects like DJ Augustine and Eric Gordon so they can develop into proper pieces in the future  Free Sengun
"That is just clearly false. His per game passing numbers are   Passes Received - 39.2 Passes Made - 29.3   That is the largest gap between passes received and passes made on the entire team.   I understand that Rockets fans don't like what's going on with the team but making up false narratives just to give yourself a reason to be angrier is pointless.   And before someone tells me to ""watch the games,"" I've watched every Rockets game this season aside from the Thunder matchup.   As an objective observer, aside from being a Sengun fan, this is all on the F/O for putting the team together this way and the coaches for doing things like playing Eric Gordon for 39 and 37 minutes the last two games."
Eric Gordon getting those PJ tucker flashbacks
"Great? What makes you say Eric Gordon is ""great""? His free throw attempts are way down and this 3pt percentage is not gonna last, and in reality he's probably a worse shooter at his age than he used to be."
Holy shit just realized Eric Gordon is still stuck in Houston lol
"lmao even that can’t save them. For some reason him and ad and the fo thought westbrook and some old vets were better than younger hungrier defensive pieces. Could have traded for 3&amp;D Wings and a shooter. Shit if i was them id trade whatever i could for Eric Gordon and Christian Wood. Lakers suck on DEF so might as well have offense. 26-30 is open for LA if they wanna take on one of Wall or Gordon/Wood. Wood provides a backup for AD as well as scoring if he has LeBron/Russ running PnR, and then you got a veteran elite shooter in Gordon"
Green was trying his best to ruin the tank with 16 on 7/11 shooting. Thank god Eric Gordon took the last shot instead
"Their oldest vet ""leaders"" are Daniel Theis &amp; Eric Gordon, 29 &amp; 33 respectively. Who exactly was expecting wins right away to put Silas on the hot seat?"
Eric Gordon has been good lately but he’s a ball hog
"There is no reason for Eric Gordon to have the ball so much at the end, let the young kids take those last shots."
Tank commander eric gordon coming in the clutch
"Hey, Eric Gordon made the all rookie team. Hes the kind of high ceiling player the rockets want to be developing."
"""Why did Stephen Silas make Eric Gordon and Tate miss wide open 3s""  \- rockets fans"
Eric Gordon and Alec Burks are carrying the knicks
Yea  However he had 21 last night and 14 tonight in 3 quarters both of really efficient shooting. Notice how KPJ has been out the past 2 games and replaced by an elite shooter in Eric Gordon?
It’s the lakers flair.  But I think his ceiling is eric Gordon
"Eric Gordon is trying to show himself so that a playoff team trades for him, but he's lowering his stock with these ""zero-pass iso"" possessions. Nobody wants him to put the ball down, only shoot 3s."
rockets fans is eric gordon still solid? or is he washed now
eric gordon still chillen on the rockets and lighting up the knicks #Loyalty
"I think people are focusing on Westbrook, but they'll figure out how to use him with Lebron and AD. He will be better than Shroeder.   The main issue is the lack of 3 and D players to play along side AD and Lebron. And idk if they can pick anyone up at the trade deadline.   Eric gordon will probably be traded, he would be an improvement.   Not sure if there's any other players like that they can pick up."
"He played god-tier basketball in Houston for 8 years, and everyone he was committed to besides Eric Gordon got traded or left. I don’t think there’s a single Houston fan who thinks Harden abandoned the team and didn’t do everything in his power to try and bring  ring to the team."
"&gt;	God, I had to give up on my career after B Fresh in 2K18. I really could not deal.  They should have used Eric Gordon or Dion Waiters for that part."
Send Westbrook to the Rockets for Eric Gordon and DJ Augustin
"Tate, Eric Gordon, and Silas. For Fox and Walton.   Who wins this trade? 😂"
"Any combo of Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Christian Wood, Daniel Theis and probably 2-3 picks."
Louisiana has been a cursed place for injuries   Saints have been wrecked by injuries and LSU has been destroyed these past couple seasons. And of course the Hornets/Pelicans have seemingly been injured immensely like every season this decade. Even our top asset from the CP3 trade (Eric Gordon) had a freak career derailing injury in like his first couple games with us back in 2011. I don't know how to explain it but its heartbreaking
"I mean look at them out there, its basically a team of teenagers.   some of them are 21-22 but they still look super young and nobody has been building muscle  if you didn't know you were watching a NBA game you could easily mistake it for kentucky or UCLA, except for eric gordon the only man amongst boys"
Harden with eric gordon and ryan anderson still made playoffs
"I feel bad for Eric Gordon, he’s the only one left on the Rockets and he’d be valuable to most contenders but his contracts makes it difficult"
"In many cases, teams should give into trade demands and they eventually do. I went through trade demands with Anthony Davis, Chris Paul and Eric Gordon.      Anthony Davis, it made sense to wait because Lakers needed him to capture Lebron's window, more than we needed AD for our short-term goals. We paid a culture and performance price that year while we waited it out. Not sure waiting led to any net benefits.   We didn't acquiesce on Gordon and he stayed, underperformed and impacted our culture for years.     When a player's done, it's best to move on. Just like when a team is done with a player, it moves on. Ben doesn't want to play for sixers organization, Joel and their fans. If it was just organizationally, that could be fixed by him coming and playing."
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
Paul George? Marcus Smart? Eric Gordon? Avery Bradley?
"Eric Gordon, FVV, Dillon Brooks have all done nice jobs guarding Curry in big occasions in the past."
Call it a hot take if you want but I’m very high on both JJJ and Ja to the point that I think they are gonna be title contenders within 2-3 seasons. Also think Desmond Bane is gonna be a borderline all star every time I watch him he reminds me a combo between young Eric Gordon/Rookie Malcom Brogdon.
Going from Eric Gordon and Injured players to Kevin Durant and Kyrie will make any man this happy
The Rockets have a really strong starting five:  PF: John Wall  SG: Eric Gordon  SF: Oladipa  PF: Tucker  C: Wood  &amp;#x200B;  That team's in remarkably good shape for a re-build.
"The Harden-DeAndre PNR was actually kinda suspect because Harden thought he was playing with prime DJ and airmailed it like 3 times (Harden had 6 TOs in the 1st half), but dude immediately adjusted and ran it really well in the 2nd, didn't have another TO, and fed DJ some super easy dunks. Although for some reason Bud kept on playing drop back defense with Lopez and denying the outlet and just let Harden spam floaters on the Buck's face all game.  Harris is actually our combo guard haha, D'Antoni is basically doing the Harden-Eric Gordon PNR, except Harris is shooting like 50% on 3's and (in my mind) like 90% on uncontested 3's, which have been coming in droves since Harden got here."
"Injured guard John Wall yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Christian Wood gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Eric Gordon yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Oladipo hit  locker room door, former NBA great DeSagana Diop hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Eric Gordon and Danny Green send their regards
He's just a lightskin Eric Gordon with a 70 point game   am i doing this right yall?
Here comes Eric Gordon.
"Simmons is on contract for 5 years though. You could spend 3 years acquiring assets and young players and then contending in years 4 and 5. Hell, if you got off the Eric Gordon contract you would literally have space for 2 max contracts in 2024 and build a super team with Ben Simmons if that’s the route you want to go. If a team’s front office is even semi competent 3 years of sucking is more than enough time to prep your salary cap, assets, etc in order to contend in year 4. If you honestly think Houston cannot build a team around Ben Simmons within FIVE years that’s not a problem with the timeline that’s a problem with your front office"
"Houston currently has a total of 22 million on the books for for 2023-2024 and literally nothing on the books for 2024-2025 which is the last year of Ben Simmons’ contract where he’s making 40mil. Couldn’t you guys theoretically spend the rest of this year and the following 2 years rebuilding/retooling (ie moves like trading Eric Gordon/pj tucker for any picks you can get hoping John wall plays well and you can get an asset for him in the expiring year like OKC did with Chris Paul, etc) with the timeline being attempting to contend in 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 where you have all the cap space in the world and Ben Simmons would be in his prime at 27 and 28 years old? I mean if you don’t believe in Ben Simmons sure that’s fine I don’t necessarily either but timeline wise I don’t understand how that doesn’t work."
Not being biased at all   John Wall-Oladipo-House-Tucker-Wood  2nd team is prolly  Eric Gordon - Mclemore -Tate -Cousins - Gobert
Who's starting at the 3 currently for the Rockets? Eric Gordon?
"They should unless injuries somehow get worse than they already have been.  They've emerged looking good from the toughest part of their schedule with about a third to half of their team out on basically every given night.  OP didn't even list Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Jae'Sean Tate, David Nwaba and Sterling Brown who have all proven to be very solid depth pieces... Plus, BOOGIEEE!"
"Patty Mills, Eric Gordon, and JJ Barea"
Eric Gordon
"1, 2 is Wall/Wood or Wood/Wall right now (I'm doing this with Dipo left out of the equation)  So that would make 3/4... Probably Eric Gordon, Sterling Brown. We have a lot of guys scrapping for that '4th/5th best' spot rn and House is still injured.   However I'll add the caveat that boogie is our 3rd best player if you only count the minutes he plays in games where he gets ejected. It's some sort of curse I swear to God. Either he plays meh out there for a whole game or he starts picking up steam and making an impact, and then immediately gets tossed."
Eric Gordon be taking 30 foot shots and bricking them 10 times a game. Then the next game he hits 2 of em and starts feeling himself again
Eric Gordon probably.
Eric Gordon
"That may be true for now but I gotta see it for more games.  When it comes to bench scorers for them to be good, I look for them to either be well above average efficiency wise, playmake decently well or defend at an above average lvl.  Ross might do the 1st this year but hasn’t done so previously.    Eric Gordon for example from 17-19 did not do the 1st two but was an underrated defender."
"Then how do you explain his league leading 11 apg during the 2016-2017 season? Look at that Rockets roster. He was leading the league in assist w/ his best teammates being Eric Gordon, LouWill, Capela, Ryan Anderson, Ariza, PatBev, etc."
Who is Gordon? Aaron Gordon? Gordon Hayward? Eric Gordon?
"I have a feeling you havent watched Houston games in a long time then. They traded a ball dominant non shooting PG with an injury history for another exact replica.  PJ Tucker has a lot of heart but simply doesnt have it anymore.  Eric Gordon shoots like 35-40% every season without a lick of defense.  Cousins is in no way shape or form “good” anymore.  Wood is great, I love the guy and wish him the best, but as if now he’s one of the worst defensive centers in the entire league.  If you think that team had potential to win a playoff series youre deluding yourself."
Probably because they both played together and all he had was a hobbled CP3 and whatever version of Eric Gordon that walked into the arena that night lol
"No more praying for Eric Gordon to make a basket, hoping John Wall and Cousins knee's will stay healthy or if Christian Wood is going to show up against a big that actually plays defense. He got a top 3 player with him and another top 15 player coming soon."
"Lends a lot more credence to people (Eric Gordon) saying that Harden said what he did not cuz he wanted to, but cuz he realized that Houston would keep dragging this shit out forever unless he did something."
"i guess eric gordon was right harden didn't mean it, he had to say it."
"I feel like Harden likes to default to playmaker when given the proper talent/system.   In pretty much all the All-Star games or Team USA, he looked more comfortable handling the rock and setting up the offense, than looking for his shot.   That’s how he was used a lot in his OKC days as most would say he was more of the PG over Westbrook.   He did league the league in assist with almost 12 per game in 2017 when his best players were Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson.   It’s crazy he can still go nuclear for 50+ on a given night and still get 12-15 assist.   The dude is a top-5 offensive system."
Until the playoffs where he had to deal with Patrick Beverley and Eric Gordon as the only other people who could handle the ball (both asswater at it)
"Good showing from the baby Rockets, especially Mason Jones and C Wood.   Can’t wait till we get John Wall, Eric Gordon, Boogie, Danuel House, and Sterling Brown back into the lineup. We still haven’t played a game at full strength."
Motivation comes by *a tiny bit* easier when you're staring at KD rather than Eric gordon
Lol Never saw him do this to Eric Gordon  Smh
Eric Gordon ain’t playing  Neither is Wall or Oladipo or House or Boog
People are going to realize why Harden always handled the ball when they see Eric Gordon average 50 turnovers per game
Eric Gordon will bring an important veteran locker room presence for the Chicago Bulls. We'll even throw in Danuel House and three firsts.
PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon?
He clearly uses “we’re” as in WE are. Not they. He’s really not throwing any teammates under the boss. It’s a comment on the team as a whole including him. And was he wrong? Eric Gordon clearly didn’t take it as throwing the teammates under the bus and Boogie seems to be the only one making a big deal of it publicly.  At the end of the day it really doesn’t matter. This sub takes any chance it can get to shit on Harden and this is a prime example. James has every right to say things like that. He has led this team for two entire contract terms.

Ancient Chris Paul? He got a Chris Paul that led the Rockets to being a 67 win team fresh off leading the Clippers to 50 win seasons. That same Chris Paul brought OKC to the playoffs last year and is revitalizing Phoenix this year.  Not to mention prime Dwight.  The Pelicans had no first round picks between AD and Buddy. They completely ignored improving that roster and every key piece on the team got there early and didn't improve. Jrue is the only other player worth mentioning he played with his whole career. Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson were his #3 and #4 guys (with Tyreke Evans #2) for a while and they were Harden's depth guys on some of the weaker rosters he was on.
"Eric Gordon is totally wrong.  James Harden disrespected his teammates.  James Harden was supposed to be the leader of the Rockets. He was the one who had the keys to the franchise for 8 years. He was the one who got everything he asked for.  The current Rockets team was the team Harden wanted. The Rockets' style of play was the style Harden wanted.  He had to take all of this on as a leader. Instead, he chose to flee elsewhere.  That's not the attitude of a leader, it's the attitude of a diva."
"Yup. When everyone's in a shitty situation, but only 1 or 2 guys actually have the clout to get out of it, the other guys stuck in that situation will naturally feel bad and even betrayed.  Except the people that have been in that situation with you for a long time and probably felt the same way (Eric Gordon, probably PJ Tucker as well). They probably want out too, but they don't have the clout to force the issue. They may still get out by being dealt in trades, but they likely won't get to choose their destination."
"&gt; MDA, Morey, Harden all yeeted tf out.  And Russ.  Wouldn't be surprised if PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon yeet out if they can too.  I can understand why Wall and Cousins felt disrespected, but they just joined the team after not having played for so long after injuries. They haven't been teammates with Harden for years like the other guys.  The popular media isn't going to shit on the owner. The player is the far easier target.  Remember when Russ requested the trade, people thought Russ and Harden had talked it out and decided this wasn't it, the owner was fucking the team up, and Russ took the hit first to get out and got lucky that the Wiz suddenly decided to deal Wall for him? It's so weird how opinion changed so quickly."
"To be fair they had injuries at such a high rate. Holiday has been healthy the last few years but was often injured those years, same with Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans, Ryan Anderson."
"[EG Pre Game](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/eric-gordon-of-the-houston-rockets-enters-the-arena-before-the-game-picture-id915088956?s=612x612)  [Harden &amp; Westbrook Pre Game](https://media.gq.com/photos/5e3c36033367520008ec7fec/3:4/w_2498,h_3331,c_limit/james-harden-russell-westbrook-gq-cover-march-2020-1.jpg)"
"The nets package is better in a long term view.   Sure they could’ve had Simmons and tried to build around him, but quite frankly they’re most likely not a playoff team in the west and have to commit to paying wall and Eric Gordon 100+mill for the next 2 seasons. By the time they can actually start to construct a roster, Ben Simmons would be disgruntled, their late picks would probably manifest into players drafted in the late 20’s and they’d be banking on FA wanting to play there.   With the nets offer the picks are so far away there is a VERY good chance none of harden, KD, kyrie are on the team and that we’re the worst team in the league again, giving the rockets the perfect opportunity to do exactly what the Celtics did."
"Aw I love Eric Gordon. Dude doesn't give a shit about anything but hoops, I mean have you seen the fits he wears to games? Literally sweats/rockets warmups lol"
And also because Eric Gordon is a bitch
Eric Gordon - Pi Mamba
"Yeah, it's r/nba that's tripping. Demarcus Cousins and John Wall had nothing to say about Harden. Wouldn't it be just as easy to look at Eric Gordon and say of course he doesn't feel disrespected since they've been through many wars together unlike other guys who don't really know Harden like that and felt disrespected?"
"Yeah [the TS% splits are also interesting](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2014-15,2012-13,2013-14,2016-17,2015-16,2018-19,2017-18,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612745&amp;PlayerId=201935) one thing I saw just now is many of his recent teammates like Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker actually had higher TS% when he wasnt on the court"
"I’ll say this. If I wanna leave a job cause my coworkers suck, I will. But I won’t tell them they suck. I’ll keep that to myself.   At the same time I’m not gonna call a Corolla a fast car because it isn’t. Ain’t a knock on the Corolla, it’s just a fact. It wasn’t built to be fast much like the rockets aren’t constructed to win a championship. But that’s a car. An object. James was probably looking at it like that. But these are human beings with emotions, not objects, so words should be used more carefully when mentioning someone’s level of performance vs something’s level of performance.  His teammate Eric Gordon who he’s been with for years didn’t even take his comments as disrespectful, but he knows james. Doesn’t mean the others took it the same way Gordon did though."
what did eric gordon say?
"after hearing what eric gordon said i believe harden really did have to act that way to get traded. he tried to get traded last season without causing a big issue, but wasn't able to. he did seem apprehensive or melancholy when he had that last rocket's interview. i think if he could have done it another way he would have preferred to."
When did Eric Gordon say that?
"he tried to get traded without causing trouble but they wouldn't trade him. so going by what his former teammate eric gordon said, harden had to act that way in order to get traded."
"That roster was not decent. Nearly every play from his tenure is out of the league/bench warmer.   And when he had good players they’d be constantly missing games such as Tyreek Evans, Eric Gordon, etc.  Who not to mention, Eric Gordon was actively tanking so he can get traded.   The year he has a decent roster was the 2017-18 team and they went to 2nd round of the playoffs and lost to KD Warriors."
Truly the Eric Gordon special
Yeah. It’s incredible that he can look like a superstar for a month and then play like Eric Gordon for the next month.
"Missing Chris Paul that game and I think Eric Gordon as well. Rockets down 20 the whole game. They slowly clawed their way back and Harden hit a shot to send it  to OT. Definitely one of his best regular season games as a Rocket.   Up there with his 60pt triple double against Orlando, where he carried the bench with pretty much all the starters out. Broke the Rockets franchise record for points in a game that night."
"James Harden’s failures all circle back to James harden.    In elimination games in Houston, Harden averaged 26.7/5.7/5.8 on laughable 39.9/32.7/82.5 shooting splits with 5.4 turnovers per game. Can’t blame Eric Gordon for Harden repeatedly shitting the bed."
"I guess injured CP, injured Clint, and Eric Gordon should have won.  You're right."
"Eric Gordon, Wes Matthews, Bradley Beal, and (so far) Patrick Williams. I’m running a mostly guard lineup bc shaq can carry defensively when needed and they’re smaller and faster than the bigs. Also I’d only really be lacking at the 4 position."
Eric gordon is so fucking worthless. He shoulda been gone with Ryan Andersen.  They both get scared in the playoffs when it counted.
"""He had to face the greatest team ever assembled? Not a good enough excuse bro.""  'He faced that team with Eric Gordon as his second option in Games 6 and 7? Not a good enough excuse bro."""
"Definitely. Harden was willing to share the ball with Eric gordon so he can pull up from 30 feet, he won't have an issue giving it up to kyrie and KD"
"Honestly where does a team of Wall + Simmons 🤢 and a nearly empty cupboard of assets get you? They’d have to completely retool their roster around Simmons while still having contracts like Eric gordon and John Wall on the books. They wouldn’t be competitive now, and it would be seriously difficult to build around what they do have   Those first round picks and an expiring oladipo are assets that won’t depreciate like a Ben Simmons that still can’t shoot or a LeVert who still hasn’t put it together either."
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Eric Gordon has been downgraded to GONE
"No way. You'd have been stuck in mediocrity, probably not even making the playoffs with no hope of getting a good pick.   Kevin Martin was the best player in the deal and he wasn't anything special. Dragic wasn't seen as that good or a great asset. Scola was an OK big. The Knicks were pretty good then.  Eric Gordon and Aminu were seen as really good young prospects. Getting good young prospects, which let you bottom out and get AD which put you in the position you are today."
"Instead, they got Chris Kaman, Eric Gordon, and Aminu. Hot damn, what a haul!  By the way, does anyone know if there's a reddit comment formatting to highlight sarcasm?"
"He wants to come to Houston to reunite with John Wall, I'm a trustworthy source don't worry.  Deal will be centered around Eric Gordon and Danuel House. Expect it to be announced within the week."
What? DLo alone is better than any one of wall/wood/gordon and thats before adding in KAT a top 20 player   Fox/Haliburton+anyone is also better than wall/wood/eric hence why they have almost twice as many wins as rockets
Eric Gordon was a projected all star people forget
"True, the 6 quarters that KD misses and the Warriors only had, prime Curry, prime Klay, and the last sight of motivated Green.   Harden should have won, after all, he had hurt CP, hurt Capella, and Eric Gordon.  How did Harden not win?"
Completely agree. He could even spend time at the 4 and run a line up with him and boogie. Christian wood is quick enough to cover the 3. And do Eric Gordon and John Wall
"eric gordon is absolute trash and there is only one team in the conference with a big three worse than Wall, Wood, Gordon and thats OKC"
"&gt; They can - there's nothing that says Houston needs to only take expiring money.  Their broke ass owner means they can’t take anything other than expirings. John wall, Christian wood, daneul house, and Eric Gordon alone costs them over 80 mil. They need to sign 10 more players to have a full roster next season. They can’t afford 20 million to Gary Harris.  &gt; He's been a 20 ppg scorer this year so far, even if his defense has fallen off, teams have traded late 1sts for less.  The Celtics don’t even need another guard. You gonna start him over Kemba, brown, or smart in the playoffs? Hell no. Philly trade you mentioned seems somewhat possible. Would be a bad idea for Philly unless they’re  convinced dipo will win them a chip this season, which I’m not."
"Typical scoring numbers for a third option, Love gave you good rebounding though.   Eric Gordon in 18-19  17.8/2.5  Tim Hardaway Jr. In 19-20  17.8/3.5  Just to give a few examples, this Nets pre Harden trade would have been very comparable to the 2016 Cavs which is the point and I would have said better outside of the top player."
Imagine the pistons trade griffin and picks for oladipo and Eric Gordon. That should help both sides unless pistons are in super tank mode
"yeah thats fair. Im not sure any of John Wall, Eric Gordon or Oladipo are on this team next year. Christian Wood is a future staple though, hopefully."
Eric Gordon he’s either Really good or really ass
Eric Gordon
Ooooh trade Eric Gordon for Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose   Sick squad
Trade for Eric Gordon
"If this was coming out of someone like PJ Tucker or Eric Gordon, then I take it seriously, but coming from a dude who hasn't played in 2 years and then missed 2 games start of the season, and got ejected twice out of the 6 games he played, I say this is not your place to say anything, Boogie."
"They are not as bad as everyone thinks they are. I remember getting roasted when I said OKC would still be a playoff team with CP3 SGA, Steven Adams and Danillo.   There are many on the subreddit that think the only valuable thing is scoring and statistics. I think Dipo gets these guy to the playoffs if Wall and Cousins are healthy especially with the emergence of Woods.  He is a much better fit playing with those guys and plays above the rim. Wall and Dipo will play well together offensively.  Much better than him and Harden.  Dipo is also a much better defender than Harden, and they still have a 6th man candidate in Eric Gordon."
"Simmons and 1-2 late first round picks is definitely worse than this deal. Getting Maxey, Simmons, and Matisse plus picks is the only deal from the sixers I’d want over just a shit load of picks. Ben Simmons would be fun but would make us a mediocre fringe playoff team for the next 5 years. I’d rather Hard tank and look towards a legit future and bet on hitting on some late picks or packaging picks to move up. We got picks and wood for RoCo, a pick and Wall for Westbrook and for harden we got 4 firsts, 4 pick swaps, and Victor who will be traded for another first most likely at the deadline. If he has a resurgence it could be a legit haul for him as well. PJ could get us another late first. Eric Gordon could be swapped for another bad contract and a pick in my opinion if the offer ever presents itself. Wall and Gordon are our only real bad contracts and neither player is necessarily bad, just old."
I thought it was likely they trade the other pick from the Covington trade to move Eric Gordon.
Best thing that happened to us got outplayed by Eric Gordon
I think that's extremely unlikely.  There are zero teams in the league right now which are a PJ Tucker or Eric Gordon away from beating the Lakers/Nets. Why would anyone give picks for them?
"Money. They are betting that if Oladipo works out, signing him long term will be a better financial move than locking into 18M per year of Levert over the next two years. This becomes easier to envision if league financials take a continued hit this season. Players may have to settle for less than they normally would while Levert may shift into slightly overpaid status if his surrounding peers have to take less.   This is all also a prelude Eric Gordon being shown the door.  If they got rid of Levert, you can bet Eric is next out the door."
The Rockets are paying John Wall and Eric Gordon a combined $70 million for the next 3 years. They’re going to be garbage. The Nets at least have proven competent front office. The Rockets are just as likely to be worst than the Nets than vice versa.
True. Eric Gordon doesn’t have many prime years left in him
"How do you mean completely reactionary?  Everyone knew when they signed the Chris Paul and Dwight Howard contracts that they were going for high risk high reward win now moves that required spending large amounts of money.  Those were proactive attempts to bolster the roster around James Harden, and in no way reactions.  If anything, they reacted quickly by trying to retool to actually take advantage of James Harden's prime.  They sign a contract for Dwight Howard to get a great player for James Harden to play with.  BUT, James Harden can't play with him. So they ship him out.  BUT, James Harden wants to win now. So they sign a massive contract with aging and injury prone Chris Paul to win now cause he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, James can't win with Chris Paul his first year. So they try to retool the team. They get the hottest 3-D guy on the market in RoCo and hope for a runback.  BUT, james can't win with Chris again and starts to dislike him. So the team ships him out and further leverages their future for Russell Westbrook because he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, this style doesn't work very well. So they retool the team. They ship out capela and go true small ball.  BUT, they still don't win. James gets grumpy and wants his new friend shipped out again.  And, now, the rockets have a very grim future and James Harden blames the Rockets.  And its not like they havent had competent players on their team throughout James Harden's tenure. PJ Tucker has been a shining example of an amazing contract in the league and Eric Gordon outside this past year was a fantastic second/third option.  They had their chances and blew it. Whether that was bad performances, bad luck, bad timing or a mixture of all three is beyond me, but I don't think its fair to say the Rockets weren't trying and spending for it too.  Rockets fans like to point to not resigning Trevor Ariza after the 17/18 season as an example of the poor management of the Rockets and their refusal to pay up.  But I just don't think Trevor Ariza is the difference maker between a winning team and a losing team.  I think the rockets could have spent more. But I dont think its fair to say they needed to.  In 2018-19, the Raptors spent $11 million more than the Rockets and won the NBA championship.  In 2019-20, the Lakers spent $13 million less than the rockets and won the NBA championship."
"Tbf he never wanted to play with the in the first place and demanded a trade well before the season started. But continue to blame harden because he doesn't think Wall who can't shoot, Wood, Tucker, Cousins, McLemore, Nwba, and whatever's left of Eric Gordon is good enough to win the west 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Considering that Kyrie might be worthless to Houston, I'd say it's a pretty strong possibility. Rockets are going to choose between a Simmons deal and a everything-the-nets-have-but-KD-or-Kyrie deal. I'm assuming that the Rockets also get to dump Eric Gordon in the deal."
Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker are proven role players in this league
"It’s not. People are just really into the narrative of this team potentially being good.  They have a PG who cant shoot, an SF that nobody has ever heard of, a PF whose entire offense consists of corner 3s, and an undrafted center who’s good, but is terrible defensively.   Their bench consists of Eric Gordon, who shoots like 35% every season, and a Center who has more ejections than points. Everyone else is a no name."
PJ tucker and Eric Gordon might be involved in that trade as well
"Notice no response  Curry stans have literally no logical consistency to any of the arguments they're spewing on here.   There are people arguing Harden playing with Russell Westbrook, CP3, and Dwight Howard at different points in their career while they were all outta their primes, often injured and bad at the most important times (Dwight hurt and mediocre in 15 &amp; 16 playoffs, CP3 hurt in 18 playoffs, mediocre in 19 Playoffs, Russ hurt mediocre in 2020 playoffs).....  is somehow equivalent to Steph playing with Klay, KD, Draymond and Iggy all relatively in their primes for years. Bullshit. Then there's people claiming Steph has to play with Juan Toscano Anderson while implying Harden's worst role players were guys like Eric Gordon when in reality they were guys like this:  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html)  Notice his only season with Harden was his last season in the NBA. Harden had to play 70 games with a guy who was so bad he dropped out of the league forever afterwards.  Jesus, the lengths people go to defend Curry at all costs. You can still acknowledge Curry is better and all without lying about objective facts"
"That has nothing to do with this thread. This thread is saying Steph playing with Wiggins (55.6 TS%), Wiseman (54.8 TS%), Oubre (50.2 TS%), and Draymond (42.7 TS%) is the equivalent to when James Harden had to play with Chris Paul (60.4 TS%), Trevor Ariza (56.7 TS%), Ryan Anderson (59.2 TS%), and Clint Capela (65.0 TS%), with Eric Gordon (57.8 TS%) off the bench."
"Lost Wood and no Oladipo (though he’s been lousy recently)  Eric Gordon has been awesome though, we need to trade him while his value is high"
"8 games is a ton in one season.  they had a top 10 defense.  eric gordon and ryan anderson were our 2nd and 3rd best players.  the season before those guys were with anthony davis and went 30-52.  and they were 13-24 when all 3 played so it's not like it was just injuries.  in the games where they played with harden, they were 45-20.  preseason expectations were low because people didn't think even someone like harden could elevate such a group, but he did."
"Harden was going toe to toe when he was with CP3, Capela, Eric Gordon, great shooting or defensive players. When he had no help he was losing in 5 or getting swept by Klay and Draymond."
The last time the rockets and warriors played when both teams were competitive harden had:  * Carmelo Anthony * Clint Capela * Eric Gordon * Chris Paul * PJ Tucker  That's an interest cast of no help...
yea lol eric gordon barely bumped him and the ref was rdy to blow the whistle the moment randle got touched
"The argument you just made for the stat being bullshit also proves that Harden had a far better supporting cast and therefore shouldn't be credited for winning more games than Westbrook that season.  As you said, Harden's backups were Lou Williams and Eric Gordon while Westbrook's was a no name that never played in the NBA again."
"That team was only great because of Harden.   Who was the second best player?   Trevor Ariza?   Eric Gordon?       And yes, winning games is generally considered to be more impressive than losing them."
"I think Oladipo is just washed at this point tbh. Eric Gordon is interesting though, I hadn’t thought about that one before"
Eric Gordon or Oladipo would help you guys
Would you be interested in Eric Gordon or Oladipo?
"Those on/off points numbers are kind of bullshit, his backup was a rookie who never played in the NBA again. Harden's were Lou Will and Eric Gordon yet he still had a similar pts/poss impact for his team.  He won because his statlines were godlike and he clutched up the entire last month, like you said. Everyone knew he wasn't the best player in the NBA, but he was getting stats that hadn't been seen in decades and willing a terrible roster to the playoffs."
That Eric Gordon early career injury makes me so sad....he would have feasted on the league in his prime
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
"He used it as means to an end to get the trade going, definitely rubbed teammates the wrong way, but I think those that have been with him for a little knows that he probably didn’t mean to shit on anyone for the purpose of being a dick head.  “Eric Gordon said he did not believe Harden meant to ""disrespect"" his teammates with his comments."" He wanted his way out. And he got it."" “"
"Uh. signed Dwight Howard, traded for Beverley for basically nothing, drafted Trez and Capela, traded for CP3, got Eric Gordon"
"Or ask Eric Gordon, who played with him the longest and said he didn't care and he had to do what he had to do lol"
"He was a SG in the last half of his time with New Orleans. He was a Point Guard before then and came to New Orleans originally as one. Unless Eric Gordon was also Point Guard from 2014-2016? When he was in Philly he was also clearly the Point Guard.  He’s 3rd in Assists because Giannis and Khris are Star playmakers and allow him to play off ball more.  I’m not saying Bleacher Report is gospel, but I’m just saying I can at least come up with sources. You however still haven’t shown me anything where he is being labeled as a SG this year.   When you look through the starting lineups on NBA.com, ESPN.com he’s always a PG.  https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401265866"
"There's this one Bill Simmons [column](https://grantland.com/features/the-third-day-nba-christmas/) from December 2011 where he argues that Afflalo getting a ridiculous contract isn't as ridiculous as it sounds because of how awful the SG position was at the time.   In the column Simmons says there's 2 franchise guys (Wade, Kobe), 2 all-stars (Manu, Joe Johnson), 1 potential all-star (Eric Gordon), 2 ""scorers only"" (Monta Ellis, Kevin Martin) and the 3 ""sure thing starters"" (Harden before his breakout season, Wesley Matthews and Afflalo). Simmons isn't necessarily the best judge of talent lol but that gives you an idea of how weak the position was at the time, it's not quite ""Afflalo top 3"" but pretty weak.  I only mention this because the OP mentioning Afflalo in particular makes me think he might be remembering this column (where Simmons talks about the SG position being weak and makes a case for Afflalo) and thinking about an exaggerated version of it, which tends to happen 10 years after the fact. Pretty random guy to mention otherwise."
Eric Gordon dropping F bombs out there lol
Whoever was on Josh Hart throughout the game is a total clown. I wouldn't be surprised if it was Eric Gordon (who's never heard of a rebound).
"I attended two of those games in NYC when I lived there and that hot streak definitely put him on a pedestal which resulted in him getting on my favorite team, the Rockets.  I agree that he has the skills to be a decent role player in the form of Austin Rivers or Ben McLemore but not to the level of Eric Gordon when he's on a role (those are my recent Rockets comps). Speaking on Ben McLemore, the NBA has also changed and his lack of defensive capabilities (abilities) are glaring so he wouldn't be able to stay on the court unless he could light it up at the near Trae-level to justify having him out there. Nowadays it's almost as if it's better to be average-to-above average on BOTH sides of the floor rather than excellent on one side of the floor but a ZERO on the other (e.g., GREAT shooter with BAD defense; GREAT defender that's a BAD shooter)."
That sounds realistic. Comp is Eric Gordon in my book and Trent got a lot of career left. Plus this offseason is going to be a untouched gold mine for Free Agents.
Yeah it’s tough Philly needs another half court creator/organizer but it’s also  hard to find someone who’ll do that in a way that can really make a difference after the first round it’s not like a defensive big or 3+D wing. Lowry is the dream but I think requires giving up Maxey   Otto Porter is someone I like but his salary is pretty damn big to match in a trade. Eric Gordon might be another option but he’s risky with that contract and both these guys don’t offer anything for playmaking. If Charlotte doesn’t want to pay devonte Graham that might be someone I ask about but idk haven’t heard any buzz about him being potentially available
Lol might’ve been my first game since that same OKC game too.   But yeah best believe I was booing Eric Gordon thru my mask as much as possible. So heartwarming to see he was -40.
"Went tonight, first game since the OKC game where Adams yeeted the ball into our basket from like full court. There were easily more chants and heckling of Eric Gordon than ANYONE else, including Boogie. Everyone mainly wanted Boogie to miss (but wish him good luck) whereas EVERYONE heckling was on Gordon's case. In that arena, every time he took contact it sounded like he was a stuck pig, even from across the blender."
"Truth be told I was always way more afraid of your role players constantly rising to the occasion to beat the Jazz.  Fucking PJ, Eric Gordon, and Rivers Jr."
Eric did not have a good time in the blender. There were a couple “Gordon ... sucks” chants going around throughout the game plus he got booed every time he touched the ball lol.
All my homies hate Eric Gordon.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Everyone in NO loves to see Eric Gordon with a -40 stat line.  Maybe the most joy evoking part of the entire box score.
"Imagine being in a locker room with Boogie, Eric Gordon, John Wall, PJ Tucker. I dunno why Im just thinking it'd be so awkward because they all have these straight personalities/attitudes."
Has Eric Gordon ever rested. Feel like he's been in the whole game.
No one in the league dribbles the ball *harder* than Eric Gordon. He probably destroyed some indoor balls playing outdoors growing up.
Hmm but the domination is still insane. OK i hope yall understand why Rockets fans rode Harden's dick.  2015 2nd seed with Dwight out half the season.  2017 second best player is eric gordon or clint  2019 gleague roster for large parts of the season.
Neither did John Wall. Or Eric Gordon.
"Look at some of the rosters that harden won 50+ games with. In 16/17 he won 55 games with Eric Gordon being his wingman. Thats the point. Ad, for as great as he is, isn't on that level of play."
I remember some odd years ago when Eric Gordon was #10 or #9 in the league in scoring when he was on the Clippers dropping 20 a game
"Tough week for my fantasy team. Jalen Brown, Eric Gordon, Conley, and now Markkanen..."
"No, we're the team that starts out cold, gets hot, and then get trounced by Eric Gordon! Get your facts straight."
"Those were my favorite moments of high school ball. I played in central Indiana, our sectional my senior year had a team with Josh McRoberts, a team with Eric Gordon, and another team with Mike Conley and Greg Oden. They all obviously destroyed us whenever we played, but I distinctly remember Mike Conley. Our PG was our best player, he ended up playing D3 college. But Mike Conley just dog walked him up and down the court one game, even though he was a year or two younger. I remember our coach just yelling at him because he's turning the ball over, he's getting his pocket picked, he can't stay in front of him. He just had a rough game, but what was he supposed to do? He eventually came to the bench and sat down and was like, ""I don't know what coach wants me to do here. He's *just better than me.*"" Which is a hard thing to admit in high school when you are pretty good yourself haha. At a certain point, what are you supposed to do when there is someone who is just better than you."
"Every time I hear people talk about Eric Gordon playing excellent defense it just solidifies to me that defense is so much about effort and focus. He didn’t give 2 shits in New Orleans, played no defense what so ever from day 1."
Eric Gordon does it a lot.
"&gt;I got downvoted into oblivion for saying that having better teammates elevates one’s own stats.  What a silly comment.  Harden averaged 11 assists with a lineup of Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela, Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon off the bench."
Not against Houston's bench though. Eric Gordon still gives me night terrors. I wake up in the middle of the night and see his lego head as a silhouette in my hallway
Harden 3rd seed with Eric gordon as the second best player
Watch us win against the Jazz tonight.   Only thing is that #1 Jazz Killer Eric Gordon is out too
Eric Gordon in the offseason maybe..?
"Eric Gordon before his injury was playing his best ball since 2018. I know sixers fans think basketball players are only supposed to have 2 things they're good at, but y'all would be lucky to have him coming off your bench or starting him as a 3."
Ya I thought about Eric Gordon to Philly but guess not now lol
No thanks I’ll stick with KPJ and Eric Gordon in a full body cast
Reminds me of Eric Gordon. Is that just me?
"It's a shame. Healthy Eric Gordon is such a fun player to watch, and really could be a top 30-40 player in the league. But injuries are keeping him from any form of consistency and butchering his value/career."
For Sale. Eric Gordon. Never Won.  -E.Hemingway
"Christian Wood and John Wall are pretty good second and third options. Eric Gordon is a good 6 man. John Wall's stats this season are not much different than when he was in his prime other than reduced assists. Had they been healthy, they would've been in the mix for the 8-10 seed without Harden."
&gt;How isn't Wiggins good enough to be a 3rd guy? He's better than Eric Gordon who used to be the Rockets 3rd option or Kyle Kuzma.  Because he was a bad 3rd guy with us in 2017-2018? And that he's not really an efficient scorer.
How isn't Wiggins good enough to be a 3rd guy? He's better than Eric Gordon who used to be the Rockets 3rd option or Kyle Kuzma.
"Eric Gordon and his yearly injury that makes him miss a month, name a more iconic duo."
**ERIC GORDON FOR SALE**  ^now ^~~50%~~ ^~~75%~~  ^99% ^off
and Eric Gordon was barely healthy that season and when he was healthy that season he was having one of his worst years in Houston.
What's that got to do with Eric Gordon dropping 50 on the Jazz
Eric Gordon is a Jazz killer. I never feel comfortable playing him
"Wtf is this lmao listing literally the worst players on Harden’s roster and leaving out Chris Paul, Clint Capela, PJ Tucker, and Eric Gordon lmao"
Eric Gordon injury really put a damper on tonight’s tank.
Eric Gordon getting a groin injury tonight makes healthy scratches for players you are going to trade away a smart idea.
It’s pretty much what Rockets always played except with Hardens assists actually getting made instead of being bricked by Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon can really help a contender imo.
He led the rockets to the 3 seed in a stacked west with Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon as his next best teammates...
"How is there Eric Gordon but no CJ, I’m confused"
Yeah I also don’t see sexton which doesn’t make sense to me cause Eric gordon is on the list 🤨
If Eric Gordon makes the USA Basketball Olympics team we winning bronze
"I wonder if an Eric Gordon/minor asset for LMA deal was considered, or is being considered  Seems somewhat beneficial for both teams, I’m not thrilled about it, but I don’t think it’s bad"
Not Eric Gordon?
"I think you're looking at it from the wrong angle. that's all those guys should be doing. their role was defined by their skillsets being limited. if you've ever seen Danuel House try and move around the court or dribble a basketball, you'll know why he shouldn't be doing much more than standing on the 3pt line. same goes for PJ Tucker, and even Eric Gordon.  &amp;#x200B;  they didn't have any intelligent playmakers on the team. they were consistently signing minimum guys and pulling up from the G League (House, Mclemore) or finding guys that nobody else wanted (Rivers, Green, even Gordon) to avoid paying the tax.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Missing Piece the Rockets Need to Help James Harden - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/5/11/18616097/houston-rockets-missing-piece-james-harden)  &gt;The Rockets’ problem, especially in comparison to the  Warriors, is that they have never had players who combine both. They  have no one comparable to Andre Iguodala or Klay Thompson, much less  Draymond or Durant. None of their other shot creators are natural  pick-and-roll partners for a star guard. Golden State can switch a  screen between Harden and Gordon, Paul, or Rivers, and keep  similar-sized defenders on both players. They don’t have to worry about  any of those three attacking Harden’s defender on a switch. He is always  the one who has to create the mismatch, which wears him down during a  series. My guess is the primary cause of Harden’s history of fading in  the playoffs is his overwhelming offensive responsibility, not any flaw  in his character or his game.   &gt;   &gt;Harden doesn’t play with anyone who makes his life easier in the way Draymond and Durant do for Steph Curry. [The play that sealed Game 6 for Golden State](https://twitter.com/connectwidutpal/status/1127056521232175105)  (a Thompson 3 with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter) summed up the  difference between the two teams. Houston blitzed a pick-and-roll  between Steph and Draymond, creating a four-on-three opportunity for  Draymond at the 3-point line. He drove into the lane and found Iguodala  in the corner, who then swung the ball to Thompson. There is no one on  the Rockets’ roster who can consistently make the play that Green did.  Draymond is a legitimate point forward. Neither Capela nor Tucker is  comfortable making plays off the dribble. The Warriors can overload to  stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making  them pay for it.  this is a really good article that highlights the difference between the Rockets and, say, the Warriors. it's not like Harden wouldn't of rather had other lineups, it's that for what the Rockets were willing to spend they were never going to get guys who were more capable of doing anything other than 3&amp;D."
Bron then Giannis have the best shooting percentage off of drives among players who average 4 or more per game. Then 3rd is.......Eric Gordon??? Lol
"Eric Gordon always surprises me with his game in the playoffs, someone should really trade a young player and or a pick for him."
"Really though? Here are some people on ~20m contracts. Jerami Grant, THJ, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon, Bojan, Caris LeVert, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Gallanari, etc. Given a choice, would you willingly pay 20M for Wiggins over any of these players?"
"So you don't think Harden maximizes roleplayers?  He's arguably the best in the league at making dudes who were out of the league look like they belong on playoff teams.  Faried Rivers Mclemore House Jeff Green Eric Gordon  The list goes on of guys that he basically revitalized the careers of.   The entire strategy that our F.O used was to find cheap contracts and guys no one else wanted and let Harden simplify everything for them so they were playable again.   The addition of ""every great team"" isn't honest to the subject. This Warriors team is not a great team and neither were most of those Rockets teams. Most teams aren't great, which is why most need their star on ball."
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"There might not be as many injuries total, but it certainly has affected a lot more star players than in the past, which is why people probably think there have been more injuries.  Not even done with the season yet and we have had Steph, LeBron, AD, Mitchell, Embiid, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Murray, Dinwiddie, LaMelo, Hayward, Lavine, Jerami Grant, Wiseman, Oubre, Klay, Eric Gordon, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Drummond, Oladipo, Mitchel Robinson, and SGA miss significant time."
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"You want a 3&amp;D like Eric Gordon or Gary Harris at the 2. Wall starting PG for defense . It'd be a good lineup , KAT alone can damn near carry the offense and you have enough defenders out there"
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"
For real. Eric Gordon looks like he hasnt slept in 10 years
Is Eric Gordon supposed to seem younger than James Harden? Cuz he definitely has always seemed older to me.
No you didn’t. You named players who suck *now* and were allstars in years prior as if that was suppose to mean something. Eric Gordon has never even made the top 10 for any all star positional voting. Please stop.  What HOF players did harden play with? Westbrooks 17 and 4 on 40% TS? Paul who literally *did not play* after they went up 3-2?  They won 2015 because kyrie got hurt. Hardly even counts. Harden will easily win with the pussy super teams steph has been on
"&gt; borderline perennial all star gordon  LOL  &gt; westbrook   17 and 4 on 40% TS in the playoffs with harden.  &gt; paul   65 wins and up 3-2 on your team until they got bailed out by injuries. uh huh.  &gt; dwight  was never good against golden state and refused to run pick and roll.  paul did not want out, and russ only wanted out because harden did.  &gt; lebron won rings with bad teams  kyrie/love wade/bosh is ""bad"" now?  if you really want to compare clint capella and eric gordon to klay, dray, iggy, and kd, your argument is garbage"
what place is eric gordon on your shit list
"&gt; You don’t lead the league in assists per game twice like he’s about to do without being an incredible passer,  Counterpoint: Russell Westbrook exists. You can absolutely put up great passing numbers while being a mediocre passer. Not to say Harden is mediocre in that regard... he just isn't anything special at it either. Think about how a 2019 Rockets possession usually goes for a second.   Harden stands at the top of the key.  Harden dribbles for 15-20 seconds.   Harden decides to drive or shoot... in this case drive for the kickout to Eric Gordon on the wing.  Gordon makes the shot.  Now tell me... what exactly in that possession demonstrated Harden was an elite passer? If anything,  it demonstrated why the Rockets struggled so much in the post-season: no rhythm outside of Harden."
"Either way, fuck Eric Gordon."
"To everyone saying no, Eric Gordon was in numerous reports that teams were interested in acquiring him   My educated guess tells me that it was for another bad contract and a pick, or they wanted one of our cheap pieces (Tate was being brought up in reports)   I think it’s possible some desperate teams gives us an expiring next season, he needs to be healthy though"
"&gt; **Is Eric Gordon a Houston Rocket next year?**   Gordon was having a pretty solid season, eFG wise, and then he got injured again.... So as the same story goes... HOU is too cheap to offer assets to get rid of EG, so he's going to be there for the foreseeable future."
Rockets offered all their picks and expiring filler for Butler  Thibs declined  We couldve seen   CP3-Harden-Butler-Tucker-Capela with 6moty Eric Gordon  But thibs wanted to win now and didnt want the picks
"Who says they sucks? Im a Rockets, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker and Capela are players I love. But its not an insult to say there was a massive talent gap between the two teams. Harden went 0-11 but he still drove well, drew fouls and created offense for others. Yea he didnt shoot great from 3 but there is more to offense than that."
Eric Gordon still gets booed in New Orleans. I mean who gives af about Gordon like that? lol...
"&gt;Harden - 2017, game 7 loss to Warriors  2017 is fair but come on you can't blame him for losing a game 7 against the Warriors who had Steph, Klay and KD in their prime while Harden had Trevor Ariza, Capela, PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon in his starting line up lol."
Eric Gordon won 6MOTY for us and generally always shows up in the playoffs. He was crucial in 18 and 19 especially and was decent in 17 and 20
He used to get clamped up by Eric Gordon imagine what Dillion brooks will do to him
He gave a double bang to Eric Gordon a few years ago
"I think it'd be unfair to say something like ""The 2015/16 Rockets were worse, Harden deserves so much more credit"", this Warriors team is horrendous. Can you imagine how much Warriors fans would kill to ""only"" have Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard or Eric Gordon as the second best player? This team straight up can't score without Steph.   (Also because I got into basketball that playoffs, I hard disagree for 2015, Dwight played 41, sure, but come playoffs he mashed the Mavericks, and _with Harden on the bench_, he was the center axis of that insane comeback against the Clippers. He was, to a certain, real extent, the 2nd star. Its his last real Dwight season. To compare the first Rockets era to this Warriors team is revisionist)"
"As great as Curry is, and I truly believe he is easily a top 20 NBA player of all time, he just isn’t built with the same durability as WB and especially Harden. That’s not a slight on him but just how it is.   People want to complain about how bad rest of the Warriors are and mistakes Kerr made but just taking a look at the rosters Harden had especially in 2015, 2016 and 2017 with Kevin McHale as HC for 2 of those seasons (MDA in 2017), and Harden had way more success with a lot less.   2015: 2nd seed, WCF with Howard playing 41 games, starting Jason Terry at PG when Beverley went down, having to rely on Brewer and Josh Smith as key reserves. Ariza was the 2nd best player on that team that year.   2016: Harden got a lot of flack for how he came into the season, deservedly so, but still put up 29/7/7 and got the Rockets to 41-41, 8th seed even with the team split. They at least got a game out of the 73-9 Warriors.  Harden didn’t even get an All NBA team selection. Ridiculous and even more now so considering the praise Curry was/is getting this season (top-3 MVP, probable 1st team All-NBA).   2017: 3rd seed, 2nd best player was maybe Eric Gordon or Ryan Anderson. Terrible game 6 against the Spurs, so Harden deserved criticism for that but just taking that roster as far as he did while averaging 29/11/8. They lost to a 61 win Spurs team (without Kawhi or Parker in Game 6) so it’s not like the Rockets “choked” imo.   It’s just kinda sickening watching from a distance how Curry gets coddled by the same people that have no issues with throwing criticism to players that weren’t as fortunate as him when playing with other great players."
"Well it's also different because he had Russ, Eric Gordon, Robert Covington, and PJ Tucker instead of relying on Jordan Poole, JLT, and Dray lol"
He was much better than the guys the warriors have. Eric Gordon had the ability to get his own shot and make 3s
"Tate doesn’t make much and Olynk is a FA. But this works:   Wiggins, Wiseman, Minny pick   for  Eric Gordon, Wood, DJ Augustin, Danuel House"
"But Westbrook and CP3 werent healthy lol  As for Dame, please just rewatch their 2018 series vs New Orleans. He was doubled basically every possession for the entire series  I wont even talk about Eric Gordon because... yeah"
Christian Wood &amp; Eric Gordon?
"&gt;CP3/Westbrook (when healthy)   That's the point, they've been hurt every playoff run for Harden, so he really hasn't had the help.  &gt;or Eric Gordon to consistently help on offense.  Now we just sayin names? Gordon as a consistent playoff threat? He's not even as reliable as Wiggins, who's way more durable (Gordon is hurt all the time) and has scored more this year than Gordon's ever had."
"Regardless, you’re kidding yourself if you think Eric Gordon was some great sidekick to relieve some offensive pressure for Harden back in the day"
Dame and Harden have never been alone on offense though. Dame has CJ to pick up the slack as another threat and Harden has had at least CP3/Westbrook (when healthy) or Eric Gordon to consistently help on offense.   Steph has not had a reliable wingman since Klay went down in the 2019 finals.   His turnovers tonight we're inexcusable but let's not act like there's a reliable scorer besides Steph on this year's Warriors squad.
"I mean I know he got double teamed, no question, but I guess I haven't seen it happen to him in a playoff setting for 3 quarters, because he could dump it to Eric Gordon, Russ, or CP3, or whoever was on his team that could create for themselves."
"Bazemore, Wiggins, and Poole all had better FG% and 3P% than Eric Gordon did with Harden so I’m not sure why you mention him as some elite shooter. Capela also literally couldn’t score unless Harden gave him a lob back then."
"Harden and LeBron made it with their bum teamates because there bums can shoot and play D, the Warriors bums can only play D leading to people doubling Curry full court, like this roster was BAD, the only Players that can even create their own shot on it where Curry and Jordan Poole, at least Bron had Larry Hughes and Mo who can shoot 3's and handle, and Harden had Eric Gordon and Parsons before the injury who can do both as well"
none of those guys are better than Draymond lmao. The only dude of those 3 that are even comparable to fkin Wiggins is Eric Gordon.
Harden averaged 40 Ppg for 3 months in 2018-19 with his next best scoring option being Eric Gordon or Daniel House and he still got plenty of criticism for ball hogging and having turnovers.
Eric Gordon? Tucker ? Capella ? Why do you harden stand pretend these guys didn't exist ?
"Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Solomon Hill, Julius Randle, Anthony Morrow, Daunte Cunningham"
"It wasn't even ""the last bit""... It was basically all of game 7.  Rockets made the adjustment to stop switching on him, since he was hunting and abusing the Covington matchup.  They had Gordon stick to him the entire time, and Eric did a great job of limiting him."
before the season the two teams basically had the same over/under.  then harden made ryan anderson and eric gordon (30-52 together on NO the year before) look like winners and suddenly he had too much help.
Eric Gordon Hayward?
"Steph, Luka, and Eric Gordon are the prestigious Bang Bang Bros"
Mark jackson is challenging eric gordon for roundest head
Surprised this didn't get a real answer with the exception of u/scottishere's comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nfrd7j/terry_rozier_went_09_behind_the_arc_tonight/gynvu4p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Here the list of most missed 3s in a game 7:  11 - James Harden 2018 WCF (2-13 from 3)  11 - John Starks 1994 Finals (0-11)  10 - Eric Gordon 2018 WCF (2-12)  10 - Terry Rozier 2018 ECF (0-10)  10 - Steph Curry 2016 Finals (4-14)  10 - Craig Hodges 1990 ECF (2-12)  9 - Trevor Ariza 2018 WCF (0-9)  9 - Jaylen Brown 2018 ECF (3-12)  8 - James Harden 2020 First Round (1-9)  8 - Marcus Smart ECSF (2-10)  8 - Klay Thompson Finals (2-10)  8 - Joe Johnson 2013 First Round (1-9)
"&gt; Harden should have 1 more MVP  I will die on the hill that Harden should have won over Curry in 2015. Dwight missed half of the season and Harden carried the Rockets to the 2 seed. Curry was great but he still had Dray, Klay, Barnes, Iguodala, etc. The Warriors were figgin stacked and Harden's most consistent help was Eric Gordon."
"What? Harden shot 41% from the field on 29 points a game, Cp3 was shooting 40% on 20 points a game that series. The only game Cp3 truly outperformed him was game 5 but Eric Gordon was the true star of that game.   The very next season Harden put up a crazy performance against the Warriors in the playoffs but Cp3 was dealing with injuries and played a bad series."
Also Lou Will and Eric Gordon on the Rockets lol.
eric gordon
"I swear Ish has lowkey been a quality point guard for so long.   I have a weirdly vivid memory of watching a Pelicans game on opening night in 2015(?) where Ish Smith was legit their best player. AD was trash, whoever they started at PG was trash, Eric Gordon was trash, and Ish was out here trying to put the team on his back. Game was weird as hell.  Since then I've been on the ""Ish Smith should be a starting PG"" train, but he's still just continued to be a journeyman and never really gets the credit he deserves."
Eric Gordon is a very appealing trade piece but nobody is trading for that John Wall Contract.
"I feel for Wall. The fact that he was acquired with a 2nd round pick lets you know the whole story. Houston were hedging their bets on a rebuild after the Morey/D'Antoni era had ended, but were still hoping Harden would stay.  Alas Robert Covington is traded for a pick and Harden soon follows. Eric Gordon is mysteriously shut down and PJ Tucker is traded to the Bucks.   Wall is now on a team that would much prefer to develop guys like Tate, Wood, KPJ, Brown through the losses. Guys that are delayed by the presence of a ball dominant star like Wall.  The only answer is to buy him out. I can't see a contender taking on his contract or a rebuilding team requiring his minutes. And buying him out does right by his good character he's displayed during the transition."
"I know this is old but the pelicans did get talent around ad but just had bad luck with injuries it wasn't Timberwolves KG  Dude had rondo, boogie, jrue holiday, eric gordon, julius randle (who had a good season there), nikola mirotic. It didn't work out for the most part because of injuries I'm tired of people saying the pelicans never tried to surround talent around him cause that's false"
"&gt; If he didn’t want to play in NOLA you can retire.   Chris Paul didn't want to play in NOLA and he didn't have to retire. Anthony Davis didn't want to play in NOLA and he didn't have to retire. Eric Gordon was just trying his hardest to get out but the Pelicans didn't want to let him. It hasn't really worked out great for the Pels when they try to hold guys there against their will. Maybe instead of forcing guys to stay when they want out the Pels should try to make the team one that people actually want to play for. After all, you don't want Zion to get fed up and want out next."
"Hey man I'll be honest, I thought Wall, Wood, Cousins, and Eric Gordon coming back would be pretty solid. Not in contention either though"
"Our FO chose not to trade Eric and PJ earlier when their value was probably a lot higher. PJ in off-season when we knew Harden already wanted to leave (so we knew PJ would not be as useful to us) and Eric before his injury this year (when he was balling and it was clear Harden was leaving or had left). The FO was twiddling their thumbs trying to make a championship team with Cousins and Wall when the rebuild and trades could have started earlier, to be honest. There's a reason why Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker didn't blame Harden at all when asked about it, they understood the ownership was being difficult and Harden had helped them get their earlier contracts as well."
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
"Ryan Anderson started 50 games, Eric Gordon started 30 games, and PJ started 34 games. Our starters were kind of a revolving door depending on the match up, current injuries and what D’Antoni was feeling at the time."
"He also was injured a lot while he was there, along with almost every other Pelican player in those years (probably because the Pels refused to hire their own training/medical staff, instead just borrowing people from the Saints). Also, Gordon did try to warn the Pelicans not to re-sign him, by signing a max offer with Phoenix and [then saying:](https://pelicandebrief.com/2012/07/03/eric-gordon-signs-offer-sheet-with-the-phoenix-suns/amp/)  &gt; “I strongly feel (the Suns) are the right franchise for me,” said Gordon. “Phoenix is just where my heart is.”  The Pelicans decided to ignore that and matched the offer for him, so you can't say they weren't warned."
"Are the Warriors going to want to go that deep into the repeater tax again next year after seeing what they got for their enormous payroll this season? I know Klay is coming back, but the Warriors seem to me to be much further away from championship contention than whatever he will give you next season, coming off two straight years out due to major injuries. Would Eric Gordon really be much of a difference maker there? Gordon is still owed $38 million over the next two seasons."
Oladipo was just as good as Eric Gordon and played better defense stop this bullshit
"No he didn’t, what the fuck are you even going on about. He averaged 30 and 7 on 60% TS, why are all your takes so awful? They were rated poorly because Ryan anderson and Eric Gordon weren’t seen as the star supporting cast players youre trying to paint them as"
Oladipo wasn’t garbage. He was as good as eric gordon while playing better defense. Completely ignored adams who was as good as capella and roberson one of the best defenders in the league. But tell me more about basketball  knowledge buddy
The players might have been better in the short term but they weren't more valuable. Value in the NBA isn't just how good you are currently but your future potential. Odom might have been a better player than Eric Gordon at that time but Eric Gordon was undoubtedly more valuable.
"I mean it wasn't good enough to let them contend or bad enough to let them tank and it didn't have any (at that time) well rated prospects so it didn't fit their needs as a rebuilding team  The Clippers trade gave them a highly rated prospect in Eric Gordon, a top ten draft pick from the last draft in Aminu and a higher draft pick (10 vs 16) + would ensure they were bad enough in the short term to get some highly rated draft picks. Neither trade was going to be good for NO in the short term but the Clippers trade had significantly more long term upside."
"&gt; That was before Dragic was even that good lol. It would have been a disaster for the hornets.   Except that Dragic did become good, so it wouldn't have been a disaster for the Hornets. What *was* a disaster for the Hornets was the trade they actually made. Instead of getting a future All NBA and All Star player in Dragic, they got Eric Gordon, who proceeded to miss 173 games with injuries over his 5 years there, along with three underwhelming years of Al-Farouq Aminu, one underwhelming year of Chris Kaman, and the draft pick that became Austin Rivers, who was also quite bad while he was there.   They traded Chris Paul, an MVP candidate, for three totally underwhelming players and the rights to draft an underwhelming player. In retrospect I don't see how anyone can argue that they were better off with that package instead of the one that contained Goran Dragic, Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola and the 16th pick in the 2012 draft."
"eric gordon could have been an all star if not for injuries and their unprotected lottery pick could have been lillard if ping pong balls worked out better. it didn't work out as well as they hoped, but the lakers trade had no chance of being good whatsoever."
"Also harden and Eric Gordon were some of the only rockets players that performed as they were expected in that 2019 series against warriors, either way 2018 we had a way stronger team and we were up 3-2, with Chris paul we might’ve ended it in 6"
"2018-2019 Rockets had 3 other guys average at least 15PPG (CP3, Capela, and Eric Gordon). All three had injuries, but each played at least 70% of the regular season."
What's the low down on Eric Gordon being the Anti-Pelican?
"His tenure with the Hornets/Pelicans was:  Year 1: 46 wins, took the 2-time defending champion Lakers to 6 in the first round; after season CP3 is traded away after a vetoed trade would have brought Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic; instead the Hornets get Eric Gordon (the most despised player in New Orleans history), Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a pick.  Year 2: Hornets finish last in the West with a roster where Marco Bellinelli and Greivis Vasquez lead the team in minutes. Gordon only plays 9 games. Hornets win the 1st overall pick and pick Anthony Davis.  Year 3: AD has an okay but not great rookie season, averaging 13.5 pts in 64 games. Minutes leaders are Vasquez and Ryan Anderson. Gordon misses half the season. Hornets finish with 27 wins. Pels trade their draft pick which ends up being Nerlins Noel for Jrue Holiday.  Year 4: They are now the Pelicans. I buy season tickets for $200/seat (seriously!). Jrue is injured after 34 games and misses the remainder of the season. AD has a break out season averaging 21 and 10, but also misses 15 games with injuries. Gordon misses 18 games. Ryan Anderson only plays 22 games. Hornets finish with 34 wins. Pelicans acquire Tyreke Evans in the offseason via trade.  Year 5: AD continues to improve to 24/10. Holiday misses half the season with an injury but the Pels still win 45 and grab the 8th seed, but are swept by the Warriors during their first championship run with Curry. Monty Williams is fired, and the Pelicans have made the playoffs only once since then."
Super teams are beatable with the right squad construction - we saw this in 2018 when the Rockets whos 3rd best player was Eric Gordon almost defeated Golden State.
You one of those Twitter clowns that thinks Jrue wasn’t an upgrade from Eric Gordon?
their nickname for Eric Gordon is literally Pi Mamba cuz his head is so fucking round. they got some elite ass nicknames compared to us
eric gordon was literally the only other dude on the team who could dribble with cp3 out lmaooo. this aint a video game dawg
This guy thinks ERIC GORDON is better than James Harden
Chris Paul was hurt. If it wasn't him it was Eric Gordon  EG is nice but he's not the guy I want taking the big shots in game 7  Also Harden had 9 and 6 assists respectively between games 6 and 7 and this doesn't count the hockey assists he had as well
Eric Gordon is better than harden guys according to OP.
Im a rockets fan dumbass I def was paying more attention to the Rockets than you were  Eric Gordon was cold but he was not the guy that the Warriors gameplanned for that series. That was Harden and CP3  This has the same energy as the morons that were calling for Cameron Payne to start over CP3 during the Clippers series
Eric Gordon created his own shots
"If you actually watched that series without being insanely biased, you would know that the majority of the shots Eric Gordon made were unassisted. He had a great series."
"Raw assist numbers are going to capture everything that happens on the court, especially not the kind of looks that Eric Gordon gets lol, terrible analysis."
"Yea Eric Gordon really had the responsibility of carrying the offense, Harden didnt set him up at all......terrible thread."
"U a clown lmao no context u do realize like 90% of his shots were forced at the end of the shot clock bc he has to bc there wasn't offence around him other than cp3 and do u also know who was guarding him he was getting guarded by klay, iggy, kd, draymond and soemtimes curry but even when curry would get switched on him that would have been with like 5 seconds on shot clock so he couldn't even run pnr and as for eric gordon good job he got spoon fed easy threes by harden and he made them now stfu bc u clearly never watched the games and just look at stats"
Yes cuz Eric Gordon was getting crazy attention drawn to him every single and that offense ran through him
Facts Eric Gordon really showed out.
"Agreed, major respect to Eric Gordon!"
Luke Kennard and a future protected FRP for Eric Gordon
"Honestly, it’s almost so bad it’s good. Kinda makes the terrible career mode at least a little entertaining  Bonus Eric Gordon version: https://youtu.be/wNGJt4C5Sss"
"My unpopular opinions for the Pelicans all involve Steven Adams. With the exception of 1.      The first is that Adams presently provides enough spacing even without outside presence by screening and making it difficult to double Zion in the paint.  Could he provide more spacing with high passing, being more competent at FTs and open jumpers? Sure. But Adams is much better than Favors and there were no spacing issues with Favors.         The second is that Hayes and Adams should absolutely be playing together in order to shift Zion to 3 and Ingram to 2 and make their defensive matchups at least somewhat easier. It would also make a nice lineup to have in your back pocket because it would be so hard to guard.        My third is that the Pelicans can’t let Zion hit RFA. If he doesn’t sign the max after next season, the Pelicans should just auction him off. None of this Qualifying Offer/Eric Gordon 2.0 Bullshit."
Please tell me how Russ was the 2017 MVP without the arbitrary triple double argument which I already proved is dumb  29/8/11 is just as impressive as 30/10/10 and this isn't even talking about the efficiency gap  Also Harden's best teammate was Eric Gordon who did nothing else but score and even then it was 16 at league average shooting
"Maybe add Harden, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, hold on to Eric Gordon, maybe bring in Melo and Dwight Howard for the bench and you'd have a pretty good team right there."
&gt; But the real question is have any of those problems directly led to them losing a playoff series? I can’t think of a single time it has.  2019.  You don't get to sit there and bark at the best player on the team while also having one of the worst seasons and playoffs of your entire career without lacking some sort of self awareness.  Dude was closer to Eric Gordon than he was to Harden.  That's not acceptable.
"Tatum, Luka, Tucker, Eric Gordon, Lowry are all a tier below"
Eric Gordon
"Because they do all the time dumb ass.   [Eric Gordon is ""mini Lebron""?? You call him that too?](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bledser01.html)   [ Rodney Stuckey is ""Young 50""](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stuckro01.html)    [Who the fuck calls Jaylen Brown ""Old Man""](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownja02.html)?  Your ignorance is cute."
"CP3, Holiday, Peja, Zion, AD, Chandler, Prime David West, Boogie, Ingram, Eric Gordon, and Baron Davis? I’m going with Pelicans in 7, maybe even in 6"
"Not a big signing, but Phoenix was pumped when we signed Ariza. Well, at least until the season started and then we realized how bad he was. But then we suckered DC into trading form him. Before that, Chandler was another one but he was well beyond his prime.    Even before that, Thomas could be seen as a big signing as well, though it was technically a sign and trade. Also, one time Eric Gordon said he preferred to play here, but it turned out we were the honey pot in contract negotiations. That was a hard pill to swallow.    If we are going way back, one time Antonio Mcdyess was going to re-sign with us, but Denver trapped him in Colorado and forced him to sign with the Nuggets again. Then we signed Tom “I-never-fucking-play” Googliata as an alternative. Oof. That was a tough one too.    So yeah, if we aren’t a small market team, we sure as shit act like one. Which makes these finals so much more sweet."
Also we looked like we were on a roll there for a second then Christian Wood and Eric Gordon both went out it was pretty much tankathon 2020 after that.
"and shoutout to his son! i just finished watching an 8min short on eric gordon dumping on jordans kids in highschool game. Even when you have every advantage and youre the son of a successful nba player... making it in the nba is ridiculously, stupidly hard."
John wall + Eric Gordon + 2 1st for Ben Simmons p
Eric Gordon
Eric Gordon
"Imagine if Simmons ends up getting traded to Houston anyways, but for Eric Gordon"
Getting a prime eric gordon level player out of the 13th pick is great
Bro Eric Gordon had already been in the league for 6 years by the time you were playing 2K13
you mean eric gordon?  I used to always draft Mayo and Eric Gordon cause they had A+ potential in 2k13. It was so easy to make them 90+ overall.
"&gt; players just be emotional  Yes, this includes CP3 and his stubbornness to damn near force players to play his way which objectively has lead to no better results than all of the stars he'd played with up to that point.  &gt;  don't need to be better at basketball than harden to criticize the dude for quitting on his team in the '17 playoffs  We are talking 2018-2019.  Whatever point you think you're making is irrelevant.  &gt; so why would he be mad cp3, one of the most brilliant basketball minds ever, is critiquing him lol  Probably because if anyone actually deserved criticism that year it was Chris Paul.  If Eric Gordon wasn't outplaying him for the vast majority of that GSW series, they likely win that series.  It's not reasonable to not show up for 5 games against Golden State and miss a quarter of the regular season and start pointing fingers elsewhere."
"The decline of the rockets were the Cp3 for Westbrook trade   We didn’t use any picks to duck the tax except a 2nd to get rid of Ennis. That’s i  You are exaggerating really hard. He could have made a big move cause he literally had Eric Gordon before he got his extension, coming off an all star level playoffs against the best team of all time and 4 picks. This was a trade that was completely able to be used as we tried for Butler, Butler failed and there was no second option   The failure of the rockets is due to the Russ trade, nothing else. The fit became poor for the team, we got rid of Clint cause of his injury and for Russ, and lost all of our picks. The window closed   You don’t need exaggerate"
"... Yall really think Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay could not win back-to-back games against CP3, a choker and .... Eric Gordon?"
"I love this consensus the NBA nephews have reached that just because it was a 3-2 series Chris Paul... James Harden(?) and.... Eric Gordon (????) would have beat KD, Steph and Klay 😂"
Eric Gordon is not a bad 3rd best player when you have 2 stars and multiple good role players.   How is this relevant lol
"This is just isn’t a fair take. And I love Ariza, I’ll wear his flair on the rockets sub till they rip it off me. He was declining after that year and there is absolutely no way that we would have done anything with Cp3 having his down year. And who knows, maybe he doesn’t bounce back the same if he doesn’t get traded. Apparently, it was a big wake up call for him and he felt cheated   Most of this is on Morey for doing nothing for the 2019 year. We lose our 3andD wings and he gets Melo, MCW, Ennis, and Bruno to replace them. Nene was basically fossilized and we never found a replacement even though having a backup option between Nene and PJ at the center was huge for us depending on the matchup   He had an entire year to trade Eric Gordon, who just had an absolutely fantastic post season and our 4 picks to get another star. Like I said Butler was one but any star would have been a major help. I remember reports about Millsap   Then Harden and Tilman start panicking about Cp3 and we lose our 4 picks and the window is gone. That’s it   We had a window of opportunity in 2019 and we did nothing with it. Tax has nothing to do with it, almost all the players possible for us to get were min players. We just picked the wrong ones."
&gt;If harden played off ball like Steph curry and Paul is playing point how do you think that plays out?  Idk because their third best player was Eric Gordon….  Seriously what the hell is wrong with you people?
Harden's TS% was awful and went 2/13 from 3pt. Eric Gordon was creating plays though and driving to the rim  because Harden has a history of playing bad in big games
Eric Gordon cause of his stupid fucking shot animation/release in 2k for the past like 5 years.
"Lol you think mba players care about “competitive pride?” Lebron teamed up with Wade and bosh and bragged about how they were gonna win 8+. KD teamed up with Steph and Klay. When your best teammates are old man Paul and Eric Gordon, I think trying to get more points from the line is an acceptable alternative."
Add yourself to the Pelicans list for leaving off Eric Gordon
"Man, I love the CP3 turned aroung the Clippers myth. That team was good and then Eric Gordon got really hurt. Then they did it again this year with the Suns when what actually happened was Ayton got hurt and other injuries caused them to underachieve."
Add a freshly drafted Eric Gordon and it’s a really good team on paper
We call it the Eric Gordon around our parts.
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
Cousins and Eric Gordon could have been great players for them but they were always injured
"He would’ve quickly become a starter the season before CP3 arrived, but yeah maybe he needed someone like Granger to learn the game. That team would’ve been: Baron Davis / Bledsoe / Mo Williams Eric Gordon / Rasual Butler (RIP) PG / Ryan Gomes Blake Griffin / Craig Smith Kaman / DJ"
"You missed Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker defending him in the media. At that point, Harden would’ve been around Cousins and Wall for about two weeks, their opinions don’t carry anything"
"Okay so you don't watch basketball because I guess guys like Steph Curry, Bernard King, Chris Mullin, Alvin Robertson, Kevin Johnson, Richard Hamilton, Vinnie Johnson, Damon Stoudemire, Eric Gordon, Jason Williams, Luol Deng, Luc Longley, Roy Tarpley, Mike Gminski, Nene and Kirk Hinrich are all scrubs right?"
Eric Gordon was a good young player (by a good margin the best asset offered in either trade) and the Lakers deal probably would have had the team in mediocrity that year instead of downright bad.   It would have been a lot tougher to get away with selling the rights to Anthony Davis along with the team if Stern had the Hornets jump to #1 from like the 14th best odds.
"The same people saying the Clippers offer was better are the same people who were saying Lamar Odom was an all-star back in 2011 lol. Eric Gordon being a fuck you to New Orleans was basically just karma for the organization, and has been a recurring theme for the past decade. Can't wait to see when Zion teams up with Luka in the future."
Yes. At the time. Eric Gordon was seen as a future all star. Maybe a Shai Gilgegous Level or Jamal Murray. Al Farooq was a young athlete and Kaman a solid vet former all star on an expiring.  The Lakers deal had Lamar who was a role player. Albeit a cool notable one. Scola. A solid role player. Kevin Martin who was maybe at best Jordan Clarkson level guy....and Dragic who was maybe thought of like Luke Kennard at the time. Eric Gordon and Al Farooq seemed like way higher potential players.
eric gordon and the picks were more valuable at the time (plus aminu who was just a top 10 pick)
"&gt; They just drafted a center last year who made All-Rookie, getting Wiseman just stunts both of their development.  You don't draft for fit. Take the best player available. Particularly the Pistons have no reason at all to cater around their current roster.   &gt; \#7 and #14 are also nowhere near enough value for Cade. I don't consider him a ""generational talent"", but he is All-NBA potential.  I think of it more probabilistic. #1 pick has an some chance of turning into a franchise changing player. A #7 pick has a slightly lower chance, and #14 lower. But I don't think it's crazy that #7 + #14 + Wiseman collectively have more odds than Cade.   Let's say conservatively Wiseman is worth #15. If you look at past drafts in the 1-and-done era, around half the time #7 + #14 + #15 is better than #1:  - **2007: Yes** (Brewer + Thornton + Stuckey &gt; Oden) - **2008: No** (DRose &gt; Eric Gordon + Anthony Randolph + RoLo) - **2009: Yes** (Steph Curry + Clark + Daye &gt; Blake Griffin) - **2010: No** (Wall &gt; Monroe + 2Pat + Larry Sanders) - **2011: Yes** (Biyombo + Marcus Morris + Kawhi &gt; Kyrie) - **2012: No** (AD &gt; Barnes + Hensen + Harkless) - **2013: Yes** (McLemore + Shabazz + Giannis &gt; Bennett) - **2014: Yes** (Randle +  TJ Warren + Adreian Payne &gt; Wiggins) - **2015: No** (KAT &gt; Mudiay + Cam Payne + Oubre) - **2016: Yes** (Jamal Murray + Denzel Valentin + Juan Hernangomez &gt; Ben Simmons) - **2017: Yes** (Lauri + Bam Adebayo + Justin Jackson &gt; Fultz) - 2018 onwards: too early to tell (eg MPJ vs Ayton)  So if you look at the 11 year span from 2007 to 2017, you have 7 times (64%) where it's better to take #7 + #14 + #15."
"&gt;How many shot creators did the Rockets have when Harden was there?   They had CP3,Eric Gordon and later Westbrook."
Eric Gordon
"Explain the eric gordon hate? I thought he was a hooper when he played for yall, you guys werent the best before AD and he was dropping 50 bombs. Was it a bad departure? Im out of the loop"
Y’all can have James Harden’s waterboy Eric Gordon Heat fans
Why is Eric Gordon most hated by NO?
fuck eric gordon
Eric Gordon is a superstar bro  18 points on uhh we don’t need to worry about the efficiency but he’s good!
Eric Gordon for Kuzma is inevitable 😤
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
"Hayward, Eric Gordon, Darius Garland, Gary Harris, Teague, Conley, George Hill are the notable current ones that come to mind"
"don't forget that Eric Gordon was viewed as one of the best high school basketball players of all time and was even given the nickname ""Air Gordon"" at one point"
"Big O, Larry Bird, Shawn Kemp  Eric Gordon, Mike Conley, George Hill, Jeff Teague are some current players from Indiana  I'm sure there's others"
"Gordon Hayward, Cody Zeller, Mike Conley.  wished greg oden would've panned out. had to google some other ones. not many ""stars"", but Romeo langford and carsen edwards are some younger players  Edit: Forgot Eric Gordon and George Hill!"
"Ik everyone forgot about them but we still have John Wall and Eric Gordon  On top of that Wood, KPJ, Tate, and the 2nd overall and idk if we're bottom 3. The only reason we were at the bottom is because of injuries and the Wolves stopped tanking"
Trading him for Eric Gordon or some draft picks would probably upset him too.
i firmly believe that oj mayo was the best high school player of all time. followed closely by eric gordon and/or dajuan wagner.
Why does he get to shoot the deep wing 3s like he’s Eric Gordon?
"It felt like a fleece because I think his value was much higher during the off-season. When we started playing and he was on our shitty teams, he looked terrible because there was nothing to play for and there was no one playmaking for him and no one for him to actually create space for. I definitely think we should have traded him and Eric Gordon (who also had good value before his injury) as soon as we knew Harden wanted out."
ok but that wasn't the intention after the trade. they tried to get john wall to play through injuries in order to win games. christian wood got hurt. eric gordon got hurt. they lucked their way into being extreme trash rather than just regular trash.  let's not do revisionist history here.
Eric Gordon doesn't deserve an acronym lol
John Wall  Eric Gordon  Kevin Love  CJ McCollum
"Partially, Suns faced a Lakers team without Anthony Davis, a Denver team without Jamal Murray and now a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard, it's almost identical to the Warriors first title run just with more star power being out. Warriors faced a Pelicans team with a hobbled Eric Gordon.... A Grizzlies team who missed Conley in the first game arguably their second best player after Gasol, fully healthy Rockets squad and then a Cavs team basically without the 2 best players after LeBron.  Overall it's about the same in improbability since those Warriors is obviously a better team than the Suns this season and the level of competition the Suns faced is skewed since the teams they faced so far didn't have their number 2 or even number 1 option in Kawhi. However without CP3 being out I guess it cancels out Kawhi being gone."
Jazz is Eric Gordon
"The rockets healthy are very easily better the Pistons. You guys are playing a bunch of raw young players   We have Wall, Wood, Tate, Eric Gordon, and numerous experienced nba guys who have expired but we may bring back like Olynk, Brown, Nwaba."
"Through trades, player development, and asset management, same way as now.  Mitchell was the 13th pick and Gobert was the 27th. These aren't high lottery picks that the Jazz got for being bad, they got them through good scouting more than anything.  As for the Pacers, without a draft we probably have players like Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, Eric Gordon, Zach Randolph, etc. not to mention historically Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp among others all grew up in Indiana. We acquired Sabonis, Oladipo, Levert and Warren through trades and Brogdon through free agency. The draft has done nothing for the Pacers since Paul George in 2010, and before that Danny Granger in 2005, and then before that you'd have to go back to Reggie Miller in 1987."
"Absolutely agree. I watched most Rockets games from ‘17 on and there was a huge focus on offense because our defenders were naturally good prior to ‘20. Glad we had PJ because he was our saving grace during small ball. There was a lack of defensive coaching through that small ball span, with games often running solely through Harden’s unstoppable shooting and foul-baiting; Eric Gordon, and Rivers were also focal points during these years. Although fun to watch, we just kept buying into the offense after 19, which is what killed the team IMHO."
"The draft actually hurts smaller market teams because it handicaps their ability to grow organically and allows bigger markets to just tank and pick up the best prospects, since smaller markets can't tank without hurting themselves financially.  Look at the Pacers, without a draft we could have had the likes of Gordon Hayward, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, etc. come up, not to mention Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp and other historical greats. Instead we have to try hard every year to be competitive and end up with Goga Bitadze, Aaron Holiday, TJ Leaf etc."
"Philly needs a player to help them contend though. The teams in full rebuild mode have very few of those guys.   Thunder have SGA, who is probably straight up better than Simmons at this point, so I can't imagine they trade him. Other than that, it's basically Kemba and his degenerative knees, a million draft picks, and a G league squad.   Rockets have washed John Wall on one of the league's worst contracts, Eric Gordon, and Christian Wood. No deal there.   Magic could do like, Gary Harris, Terrance Ross, and picks? I don't think Philly is taking Fultz back, and it doesn't make sense to move Isaac. No deal there.  Detroit could offer Grant, Cory Joseph, and picks.  Don't think they would offer a top 5 pick. Don't see a deal there, either."
"This dude knows jack shit about basketball. Just argued with him earlier, he thinks Atlanta plays small ball with Capela   Ben on the Rockets WOULD NOT work well. He only works well with Wood and Eric Gordon, literally not with any other player on the roster. And we don’t exactly have the resources to overhaul the entire roster right now  If they want John Wall, I’m down cause get me away from that contract. But unless they’re taking Wall, without us giving any of the assets we do have, I guarantee the rockets will not be trying for Ben"
We call this the Eric Gordon special
Ben Simmons + FRP for Eric Gordon who says no
"Houston looking like absolute prophets when they trade Kevin Porter Jr, Eric Gordon and a 2nd round pick for Ben and a 1st"
ERIC GORDON
"Yea they really build amazing team. Their problems mostly in coaching stuff (even tho they won the ring lol) I hope im wrong but Dallas really stuck imo. Dallas play that Harden ball but first Houston always had strong players like Tucker, Gordon and ofc Capela so when closing moments come they would just gear up and put some good defence Mavs cant do that. Our paint defence goddamn terrible and other than Maxi none of our guys can defend those strong wings (Dfs pretty good defender, better than Maxi but he just not strong enough)   Second problem other than Luka we have nobody that can make plays in starting 5. Dfs-Maxi-Thj-Kp like other than shooting these guys dont/cant do much on offence. Again when compare that with Houston team they obv had Cp3 but even other than him they had Eric Gordon with Harden. Mavs again dont have that  Anyway lets hope Reggie can save us"
Dawg Eric Gordon from Indy
"The trade machine probably isn't taking into account the more restrictive trade rules the Clippers will have when Kawhi's salary or cap hold is factored in.   However, that said, I think Wall and Gordon for Beverly, Kennard, Rondo, Ibaka, and Yogi would work within the cap, or at least gets close. I do think Rockets would do this, but I don't think Clippers would. I'd imagine they'd prefer to keep Ibaka and get House instead of Eric Gordon."
"Would the Clippers be interested in Eric Gordon? He seems like a useful player, and on a long contract"
"The trade machine says Rondo, Beverly, Kennard (or Morris) apparently is enough to match salaries for Wall *and* Gordon. I don’t get how that’s possible, but Eric Gordon would be useful for the Clippers"
Would there be some way to trade Eric Gordon and John Wall to the Clippers for short and/or cheap contracts?   John Wall + Eric Gordon   For   Rajon Rondo + Patrick Beverly + Marcus Morris (or Luke Kennard)   Surprisingly works in the trade machine. Would the Rockets want to just dump Wall’s and Gordon’s salary? I don’t know enough about how Gordon played.
"bruh, KG is from south carolina, born in south carolina, and played like 1 season of highschool basketball in chicago. Eric gordon was born in indiana and lived in indiana until a sophomore."
&gt;none of his teammates deserve blame.  Clint Capela: 3-11  Eric Gordon: 2-9  Ryan Anderson: 0-6  Lou Williams: 3-7  Sam Dekker: 2-6
the one that hit me is Eric Gordon. he was a promising young buck on the Clippers two seconds ago
He’s like Eric Gordon Jr.
Oh I know. I’m a rockets fan with no idea how to change my flair. I see why Stone drafted him. I can see his ceiling being an Eric Gordon type player if he’s able to develop properly
"Josh Christopher gives me Eric Gordon vibes, just wish he could shot as good as him"
Definitely starting.  If I'm the rockets I'm probably trying to get rid of Eric Gordon and get some assests. Idk what they're going to do with Wall though.
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
"Team of simmons, tucker, house, eric gordon and brook lopez is top 5 lotto team in both conferences"
"The Lakers offer was a bunch of decent middle aged (for NBA age) players that may have propelled hornets to a mediocre playoff team. The clippers trade had more long term upside and a young prospect in Eric Gordon who was pretty exciting at the time, its honestly a no brainer which trade was better for a rebuilding franchise"
Eric Gordon becomes what prime Eric Gordon was supposed to be
how come eric gordon becomes prime steph curry vs us
And here I thought Jamal Murray and Eric Gordon were our Joe Johnsons.
Pj throws the ball to Eric Gordon. Eric Gordon doesn’t go for ball. James harden is confused as to what’s going on. No one goes to guard curry even Eric Gordon who is the closest. But James harden bad so upvote.
"Harden was a legit threat to the KD Warriors when LeBron wasn't. Almost like the team around you matters.   But yes, Harden with Eric Gordon as his second best player couldn't beat Steph, Klay, KD and Draymond.   I only thing 18-20 Harden is really top tier though. Before that he was the same tier as Dame even though he was much more dominant in the regular season."
Did this shit with Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly in 2017 too tho  Also playing with those 2 would hurt his usage
"Imo I'd disagree that he's a bad shooter. He's really streaky and takes a lotta tough shots tho, which tanks his percentages. Similar story with guys like Eric Gordon and Marcus smart"
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Gordon and a nets pick for Simmons?
"The best offer at the deadline was lauri Markkanen who was on an expiring and not someone we would resign. So we’d be sitting here right now with exactly nothing right now.   Also, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to force someone to play here for that amount of money and basically waste half a season. Trust me we’ve tried (eric Gordon, eric Bledsoe, AD’s last year) if a guy doesn’t want to be here it’s best to move on."
"So we should force a player who doesn't want to stay to stay? Man, that could never go wrong. On a completely unrelated note, what is Eric Gordon up to?"
He averaged 30/8 with just Capela in 2018 and he was playing with another ball handler in CP3  Did 29/11 with Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly in 2017 lol
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
I honestly forgot Eric Gordon was still in the league
"Yea I mean they're the clippers...until fairly recently they were always pretty bad.   It was basically him Kaman, Eric Gordon, then Blake for half a season."
"3 or 1   Would replace Marques Johnson with Iso Joe and take 5 tho.    Some others to add   Curry family   Tim Hardaway, THJ, Anfernee Hardaway  George Hill, Grant Hill, Solomon Hill   Anthony Davis, Baron Davis, Terence Davis   Ben Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Eric Gordon"
What team is Eric Gordon on? Lol
"I wanted to see what I could get with the 2011-12 season: 7-59 Bobcats, 20-46 Wizards, 21-45 Hornets  PG = John Wall, Jarret Jack  SG = Eric Gordon, Jordan Crawford, Gerald Henderson  SF = Trevor Ariza, Al-Farouq Aminu, Corey Maggette  PF = Rashard Lewis, Boris Diaw  C = Javale McGee, Nene, Emeka Okafor  Is that team any good? No not really."
Possible S&amp;T for maybe acquiring Jingles or Eric Gordon pending if any one wants Oubre..Otherwise our payroll (Klay mainly) needs to perform to the ability of how much they’re being payed for.
the disrespect to Eric Gordon smh
Mine would be this with SF and PF being pretty interchangeable. This is just off the top of my head without looking at rosters.  PG: SGA SG: Eric Gordon SF: Johnathan Isaac PF: Jerami Grant C: Christian Wood
Eric Gordon had a 60 TS% on 12 field goal attempts per game.  Westbrook had 48TS % on 18 shots per game.  Granted the Lakers were leaving Westbrook wide open for 3 and again Westbrook was injured.  Gordon by the way averaged 16.2 ppg and Westbrook averaged 19.8 ppg against the Lakers.
"Let's break this down:  Russ went 7-17 for 16 points and 14 assists in a 7 point loss in game 1.  In game 2 Russ went 2-10 for 10 points and 11 assists in a 25 point loss. Russ only shot twice in the second half after starting 2-8 in the first half and it didn't help.  In game 3 9-18 for 26 points, 10 assists and was 3-6 from three. The Wizards lost by 29. Russ went 2-4 in the third and 1-2 in the 4th for 12 points in the second half. The Wizards were outscored by 15 in the second half. In the first half Russ was 6-12 for 14 points and they were outscored by 14. Russ stopped shooting even while having a good game because they were down in the first half.  In game 4 Russ went 3-19 for 19 points with 13-16 FTs, 21 rebounds, and 14 assists. In the first half Russ went 1-10 for 6 points. In the third he went 2-4 for 8 points and in the 4th he went 0-5 for 5 points. In the third Wizards outscored Philly 32-19. In the other 3 quarters the Wizards were outscored 95-90. They won this game with Russ going off for a quarter. In every other game when Russ stopped shooting after starting poorly it didn't translate to the rest of the team doing better because outside of Beal and sometimes Riu they had no help.  In game 5 Russ went 7-20 for 24 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds in a 17 point loss. Russ went 0-4 in the 4th with most of his shots coming in the 4th. It was a 12 point game and Russ was trying to get them back into it(and failed). He missed two threes, a midrange shot, and a dunk. He had gone 7/16 in the first 3 quarters and 2/3 from three with most of the team outside of Beal and Rui not doing much.   What is the point of this post? It isn't Russ. Russ isn't going to be a difference maker in 2021, but he's not the problem even if it looks like he's the problem. Why? Because the surrounding offensive talent is garbage that can't create for themselves and can't shoot. That is Westbrook's career post 2012 after the Harden trade. On the Thunder it was Russ/KD and no one else could do shit for themselves offensively. Then it was briefly Russ and a poor version of Oladipo then Russ/PG13. On the Rockets it was Russ/Harden then no one that can create for themselves outside of Eric Gordon sometimes. On the Wizards it was Russ/Beal and then half of the team got injured.  After Russ/Beal it was Rui and then a steep drop-off to Gafford/Bertans/Neto/Ish, all of which couldn't score as well. If you give Russ a team where no one can score he will try to fill the gap. If you give Russ a team that can score he will try to distribute and not try to fill a gap that doesn't exist."
Lonzo isn't AD and that would be more likely to be an Eric Gordon situation
"I thought the general perception was that we didn’t have up to two years with Zion. I love Lonzo, but he apparently didn’t want to stay, and the FO doesn’t want another Eric Gordon situation."
"&gt;	Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, and matching Eric Gordon  Ding Ding, we still have PTSD over these contracts. Overpaying fucked us with AD now we getting bitched at for not overpaying the internet current hype machine.  Also, as fan, what in the fuck are we supposed to do about Griff? Like we’re an easy going city and it’s literally just his second year… Do we put his head on a pike for the third?"
"Everyone is saying we should have forced Lonzo to stay when he wanted out, people forget we did that with Eric Gordon and how did that turn out?"
"No one is saying you guys didn’t get better, just switching your coach and replacing adams and Bledsoe with JV gets you a playoff spot in my eyes. It’s just acting like Turning Lonzo and a first which makes you unable of  using your other first therefore affecting trading abilities to get fucking graham who’s a back up pg on a none eastern conference team is such a head scratcher. It makes no sense to be scared of that Lonzo contract, his skill set makes him super tradeable if it all falls apart. Good defense, good playmaking, good three point shooting, good size, it’s a skill set that every single team in the league would want and he’s young and always works hard and gets better, comparing to Eric Gordon is so disingenuous."
"I'm not in love with the off-season moves, but its hard for me to be mad about not giving Zo $85/4. I legit think it's a overpay and after the AD years of giving massive deals to Solomon Hill, Omer Asik, and matching Eric Gordon even though he wanted out, I'm happy to not lock ourselves to Zo.🤷‍♂️  We do look absolutely foolish trying to gun for Lowry and he's off the board the moment FA starts.   I'm still fairly optimistic about this team. I think Zion and BI are both really really good. JV is a huge improvement over Adams and Favors before him. Graham I honestly don't know too much about, I don't watch Charlotte so I'm not going to comment too much. But if he's even a touch better than Zo in the half court, at the price we got him I really like it. I'm sure he isn't the defender Zo is, but Zo is really streaky on that end, the effort isn't always there like it was with a guy like Jrue. NAW is really key here, I think hes going to have a big year and put his name on the map.  Not to mention Hayes. Which, is kinda a whole can of worms atm. But he played really well the second half of the year last year, hopefully he can continue to improve on it.  Feel like we're getting bent over a barrel a little more than necessary. Still think we can be pretty good with this roster as constructed and still continue to have a high ceiling and grow moving forward. I could be wrong, I just watch the games on TV, but I'm not selling my Pels stock just yet."
why Eric Gordon?
Eric Gordon
"Yes it was, it fucked them long term and would've done so without any Eric injury.  The trade we gave them, allowed them to be shit quicker for longer, but made it easier to pull themselves out of the mud. They struggled hard to do anything with the Asik/Gordon contracts bogging everything down.  It took 6 years after the LAC trade to finally get themselves out of the mud, the Gordon contract stuck them in and it wasn't too late. But they couldn't keep that 2018 momentum going."
"People forget that Eric Gordon was actually a real potential piece, he just didn't want to be in NO at all."
"Arguable...LAC gave up Eric Gordon (a 3rd year stud),Minny 1st, Aminu and Kaman which was significantly better value for a rebuild than Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola and Dragic. That's a shit trade package"
"&gt; Pelinka would be jobless if he had to rebuild a team like Minnesota  A successful GM that is a lawyer / former agent who was representing players like Harden, KD,  Kobe, Iggy, Boozer, Kman, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield, Drummond, Ariza, etc., and successfully negotiated their contracts. Someone who is very knowledgeable about the CBA would be... jobless if he were the GM rebuilding in Minnesota.    LOL  I doubt that given his track record at everything he's been doing since playing for Michigan."
Eric Gordon is so underrated man.
Same except it was Eric Gordon
Yeah but when you being back people against their choice it often ends up badly. I.e. Eric Gordon
"At least Demps had a good plan with Jrue, Eric Gordon, Tyreke, Ryan Anderson and AD. They just all got injuries that in most cases hampered their careers and those 5 barely got to play together because at least one of em was always hurt. Griff’s plans are just flat out mediocre to begin with. Everybody and they momma could see that Adams and Bledsoe wasn’t the answers as soon as we acquired them. And if you look at the roster he’s built so far this year it doesn’t make much sense either"
"He signed with chicago 5 seconds into free agency. he didnt want to be here.  we didnt need another eric gordon situation.  yall shit on us for ""betraying"" JJ, but shit on us for letting Lonzo do what he wants."
Would be like Eric Gordon all over again
We did that with Eric Gordon and that didn't turn out well.
Should have gotten Eric Gordon 🤮
See Eric Gordon contracts for a reference
"Eh the Rockets didn’t really get that many big FAs. Washed Dwight Howard, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, PJ Tucker were the notable ones"
Look how it turned out with Eric Gordon. It's not something Pels fans want to do again.
did it to Eric Gordon. Jazz did it to Hayward. Happens all the time. From how extension talks were before the season started Nola didn't want to keep him anyway
"I mean, do you understand how RFA works?  We already had a terrible 4 years with Eric Gordon where he was total shit the whole time because he was mad we matched his deal from Phoenix  We're actually doing right by Lonzo."
"we dont want another eric gordon situation where we're stuck with someone who's ""injured"" for 4 years."
Yeah like Eric Gordon lol
"SA got LaMarcus Aldridge. Houston got Dwight Howard and Eric Gordon. Not exactly star-studded there, but Texas has nice cheap land and no state income tax."
Can I offer you a John Wall or Eric Gordon?
"Did it really end up being a worse trade though?  New Orleans would have gotten Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Goron Dragic, Luis Scola and the number 16 pick in the 2012 draft (turned into Royce White).  Martin and Scola were both good players, but Martin was 29 and Scola was over 30.  Not exactly good building blocks to start a rebuild after losing your superstar.  Odom seems like he was the center piece but he ended up falling apart after being traded from LA, so New Orleans dodged a bullet there.  Gragic would have been the best thing they got out of the trade.   Instead from the Clippers New Orleans got Chris Kaman (not a great center piece but better than Odom), Al Farouq Aminu (very young at the time, good prospect having been the 8th overall pick), Eric Gordon (young talented guard), and a Minnesota 2012 first round pick which ended up being number 10 (turned into Austin Rivers).   I would definitely rather have the clippers package if I was New Orleans, even with the hindsight of knowing that Dragic ended up being the best player in either package."
I loved how Eric Gordon went from confused to absolutely losing it in a split second
"The best part is the slow, but dramatic, realization of what was happening by Eric Gordon."
Only if you throw in Eric Gordon
It’s more about Lonzo I think. Don’t wanna another Eric Gordon in the lockerroom.
Prolly Eric Gordon and Christian Wood
"Tobias Harris for Everyone not named John Wall or Eric Gordon, 4 First Round picks and 4 pick swaps  —- Daryl Morey"
Eric Gordon?
Eric Gordon?
Morey always gets shit done somehow and it may not look good until the middle of the season. The Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson F/A looked really bad at the time. But during that first season it really turned around peoples thoughts.
Rockets think Eric Gordon is better than Tobias right
"I'm guessing Eric Gordon maybe but because of that fucktrad, yeah who is Gordon again?"
Eric Gordon
eric gordon had an above average ts% this season despite shooting 43/32/82
"I hate teams that insist on shooting threes without three points shooter. This years rockets were a prime example. I swear only Eric Gordon can hit threes. Yet they keep chucking them.   If you have the shooters, then shoot. If you don’t, maybe shooting 40 threes a game isn’t the strategy."
who would you want from rockets? Eric Gordon please please please haha
Eric Gordon doesn’t deserve this lol  He’s actually a good player  Wall tho…
John wall and Eric Gordon 👀
"And whenever any of these 3&amp;D guys get a normal contract and not a minimum everyone considers them bad money and untradable. Like yeah sorry you can't have Eric Gordon or Danny Green at 1,5 Million lol"
"Russ was injured in the bubble leaving Harden to carry them with no help outside of desperate 3pt shooting....Eric Gordon played awful.   But if you watched down the stretch during the regular season, things were starting to click bigtime with Russ attacking the basket, Harden doing his thing when need be, and surrounding them with 3 point shooting and going small ball. Even if healthy it probably never would have worked , but that Rockets team beat a ton of great teams that year before Covid took over."
"How were they ass? Westbrook shot 20% from three. Dude fucking sucks. Our team numbers don’t look great because eric gordon was launching 7 a game at a bad clip. Our team wasn’t “trash”, we had 2 high level 3 and D switchable defenders in tucker and covington, literally the best offensive player in the league demanding double teams OFF WESTBROOK every play, Jeff green who was playing really well, Eric Gordon, austin rivers, keep arguing that our team was somehow trash and Westbrook is absolved of all blame as if we weren’t up 1-0 on you with the lead in game 2 until Westbrook checked into the game and literally threw it away.  Your fan base was celebrating when he checked in. I was in the game thread. The same guy you just traded for, your fan base *celebrated him checking in for the other team* while on the verge of going down 2-0. That's fucking hilarious"
"&gt; He'll miss a game here and there, but people acting like he's constantly out half the season are just wrong. Most of his absences happened early on when New Orleans was still using the Saints football staff to take care of their basketball team, and it wasn't just him who was out a lot, it was everyone (Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Tyreke Evans, Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, etc).  &gt; I know you guys all have your hopes pinned to LeBron and AD suffering season or career ending injuries on opening night (great look for you, btw 😬😬), but it's not like that's a lock to happen. Sorry.  Nope, he only referred to New Orleans..? Nothing about a shortened season."
"* 2016-17 - He missed 7 games all year  * 2017-18 - He missed 7 games all year  * 2018-19 - He missed 5 games before his trade demand, then the Pels sat him out a ton to protect his trade value  * 2019-20 - He missed 9 games all year  He'll miss a game here and there, but people acting like he's constantly out half the season are just wrong. Most of his absences happened early on when New Orleans was still using the Saints football staff to take care of their basketball team, and it wasn't just him who was out a lot, it was everyone (Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Tyreke Evans, Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, etc).   I know you guys all have your hopes pinned to LeBron and AD suffering season or career ending injuries on opening night (great look for you, btw 😬😬), but it's not like that's a lock to happen. Sorry."
I’d say that’s more the case with dudes who shoot a low to mediocre percentage but are willing to let it fly. Guys like Eric Gordon or Jae Crowder don’t always shoot the best percentages but shoot at high volumes and are always guarded. Westbrook is literally left open because he’s such a terrible shooter.
You mean Eric Gordon?
like you’re better off trading for eric gordon
No trades and we take Corey Kispert at #13.  Or whatever the fuck that Eric Gordon trade proposal is.
"&gt;That's an objectively false statement. Mayonnaise is objectively not a fruit.  Looks like the pedant is back at it again with the inability to infer anything whatsoever. Forget the mayonnaise analogy and try this one instead. ""In my opinion, Bananas are the best fruit because they have the most the most vitamin C."" This would initially be a subjective statement backed with objectively false reasoning. It would be the equivalent of someone saying ""In my opinion, Giannis is better than KD because he averaged more points in his recent series vs KD."" Furthermore, anyone trying to argue something subjective can strengthen their statement by backing it with objective reasoning. Such as ""I think Michael Jordan is a better basketball player than Eric Gordon based on his accolades and statistics."" Would it still be subjective in nature since it's based on an opinion? Yes. Does this make it unarguable? No. Stop thinking in absolutes you braindead donkey. You are being pedantic to the point where you are taking the literal definition of ""proof"" and missing the entire point of debate. Hence me saying you are oversimplifying things when you paint this as purely subjective.  Your entire disconnect seems to revolve around my initial statement of ""KD is a better player than Giannis and you can't prove to me otherwise."" Which instead of seeing this as me saying ""Let's use objective reasoning to back up our subjective takes"" and an opportunity for a normal player vs player discussion on Reddit you decided to do mental gymnastics and be pedantic to the point of arguing that it's impossible to ""prove"" anything subjective and scouring through my comment history for ""gotcha"" points. All you did, in the end, was make yourself look cringey and desperate.   &gt;You literally just insisted your argument was objective and mine was subjective, which is nonsensical.   Perhaps my choice of words confused you. The Ron Artest scenario was me trying to give you an example of using objectivity to argue someone else's subjective claim. ""Ron Artest is better than Michael Jordan"" is subjective and ""Michael Jordan has more rings and better stats than Ron Artest"" is objective. *Your* statement would remain subjective while *my* statement would remain objective, not the entire nature of the fucking argument you autist."
Weaver doesn't want Eric Gordon.
Good shout. Maybe Eric Gordon too type of player with long contract
I'm all for NBA Chaos. It makes for the best offseason. I'm just scared that means the Pacers somehow trade our lottery pick for Eric Gordon
The rockeys will help. How would you like an eric Gordon and Danuel house for some picks
"Next time you hear that, tell them nephews that Eric Gordon dropped a 50 piece nuggies on the Jazz too"
Old Eric Gordon dropped 50 on dem boys
Eric Gordon
"Though he didn’t run us into the ground, Morey didn’t not do everything so well   Starting with the Ryan Anderson contract, absolute albatross, and fucked us pretty hard once we were out of money and tradeable players  Extending Eric Gordon for 4 more years was ridiculous.   Replacing our 3&amp;d wings of Ariza and Luc with Bruno, MCW, Ennis, Melo who are literally not even the same type of players which we needed badly.   Not getting a backup Center as Nene turned into stone   Routinely having the worst 3rd stringers in the league, which made our garbage time lineups give up huge leads all the time, forcing our starters to come back into games where almost no other teams would’ve had to do the same   Rarely ever utilizing the g league or finding young filler talent. House was the only guy that could play  Trading Capela to bring RoCo, which was fine as Capela was injured but didn’t get even a backup level big   Holding out on Jimmy Butler for EG and 4 picks even though Thibs declined numerous times as he wanted players not picks. Instead of potentially using this package to get another player"
Eric gordon
Eric Gordon is trash
"No one has an answer to Brooklyn's firepower. The only thing that would've made the Lakers on the Nets level was if they got Kawhi, which they didn't. If Lakers didn't get Lillard/Curry/Kawhi, the Nets were always going to win. This post is stupid.   &gt;Traded for scorers like Eric Gordon and maybe Lou Will  ?  &gt;Traded for Oladipo  LOL"
"Higher scoring guards like Eric Gordon, Lowry, Lou, Derozan. The defense LA already had would make up for def liabilities but their offense would be tremendous with a real shooter"
Yeah a baby harden in his first series. He had to join a 73-9 team to barely beat harden and eric gordon
"You think its bad now? We're having a sort of SG revival right now. A decade ago the position was horrible. It was Kobe and Wade and then mostly trash. Look at BRs old top SGs list from 2011  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/495844-nba-power-rankings-top-25-shooting-guards-for-2010-11   Jason Richardson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Martin, OJ Mayo and Eric Gordon made up half of the top 10. Those guys made a combined 0 career All Star appearances..."
"This. Eric Gordon was the only good part of the Clippers trade and he already had knee issues.   The Lakers trade would have given them 3 starters and a future All Star/All NBA quality player in Dragic.   Then again they wouldn't have been so trash that they end up with AD, who eventually ends up with the Lakers.   Life is funny that way"
Eric Gordon …..
"Shared elevator with Tony Snell..he seemed amused that we were high AF, he’s friendly/shy  Saw Shawn Marion outside a club.. just a cool dude with no ego and really appreciated when I told him I look forward to when he makes the HOF  I “saluted” Nate McMillan from across the street…he saluted back so that was cool (I was 14)  Daryl Dawkins, Kevin McHale, Jason Terry were really cool/acknowledging of fans..Eric Gordon too but he was really shy.   Dwight seemed to enjoy joking around with little kids and making them laugh  My friend saw Draymond at their apartment gym, said that he was really cool."
"I picked the first player that popped into my mind without thinking twice, obviously I don't think Reggie Jackson is the greatest Piston of all time:  Mavs - Dirk   Nuggets - Jokic    Warriors - Curry    Rockets - Harden   Clippers - CP3    Lakers - Kobe    Grizzlies - Conley   Timberwolves - KAT   Pelicans - AD    Thunder - Westbrook    Suns - Nash   Trailblazers - Lillard    Kings - Bibby    Spurs - Kawhi   Jazz - Mitchell    Hawks - Young    Celtics - Tatum    Nets - KD   Hornets - Walker    Bulls - MJ    Cavs - LeBron    Pistons - Reggie Jackson    Pacers - PG    Heat - Wade    Bucks - Giannis    Knicks - Melo    Magic - Eric Gordon   Sixers - Embiid   Raptors - DeMar    Wizards - Wall"
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Westbrook (if you count him wanting to get traded here), Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, PJ tucker   Plenty of good NBA players choose to play here and enjoy the city. Tucker had his bucks championship party in Houston."
"Everyone knew CP3 was being traded.    But instead of getting all-star Pau Gasol and 6MOY Lamar Odom from the Lakers, the Pelicans traded away CP3 to the Clippers for that amazing bounty of players of:  Al-Farouq Aminu   Eric Gordon   Chris Kaman   and a '12 1st round draft pick (Austin Rivers).  Yeah, I could see how the Pelicans were so much more attractive..."
"It would have been a 3 team trade between Houston, Lakers and New Orleans:  **Los Angeles Lakers: ** PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  **New Orleans Hornets:** F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  **Houston Rockets:** PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)   The trade with Clippers that was accepted:  **Los Angeles Clippers:** Chris Paul  **New Orleans Hornets:** Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and the Timberwolves’ unprotected pick in 2012 (ended up being 10th, Austin Rivers)  I’m not sure that was a better package. I kinda believe the story that other teams whined about Lakers getting their man again, and that is why Stern blocked it."
Eric Gordon was a monster in highschool
Updated list for u/Forke   Eleven. Donavan Mitchell Twevle. Dwight Howard Thrirteen. Eric Gordon Foreteen Alex Caruso  Fiddyten. Jj Reddick
Marcus was a legit D1 player Jeff was the one who had no business being recruited. I remember watching Eric Gordon thrash them on espn in high school.
"Jalen Green is the best player in the draft and will be seen as a Luka/Trae level talent.  Eric Gordon is gonna stay healthy this year (please), and whichever contender adds him will get a good edge on the competition. Healthy EG is a positive asset."
"I don’t necessarily think so. Russ had the same effect on Adams if not better, than Harden did on Capela.  Houston also had Eric Gordon who was at the time a 20 ppg if he didn’t play alongside Harden.   Houston’s team wasn’t necessarily insanely better but if harden missed games they were better equipped than if OKC were should Russ have missed games."
"…… okay.   Plenty of players do embarrassing shit. MJ had a gambling addiction. Dwight Howard had that press conference with Stan Van Gundy. Gordon Hayward had that weird Player’s Tribune article come out after his Celtics signing already leaked. Kevin Durant’s twitter burners. Paul George (just him. All of him).  And yet, AD got exactly what he wanted. The Lakers obviously got exactly what they wanted. And the Pelicans got an amazing package which would look better if not for random Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams trades.   So… I think your point that it was a mess is just asinine."
"You act like everything else they could've tried would've gone in GSW's way lmao   Totally ignored one of the easiest changes they could've done which is to utilize Capela a lot more since Looney was the biggest guy Warriors had out there. The guy I said that made 90% of his shots that game. If they had to force Warriors to play Looney a lot more then the defense on Harden and other wings would've gone down or if they decided to stay small ball they could've made Capela score a lot more.  You talk as if Warriors had 8 DPOYs and Rockets only had 2 competent players with one of them injured.   &gt;Harden switches into Steph, dribbles past him in the paint, Dray helps off PJ, Harden passes it to the open PJ, what you expect PJ to do here? take the open three? or try to somehow drive and get blocked/turn the ball over (because he's just a spot up shooter after all)? same for Ariza.  What did you think happen when they missed those 27 3s in that stretch? Did the referees just give them free points to keep them in the game? They shot 29/46 on 2FGAs. They were more than capable of getting to the rim or to the line.   &gt;you aren't gonna beat GSW with Eric Gordon taking contested midranges off the dribble against good defenders like KD, Iggy, Klay, Dray...  and you think EG taking more 3s in an off night was the solution like exactly what happened? lol   &gt;not to mention starting 0/15 doesn't mean you'll stay the same, often a team starts cold and go hot or vice versa.  yeah they fucking went 0/27 instead of just 0/15. If they took those 12 possessions and attempted midranges, lobs, layups, played through contact or anything else they could've won.   Total reliance on the law of averages saving your ass from a bad shooting night is dumb. Everything you just tried to say was to circle it back to ""ROCKETS NEEDED TO RELY ON THE 3 THEY WON'T ALWAYS MISS"" it's already what they did and why they now have one of the worst chokes in a single playoff game in NBA history"
"jrue, cousins, rondo, tyreke evans (in good form at the time), mirotic, etwaun moore (also played decently in NO), casspi, eric gordon, randle"
the hobbit (eric gordon)
"Pels  PG: CP3, Lonzo  SG: Jrue, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield  SF: Trevor Ariza,  Solo Hill....  PF: Anthony Davis, Aminu  C: Demarcus Cousins, Christian Wood  &amp;#x200B;  So probably Thunder."
"The fact that luol deng and boozer were his main helpers on the offense says a lot tbh..(i love them both(actually i dont like boozer)  but boozer was past his prime and deng was more known for his defense than offense) Harden had CP3 and eric gordon to help him, elite playmaker and above average scorer.. also east was not that much worse than west neither that year nor in 2018"
CP was pretty good in the games he played but yeah that’s still damn impressive  I think that was also prolly the last good Eric Gordon year
"I mean, Harden lead a team with either Eric Gordon or Trevor Ariza, however you'd like to slice it, to the 3rd seed in a ridiculous Western Conference. I think people overestimate how much better Houston was compared to OKC. Houston still had the better roster, but OKC was also just geared more towards defensive basketball than Houston."
Defenses just can’t extend that far.   Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson were the first two guys I saw constantly spotting up 3-5 ft beyond the 3 pt line. It looked crazy but those essentially open 3s for NBA players
"PJ Tucker was an absolute stud for the Bucks championship run. In Houston he was younger and more mobile.  Clint Capella is one of the best defensive rim running centres in the league, and single-handedly transformed the Hawks defense.   Chris Paul is an ATG Point Guard.  Eric Gordon was a sixth man candidate   And then they had  whole lotta 3D wings."
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
"It is different mentality with soccer, cause soccer fans are not crazy about the best player(they are but laid back fans are not), i.e. my favorite players are Raul Gonzalez and Ronaldinho and I don't care if they are not the best, they don't have to be the best, they are my favs and that's it.   In NBA people who are not fans of the teams cant have the same thing cause this reddit and social media would make you think if Lebron is not absolute best currently he is shit not worth and so on, people think it is something to be ashamed if you like lower tier guys like Demar Derozan, Eric Gordon and rotation bench players we meme like they are joke of a players like Bayness, Boban, Cancar or idk Javale..."
&gt;Its hard to compare assist opportunities when one guy is on a super team surrounded by stars and shooters and the other guy's second best player was MPJ.  Are we really gonna act like Harden wasn't on the Rockets without a superteam for like 9 years where he already showed that he was a great playmaker? He even has an assist title from when his second best player was Eric Gordon lol
Not trusting Harden against Lebron  I’m trusting CP3-Harden-Ariza-Tucker-Capela and Eric Gordon against Lebron
"&gt; Harden taking KD warriors to 7 with Eric Gordon as his number 2  CP3 was feasting that season. Gordon was playing outta his mind. Capela was in the MVP race (lol) that season.    Harden definitely didn't choke, he just got beaten by an OP team"
James harden and Eric Gordon were suppose to beat 2 MVPs and 2 allstars. You’re a different breed   https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU
I'd like to see any other player play well against that team with Eric Gordon as the 2nd best playmaker on the team.
Yeah Harden choked because he didn’t beat the KD warriors with Eric Gordon as his second best player lmao. You are a special type. Eric Gordon would barely be the sixth best player on the warriors.  And what excuse Harden and his usual band of shitty player took 2 games of a 60 win team? You are saying he choked on that? You think Curry choked against the Lakers this season?
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
"It’s just this, luka, and an eric gordon shot iirc"
Yeah Curry made the finals in the row 5 years in a row. Those other 3 hall of famers and the all star on his team didn’t matter at all. That’s why Curry has 3 fmvp right? Because he took those teams to the finals all on his own lol.  And saying Harden taking KD warriors to 7 with Eric Gordon as his number 2 is choking must some sort of calling sign of the casuals.
couldn't even beat the greatest team of all time with eric gordon as his second option
PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon were bums? I don't think so
"It's not 2K though. You can't just put 5 teenagers out there because none of them will actually get any positives out of that. They'll all simply create more bad habits. You need somebody out there who can at least do a couple things right, even if it won't translate to points. It's better for KPJ to run P&amp;Rs with Theiss than run P&amp;Rs with Alperen. It's better for Green to get involved in plays with Eric Gordon rather than get involved in plays with KPJ."

Eric Gordon needs to ask to be bought out and join the Warriors ala PJ Tucker last yr with the Bucks
"That's a proper team right there! Not like that disgraceful, black eye on the league OKC Thunder 😤 can't be havin teams sitting vets to retain trade value and give minutes to young guys like they did eith Horford 😡😡   We need teams DNP'ing healthy former all-stars so they can give minutes to guys like Eric Gordon and DJ Augustin!"
"Sure! Eric Gordon for DeAndre Jordan and a lottery ticket, who says no?"
Eric Gordon is more of a buyout candidate. No one's trading for him.
Westbrook for Eric Gordon and remaining of Harden's beard? deal
"Lakers can get a good guy for him. He has real potential      Speaking of which Eric Gordon is available..."
If he is ever as good as Eric Gordon we’re cooking
"Yeah I was really optimistic after seeing him start the game well. No KPJ today so Jalen gets to run the offense! Haha nah, let's give Eric Gordon every possession in the 2nd quarter"
"I made a longer comment elsewhere but Stars really haven’t been doing it regularly, even Kobe. Curry was only taking 1.11 a game in 2013 and now guys like Eric Gordon were taking 4.89 a game in 2020 lol   In 2013 the top player averaged 1.44 deep 3s per game and by the time you got to the 5th player it was down to .98 deep 3s per game. In 2020 the top player averaged 6.33 deep 3s per game and the 5th was at 3.95 deep 3s per game.   In 2013, 3 players averaged more than 1 a game, in 2020 **44** players averaged more than one a game."
&gt; Eric Gordon is a player that every competing team should be inquiring about  Lmao. OP thinks anyone shits on anyone for saying this? He’s probably just parroting what he’s heard guys like Zach Lowe say. I’ve heard multiple national media guys say this about EG.
https://youtu.be/m68DRZTZcpg  Here’s harden against peak GSW KD warriors with Eric Gordon and capella lol  It’s the regular season
"No he wasn’t.  First option means the guy you look to first to score. In every season except  one that he played with the Clippers, Griffin shot the ball more than anyone else per game. That one season where they didn’t look to him as the main scoring option was his rookie season where he had the second most shots behind Eric Gordon by .1 a game.   Paul never was given as many  opportunities to score as Griffin in any season they played together. Blake was always the number 1 option."
"In Houston’s defense, Houston has tank commander Eric “cartoon face” Gordon.    I wonder what he thinks playing with all these young gunners.  Definitely getting traded for an expiring contract or two, maybe draft picks if they’re lucky."
Its more that he wouldn't be as effective with us given Chicago is set up perfectly for him  We got some good guys on the team cheaper (like JV and Graham) and if we had Lonzo our team would have even less depth than it already does. He's a solid to pretty good player but I don't think he'd be worth the 20 million to us like he is to Chicago (especially given he didn't even want to play in NOLA so it had the potential of being an Eric Gordon situation all over again)   Our biggest mistake in hindsight was definitely not trading him when he actually had good trade value but thats in the past now
Im more perplexed that Fish was still sinking game winners in 2012 against Eric Gordon DJ Clipper teams. I feel like he is two eras earlier than them.
"I agree with him and I'll try explaining it how I think of it. Anthony Davis is a top 5 talent in the league, maybe provides top 5 value in the league when he's on the court, but he isn't a top 5 player in the league. It's somewhat hard to distinguish those from each other.  When he's on the court his numbers don't ever not look good. He has an unbelievable midrange game, he can run the floor, catch lobs from anywhere, and then on defense clamp any 4 in the game, play great defense on most 5s not named Jokic or Embiid, and play elite help defense.   But there is something that is critically lacking in his game and it's hard to pinpoint. It's too cliché to say killer instinct, or heart, or silly sports platitudes like that. But AD is very evidently a player who can just will you to wins night in and night out. At times it seems like he doesn't even want to do that.   It's not normal for a player who is putting up 28/12/2/1.5/2 on 50% from the floor to miss the playoffs. It isn't normal for someone to put up those numbers and only get to 34 wins in a season, and especially because AD is clearly not a ""great stats, bad team"" guy. He's not an empty stats guy which is very much what KAT feels like right now. He can get those stats on a championship level team all the same, and give you valuable possessions on both sides.  A team with Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, sniper years Ryan Anderson, some ok but not very good guard/wing back ups like Toney Douglas, Tyreke Evans, Tim Frazier, James Ennis, and then some solid back up bigs in Ajinca and Asik shouldn't be 12-26 at the All-Sat break if you're the best player at your position in the league.   James Harden as a 23 year old pulled a starting 5 of him, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, and Dontas Montejunas to 45 wins and took OKC to 6 games; and that was with Kevin McHale as coach. Then half that damn Pels team ended up going to Houston eventually too.  KG's running mates were Terrell Brandon, Wally World, Anthony Peeler, and Rasho Neserovic and he pulled into the playoffs in an even more competitive West.  Hakeem didn't have a single All-Star with him as he kept making it to the playoffs each year in the West.   Dirk the same thing, he took a team to the finals and lost in 6 (refs willing) that was starting Jason Terry, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, and Erick Dampier.  Jokic won a playoff series last year against a high-powered Portland team with his top 4 guards out, one other guy who could score but not defend, and then a mix between 5'9"" rookies, just signed players, two way guys, and the reanimated corpse of Paul Milsap. This year without MPJ and Murray, and now Barton, Jokic is leading the Nuggets while putting up even better numbers and a top 10 defense...and they will sail into the playoffs.   But with Jrue Holiday and a bunch of 3pt marksman, Anthony Davis had years where he didn't even sniff the playoffs.   That just isn't normal. If you put any of these other guys on that team they're going to find a way into the playoffs, even if it's the 8 seed, even if they get swept. They're certainly going to win more than 30 games.   I think it speaks to Anthony Davis at his core is just a right hand man type of player. He may very well be the best ""2nd option"" of all time. He's this generation's Scottie Pippen who people sometimes even have as a top 5 player in the 90s. But AD just doesn't have that drive in him, or the specific skill, or desire, or whatever it is, to pull teams to wins. Pull them into the playoffs. Just find ways to get it done and get there. He isn't that guy...even though he obviously has all the talent in the world to do that, and has always put up numbers that SHOULD do that.   I mean damn even Carmelo took a team with a guard rotation of Pablo Prigioni, Ronnie Brewer, Raymond Felton, and a 39 year old Jason Kidd, 7ppg Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, the decayed husk of Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak, and Tyson Chandler to round 2 of the playoffs. And Carmelo is not a better player than AD, whatsoever, in any way. But he is the kind of guy who is a bonified #1 option, who has the drive and will to just find wins and go for broke trying to get them in a way AD doesn't.  AD kind of always seems like he's holding back a little bit. The other night vs. I forget who, but AD was red hot the entire game and WB was...not, and to take the game winning shot what happened? They ran 1-4 flat with Westbrook who took a contested 30ft 3 and bricked it. AD was standing in the corner just watching it.   Now you could say that has something to do with coaching, and maybe it does, but not even Vogel is that bad. It's not like this was some misdirection play or a match up thing either. Also if you're that guy, if you're an All-NBA 1st team player, if you're this HOF two way incredible 30ppg dude...you should be demanding that shot. Especially when you are just draining jumpers all night. But he didn't, and that isn't the first time he's seemed to shy away from pivotal moments like that.   So in that sense AD is a ""very good"" player, but not a great player. He's an absolute incredible talent, incredible scorer, incredible defender, easy choice for the HOF. but as a ""player"" there is something that is critically missing from him. Something that you can find in almost all of his All-NBA 1st team peers from LeBron, to Jokic, to Embiid, CP, Dame, Curry, Doncic, Harden, KD, Butler, Trae, Morant, Mitchell there are so many of these guys who have that extra part of them. Even guys who haven't been All-Stars like Jamal Murray, Fox, Ant, Bogdanavich(s), grab hold of that moment more willingly and firmly than AD.  I mean good lord it's in Russ--that's half the reason he's so good at basketball--but AD should be the person taking that situation every single time. Not just over Russ but maybe over LeBron most of the time too. That's how good he is. Not just a single shot but just down the stretch in general.   AD is going to be one of the 5 greatest talents of this generation, and he's gonna pick up a lot of hardware, but there is just such a distinct generation between him and these other HOF peers of his when it comes to drive and will to win. Maybe AD is just apathetic, maybe he doesn't care that much and is just insanely good at basketball, I mean he is notoriously lazy about his workouts in the offseason which also isn't normal. I don't know. But there is absolutely something to it."
Let's be real. Healthy Eric Gordon wasn't anywhere near good enough to win with. Even a healthy Cousins is no guarantee of winning anything. They flat out didn't surround AD with a good enough team at any point.  The Pels are also at fault for being so far away from contending that Jrue asked out.
Only if he's to blame for constantly being injured early on in Nola along with the cousins injury and eric Gordon being injured that were the biggest killers of hope for the AD era.    His timeline could never fit with the Zion era.
Yeah they totally mismanaged Cousins by injuring him... They totally mismanaged Eric Gordon by injuring him repeatedly... They totally mismanaged Jrue by injuring him repeatedly throughout his tenure in Nola.    They had some shit luck and made some poor moves but they haven't been that poorly managed lol.
If you tank at least play your first round picks and not play Eric Gordon 20 mins a game
"Because he didn't fit and didn't want to be here. He is a decent player but he has severe limitations that most people don't realise, because of course they didn't watch the Pels, and which are somewhat exacerbated by the way Ingram and Zion play.   Lonzo is a good shooter but only when he is wide open and really only off the catch. He also has very little half court creation and driving skills. This basically makes him a spot up shooter and just a spot up shooter when it becomes a half court game. This is find in Chicago where Lavine, Caruso, and DeRozen can all create offense in the half court. The Pels don't have that and we need the shot creation skills of someone like Graham. There have been only a handful of games that where we weren't in the mix for the win this season and I can 100% assure you we wouldn't be in those games if we had Lonzo instead of Graham for the above reasons.  On the defensive end Lonzo can also be a bit deceiving. He is a great help defender but regularly gets torn to shreds defending quick guards and doesn't have the size to take on big wings. I'm hoping that the health issues he's had are the root cause of his inability to defend quick guards and as he gets healthier that improves,  he seems like a nice dude so I want him to do well. Graham isn't a bad defender, a weird myth that I don't know where it came from. He's fine. Limited a bit height wise but he is fine defending the point and as our team settles into the new defensive scheme and gets to know each other (remember new coach and lots of new players usually = bad defence) our abysmal defense should improve.  Then of course there was the issue of Lonzo not seeming to want to be in NO. That is fine, the dude should be able to live where he wants to, I'm all in favour of that. But we've had really really really bad experiences of keeping RFA against their will before as a franchise, Eric Gordon, and I wouldn't be surprised if the toxicity from that whole shambles was considered in the equation.  So basically Lonzo is a bad fit for our stars, we've had bad experiences with keeping RFA who don't want to be here, and Lonzo was asking for way more money than it would be reasonable to give someone for the role they would be playing with us. Should we have gotten more for trading him? Yes probably but we also have some good salaries for trading should people become available, as they always do. I know it won't happen, because he seems happy, but we could through a lot of picks at OKC for SGA should become available. That would push Graham to the bench, which would also work really well for us."
You mean because AD refused to play center and we had to trade Robin Lopez to get Tyreke Hill in a sign and trade. How bout Eric Gordon and Boogie. The Pelicans may be cursed by horrific injury luck but you can never say they didn’t try and the only thing outsiders like yourself can look at is hindsight.
"Winfred jacobs also seemed to work on a lot of them as well. There’s probably a few more BAA oldheads that work.  And I think you’re right that those are the only teams - I didn’t see any others that worked. Though I think the wizards also were giving 8s in some scenarios because of beal? And I think Corey Joseph was fucking some of the pistons ones. Eric Gordon was the link used the most often for the rockets.  There’s definitely a couple of teams where it’s like “Ah, if it wasn’t for that *one* vet you signed this year.”  If 10 exists, I think you have to proc it on the early end by finding someone that takes an extra connection to get to the modern day."
Lmfao all those Rockets fans saying shit like “Eric Gordon and the 13th pick for #1. Take it or leave it.”   I don’t miss those times.
"&gt;Nah Silas has actively prioritized winning over development for a good number of games. Benched Jalen and played Eric Gordon in close 4th quarters to try to steal wins.  This happened once, and while  I didn't like it, Gordon was playing well (was 5 of 6 when he came in late) and a win would have been huge for morale and confidence.  Any kind of win right now would be huge for that.  Losing still sucks for the players and makes things hella frustrating.   Vets getting some playing time isn't really an issue for this team, and any rebuilding team should have some vets getting minutes.  They provide direction and leadership on the court.  Gordon, House and Augustin in particular, because they provide spacing, which this team sorely lacks.  They're also likely to be gone by the deadline, so it makes sense for them to play.  Augustin and House aren't even getting big minutes, just 26 combined, and they've missed 9 games already.  Augustin has been a healthy scratch the last 2 games, so he might not even be in the rotation anymore.   I'm confident Sengun will get more minutes when he cuts down on the fouls.  He's averaging 6 per 36 (also 4.5 turnovers per 36).  It's better for him right now to be playing with the second unit and getting a lot of usage, rather than being the 4th or 5th option with the starters.  Once the fouls come down, he'll be able to do both, and I'm hopeful that he'll be cutting into Theis' minutes (who is already kind of splitting minutes with Sengun 24 mpg vs 19 mpg).   Nwaba is the only real head scratcher, but he's only getting 13 minutes a night.  He does hustle, and he's one of the best defenders on the team, so maybe he's good at helping guys get in position.  He doesn't seem to bring much on offense though, so I would definitely rather Garuba take his minutes."
"Giannis playing center and the whole team make up looks like the AD- Jrue Pelicans   We got 3 guards in the starting line up, couple of SF/ PF guy that really provides nothing, some undersize wing playing at the 3. A stretch 4 next to Giannis playing C  So Jrue playing Jrue role Giannis doing everything on both ends like AD did George Hill playing the Tim Frazier role Grayson Allen playing the Eric Gordon role Pat Connaughton playing Dante Cunningham  Bobby Portis playing Nikola Mirotic   It’s just not very good."
What talent exactly?  They have Wood and then an old Eric Gordon?  Jalen is 19yo and despite r/nba gushing... there is a reason KPJ was given away.
"It's not just his slim frame though, his shaky handle, weird shooting form, off ball movement, defensive instinct all need major work. There was a play today where Sengun was asking him to run a play and he just stood there and instead sengun had to iso. You could see Eric Gordon was disappointed with the play."
"&gt;And if you put the ball in the vets’ hands the fans will freak out.  Nah Silas has actively prioritized winning over development for a good number of games. Benched Jalen and played Eric Gordon in close 4th quarters to try to steal wins. Plays Theis, House, and Nwaba over KJ Martin, Sengun, Christopher and Aruba. He even goes with a lineup of Gordon, Nwaba, House, Tate, Theis at times. It is what it is.  Meanwhile coach Casey benched Olynyk so they can start Killian, Cade, Bey, Grant, and Stewart but Silas isn't willing to even give our players opportunities. Seems like Silas is trying to rebuild while also playing vets to get wins and he's half assing both."
With Eric Gordon being the leading scorer after Harden
I guess they have Eric Gordon to teach them...
They tried. Silas even benched jalen Green in crucial time and played Eric Gordon trying for a win but it didn't work.
Actually there are two guys who didn’t regress.  Kenyon Martin Jr and Eric Gordon.
"Kinda crazy this has 40 upvotes, unless this is satire I’m not picking up on. You must not watch our games, which is fair given we are 1-12, but Şengün absolutely doesn’t “muck” up our offense, in fact if he didn’t come off the bench I couldn’t imagine how we’d ever score outside of Eric Gordon isos"
" ""I don't think these young guys know how good eric gordon is"" - suns announcer"
"&gt;they would develop KPJ at the SG and will run John Wall at PG, instead of asking him to rot on the bench.   In this scenario where HOU has Rubio, I'd rather have him at PG. Rubio can coexist with another ballhandler, as he's showing right now.   That way KPJ can still develop as a ballhandler/playmaker, instead of Wall forcing him into an off-ball role. Wall fits more with Eric Gordon, if he's willing to come off the bench."
Cade’s handle has really impressed me. He takes ankles every game. His cross on Eric Gordon was particularly sick.
Send them Eric Gordon.
"I can only assume it’s their role, maybe they want the young point guards to develop &amp; the fastest way would be to get them playing time.  Eric Gordon is an incredibly useful player that can pretty much adapt to how the team plays. John Wall is a ball handler &amp; not a great shooter, that’s all I can think of &amp; they probably know some Veteran presence is good for the growth of a team &amp; they just like Eric Gordon."
So why is Wall different from Eric Gordon?
"I don't understand why it's a terrible look for a professional athlete to say ""I'm paid to play basketball. I want to play and I want to help this team win in however many minutes they want to give me.""  Rockets clearly are not making the decision based only on who deserves minutes, or even who is young enough to contribute in the future. Eric Gordon is older than Wall, and he's getting plenty of minutes. David Nwaba isn't better than Wall, and he's not in the long-term plans, either."
I still don't understand why the rockets don't just play him 20 minutes a game. He's there. They're paying him. It's kind of weak that he's healthy and willing to play but they're just not playing him. Are they really worried Wall is good enough to keep them out of the lottery? Do their typing players need ALL of the minutes to develop? They're still playing Eric Gordon regular minutes. Just seems really fucking strange that they're acting like Wall is some kind of cancer.
"Really, what on earth happened in the 4th to give Eric Gordon more ball handling than Jalen Green??"
Less wild when you consider Eric Gordon is the only leftover from those teams lol
Any chance do you think of getting Eric Gordon?
So I recognize that I haven't followed the post-Harden rockets...at all. Or the Pistons since SVG was there.   But if not for Eric Gordon and Olynyk I might have no idea who any of the people in this game are.
"They should trade cj long time ago, Now his value is very low, 30 years old, bad contract undersized sg , mediocre passer, awful defender, mediocre efficiency. Trade cj and a pick for jerami grant or cj and a lot of picks for siakam, cj for wood and eric gordon, maybe detroit or rockets accept this, raptors would likely reject, is tough because cj is not a star and never was and now he is 30, I dont know who gonna trade for him, lowry and conley are better players than him and were traded basically for a average young player, overpaid vet and a protected first, so I think this is cj value"
At 13M/year he's a lot easier to move than Eric Gordon too
Also he was not primary usage level in the playoff. Eric Gordon was their second option not hom
"If he's being compared to Eric Gordon, I would assume not good.   (I really have no idea though)"
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"Eric Gordon might be the better Rocket example... even though Ryan Anderson got paid more that summer. It's funny that people think Gordon has a bad contract when over 5 years and an extension later, he still doesn't make as much as Ryno's $20M/yr deal (and is an all-around better player)"
"Which star was in the lineup of Lin, Parsons, Omer Asik and Eric Gordon?"
"Grayson Allen might overtake Donte Divincenzo starting spot even when Donte comes back. He can really shoot the ball and can do way more on offense than Donte.   His game really reminds me of Eric Gordon, despite all the cliche of JJ Redick comp (white SG from Duke) that people throw at him coming into the league"
That was all Stern’s decision.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2012/1/24/2729559/david-stern-new-orleans-hornets-eric-gordon-hook
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1039575-hornets-down-to-the-wire-on-new-orleans-eric-gordon-contract-extension  They wanted him play it out and get an offer in restricted free agency…that’s not uncommon.
Stern didn’t have faith in his own deal. He blocked New Orleans from signing Eric Gordon to his rookie extension as soon as the plane landed.
"Harden had a WAY better all around team than Lebron lol, GTFO. Cp3, Eric Gordon, capela, Aricza, etc. The Cavs were an amalgam of random ass players after kyrie left that still ended up making the playoffs (finals) due to Lebron being a literal one-man army. Harden also didn’t make it to the finals, and didn’t have one of the greatest individual playoff performances ever, idc if MVP is a regular season award."
"The team was far from complete. We had zero NBA capable 3s, but in general AD did have help here. Before Boogie he also had Jrue, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, and Tyreke Evans. None of those guys are superstars, but they were really good players that pretty much any generational talent could make the playoffs with. The issue was always injuries and AD not being an alpha take the game over type. We couldn’t stay healthy (still can’t apparently) and AD is better suited as the best Robin in the league as opposed to Batman."
Eric Gordon
"Lol, korkmaz is Philly and a major reason why we’re winning games. Eric Gordon washed as a mf and we don’t need another big man when Drummond has already shown to be a more than capable back up, thank you try again"
Eric Gordon has looked very good. I think he is getting traded to a contender before the deadline. The only concern is he's injury prone and his contract is not small
Rockets second unit is half decent IMO. Eric Gordon looking good as well
Most of those Pelican teams that missed the playoffs were ass though.  It was AD+Jrue(sometimes because of injury/taking care of his wife)+Tyreke(sometimes because of injury)+Eric Gordon(sometimes because of injury) then literally some of the worst role players in the league.   I do wish we kept our depth that is excelling everywhere else though! Sadly playing poorly in the playoffs and our lack of offense system meant it was all the role players fault and not the system that is essentially Lebron ball resulted in them all being shipped off.
Yeah obv he could’ve left on a better tone but our owner was fucking trolling and he wanted out. In the beginning he didn’t have any help tho. He brought us to 53 and 54 win seasons with Eric Gordon as his number 2
"Harden had a better team lol. Dude was surrounded by shooting, Russ would've absolutely feasted with that roster. Instead he was running into a brick wall in the paint every time he drove because the Thunder had 2 ""shooters"" on the entire roster, one of whom was a rookie that you probably don't remember (Alex Abrines) and the other wasn't really that much of a shooter (Oladipo). Later they picked up Doug McDermott and played him like 20 minutes a game.   The Thunder had a decent defensive squad (I think they were like 10th best), but the Rockets had wayyyyy more offensive fire power and a way better second scorer in Eric Gordon.   It was a close race but I think Russ had the bigger carry job to pull off. The Rockets were underrated before the season because their defense was supposed to be bad without Dwight and they didn't do very well the last season. But their roster was a perfect fit for D'Antoni's system and they filled the Dwight sized hole in their roster with more shooting role players.     I wish the Thunder had kept Ibaka that offseason, would've made a huge difference for Russ and the Thunder that season. No Oladipo because there's no trade, but Ibaka being their stretch 4/5 would've been huge."
"Eric Gordon isn't a free agent until 2024. Anybody with 1 year left on their deal, 35 years old, who also gets DNPs and wasn't traded at the deadline is an incredibly obvious buyout candidate that any sane GM would do if that was a request"
im not saying he wouldn’t bro was talking as if we *had* to. Masai may or may not buy him out but players have been rotting on the bench all the time. Eric Gordon is still on the Rockets.
Eric Gordon or John Wall are the only possibility. Brodie back to HOU. And if it's Gordon it'll take sweeteners because HOU would have to send additional salary back.
"I’m sure someone else has probably mentioned this, but I randomly decided to check the box score on ESPN and saw: Eric Gordon vs. Aaron Gordon, Porter Jr. vs. Porter Jr., and THREE J. GREENS lmao!!!"
"On a good defensive team, Eric Gordon is a great defender. He's strong and quick on the perimeter as well."
Eric Gordon is proof that once you are an elite shooter defenses will always respect you even if you aren’t shooting well anymore
"eric gordon didn't get the memo, TBH he should have gotten a whistle on that drive at the end rockets are lucky the refs didn't call it  gordon better be careful he's playing too well for a team that doesn't want to win games"
"Eric Gordon, from way inside! Bang! Bang! Oh what a block by Jokic!"
"eric gordon is too good for this houston team, maybe needs to get benched with a mysterious injury"
Eric Gordon looks so out of place on this team lol
"I think it's more that no one would think it refers to him because there's no T in his name.  Like how Eric Gordon would be called ""EJ"" and no one from other fanbases would know who that was, or they'd say ""Don't you mean EG?""  (The J is for Junior - Eric Gordon, Jr)"
cade cummingham do you believe eric gordon will get traded to a contender?
Eric Gordon been balling out
"Love seeing Eric Gordon jumping down, grabbing his head lol. Reminds me of CP and Deandre Jordan at the end of that one game."
"Okay so I might have a theory on this. Teams have designated inbounders for this situation (last minute, close game, being full court pressed).   The fuck up begins with Eric Gordon instinctively going for the ball after the shot even tho Tucker was supposed to inbound the ball. Think about it, you would rather have Gordon to break the press after receiving the ball.  So they both realize this but Gordon already inbounded the Ball. Tucker might have thought that this wasn't a regular inbounds pass because refs tend to let shit like this slip when it's not in an important high pressure situation like this.  So tucker tried acting like the ball wasn't inbounded yet to get the ref to allow him to take the ball out himself and inbound it again. This is also what leads Vonleh to take a second to compute what was happening before grabbing the ball, he was kinda waiting for the ref to give a signal on the legitimacy of Gordon's weak ass inbounds pass"
"&gt;What are you talking about? Harden was carrying a terrible squad. Who was his second best player? Eric Gordon? Third best was Robert Covington? I mean the Rockets needed Danuel House to be a major contributor. Every single play had to be run through Harden.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;What happened to Lebron last year with AD out? I have no idea what your argument here is. When teams are built a certain way, one star is usually not enough. The Thunder were also a great defensive team with literally the best Harden stopper in the NBA.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Westbrook is terrible. Harden was playing with a very limited roster that was built with the assumption there are two ball dominant creators.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;You were right about the Capela timeline though. I remember he was out but the plantar fascia stuff only came out post trade."
"What are you talking about? Harden had Dort on him who is the best defender of Harden I've ever seen. That obviously impacted Harden. The Rockets won 3 blowouts thanks to Harden and lost two close games.    Harden's supporting cast was Covington, Rivers, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker. Thanks to Westbrook he lost Clint Capela which meant no more pick and roll as well.   Like in Game 6, Harden got Russ a wide open jumper with the game on the line and Russ fucking airballed."
I’m just waiting for Armoni Brooks to get those Eric Gordon minutes once he gets traded
"Harden against Warriors in 2019, he had the best playoff series in his career while Chris Paul and Capela were getting outperformed by Eric Gordon"
Free Eric Gordon.
"I agree with your second statement. Like I said I'm a huge advocate for Harden's 2018-19 season. However the 14th to 4 seed argument is a very bad one when they shouldn't have been underachieving in the first place.      Through 25 games the Rockets were 11-14,       - CP3 had only missed 5 of those.    - Capela had played all of them.    - Tucker had played all of them,    - Eric Gordon only missed 3 of them."
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
"&gt;Rockets (McHale to D'Antoni)- Upgrade at coaching but the team also added pieces like Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson (who were actually starting level contributors at least that first season), and eventually CP3 (when they had their 65 win season).  Also was when Dwight left, which wasn't addition by subtraction per se.  But it did allow Harden to completely take over the offense."
"I mean pretty much every example here you can point to roster changes which had their fair share of impact.  Bucks- Obviously Bud was the biggest upgrade but the team he had was definitely upgraded from what Kidd had. They got Brook Lopez for real cheap that offseason, they added Connaughton+Ilyasova (not world beaters but solid guys who contributed), and upgraded Delly to George Hill during the season.  Raptors- Casey to Nurse was definitely an upgrade but the team also got Kawhi+Gasol.  Warriors- Jackson to Kerr was huge but the team added Livingston and Barbosa that same offseason (again, not world beaters but solid contributors who gave them elite depth)  Rockets (McHale to D'Antoni)- Upgrade at coaching but the team also added pieces like Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson (who were actually starting level contributors at least that first season), and eventually CP3 (when they had their 65 win season).  I know there are levels to this and Livingston+Barbosa are obviously not the same as adding CP3 but I think overall, you could make that argument with pretty much every coaching change."
Porzingis for Eric Gordon/Christian Wood works. Add in a pick from Dallas and I think that is a feasible trade.
"To be fair, the Pelicans have been one of the most poorly run teams in the league for quite some time. Most of that predates Zion's arrival there, but he doesn't need to have witnessed it all first hand to know how bad it is. He no doubt heard all the stories about why Chris Paul and Anthony Davis were so eager to leave (as well as other guys, like Eric Gordon), and then he's seen himself how they've handled him along with JJ Redick, how Jrue wanted out, how Lonzo wanted out, the mess with hiring and firing SVG, everything to do with Steven Adams, etc.   You can't really blame Zion for having a lack of enthusiasm for Pelicans basketball. His weight issues may be something which was going to be inevitable anywhere, I don't know, but it's possible that a change of scenery with a competent franchise might motivate him more than he's been in New Orleans. I feel like it's just a matter of time before we find out which it is."
"They never tried to “force” AD to stay either, they encouraged him to stay with the idea that the Pels had the #1 pick which would give him help. Similarly with Lonzo, AD wasn’t forced to play for the team. Those things aren’t in opposition.. they’re quite similar actually. Regardless, comparing a superstar in AD to an average limited pg in Lonzo is stupid. The Eric Gordon thing was an entire different front office and different owner, but if you want bring it up you could say the organization learned from the situation.. it was a mess. An organization is not forced to make the same decision over an over again despite what you believe. If Zion wants out, encourage him to stay.. if he still wants out then you get the most you can out of him."
Eric Gordon?
"&gt; are you asking if I believe we should force a player to play for a team they strongly don’t want to play for? If so then yeah I tend to believe that’s horrible for the culture of a team.   I'm asking because you guys have two recent examples of players who didn't want to play for you, in Anthony Davis and Lonzo Ball. When AD asked out your team went scorched earth to try to force him to stay, and when Lonzo wanted out you guys let him go. So if Zion ends up wanting out in the next year, which approach do you hope the Pelicans take? You guys also similarly trapped Eric Gordon years ago when he tried to sign with Phoenix and publicly said he didn't want the Pels to match, but they did anyway. At least one of these approaches was the wrong one, as they're all in opposition to each other. If Zion wants out, what do you personally hope the Pelicans do?"
&gt; nobody expected bledsoe to just give up  He wasn't our first Eric Gordon.
I wonder if they'll end up with Eric Gordon?
"The Clippers if they keep going down this losing path just *might* have to trade for a consistent guy, i truly don’t see another team trading for Eric Gordon"
"Roster isn't even that good. Eric Gordon, pj tucker, and boogie are washed. John wall is inconsistent so CWood is the only other consistent player on that team"
"Their team is awful, I know everyone is like “give wall and cousins a chance” and all that but that roster is just god awful. They have like 6 good players and then just a bunch of guys and 6 is being generous. Very generous. And after those six, the roster is god awful and you need more than 6 quality players if you want to be a contender out West.  Harden, Wall, Wood. Tucker is a nice player but he doesn’t give you much offensively. They really need a good wing defender and don’t have one. Eric Gordon has a terrible contract and is entirely too streaky to rely on and cousins looks decent. That’s their 6, that roster isn’t cutting it in the west and everyone saying how he should give them a chance and the new coach....that roster isn’t doing what HARDEN wants it to do in the west, especially at this stage if his career.  Harden, wall and wood is a decentish team that would fight for a low seed in the west but that’s now what Harden wants to be doing and tbh, he shouldn’t have to be okay with that just because you like the rockets story of having the young coach who just got a chance, an undrafted player who is breaking out, and two players who were really good and are coming back from injuries. We get that you guys like the rockets story and want him to stick around but this rockets team isn’t going where Harden wants it to go and it’s not good enough for this conference."

"You've said this before and I've told you before it's not true. AD scored at a higher rate with higher efficiency when LeBron was on the bench. He was also averaging 30/11 against the best defense in the league and DPOY runner up in 2015 and that Pelicans team did not feature a starting PG.  The starting guards were Eric Gordon and Quincy Pondexter.  AD doesn't need an elite playmaker, he just needs an NBA level average playmaker, which every team in the NBA has.  Meanwhile Giannis didn't sniff the MVP conversation until he had the luxury of playing 80% of his minutes with 4 shooters around him."
Must be talking about Eric Gordon
I mean the bigger issue is other than wall and wood the rest of the team is just complete ass. Eric gordon is useless now and the rest of those guys are just g leaguers
"Eric Gordon and two firsts, I wish."
"You should see the Rockets game. Eric gordon got a foul when he didn't even touch AD, then the Rockets challenged it and they didn't overturn."
fucking Eric Gordon. That's just brutal lol
I cringe every time Eric Gordon takes a long 3
"No, he doesn't. He doesn't look that much different, he is just ISOing less which is what people are used to seein and when they don't see that they assume he's given up. But he's doing what his coach wants him to. He's improved on his defense and his PNR passing is still absurdly good, and his efficiency is as high as ever.  Again, I think giving up Harden ISOs so Eric Gordon can attempt to go off is a bad idea. But this is what the system they're running is calling for him to do."
"Obviously those are relevant factors but he's without a doubt let his foot off the gas, in general, too. If you watch this season's first two games, then watch the last two games, it's abundantly clear you've watched two completely different players and that there's more to it than making the new adjustments.  Letting Eric Gordon ISO on Lebron for three consecutive possessions while Harden camps in half court, for example, should never happen lol"
"Depends on if the Rockets still try and make Harden give up shots so Eric Gordon can ISO more. Harden isn't really coasting, everyone just demanded he do more off the ball and not ISO as much so he's doing what he's asked. He's averaging 11 assists as a result. The problem is is giving up Harden ISOs for Wall and EG ISOs is not gonna result in wins until they figure out this new offense (and actually find a dedense)  Beal is gonna be top 3 with a like 20-52 record Harden likely finds his way back to the top. KD will average close to 30. Curry has had some hot shooting and some ice cold shooting so we'll see if he can maintain and stay healthy as the only real offensive threat. Giannis will run and dunk to 30 easily."
"Lmao everyone demands he play off ball more and let everyone else get touches.  He does that, leads the league in assists, and the Rockets suck and everyone looks around confused on how else to blame him.  You don't make a guy as good at ISOing as Harden *not ISO*. His defense, off ball, and passing have all gone up. But who the fuck coulda guessed arguably the greatest offensive player in the NBA giving up touches for Eric Gordon ISOs was a bad idea."
"This was embarrassing  Transition defense lost us the game. It looked like the Lakers were cherry picking, just bad defense  No preparation or hunger whatsoever. Harden looked passive  Disgusting  Worse loss of the season  Eric Gordon   Oh well, binging AOT and Black Clover will help me take my mind of this disaster"
Eric Gordon is an IMPOSTER
Why does eric gordon even dribble
"Harden didn't have CP3 that year.  His second best player was Trevor Ariza according to pre-season player rankings (Eric Gordon arguably emerged as the actual 2nd best).  In fact, according to those pre-season rankings, Westbrook had the better top-end support with Adams and Oladipo appearing on all top-100 lists at around the 40 and 60 spots (on average) respectively. Even Kanter ended up ranked consistently higher than almost anyone on the Rockets."
Anyone remember when Rudy gobert got punked by eric gordon and pj tucker last year lol
Kind of surprised with Eric Gordon being here. He's a little above average free throw shooter
"FACTS. If Harden wasn't busy choking, the GOAT Eric Gordon would've led that team to easy back to back championships."
"Dude said ERIC GORDON lmao.  That's nothing compared to KD, Klay, Draymond, etc. Fuck outta here"
But he had Eric Gordon that’s a lot more help from 3  than curry does
"but it doesn't seem to make it harder.  the rockets have amazing offenses year in and year out (if people were going to get sick of the style, i would think it would be over the 82 game slog of the season), and only get beat by teams stacked with 3 and 4 hall of famers in the playoffs.  it's not like the timberwolves or teams with less talent figure us out.  people act like harden is scoring 50 a game and the role players never shoot.  i don't see our role players shooting any fewer shots than most teams role players.  most of them like ariza and tucker and LMAM were 3&amp;D catch-and-shoot guys their whole careers who got a bunch of looks playing next to harden.  it's not like they've been highly integrated into their teams O's and then got turned into shooters by harden.  capela was basically made by harden.  eric gordon got to create a ton for a guy coming off the bench.  cp3 basically got as many touches as he could handle without breaking down (only played 58 games both years) as we did our best to not wear him out but also tried to not wear harden out.  by the second year cp3 was hurt a lot and clearly couldn't carry and that's the first time harden became this 35 ppg guy.  harden essentially started scoring so much due to injuries and paul taking a step back, and it basically saved the season when he did (and for some reason, all he gets is crap for saving the season).  the alternative was lose a lot.  of course, most of the talk around cp3 (if we can believe any of it) was him not liking harden not moving off the ball.  and of all the ways to look a gift horse in the mouth, that's what you can't stop complaining about on the best team you've ever been on?   as for russ.  i can't save russ from russ.  he had his 3rd highest scoring and best shooting season ever in houston.  if he needed something else to feel good about himself, i don't know what to say."
Raptors (1-6) and Rockets (2-4)  Kyle Lowry / John Wall  James harden / FVV   OG / Eric Gordon   Siakam / Tucker   Christian Wood / Boucher
"Send Embiid to Houston for Eric Gordon and two firsts, it's the only solution after this devastating loss!!"
"Hes gotten Capela paid, he got Ryno paid, he got Eric Gordon paid, I can keep continuing on and on."
"Ya, he brings a lot of energy and actually tries to do something on defense. Makes up for having Eric Gordon in there."
Eric Gordon takes too many bad shots. I think his light has been too green for a couple of years now.
"He is? How come he got absolutely obliterated by Harden, CP3 and Eric Gordon in back-to-back postseasons? Clint Capela feasted because Houston just took Gobert onto the perimeter and abused him there time and time again."
Reminds me when Harden was out and Eric gordon dropped like 50+ in you guys
"Bucks depth? Last year for sure, but a lot has changed. Are their first 3 off the bench in the playoffs going to be Augustin, Forbes, and Portis? Nets look good on paper in that regard, but they really need another PG to run their second unit.   Miami and Indiana look like the deepest teams in the East to me. I agree that Morey will need to make a move for another ball handler by the deadline Kyle Lowry, Derrick Rose, Patty Mills, George Hill, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon come to mind as potential fits if they become available."
"1) Harden 2) Wood 3) Wall 4) Eric Gordon 5) PJ Tucker 6) DeMarcus Cousins 7) Jae’Sean Tate  Rockets don’t really have any young prospects worth keeping, so I think just retaining our main rotation pieces at the moment would be the best move possible. After last year’s bubble incident, I’m not a fan of Danuel House and he’s honestly been pretty bad to start the year. Don’t think he’s worth keeping."
And Eric Gordon with pj tucker in the inbound
eric gordon is so fucking strong man
is eric gordon the least aesthetically pleasing player
This man Eric Gordon dribbles so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao gotta love Eric Gordon pump faking from the half court line and drawing the foul
Eric Gordon plays so wide. It sounds weird in my head but its the best way i can describe it.
Eric Gordon + first rounder
"Lmao Wood is the only guy who’s played above average and he was a total surprise to everyone, Wall, Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker haven’t done shit, Boogie was a weak signing, this roster isn’t good by any means, that’s why all the sports writers don’t expect much of them, you sound like the dumbass little man “we need to wait until the all star break” lmao maybe watch the games that’ll help"
I long for the day where I don't have to watch Eric Gordon argue every single foul call where he clearly fouls.
"&gt;  Harden and an earlier Westbrook fit more in to the latter camp.  Just talking about Harden, Westbrook, and Curry, I guess this gets to my question:  What's your evidence that Curry *can't* raise the floor like those two guys?   Harden's most obvious ""no help"" season was '16, and it was a .500 team. But even still, that was a well-constructed team around his talents, with guys who were very good at their roles (Howard and Capela as finishers, Beverly and Ariza as shooter-defender types, Lawson as a secondary playmaker).  Other years he had guys like Montiejunas (IIRC, he had a very effective low-post game) Chandler Parsons (who became ""Chandler Parson's contract"" when he got hurt, but was actually really good before then), Marcus Morris, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, etc - not a bunch of great players but not a bunch of scrubs, either.   Because I look at how that '13 Warriors team played when Curry was out, and I think, man, the floor without him was pretty damn low."
Some people liked oladipo though okc fans argued he wasn’t even comparable to Eric Gordon.  Just come on now with the grant and sabonis mentions.  They did very little on that thunder team.  Now adams/kanter was good center rotation and Roberson played some amazing defense.
Eric gordon  Man is getting starter minutes and shots
EG = Eric Gordon?? Didn’t we just have a popular thread about how dumb it is to use initials for players that aren’t household names?
"Tatum,Eric Gordon and Caboclo"
"&gt;AD, Harden, and Giannis being ranked above Curry is ridiculous, mind you I'm not talking about regular season stats which are debatable, I'm talking these guys making actual top 5 lists based on who can carry their team.   Well those player rankings every year are based on regular season.  ESPN even noted that Curry dropped to 8 I think this year because of availability last season.    &gt; if you look at the net rating Curry comes out first the last 5 seasons  Net rating doesn't tell you much about a player individually.  Danny Green had the second highest in the 18/19 season.  Eric Gordon was tied with Steph the year before and played the same minutes per game.  The year before that the entire GSW starting lineup was in the top 6.  Last year 7 of the top 10 were on the Bucks.  Also, his lack of FMVP awards definitely hurts his legacy in the eyes of the general public."
"Eric Gordon made Gobert fall on his ass, Shaq would do that every play."
"Rockets only got Harden/Wall/Wood as their big-time 20ppg+ scorers, with Eric Gordon cameo-ing every now and then. Everyone else is there to play defense and hit the occasional open 3.  There is still plenty of scoring load for Harden to shoulder, and Wall might have something to prove but he's a willing passer."
"I have no idea what that is even meant to say. You aren't even addressing the argument anymore. By that logic, give me KD and Klay....you can have Eric Gordon and Ariza...."
"oubre was better, though it should be noted that he was a starter and gordon was a bench player, they have different roles.  eric gordon is more of an outside threat that uses his gravity to drive (at least he used to be lmao)if stats are to be trusted, less than half of oubre's shot are from 3, more than half of gordon's are from 3.  if we take a look at team construction, eric gordon is in his correct role and complements his teammates and the system they were playing (outside or under basket), oubre this year is in his correct role but does not complement his teammates because hes not an outside threat and neither are 80% of warriors players.  this is what i mean by using only stats is very bad way to analyze the game.  you can say ""ya look at those stats"" but stats without context dont mean much.  heres a better comparison, comparing harden in lineups with 1 pg 1 big 2 wings to curry with lineups with 1 sg 1 big 2 wings.  then we can see if curry can elevate similar lineups the way harden can."
They are 11th in attempts per game and Eric gordon has only played a couple games.
Lmao Air Gordon is way more suitable for Aaron Gordon than Eric Gordon. Never ever heard anyone call Eric that
"So just trade him then.   Was Lonzo a ""wasted pick,"" or an asset that helped get AD?  Was Buddy Hield a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get DMC?  Was Andrew Wiggins a wasted pick, or an asset that got Kevin Love?  Was Eric Gordon a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get CP3?  Was Javaris Crittenton a wasted pick, or an asset that helped get Pau Gasol?"
Kings fans you guys will LOVE eric gordon /s
"Late to the thread but yes please. It drove me nuts for YEARS. Some times I can garner who the player is by the context and flair, but a lot of times, no.   ""EG looks slow."" Who the fuck is EG? Oh, Eric fucking Gordon. Hey, KL is looking thicc. WHO?? Kevin Love? No! It's Kyle lowry! Even though I'm a big raps fan, we've never called him that, just some non-raptor fan trying to be trendy.   Thank you for bringing this up. So tired of this shit. If you ain't a superstar or have a complicated name, nobody beside your own team's diehards would recognize it."
"He definitely has had some years with some scrubs. His teammates have pretty bad injury luck. Our 2019 roster looked great on paper, but Capela and CP3 were injured all year, leaving..... Eric Gordon as the 2nd option. Harden put the team on his back and brought us to the playoffs by himself.  2018, no, that team was stacked. But again CP3 and Capela were injured a lot.  Before that, yes pretty much every season with the Rockets he had scrubs besides Dwight who couldn't play 50 games in a season."
"Plus you still got a PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Sterling Brown.  I hope Harden stays."
Ur on drugs thinking the Rockets have to part ways with Eric Gordon in your little proposed trade...and it still ain enough
"Harden faced that, but worse, anytime he crossed halfcourt vs the Lakers in the playoffs and he still dropped 30 ppg on 66% TS, even with guys like Russ and Eric Gordon underperforming.  All stars get extra attention once they don't have multiple All-NBA players on the court at the same time. Welcome to having to play on a team without multiple stars."
"Let's say the Raptors offer is hypothetically:  - Siakam - Powell - 3 first round picks and 3 pick swaps - Somehow take back Eric Gordon  Now let's say the Sixers offer is just:  - Ben Simmons - 1 first round pick  If the Rockets are just randomly low on Simmons, like they think he's just a flawed player that's tough to build around, maybe they like the Raptors offer more, because of the picks and flexibility/savings from offloading Gordon."
"Again, he was still their best defender and playmaker. Is Eric Gordon all of a sudden the better performer than Harden if harden goes on a cold streak?"
"Rockets Big 3 of John Wall, Christian Wood, and Eric Gordon showing up big today"
Eric Gordon legitimately hates Christian Wood lmao. Man does not wanna pass to him at all
Eric Gordon is who Hield thinks he is
Eric Gordon thinks he's playing against Utah here.
I really dislike Eric Gordon.
Eric Gordon has such an unappealing game. His shot form looks like he's chucking.
Eric Gordon whenever someone slightly bumps him https://imgur.com/gallery/qbtSvUn
Is Eric Gordon kinda chubby ??
I did not miss seeing Eric Gordon complain about every call
why does eric gordon always look confused
"Eric Gordon, House and 2 1st rd picks"
Fox drew a shooting foul where Eric Gordon didn't even touch him lol
He can't even post up Eric Gordon lmao
"That doesnt have shit to do with who is better. Brons taken 3 different teams to a finals win. Harden hasn't even brought the rockets into the final game while playing with players like Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul. Clint Capela and Eric Gordon when he was actually still really good"
Eric Gordon and a 2nd?
&gt; Eric Gordon  Oof no.  Gordon has averaged 32% from 3 over the past 2 seasons.
Simmons and picks for Eric Gordon  Who says no?
"Sixers need more shooting. I could see them being interested in the likes of Bojan Bogdanovic, Bertans, Ingles, Harris, Kennard, Mook, Gallo, Eric Gordon"
Maybe Simmons for John Wall and Eric Gordon. Houston not looking to do anything real in the next 2-3 years anyway. Philly could lob a couple of picks their way to sweeten the deal.
"Not just outside of John Wall. Outside of Tate, PJ, Nwaba, KJ Martin  The only people he would fit well with is Wood and perhaps Eric Gordon."
Just gimme a playable Eric Gordon
"Your not wrong, but how much better he gets better is still limited. Eric gordon was a better player than draymond almost every houston vs warriors series."
Prime Eric Gordon
Your team  let Eric Gordon drop 50 on y’all 😂😂
"Watch more games.  Harden with a similar team in 2019 (CP3 injured and a shadow of himself after, Eric Gordon injured, Capella injured) had them 4th.  Curry was always great but only grew in prominence when Dray became a top 30 player. All his success is with him playing on a superteam, being the pre KD Warriors (a fellow top 20 and top 30 teammate) and ofc the KD Warriors.  I don't blame him , it's not as if he ring chased the great team came to him but let us not pretend that he is one the level of KD, LeBron or even Harden. Steph would always fail once he would have less than 2 active all stars alongside him. Surely that should count for something."
"I swear Harden stans must not know how to read. I picked his biggest choke. He has choked like 10 times but that was his worst.  Some more:  2012 Finals vs Miami (the first of many)  2013 vs OKC (7/22 in lost elimination game)  2014 vs Blazers (destroyed by sophomore Damian Lillard)  2015 vs Clippers (one of his worst)  2015 vs Warriors (before they signed KD, classic Harden elimination game with 14 points and 12 turnovers)  2016 vs Warriors (before they signed KD, Curry missed 3 games and Houston still lost in 5)  2017 vs Spurs (probably his worst. Jonathan Simmons destroyed him lmao)  2018 vs Warriors (Harden misses 10 straight 3s in game 7, Rockets blow 11 point halftime lead. Was against Warriors with KD so I give him a bit of a pass)  2020 vs Thunder (4/15 1/9 on 3s in game 7, carried by Russ and Eric Gordon)  2021 vs Nets (5/17 and 2/12 on 3s)  In 5 career game 7s he has shot 34/91 from the field, 11/49 from 3, with 21 turnovers  He has choked far more than any other player who is considered a superstar. Every year he shrinks in big games. It's ok you don't need to defend him anymore. He's embarrassing the Nets in the playoffs now."
"Ryan Andersen, Eric gordon, joe Harris, landry shamet. There's a reason its called the big balls dance and those 4 never done it."
"I mean there was nothing else HOU could do. Warriors were playing physical defense in the paint and HOU was getting 0 calls so they switched to perimeter shooting and their shots just didn’t fall. There’s no gameplan that can prepare James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Clint Capela to beat Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green... especially in a shootout"
"game 7 vs OKC: 17 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers, 4/15 on FGs (26.7%), 1/9 from 3 (11.1%)  game 7 vs Milwaukee: 22 points, 9 assists, 4 turnovers, 5/17 on FGs (29.4%), 2/12 from 3 (16.7%)  Harden stans: ""The only explanation for him being ass against Milwaukee is injuries!""  &gt;We won that game  No thanks to Harden. Russ, Eric Gordon, and Covington collectively carried him to that win. Just like KD almost did tonight. Just like Josh Smith and Corey Brewer carried him (17 point comeback) when he got benched the entire 4th quarter while down 3-2 against the Clippers.  &gt;At least cherry pick stats from a losing series  Hmm there's almost too many chokes to choose from but the most egregious is probably at home game 6 vs San Antonio down 3-2 **with Kawhi out** a few years ago. Harden scores 10 points on 2/11 shooting (2/9 from 3) with 6 turnovers. Jonathan Simmons thoroughly outplayed him, scoring 18 points on 8/12 shooting. Spurs won by 40."
"Lmao at the first sentence, bringing back memories of Eric Gordon and Wolves-era D-Rose dropping 50 on us."
tucker will never not be tatood eric gordon to me
"I'd trade Giannis, Jrue and any remaining picks for John Wall and Eric Gordon."
"Lmao actually hate to say it but PJ looks like that when he gets whistled literally no matter who he's playing against or what he's doing  Him and Eric Gordon have had the biggest 'i will literally have a heart attack and die on the spot what are you doing' reactions to the refs for years, it's a running joke on r/rockets"
How does Pat Connaughton have the greenest light for a catch and shoot deep 3 from any wing on the court? Does he think he’s Eric Gordon
"Ah yes Westbrook who has dealing with a quad injury and COVID, CP who looked completely washed in his last season in Houston, Capela who couldn’t stay on the floor against the warriors, and you really gonna bring up Eric fuckin Gordon?💀"
Que up what KG said to Eric Gordon
"This is very short sighted and dumb.   The west is stacked with guards he would have to be voted over Harden, Klay, Paul George, Kawhi, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Eric Gordon, etc any given year.   Also, the all star game is a popularity contest this is a dumb measurement of a players worth.   The Sixers need another option who can create their own shot and not stack the paint so Embiid can work.   Your opinion is bad."
Eric Gordon has always had a beautiful jump shot.
"It's more like he's (healthy) Eric Gordon but the Bucks want him to be PG. Gordon is/was fine player too, point is I'm just not sure Middleton is good enough to be Giannis' second option in a championship team."
"Missing a lot of names. While AD was consistently hurt Jrue was with the team from AD second season on until the season after he was traded. Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans(who played near the most minutes on those rosters because of injuries to AD, Jrue since Philly didn’t disclose his injury during the trade, and Eric “My heart is in Phoenix” Gordon). They always say the winner dictates how history is told. Basically you’re wrong and that’s ok but don’t speak unless you bringing factual discourse."
They ran that offense this year lol. Porzingus was basically asked to be Eric Gordon this playoffs
"Knowing our FO before Morey, they woulda traded Embiid + picks for Eric Gordon"
"Ben for Eric Gordon,  Ben for John Wall,  Ben for Kemba,  3 Way - Ben to Bulls, Kemba to Sixers - Vuc to Celtics,  Ben for Love,  Ben for Pat Bev and Kennard,  The saddest trade ever = Ben for KP,  Ben for CJ,  Ben for KCP and Kuzma,  Ben for Derrick White,  Ben for Bledsoe,  Ben for Buddy,  Ben for Shia (saves sixers a lot of money as the Thunder have massive trade exceptions and the Thunder would get a premier tank commander)"
&gt; You know what? I kind of hate the Rockets - mostly Eric Gordon   [So does KG.](https://youtu.be/T1Obkz2V0jc)
"I feel the same way. I really like turner and warren - but it’s not working. My fear is we lose turner for nothing however. He is under appreciated and a great piece even just for his defense, I’d hate to get a late pick and just Eric Gordon in return"
Ehhh.. maybe I’m too low on Eric Gordon.  I just can talk myself into any deal where Myles leaves and indy gets Eric Gordon
"Eric Gordon a few years ago for sure, solid D and better all-around player,  but now Buddy cause he's a great shooter and Gordon ain't that great anymore."
Eric Gordon is injury prone asf and one of the most streakiest shooters of the last decade. Give me Hield. Call me biased but so are the people starting to shit on Hield when he might go to the Lakers.
"Buddy Hield is one of the greatest shooters ever but contenders would rather have Eric Gordon. His defence is so much better it's not even funny, he's a good enough high volume shooter that he has to be respected, and is also a more dynamic offensive player."
I forgot Eric Gordon was in the nba what’s he doing
Who is the better player? Buddy Gordon or Eric shield?
"Buddy Hield is one of the greatest shooters ever but contenders would rather have Eric Gordon. His defence is so much better it's not even funny, he's a good enough high volume shooter that he has to be respected, and is also a more dynamic offensive player."
"For sure.   John Wall, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Ben Simmons and Christian Wood is winning it all."
\*cough\* Eric Gordon \*cough\*
Does Houston not have young talent ? Also insinuating that Jalen green's minutes would be significantly impacted by John wall and Eric Gordon(both who will most likely be gone by the end of this summer ) is hilarious
"Hornets get: Myles Turner, Pick 23  Pacers get: Eric Gordon, Pick 11, Pick 24  Rockets get: Terry Rozier, Pick 13  ???????"
I have no clue how Houston is involved here. Charlotte is probably giving their pick to Indy. Unless their giving up a valuable piece like KPJ or future picks I don’t see how they can move up to 13 with 2 mid-late firsts and Eric Gordon.
"They're effectively trading Turner for two late round picks + Eric Gordon, and moving from 13 to 11. That's not a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. Especially when you consider the fact that he's a premier shot blocker who is also a capable three point shooter. That combined skill set is extremely rare in the NBA and is pretty valuable."
"Eric Gordon, not Gordon Hayward"
"I constantly forget the presense of Eric Gordon,"
"If the Pacers trade 13 for Eric Gordon, Pritchard should be fired"
so Indiana gives up Turner to move up 2 spots and get Eric Gordon? seems like a bad return
"HOU: 13th pick (from IND)  IND: Eric Gordon, 11th pick (from CHA)  CHA: Myles Turner"
"&gt; 2017: Lost to 61win Spurs, second best player Eric Gordon 16ppg /12ppg playoffs  Kawhi was out in games 5/6 so it didn't feel like a good loss   &gt; 2019: Lost to KD warriors  KD was out with an injury - although perhaps the Rockets could have come out on top had they kept Ariza."
"Dantoni's playoff resume since everyone will inevitably say ""rings Erneh"":  2005: Joe Johnson broke his face. The guy was an elite defender and shooting 48% from 3. Not saying they would have beat the Spurs but Manu, Horry, and Barry killed them while JJ was out.  2006: Amare injured, JJ gone.   2007: Horry broke Nash' nose. Stern suspended Amare and Diaw. The series was tied and the Suns were going to play at home.  2008: Marion traded for Shaq...  2009-2012: Knicks traded the entire team for Carmelo. But this is a legit criticism about Dantoni not being able to adjust his offense.  2013: Came in after the season started + Nash/Dwight/Pau/Kobe injured.   2014: Nash/Kobe totally out. This probably would have been his best chance.  2017: Lost to 61win Spurs, second best player Eric Gordon 16ppg /12ppg playoffs  2018: Lost to KD warriors  2019: Lost to KD warriors"
Let me tell you about a man named Eric Gordon. This man quite literally screams like his first born just got murdered in front of him if he takes any contact when driving to the rim. It's ridiculous and funny as hell
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
Michael Jordan's sons would've been roasted to death if Eric Gordon game happened in social media era.
"Y’all like 6MOY, 3 point champion Eric Gordon"
You want Eric Gordon back? lol pls
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
Aaron Gordon	and Eric Gordon  I keep hearing the names and thinking the announcers are making a mistake.
"Maybe you should be the GM since you know a lot lmao. Ibaka was always key to the Thunder especially during the Spurs series. The James harden trade was not all that bad at the time considering they got 2 FRP, a solid starter in Kmart and they believed jeremy lamb to become a slightly better eric gordon. Prime eric gordon averaged 22 ppg which is very good"
"I remember this, it was a day after Kobe passed away, Capela was out and Harden/wb werent playing for understandable reasons. Odds on houston were like 1/14 and I was certain Jazz would smoke them but yeah Eric Gordon had other plans"
"&gt; ""the team was so bad they could tank and get AD"" they doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence in the trades quality.  Good thing it wasn't purely that then. The *upside* is what EG was going to bring to the table rather than 1-2 pointless season of purgatory. You're making it sound like the trade the clippers offered would put them into the state we (76ers) were in after the Andrew Bynum trade instead of what they had when Hinkie left.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;In that they pretty much got 2 young players and a pick  Lots of generalising and mental gymnastics at play here to downplay the value of the Clippers' offer here. It was not just 2 young players. It was Eric Gordon. I shouldn't have to pull up articles and videos of what people thought of him at the time. LO was 31 years old, this isn't even worth discussing.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Sure the Lakers trade would have given them expirings/older players but that means the teams expenses would be going down which doesn't hurt the value in a sale if they can't resign, and they would still have their picks for a rebuild at a lower cost.   There's so many problems with this is argument. Firstly whatever financial advantage you think the Lakers offer had was still achievable by the Hornets. EG had 1 year left at 3.3M before becoming a restricted FA. Far better than a 31 y.o Lamar Odom as an asset, you can opt in and lock up a rising star or opt out. Aminu had just finished his first year as a rookie at 2.5M/y. Hell even Chris Kaman was as good an asset as whatever the Lakers offered, he was an expiring 14M player with 12/7 the previous year and was an All-Star before that. Freeing up space wasn't even close to being a factor.  &amp;nbsp;  The bigger issue though is you suggesting it wouldn't hurt the sale. They couldn't sell the team with Chris Paul because owners were in fear of having a non-attractive team with no assets to boot after he inevitably left. It'd work if it were the Lakers or Heat. But NOLA? The entire foundation of them not being able to sell the team was literally in fear of what you are suggesting AND you're asking 28 VERY impatient and annoyed owners to sit on the Hornets to try and sell a team that now has worse value than when they struggled to sell it?"
Eric Gordon   https://www.nbadraft.net/players/eric-gordon/
"Absolutely not. Young Eric Gordon was projected to be the best SG in the league when Kobe was expected to decline and Wade/Roy had already started plus Harden didn't fully showcase his stock yet. The rebuild allowed them to tank for a pick as well (the one that ended up being AD but that's hindsight). The upside of EG, Aminu and picks as assets literally sold the team and put butts in seats. A devastating injury set EG back, but you can't use hindsight to say ""look how that ended up"". Even with hindsight you lose that argument, them having ended up with Anthony Davis alone beats anything else.  &amp;nbsp;  You got that versus a bunch of expiring vets who'd take you to the 8th seed and then undoubtedly leave within 2 seasons. Nobody was going to buy that, they were struggling to sell the team as is"
"Eric Gordon is probably the only ex Pel it worked out less with than Eric Bledsoe, but I think you meant the latter Eric in this context."
"Bledsoe is owed $22M between this season and the next. He is a serviceable backup point guard at this point in his career. Eric Gordon is owed $38M between this season and the next. Considering he hasn't been healthy for two seasons and is a shooting guard who has put up poor shooting numbers in these two seasons, I'd say he is also a bench player at this point. Looks like a win for HOU if they get this deal."
"The Harden trade was a once in a lifetime kind of trade. You simply don't find players of that caliber on rookie contracts (and this isn't just hindsight, it was obvious at the time he was a special player when he was coming off one of the most efficient seasons ever and had the skillset to be a primary ballhandler, and in lineups where he was the primary scorer he put up superstar-level production), and it's even rarer when you don't have to give up an actual superstar to get one. Your odds of finding a young superstar in a trade are far lower than going the traditional rebuild route, hell the Hornets even tried to get a potential young star in Eric Gordon but his career got derailed by injuries.  The team they get from the Lakers trade is stuck competing for an eighth seed at best, which is exactly the worst place to be when the youngest player in your rotation is 25. They barely made the playoffs *with* Chris Paul and David West, and it's hard to see them being much better than the Rockets team led by Martin and Scola."
"Breaking News! Rockets trade 2nd pick to the Piston's for their top pick to draft...Jalen Green! Rockets tossing in a couple of jalapenos, Eric Gordon, the late 1st round pick, Olynk and some chik-fil-a sauce. Not sure if its Polynesian sauce or straight up Chik-fil-a sauce, but word has it the Pistons were planning on taking Cunningham with the first pick so the Rockets felt the urgency to trade up for Green and get him while he was still on the board. /s  FML as a Rockets fan this year."
"Eric Gordon went super public, begged the team to not match an RFA offer sheet, and then wouldn't rehab injuries properly. Bledsoe was just apathetic a lot. I'd deal with Bledsoe for 10 years before I'd deal with Gordon for 5."
"The man literally tweeted that he wanted out of Phoenix then lied and said it was about a barbershop.   He sulked all year outside of like 2 games, and multiple times in his career has refused to come off the bench to help his team. That’s exactly what Eric Gordon did, and we all hate him for it."
"I don't think Bledsoe is a drama queen, actually. He just gets unmotivated. Eric Gordon was a drama queen. Anthony Davis was a drama queen. When Eric Bledsoe had a good game, he was locked in and played like the Bledsoe we expected. That doesn't scream ""drama queen""."
"Oh you mean expiring expiring contracts like the one Chris Kaman was on? They weren’t locked into him he had  1 year left when they got him. The lakers package was old vets who would’ve kept them bad but not bad enough to get a top pick. Shows you have no idea what you’re talking about just a delusional lakers fan. Eric Gordon was seen as a future all star and already a young 20 ppg scorer , and the Timberwolves pick was unprotected from a trash franchise which had good value."
The pelican ad situation would have worked except Jrue /tyreke/Eric Gordon/cousins…. And the other good players got hurt and never got to actually play together.     I realize it was over a few years…. But some of those teams could have made the playoffs if Jrue/Gordon didn’t miss entire seasons.
You guys are aware that he was traded to the clippers **4 days later** for Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman? I feel like I’m going crazy.
Eric Gordon smh
"Eric Gordon was a third year player scoring 22 pts a game at 21 years old.  Kevin Martin was 29, Luis Scola and Odom was 30.  Goran was avg 7pts a game. Actually in all respects Eric Gordon with all his injuries arguably has a better career than Goran so far. U acting like he turned into Steve nash or something. Plus they got a 10th pick from clippers."
"Stop it lol.  Don't pull the 'you weren't around during the trade' crap a couple comments back and then have the audacity to claim Odom was a better piece than Eric Gordon.  Gordon was in his second year and everyone, literally everyone projected him to be an all-star.  Odom was never an all-star at his peak, and at the time of the trade, was on his way down.  Gordon was more valuable than every role player combined in the Lakers/Rockets trade.  On top of that throw in the Wolves pick, who was again projected to be terrible, and a throw in of Aminu, and it was obvious the Clippers was a way better package.  Not even close."
"You're not wrong that NOLA's picks aren't guaranteed to be some warchest like Billy King ended up gifting the Celtics... but the fact that they have any picks at all at their disposal was the main point I was making.   Again, Dell Demps traded legitimately every. single. first round pick during his tenure as GM, starting right from AD's sophmore season. And he never got any from other teams either, for expiring/disgruntled players like Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, Boogie, etc. who all left in free agency for nothing. Zach Lowe is trying to insinuate moves like dropping back a handful of spaces this lottery or giving up a non lottery pick in a future draft to bring in someone like Lowry would be a ""Rushed Dell Demps panic move"" and obviously that could not be further from the truth."
Eric Gordon is also not being guarded like Harden in the playoffs what with half-court traps and double-teams lmao
So chucking low % bricks from three in the playoffs is the winning formula? Eric Gordon has better shooting splits than him vs the Warriors. So maybe he's just not built for winning vs top levels when it matters?
"Eric Gordon plus a first for a sign and trade for Oubre - also heard maybe Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter plus picks for a sign and trade.  Could also see Cleveland going for Paschall plus 14 for Sexton, as they don’t want to give him the max and would want a pick to continue rebuilding. They would get a low return but may view it as better than letting him walk in free agency. This is a dream trade"
"Actually now that I think about it they were just rumors, nothing official to be fair to Bled. But the body language reminded me of Eric Gordon here which maybe is why I didn’t like him here lol"
"&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; We traded him for one of the most promising young stars in the league, Eric Gordon, and we all know what happened with that peanut head.   To be fair, Eric Gordon was already injury prone before that trade."
"Eric Gordon possibly?  Spotty at times, but can give you 25 point games when he’s on, and a very good on ball defender.  And he’s the only piece worth trading thats available (Wood, KPJ, Tate)."
Seriously. Why did 2K make Eric Gordon so trash?
"Cavs should be looking at a max contract at Allen.  Dallas resigning Hardaway is logical. Balled out last season.  Barton resigned is very likely.  Green likely headed East where many teams have a vacancy at the position.   Warriors selecting Duarte in the middle of the first round is likely his ceiling in the draft.  No one should be talking with Houston about a deal involving Eric Gordon unless both picks are included. As for the rise, it is likely a late lotto pick could be had. Gordon contract is not a positive one thanks to his injury history.  Pacers need to be patient with Turner talks.  Grizz should be all over the rumored Pels trade. Would definitely make them stronger favorites for a postseason return.  Knicks should not look to package both picks. The draft is very solid in the middle and they are in prime position to draft fallers.  Ennis will be looked at by contenders more than anything.  Raptors need to sign back Lowry so he can retire there. He is already the best Raptor to ever suit up. Give him a good returning deal and let him ride it out. He already has a title and the Raptors will come back stronger next year."
Rockets are trying to move UP using Eric Gordon? Isn't he like a negative asset at this point?
"But Eric Gordon went to IU so the Pacers fans will love him! /s   Trade down your pick to acquire a perpetually hurt overpaid wing that you don't need. If Indiana makes this trade, Simon needs to sell and they need to clear out the front office."
"So the Rockets want to dump salary AND get rid of a low-round pick in exchange for a lotto pick.  I'd slit my wrists if I were a Pacers fan and this happened. Not that eric Gordon couldn't help a team, but Eric Gordon isn't a player that you give up a lotto pick for.   Honestly I bet you the Pacers are praying someone will take their two late lotto picks to hop in the bottom of the top 10 and get a few of these fringe all-stars that will be available if they pan out."
Pacers are going to feel pretty silly when they realize that they're the ones getting Eric Gordon in this trade.
Is Eric Gordon really going to push the Pacers over the top? Because if they do that trade they will be strapped for money for the next two years. I just don’t see how that’s worth it
Eric Gordon is a positive asset?
"&lt;&lt; And the Rockets have discussed a deal that would send Eric Gordon, plus Houston's No. 23 pick, to Indiana for the Pacers' 13th selection. &gt;&gt; Wait what? There is a chance to trade Gordon with his contract as a positive asset to move up from 23 to 13?"
He got that Eric gordon release package
isn't eric gordon still on the team ???
Heard the rockets might dangle Eric Gordon in trade talks. That’s hard to say no to!!
Eric Gordon (and AD but he was at least a star with us) is the pinnacle of professionalism when it comes to demanding trades
Eric Gordon dropping 50 on Utah
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
Did he get traded to you guys with Eric Gordon?
Fuck Eric gordon
Eric Gordon is overrated to me
Give harden the warriors instead of lou will and eric gordon and see how many rings he ends up. This is from someone who has curry and harden as the same level of player.
"* Blazers - Dame banged up and then leaves the series after being down 3-1. But I don't think anyone legitimately expected the Blazers to win after how the Lakers responded in G2 and onwards.   * Rockets - They lost Danuel House after two games, a dude they signed for 3 years 11.5M total. Not exactly swinging the series. Also they actually had Eric Gordon healthy for 5 games, which is far more unlikely.   * Nuggets - Will Barton again it's not like they lost their main dudes. They got to the Western Conference Finals without him.   * Heat - Bam went down when the series was 3-1, true that was a break for the Lakers but I don't think having Bam means the Heat win 3 games in a row against LeBron.  Losing 1 or 2 players in a 7-game series is pretty common and to me 2020 doesn't stand out really.   2019 Finals with GSW losing KD, Klay, Kevon Looney was the worst since 2015 when LeBron was out there with Dellavedova."
Would Eric Gordon also be in a potential Rockets trade package?
"You're acting like he missed all of the 27 straight threes, also don't forget that the Rockets got completely fucked by referees that game. Take a look at youtube if you have forgotten.  As for shipping CP3, no one thought that it was a bad move considering how bad CP3 was in 2019. Harden was averaging 35 ppg against the Warriors in playoffs while CP3 was getting outperformed by Eric Gordon lol."
"I don't know why people downvoted you for this, it's really something people should look at and be aware of. AD has this reputation for always being injured, but people need to look back on those Pelicans teams and realize that *everyone* on them was hurt all the time, year after year (just look at [this Pelicans fan's comment about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oooaw2/within_2_years_of_being_traded_from_the_pelicans/h605rl0) elsewhere in this thread). AD's injury absences are well documented, but people need to look at how many games guys like Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Jrue Holiday, Omer Asik, Quincy Pondexter, Austin Rivers, etc were missing.   Maybe it was just a lot of bad luck, but considering the fact that they were the only team in the league that did not have their own training or medical staff, that probably played a part. They were using people who specialized in football players to look after their basketball team. And that's fine if it works, but if it doesn't then I think it's perfectly fine to question why they did that or to call them cheap for doing so."
"How are you and the people upvoting this so ignorant lol? He was facing 4 allstars with 1. Heavily noted as the greatest team ever, you’re really knocking the guy for not being able to take them down with Eric Gordon? And that’s not even diving into the game 6 refs  You’re super focused on these micro events, Corey Brewer and Josh smith were horrible outside of that come back. Take a look at the 2015 series stats, they were net negatives while harden was easily our best player. And he was huge in a game 7 win for us  In 2016 our team was ass and barely made the 8th seed due to hardens carrying. Against the 73-9 warriors what did you expect? And lol, klay Didnt outplay him. That’s stupid ass talk. We literally only won 1 game because of hardens game winner. Switch these two players and what happenes?  I’ll admit, he wasn’t good against portland. That was also 7 years ago.  You’re absolutely cherry picking because you’re picking and choosing small things and not looking at the entire context of every situation. Harden has almost always lost to the better team, he choked game 6 2017 but that’s really it. You’re really knocking him for not being able to beat golden state himself. They were up 3-2 with paul  Also, this part was hilarious   &gt; After Paul went down, they lead by 17 after the first in Game 6 and 10 at the half. They lost the game by 29. Harden’s 9 turnovers heavily contributed to that.  &gt; And how am I cherry picking when you literally only post the good parts of his statelines and not the full context behind it?  Do you not see the stupidity within your own statements lol?"
"15 of the past 17 winners have been score first shooting guards (Clarkson, Lou Will x 3, Eric Gordon, Jamal Crawford x 3, J.R. Smith, Harden, Jason Terry, Manu Ginobili, Lenardo Barbosa, Ben Gordon, and Mike Miller). Odom and Harrell being the exceptions"
Wasn't Eric Gordon starting??
Meanwhile Eric Gordon is there stuck with the Rockets lol
And the reason they kept chucking was no foul calls in the paint.  That one play where Eric Gordon gets hi/lowed was borderline unnecessary rougness in football and not even a common foul in the NBA smh.
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
"Bro you’re looking to push for the playoffs. Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?   You already have your young core. Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots. There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?"
"&gt;So it’s insane to judge a guy based off the high pressure moments of the biggest stages in college but it isn’t to fair to say that same guy might not be ready to contribute in the highest pressure moments of the next level in the nba?  It absolutely is insane, especially when factoring in its a 6 game sample size, and when said player still produced and contributed well at what he needed to do in the “biggest stage” (16ppg on 42% from 3 on 7.5 3PA)   &gt;They have a young core. I don’t understand why you need to add another uncertain young guy into the mix especially when all it sounds like you’re looking for is shooting.  They have a young core that consist of 2 people, those are Zion and Ingram. Everyone else is replaceable and their roles can be moved around. You add another young guy to the mix because this is a player whose skillset perfectly blends with what they need as a team and it’s a player who you are getting on a bargain of a contract because they will be on a rookie deal.   Shooters rise, and shooters get paid.  &gt;Tatum, wasn’t suppose to be in that role for one and guys like him who perform in the playoffs like that are the exception not the rule. I wouldn’t expect Cade, Mobley or Green to have that kind of run in their rookie years if they made the playoffs much less Kispert.  Whether Tatum was suppose to be in that role isn’t the point, the point is as a rookie he contributed to winning basketball even before the post season. It’s something other rookies have done and it’s something teams and draft analysts expect Kispert to be able to do from day 1.   &gt;NAW averaged 11 a game last year in 22 mins of play. He can create his own as well why isn’t he a starter?   He’s not an efficient player, he’s not a good 3pt shooter, he’s not a lead playmaker, and he’s an average defender. Also Lonzo and Bledsoe literally started over him   That being said I think he CAN start and be a pressure reliever, secondary creator and 3rd scoring option. Like I have said before POSITION LESS BASKETBALL. These dudes can co-exist.   &gt;Kira Lewis was a rookie who’s younger than Kispert you can’t write him off as ever been a starting guard in this league that fast. That’s what they drafted him for.  I’m not going to ignore a prospect that fits a clear role and position of need because of Kira Lewis Jr and NAW. Honestly I don’t even know why you keep mentioning them when Kispert is a wing and those 2 are guards.   &gt;Duncan Robinson was just a name. Not necessarily talking about him, there will be more shooters who are available who we know can fill it up. Go after Eric Gordon. Houston is looking to move on anyway  33 year old injury prone Eric Gordon who is making 40 million over the next 2 years and has shot 32% from 3 the last 2 years? You’re kinda proving my point about how hard it is to get actual shooters with the players you’re naming."
We aren’t moving John Wall. His contract is much worse than Eric Gordons.   Eric Gordon is also prolly a better player too
No reason to trade Brunson for old ass Eric Gordon on a long term $20 mil contract
eric gordon still in the league?

"Ngl, I'm getting annoyed how soft AD is. One play where he was alone in the fast break. No one to contest him and he just softly put the ball to the ring with idk if you can even call it a dunk. Like this man came to the Lakers saying he'll be one of the best Laker big man and couldn't even dunk to show power. Even when he gets mismatch where 6'6 eric gordon is guarding him. Like play dominant not a freaking fadeaway."
"The Nets also have a lot more skilled players than the Rockets did.   The Rockets had a lot of one dimensional players outside of Eric Gordon (and CP3/Westbrook) with Harden. They could either take spot up 3s or dunk. But couldn't do much else.   I think Harden was really fed numbers by Morey about what was efficient. With the Rockets, the only way to compete was for the Rockets to play the ISO Harden game (extremely efficient and allows you to get away with having unskilled players).    With the Nets team he can play make and still lead really good offenses."
Idk if it’s the Dantoni factor but Eric Gordon looks cooked
Is there a contending team can afford Eric Gordon so he can be a solid 6th man for them?
Eric Gordon is still on this team?
only eric gordon is there from his time here lol
Eric Gordon still on this team? lol wtf
"Freakishly  strong but only managed 9 reps of 185 pounds in the bench press at combine?   Less than Gordon Hayward   Who cares what his nickname “literally” was ?

He was  great player and an excellent athlete, but not even close to being the “second most athletic player of the 2000s”"
hell yeah Eric Gordon.. keep up the good work
Opposite day was laat night? Did Alperen dunk on Eric Gordon too
"They traded for him because it was the best young piece they were able to acquire, and no it wasn’t “mind boggling” at the time because Eric Gordon was again seen as a young player to build around for years to come, the initial lakers-rockets package at the time gave no one they could do that with"
"I’m not that biased, they traded for a worse version of Jason Richardson. It was mind boggling at the time!   How good is Brandon Ingram right now? You wouldn’t think itd be stupid if Luka Doncic was traded for Ingram and Steven Adams right now? Ingram is arguably better than Eric Gordon right now too"
