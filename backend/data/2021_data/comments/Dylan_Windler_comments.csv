&gt; like when someone uses DW for a player on the Cavs and you have to figure out if its Dylan Windler or Dean Wade  No offense bro but NO ONE who is not a Cavs fan wonders if DW stands for any of those players... At best we'd think it's referring for Dawayne Wade for some reason even though he's retired.
what's going on with Dylan windler is he in the dog house?
"I mean I have friends with it, so I recognize it. I started noticing that they use the acronym on the commercials for treating it, as well. So I guess its a little bit more widely known then like when someone uses DW for a player on the Cavs and you have to figure out if its Dylan Windler or Dean Wade"
Still holding out hope Dylan Windler will be a steal of a pick when he gets healthy
man some weird ass stats how is dylan windler +20
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Wait till you tell her about Dylan Windler. She’ll propose to you
"You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Just look at this past two years: Ja Morant, Dylan Windler, Jarrell Brantley, Justin Wright-Foreman, Miye Oni, Malachi Flynn, Jay Scrubb, Grant Miller, Sam Merrill, all from mid-major at best programs. If Seth couldn't get enough attention at Duke University that's his own fault."
"Last week, we had a stretch where we were missing 8 players and had to start Damyeon Dotson and Yogi Ferrell. We were missing Sexton, Garland, Love, Drummond, Exum, Delly, Dylan Windler, and Kevin Porter.   Since then, Sexton and Drummond are back, Exum was traded, Porter started a food fight over a moved locker and ~~got~~ is about to get waived.  Windler (wing who’s played all of 9 minutes through first two seasons bc of injury) and Garland should be back by this weekend. Garland is finally coming into his own and was a huge part of how we started this year 3-0. Other than that, we’ve missed Love’s floor spacing quite a bit. This offense will be finding and hitting many more open 3s when healthy."
"&gt;The good people on r/clevelandcavs have theorized that the Cavs are shadow-tanking, as some players such as Sexton and Garland have been set to play for the last five or so games right before being scratched a couple minutes before tip-off. There have been some other shenanigan's such as Delly being out for over a month with a concussion (somewhat understandable), and there being no word on when KPJ is coming back. As for the other injuries, Kevin Love was expected to be out this long, Kevin Porter Jr is out for personal reasons, and Dylan Windler broke his hand."
"Garland and Sexton are expected to be back at any time, although suspiciously it keeps getting pushed back... Allen and Prince are just waiting for everyone in the trade to be cleared for a physical, Kevin Love and Dylan Windler are expected in the next two weeks, and there is no timetable on KPJ and Delly."

If you haven’t already look up videos of Dylan Windler dancing and thank me later

"Finally, the dylan windler we expect."
what is a Dylan Windler? A homeless man's Joe Ingles?

"Dylan ""Curry"" Windler"
Future GOAT Dylan Windler the 4th quarter rebounding machine
"Why we continue to play Dylan Windler any considerable minutes boggles my mind. He has no discernible strength. He’s good for maybe one spot up three a game, and the occasional layup. He has zero ball handling skills, he’s not a shot blocker or great defender. I mean, he gets rebounds sometimes? Not like we don’t have more where that came from. I know he’s a rookie and I should give him more of a shot. But 7 first quarter minutes for his output? Seriously?"

"Sadly no Allen or Nance tonight, and Dylan Windler is a game time decision."
"Cavs: Garland, Sexton, Okoro, start like every game and we’re drafted by us.   Then we have Cedi OsMan (draft night sign and trade), Dylan Windler, 26th pick.   If you count undrafted players who we picked up and play for us: Mathew Dellavedova, Lamar Stevens, Broderick Thomas, Dean Wade.   Aside from Delly, all these players get decent minutes too"
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team! Anyway, so here are the likely lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (14-22) | [](/NOP)Pelicans (15-22) ---|---   C. Sexton |  Lonzo Ball   Dylan Windler |   Eric Bledsoe Isaac Okoro |   Josh Hart Kevin Love |   B.

Drummond (OUT) |   D. Garland (OUT) :( |    T. Prince  (OUT) |      &amp;nbsp;  ---"
I feel like you’re not giving Dylan Windler his due
The best answer is to play all 4 of our young guards and stagger their minutes.   Our current line up:   DG-Sexton- Okoro probably start (especially early in the season)   Then bench DG to bring in Cade: so we have Sexton- Okoro- Cade this way Cade gets some playmaking experience against the starters of opposing teams   Have DG run the bench unit with Cade: he needs some off ball experience sitting either Sexton or Okoro depending on who needs rest.   Basically just cycle the 4 players in 3 spots giving one a break.   But please note we have several young players who we are training up: Broderick Thomas- Lamar Stevens- Dean Wade - Dylan Windler
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Dylan Windler
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
"- traded for Allen with a late Bucks 2022 first, that we got from trading George Hill   - traded future 2nds to reach into the first round and get KPJ (it's unfortunate what happened after but the pick itself was immensely quality value)   - in addition to the first-round picks I talked about, signing potential rotation players like Dean Wade and Dylan Windler who can space the floor and defend multiple positions   - making the most out of our ""assets"" (like a 36 year old Kyle Korver, George Hill, Javale McGee) and either creating future draft capital in the form of firsts or seconds   - so yeah, when a guy as good as lebron leaves, you're not gonna be good. instead of being salty at an organization you have paid no attention to, be grateful that your team jumped up in the lotto. Enjoy Suggs"
"Definitely not both of those guys, but realistically maybe Sexton, Kevin love, Dylan windler and a frp"
"This is interesting ideas, undermined by saying that high 30s% for 3PT% is below average. For whom? Steph Curry? Joe Harris had the highest 3 point percentage of qualified players and he shot 47.5%.  According to Basketball Reference, among all players in the NBA, league median is halfway between Dylan Windler (33.8%) and Terrance Ross (33.7%). Embiid is 70th percentile and Harris is 78th percentile. Among ""qualified"" players, it's a little different, but they're still above the median for qualified players.  It's an interesting idea to sell high, especially since they have 5 years of team control on Simmons. I don't think it's interesting enough to entertain offers other than KD &amp; Harden or LeBron &amp; AD for Embiid because they haven't exhausted all of their options with Embiid yet. They can load-manage him super hard like Raptors Kawhi, eat the fines, still make the playoffs since they've shown they can still get the 1 seed missing Embiid for a lot of the time anyway, and give it a go that way.  As for the idea of selling high, now that Tobias Harris's contract looks a lot less bad, maybe they should sell on him to try to get a couple of players, especially decent bigs that can eat up minutes while Embiid rests. Idk how possible that is."
"Look at everyone picked around him tho. Darius Bazley, Nassir Little, Luka Samanic, Goga bitadze, Dylan Windler.  They all sound like fake names lol."
"Alternatively  'The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ricky Rubio, Cedi Osman, Dylan Windler, Damyean Dotson and their top-29 protected draft picks for 2030/32/34.'"
"basically the only players we have developed in the past few years are Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro... they're all developing well?  Okoro could be better but he's not bad.  Idk wtf you want from us.  Are you upset Dylan Windler isn't good enough???"
Maybe Dylan Windler will be that guy.
But then you get 3rd string guys like Dylan Windler...making the list at no.2
Dylan Windler
"PG:Darius Garland SG:Collin Sexton SF:Isaac Okoro PF:Lauri Markannen(for now) C:Jarrett Allen Reserves: Dylan windler, Evan Mobley, damyean Dotson, Ricky Rubio"
"I mean, we've got Isaac Okoro, the glass-boned corpse of Dylan Windler, and a lightly used Cedi Osman. That's technically a wing rotation, by the broadest of possible technicalities."
"An outstanding job, that's what!  What the heck are you on about?  3 bigs - Mobley JAllen and Markannen - for 2 positions.  2 of them can shoot, and 2 of them can defend.  The one who can do both needs some development time.  Sprinkle a little DWade in there.  Darius Garland will be the first guy from this group to be an allstar.  No, it wont be Sexton.  Long term Sexton might be the starting shooting guard, or (more likely) the 6th man.  Dylan Windler and Isaac Okoro are going to surprise the hell out of people.  Pay attention.  This team is on track to be scary as hell before long!"
"1. the cavs currently have players like isaiah hartenstein, jeremiah martin, lamar stevens, brodric thomas, dean wade, and dylan windler on the roster. Cutting one of them is completely free and wouldn't cost first rounders. (I might've made up one of those names, you wouldn't be able to tell.)  2. You are not getting assets for kevin love, you are giving up assets to give up kevin love.  3. Better fitting pieces as in other teams crap they throw in to match salary? Again look at #2 Kevin love is a negative value, you will give not get anything worthwhile.  I'd also like to add the cavs are not over the luxury tax, they are not competing this year or the next, and that sending kevin love home for the season ala Al Horford on OKC would accomplish the same thing as your hare brained scheme and not cost them picks/actual contributing players to their future."
"I'll try to answer this as simply as possible.  &gt; My question Is, what the heck is going on with SexLand? Is the team more into Sexton or Garland? Who will they keep  If you play close attention, Garland and Sexton almost **never** share the court together. On average, it may be about 10-12 minutes a night they do to keep their defensive disadvantages hidden as both Rubio and Okoro are average to plus defenders for their position.   Furthermore, Sexton plays very well off Rubio and has actually showed some of the best off-ball play and ball movement of his entire career, albeit early. Garland does really well with Okoro and Rubio, as well as Sexton in certain roles.  I believe the Cavs prefer Garland over Sexton but if Collin continues to show growth off-ball, I have a strong feeling both will be Cavaliers for a decent amount of time.   &gt; What do you guys think the plan is? Yall now have a transcendent talent in Mobley, can't F this up..  The plan is pretty simple. We badly need to acquire a rotational SF. Our guard core of Garland, Sexton, Rubio and Okoro is solid enough to win games, as is our big man core of Allen, Mobley and Markkaken.   If Dylan Windler was healthy, perhaps he could alleviate some of the issues we have at the position but so far he's been nothing but injured during his first few seasons. Cedi Osman and Lamar Stevens are also not starting caliber SFs.   I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs acquired a SF before the deadline. In a perfect world I'd trade any amount of picks for Brandon Ingram. He'd fit so beautifully in this lineup.   I would also strongly consider re-signing Ricky Rubio as he's probably the best backup PG in the league and provides the veteran leadership this tram needs.  &gt; Also do you guys like all the 6'10+ guys you have? What do you think of Lauri and starting at the 3spot?  I dislike Kevin Love because he's bad bit to his credit he played well against Atlanta. Tacko Fall is fun but also very bad.  Lauri has surprisingly done pretty well at the 3 spot. In certain situations the lineup has been very affective. However, whenever we swap out one of Mobley, Allen or Lauri with Love, it falls apart.   &gt; Ps why the F is love still here?  We're not going to buy him out unless it's a significant discount. So that won't happen. And no one wants him until next year when he's a valuable expiring before an excellent free agent class."
Dylan Windler because he gets hurt every time the wind blows
Dylan Windler from 2019 finally gonna break out this year
michael kidd gilchrist is older than buddy hield by about 2 1/2 months  andre drummond and malcom brogdon are also the same   dylan windler and sekou doumboya despite being i the same draft class are about 5 years apart
This dude is what I thought our Dylan Windler was gonna be. Too bad our guy seems to be afraid to take shots.
"Have tickets to the game and was lookin forward to seeing all these guys in person.  Denzel Valentine, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler just don’t hit the same.   Tacko getting 20 minutes should be fun I guess"
"I’ll go with my hottest take, Dylan Windler should either be the Cavs starting sf or be playing close to 30 minutes a night at the very least"
"Evan Mobley, Jarret Allen, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Dylan Windler, Issac Okoro, and Cedi Osman (For now)."
The Dylan Windler Show
"He's not good. His value is in being a high energy guy. His skill set along with his size doesnt make him a fit on a good, deep NBA roster. Our wing depth is just that weak right now. Okoro is hurt, and a bit undersized when he is out there. Cedi Osman just got a DNP-CD in *favor* of Lamar Stevens, Denzel Valentine was our big wing free agent signing and he can't seem to crack our lineup, and Dylan Windler is a total question mark who's just getting back from his third injury stint in as many years.   Were not starting Markkanen just to be quirky. It's a necessity thing too."
"fr what did cedi, dylan windler and dean wade do to not warrant minutes"
