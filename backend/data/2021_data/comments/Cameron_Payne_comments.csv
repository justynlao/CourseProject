Why does Cameron Payne look like Sid from Ice Age
No one can convince me Cameron Payne isn't Lou Will's long lost son
Raps legend Cameron Payne
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"
"It's weird that the guy who constantly swings wildly at people with no regard for what he hits when whining for fouls isn't know for being dirty...  I guess slapping Patrick Beverley, throwing am elbow at Meyers Leonard, slapping Cameron Payne, shoulder barging Enes Kanter when he had a separated shoulder, shoulder barging Markieff Morris doesn't count. Sure as shit makes for a longer video than Isaiah Stewart who's been branded dirty already by some."
Calling it now. This game is going to be forever remembered as the Cameron Payne game. 28 points incoming.
Agreed. AD is def chicken an egg situation. I can’t think of anyone with really bad posture who is in the nba. Towards the latter part of Kobe’s career his posture became worse and worse. The only active player I know right now who kind of looks like he has bad posture is Cameron Payne. He’s been injured quite a few times already. Usually players with bad posture don’t stay around the league for a long time. Karl Anthony Towns is another player who has pretty bad neck posture possibly from sitting down and gaming a lot. He has he some injuries as well. I don’t expect players with bad posture to be able to stick around for a long time.
"I wasn't a fan of the Payne pick at all but if i remember correctly OKC were very keen on Booker so it threw a spanner in the works when he was taken at 13 by the Suns.   Also in hindsight the Cameron Payne pick isn't as bad as it looked at the time, realistically who was drafted after him that you would take other than Normal Powell and Terry Rozier?"
Jokic did not slap Cameron Payne. That shit was fucking a flop so get that shit out of here
"As a Thunder fan I’ve said for years he is not a winning player. He’s a great talent but when it matters most he will hurt your chances of winning. When he was here with KD I NEVER thought we actually had a chance to win it all because of Russ. I knew off their talent alone we’d get close, but if the second guy is making decisions like that, I knew we weren’t truly a championship team. We had more problems than just Russ but Russ as the main ball handler will never work. We fucked up massively by not keeping Harden instead, no coincidence the year we go to the Finals Harden was the main ball handler in the 4th. He was supposed to be the PG eventually.   I’ve seen the exact same shit about Russ back then that I see today. The problems have been there for years. Every year I’d hope Russ will improve his decision making and shot but he doesn’t. I remember when we drafted fucking Cameron Payne at 14 I wanted him to take the PG spot."
"Him and Bulls legend Cameron ""Tank Commander"" Payne can tussle again."
"Clearly was worth more to keep him than Caruso. A lot of people here willing to spend others money but at the end of the day, Caruso got fucking cooked by Cameron Payne repeatedly in the first round…"
"""Cameron Payne misses everything""  Fucking savage"
"lol thanks, a lot of these Lakers are always fucking ridiculous with their NBA takes and like to shit on other teams/deflect criticism when things aren't going perfectly for the Lakers. Like in my opinion, the Suns have just about everything you need in highly-seeded playoff team, a PG that can run an offense and hit shots in the clutch (CP3), a true three level scorer (DBook), multiple wings and forwards who can play defense and stretch the defense on the offensive side of the ball (Mikal, Jae Crowder, Cameron Johnson, Saric), a good two way center (Ayton), and overall good depth in for Guards and Centers (Payne, Elfrid Payton, Javale, Frank the Tank). You can just tell this team has pieces and chemistry to make another deep run in the playoffs if their core guys are able to stay healthy when it matters most."
"What you’re missing is the context of Jokic whacking the Heat in the paint multiple times in the game. Along with what actually led up to the Morris foul, which was when Jokic slid his legs under a jumping Bam causing Bam to land in him and fall.   Morris for sure came in with a hard foul I assume in defense of Bam which was still on the ground but Jokic over reacted. It’s not the first time, ask Cameron Payne.   You say your a Heat fan and maybe you are but your response shouts stat reader/next day highlight watcher. Anyone that actually watched the game knows Jokic was clearly in the wrong here."
"Are you slow?  I literally explained the T-Ross thing. Jokic got socked in the head, no call, he commits a foul on T-Ross. It was a non-issue. There was literally no brawl. Jokic fouls him and immediately goes to the ref, it was to ge the refs attention, and had nothing to do with Ross or trying to make a dirty play. [Here’s the video. ](https://youtu.be/1bQgHLt59NM)  So you're the one who's lying.   Cameron Payne, as I said that was reckless. So that's the only one.   On the other hand, [here’s a ten minute video of Morris twins fighting and making dirty plays, including Markieff going at his fucking teammates. ](https://youtu.be/5C1ZbubJmdE)  Enough proof?  So please shut the fuck up, you're full of shit."
"There's the Cameron Payne incident and the Kanter one which are both bad looks for Jokic. He's also gotten into it with Westbrook, Beverly, Dwight, Jae Crowder, and Meyers Leonard, but he was mostly responding to an altercation against those players."
Unless your name is Cameron Payne and you had your face broken by Jokic.  Then you can safely hate Jokic regardless
"It’s like everyone forgets the MVP is a bitch too. Not saying Morris is in the right, but if Jokic can slap Cameron Payne up and try to take out Kanters shoulder, he can take a few shots himself."
"What is my idea? I haven't given an idea. My idea would be equal if anything. If Morris deserves a suspension of 1 game, then give them both 1 game. It makes no sense to give Jokic 0 games though when he likely did more damage between the two of them.  That's fine and he should be prepared for consequences. Not giving him any consequences incentivizes that he always reacts this way. Imagine Cameron Payne punched him in the face after his cheap shot in the playoffs and Jokic got suspended and Payne didn't."
"Jokic [recklessly swung at a player](https://streamable.com/c3rgac) as hard as he could out of frustration, and he hit the player in the face.  He [literally admitted](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31627687/denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic-ejected-flagrant-2-foul-hard-swipe-phoenix-suns-cameron-payne) after the game that intended to make a hard foul: ""I wanted to change the rhythm of the game, I wanted to give us some energy, maybe change the whistle a little bit, so I wanted to make a hard foul."""

"You're right, but that's what makes it doubly irritating especially for someone like Jokic.  The guy is *literally* an MVP of the league and he still has to fight with the referees for fair treatment and when he's met with instances like this where he's taking what many would deem to be a dirty shot where Morris body checks him and takes an elbow to the ribs (which only looks minor because of his size compared to a [worst outcome of Horry body checking Nash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs147_VdQXs)), it would've most likely been called only a common foul if Jokic didn't escalate the situation.  So while many would say Jokic needs to check his temper, the other teams have learned they can bait him to try to get him out of the game. It's essentially what led up to [Jokic getting ejected against the Suns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cHgNBxvhSM) when he thought he was fouled and got nothing called so he made it a point to foul Cameron Payne, which crossed the line."
"Did Cameron Payne take a cheap shot at him, It’s not an overreaction Jokic takes hard take fouls all the time. Constantly winds up his arms and hits players he does it a ton it’s just not perceived as dirty but he does it constantly."
"Yeah, his season literally ended last year on him throwing a temper tantrum and cheap shorting Cameron Payne. That was only 10 games ago.   He will probably get off somewhat light this time, but he’s starting to enter the repeat offender zone and might start getting harsher suspensions like Ron Artest would get in his prime."
People defended the Cameron Payne play too
"He [literally admitted](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31627687/denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic-ejected-flagrant-2-foul-hard-swipe-phoenix-suns-cameron-payne) after the game that intended to make a hard foul: ""I wanted to change the rhythm of the game, I wanted to give us some energy, maybe change the whistle a little bit, so I wanted to make a hard foul."""
"He's had frustration fouls where he takes out his anger on players who did nothing to him, like Cameron Payne last year"
Wasn't that what he tried doing with Cameron Payne?
Cameron Payne but I still loved when he was the Tankmaster for the Bulls
"I'm not a huge fan of the 3s that Curry is taking with the Cameron Payne shooting form, he and the team are so fun to watch tho"
"I mean Cam Payne (before his rookie contract was up) was traded for Taj Gibson, Doug mcbuckets and a 2nd round pick (I believe it became Mitchell Robinson). OKC then traded Kanter, Mcbuckets, and the 2nd pick for Carmelo Anthony. They then traded Anthony and a top 14 2022 protected pick for Dennis Schroeder. Dennis then got shipped to the Lakers for Danny Green, a first that became Jaden McDaniels I believe. OKC then packaged that pick to Minasota for pick 16 of the 2020 NBA draft to pick none other than Aleksej Pokusevski. So in the end I think the Thunder got their guy!  Also, at least Cameron Payne figured it out and is a role player in the NBA.  A D.  On your report carddoesn't bring your GPA down to a 1.0 if you have all A's."
Cameron Payne a big missing piece
"Are you referring to the RAPTOR stat? That states Kyle Lowry was -1.1 even though he's known was a good defender. LeBron James was +.6 even though he was considered coasting on defense last season. Luka was -0.8 and no one would say he's a better defender than Lowry and be taken seriously. Jrue Holiday was +1.1. Derrick Rose, Cameron Payne and Raul Neto are all better defenders than him by this metric.  This is why advanced stats aren't the end all be all. They're usually only useful for comparing people on the same team. Which is why Sexton being -0.5 and Garland being -3.0 so far this season is significant. Within their own team, Garland drags the defense down much more. Defenses are way more about teams than individual players. Which is why usually most people on a good defensive team even the bad defenders have good defensive advanced stats number."
These same dudes got cooked by Cameron Payne in the playoffs.
i haven’t watched the suns much this year but how tf is cameron payne getting real minutes on a contender
Cameron Payne is hands down one of the most interesting looking people in the NBA today
Does cameron payne look like a bat??
Cameron Payne
"Cameron Payne, he’s been legit one of the best backup point guards since the bubble."
"Cameron Payne easily. He was the highest pick we had in years and was expected to provide much needed shooting, playmaking, and scoring because the thunder had none of those after KD and Russ. If he was the player the team expected him to be he could’ve been a game changer in 2016 or a trade asset to acquire someone who could’ve been a game changer. It also hurts that we were one pick away from booker."
&gt; Like Lebron wants to play second fiddle to ~~Dbook Mikal Bridges~~ Cameron Payne
"Probably Cameron Payne and Torrey Craig. Suns have a decent 9-man rotation, their 10th man is where the next tier down begins."
Gotta go back 7 years for context but the Bulls traded picks that became Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic to draft Doug McDermott then traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne
Here's a list of Prestis first round picks   Player | Pick # ---|--- kevin Durant| 2nd Russell westbrook | 4th serge ibaka | 24th James Harden | 3rd rodrigue beaubois | 25th eric bledsoe | 18th craig brackins | 21st quincy pondexter | 26th reggie Jackson | 24th perry jones | 28th Steven Adams | 12th archie goodwin | 29th alex abrines | 32nd mitch mcgary | 21st josh huestis | 29th Cameron Payne | 14th Terrence ferguson | 21st Brandon Clark | 21st Immanuel Quickley | 25th
GM who drafted Cole Aldrichx Mitch Mcgary and Cameron Payne
"&gt; Same GM also drafted Mitch McGary, Cameron Payne, T Ferguson  The same GM who has not hit on a first rounder since Steven Adams in 2013. Ferguson is the best player he has drafted since."
"I feel like for Mitch McGary he had potential but he literally just failed drug tests constantly. Dakari Johnson might have been good when small lineups weren't a thing but he was basically useless in the time he was drafted.   Cameron Payne has had a nice enough career to at least be on a roster. The rest like Aldrich, Jones, Ferguson, Abrines and Huestis are all busts but you're asking for that with low draft picks. In my eyes at least Ferguson was a good enough replacement while Roberson was hurt and before Dort got there."
"Same GM also drafted Mitch McGary, Cameron Payne, T Ferguson"
"Presti also picked Jeff Green, Cole Aldrich, Perry Jones, Mitch McGarry, Cameron Payne, Josh Huestis, Alex Abrines, Terrance Ferguson and Dakari Johnson.  So, there's that."
"Shit, forgot about him. Umm it still probably isn’t that big of a disparity between the two teams when we have CP3, Crowder, Dario, Torrey Craig has like 30 games of playoff experience, goddamn Cameron Payne has probably been in the playoffs with the Thunder."
"2015 was even worse, KD got hurt yeah, but Westbrook missed 15 games too, Jackson was hurt before he was traded, I remember vividly they had games where they started Sebastian Telfair and had to play Nick Collison some min at the 3 because they were so short handed. And yeah despite that they still won 45 and missed the plyoffs by one game, they could've used that year to tank, they didn't, missed the playoffs and got Cameron Payne lol"
"Terrence Ross is the guy I had in mind, but yeah those guys for sure, along with that Niang dude in Utah, and I certainly haven't forgotten The Cameron Payne Game"
right. but books playmaking was more than enough last year. if they had even an average backup pg i guarantee they woulda had a winning record. theres a reason that cameron payne breaking out for them had such a massive effect on their record. a guy like him or even just an ish smith or whatever from the beginning of the season woulda done wonders for their roster when rubio and book were on the bench
Is Cameron Payne the best player in the NBA?
Who the hell overrates Cameron Payne lol
How did Cameron Payne end up on this list lol
Lmao Cameron Payne? Who even talks about him
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
most players lol. did you see cameron payne locking him down in the playoffs?  i know he's on a bad ankle but still

"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
That actually would've given the Suns a better chance. CP3 gets suspended for the rest of the series and the Suns play more Cameron Payne

Probably not a good sign if the Suns are hanging their title hopes on Cameron Payne baseline ISOs
Lmao why are the Suns running their offense through Cameron fucking Payne?
Isn't that move Cameron Payne just pulled going to be an offensive foul with the next year's rule change? It's not a basketball move to slow down in the backcourt and reverse direction with no one in front of you.
Lmaoo Cameron Payne really playing in Giannis shoes
Should be an offensive foul on Cameron Payne for running into Giannis.
Cameron payne loves getting manhandled 😩
I wonder if Cameron Payne falls down when a fly lands on him too?

Reports say Covid was dancing with Cameron Payne pre-game
"No, nothing beats watching live and creating narrative that's what i've been told  So 30 years from now as an old man i will say that Cameron Payne as a back up was way better than some trash ass MVP kid in 2051, old school &gt; new school  Also in my time people fought 1v1 in court and brought machine guns"
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
dude look at Cameron Payne dribble the ball. That mfr would be chewed off the court in any other league. My man can't dribble the ball without carrying like wtf how the hell did it ever get so bad.  I know most other players do it on crossovers and occasionaly but looking him play I don't think he can even dribble the normally anymore. Take ANY highlight of his from the playoffs where he isn't shooting a spot up three and there is a 95% chance he is carrying.
Finally this is my chance for upvotes!  I hate the Suns. CP3 is a dirty little bitch. Devin Booker is a sore loser. Cameron Payne has a manky ass looking face and I hate his Beverley-like energy. Jake Rowder is a testy little bitch who hates LeBron cause LeBron got mad cause he missed 11/10 open 3s when he played with him in Cleveland. They're only in the finals cause they got lucky with injuries.  Monty and Ayton seem nice though.
Wait. The bucks just took a lead at 70. The score was 69-70. Cameron Payne got fouled. He missed one which means he made 1/2 but the score is now 71-70. Was it an and one?
When did Cameron Payne get like that tho lol. I only remember him from Chicago days
That's a flop by cameron payne lol.  You can see on the replay Connagton didn't touch him  Ball dont lie
How haven't defenders figured out that Cameron Payne is gonna hesitate like that every time he attacks?
cameron payne must be on adderall or speed
Feels like Cameron Payne is good for stepping out of bounds in a JV fashion once a game
Cameron Payne is looking like the Cameron Payne we all know this series
Has Cameron Payne even made a three in the finals?!
Cameron Payne is the only uglier 3pt shooter than Simmons
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
"No, Nate Payne, Cameron Robinsons brother"
Cameron Payne
"...sigh. Fuck no I don't agree with that. If you watch basketball, then eventually you can start to like things about watching basketball. One of the things that I like to do, when watching, is watch guys shoot the ball. They all do it a little different. The way Klay shoots is... so simple. Like you watch him take a three, and you're like, ""Yeah, of course that's how a All-NBA player shoots. His shot makes perfect sense."" None of this Cameron Payne, slope-stanced, haul up one side of his body and chuck it at the hoop shit. Square stance, half a body width of offset to the hoop, and PULL! Anyway, get this shit out of here."
Cameron Payne thought he was going to get the hammer.  He came off both feet and still took the other side.
"cameron payne has goofy form, i like it"
And to think him and Cameron Payne used to be on the Bulls; now they're both in the Finals

"Cameron Payne this year gave me war flashbacks to Aaron Brooks, Ty Lawson, and JJ Barea"
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul  4. Khris Middleton  5. Jrue Holiday  6. De’Andre Ayton  7. Mikal Bridges  8. Brook Lopez  9. Jae Crowder  10. Pat Connaughton  11. Cameron Payne  12. PJ Tucker
"The Suns will:  CP3 either, decline his PO and sign him to a 3 year deal, or accept his PO and sign him to a much smaller 2 year extension. That'll be the end for CP3.  Booker is already signed on for 3 years, no sign he wouldn't further extend.  Ayton has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 35 Mil per year.  Crowder has 2 more years left, on a MLE deal. I would expect a much smaller pay packet to extend him further than that for another 3 years with bird rights, that gets him to 36 years old. So 5 years total.  Saric, has 2 years on his deal... but this is a real unknown, he's now out next season as backup centre. He is also going to be coming back from major injury so I'll hold off on any further contracts. Suns have applied for a disabled player exception for next season, 4.5mil. I would expect to see the Suns sign JaVale McGee to fill that spot. The one thing the Suns lacked was that one extra ""BIG"".  Bridges has 1 more year on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 years 20 Mil per year.  Jalen Smith has 3 years left on his rookie deal, I would expect him to hang around for the duration of that as the 3rd string centre. Depending how he develops will decide whether he stays longer.  Cameron Johnson has 2 years left on his rookie deal, but I would expect him to sign an extension and not enter free agency. Maybe 5 year 15 Mil per year.  Jevon Carter has 2 years left on an early bird, currently not getting time as a 3rd string, maybe that'll Change next year.  Now the unknowns, I see the Suns chucking Payne a 3 year 15mil total deal. Other teams will offer more, but the Suns will be reigning Champions... so what will he decide...  Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, Craig and Nader will probably get some 1 year minimums.  Ty-Shon will get another 2 way deal next year.  I don't know what the Suns will do with their only draft pick. But it'll be pretty tradeable.   The Suns will basically have the same team for 3 years, maybe changing a couple 3rd string guys adding one more centre like JaVale. Then for the next 3 years still have a core of Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Johnson, Crowder, with unknowns being Starting PG, and some backups."
"Cameron Payne, that’s his name"
"Payne? As in Cameron Payne, or someone else I don't remember exists?"
Jrue is absolutely horrendous. Mans is worse than reggie Jackson and Cameron payne. Middleton is also God awful. Having one good game every 3 weeks doesnt excuse his terrible performances. Both of them deserve to be kicked off the Olympic team after playing this horrible for the entirety of these playoffs
Did you not see Cameron Payne run into brook Lopez and brook Lopez get a foul call??!
get ready to say NBA Champion Cameron Payne boys
Cameron Payne picking up all flopping and little tricks from Chris Paul… 🤣
Defensive stopper Cameron Payne
"Mikal Bridges, Cameron Payne. That’s it."
Cameron Payne got a real goofy looking shot form.
Cameron Payne looks like Sid from Ice Age
Whenever Cameron Payne does these weird ass moving 3s I can tell shit ain’t going in. Looking like me at the rec
Cameron Payne looks like he's revving a chainsaw in the air when he shoots
Im a rockets fan dumbass I def was paying more attention to the Rockets than you were  Eric Gordon was cold but he was not the guy that the Warriors gameplanned for that series. That was Harden and CP3  This has the same energy as the morons that were calling for Cameron Payne to start over CP3 during the Clippers series
Cameron Payne is a great example. This is his 3rd team already?
"The issue with trapping CP3 and/or Book is that they can get the ball out to their other backcourt partner, which will end up being CP3, Book or Cameron Payne.   Every member of the Suns backcourt rotation is smart enough and quick enough to make a decision in the 4 on 3 at that point. It’s a core tenet of Monty’s offensive scheme. The Nuggets attempted trapping Chris and Book and it ended awfully for them.   Of course Jrue and PJ are much more pesky and defensively sound than Denver’s backcourt, but it’s very high risk to try and trap a Suns ball-handler."
Cameron Payne
"No way they let Cameron Payne walk. He’s way to important to their offense. As great as Torrey Craig had been for them, he’s the one they’ll let walk between the two."
"People downvoting you but I'm laughing my ass off.   ""OH HERE COMES IT, DRIVING INTO THE PAINT, THE EUROSTEP - OH, blocked by Cameron Payne!""  ""Yeah, IT gotta know his strengths, he can't just attack the rim against someone with Cam Payne's size protecting the basket."""
TL;DR   1. Reggie Jackson  2. John Collins   3. Blake Griffin  4. Cameron Payne  5. Austin Rivers
"&gt;Kaminsky   Nope. Just more minutes to Torrey Craig, Cam Johnson and Cameron Payne which the Suns are fine with. They adjusted on the fly in Game 1 and it was pretty seamless."
Nah I would take Cameron Payne over him so 629th
"Devin Booker, Kelly Oubre, and Monty Williams changed the whole c u l t u r e to be about the   #VALLEY BOIZ   And after the Bubble gave the team a lot of hope for Mikal Bridges, and Cameron Payne earned a spot on a roster, it was time to trade for another star and become a playoff team, so they traded for Chris Paul and played good team basketball to make it to the finals 2 years after just going 19-63"
"also, the disrespect for Cameron Payne smh"
"""It's gonna be completely nuts, but it's also gonna be awesome,"" Monty Williams said. ""The whole city's gonna be behind us. We're gonna be on SportsCenter every night. If we lose, it's gonna be the end of the world. If we win, it's gonna be wild. But no matter what, it's gonna be fun.""  And so, Williams went outside and sat by the desert while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, we got Cameron Payne on our team,'"" he said. ""'The best player in the world is a Phoenix Sun.'"""
"When the Phoenix Suns made the NBA Finals, we knew CP will grace us with an amazing performance.  Cameron Payne is the man !"
"Friendly reminder that the suns are paying Cameron Payne 1 million less than the bucks are paying Thanasis  Cameron Payne averaged 18 minutes, 8 points, and 2 rebounds a game this season  Thanasis is averaging 9 minutes, 3 points and 2.4 rebounds"
The real CP has arrived. Cameron Payne
Cameron “Leandro Barbosa” Payne
"The suns have an empty injury report, meanwhile the Bucks best player is playing on a torn ligament  Even when Chris Paul went out, Cameron Payne lit up the clippers for 27 points, 9 assists and no turnovers  So maybe it’s time for teams to start building from the bench up? 🤔"
People were saying Cameron Payne is better than Chris Paul lol
"How are the Suns up? They're playing like hot trash, and can you really afford to playing freaking Cameron Payne in the Finals?"
Cameron Payne shoots diagonally
Cameron Payne has such an ugly jump shot but every shot looks nice when it goes in the basket lol
Cameron Payne has the ugliest shot I’ve ever seen
Cameron Payne proves you can recover from dabbing.
Cameron Payne what a story lol
That Cameron Payne shooting motion is odd
bulls legend Cameron Payne
NBA champion Cameron Payne doesn’t seem right
it would be crazy if cameron payne does it waived like a year ago to finals mvp.
Cameron Payne FMVP odds: 100-1  Ez money!
i distinctly remember a few years ago reading people say that cameron payne was the worst player in th NBA.....when he played for OKC  amazing to see his growth.
I submit that guys like Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne are not currently on good contracts because they're both about to end. A big part of what makes Dort's contract so good is that he has to stay on it for the next two seasons. A big part of what makes a contract good or bad is not just the money but also the years.
"I half like the suns  I like Ayton, Monty, Book, Bridges but at the same time fuck Chris Paul dirty ass, Jae Crowder fake tough guy, and Oscar award nominee Cameron Payne"
Such Disrespect to Cameron Payne
C'mon man Cameron Payne would win over Killian Hayes
"And upvote informative, flawless takes like 'Bench CP3 for Cameron Payne'"
"Cameron Payne, Reggie Jackson, Dennis Schroder"
1. Chris Paul  2. Cameron Payne  3. Jevon Carter
Lmao imagine being hyped to see Cameron Payne touch a basketball
The Cameron Payne impact.
&gt; Is that Cameron Paynes music?  As we a Bulls fans called it..  The Cam-Payne Cam-paign
"You mean Cameron ""Laker Killer"" Payne?"
Cameron Payne is better right now
It's time for Cameron Payne to lead us to the promised land.
Cameron Payne was the true CP all along...
Cameron Payne legacy game/series incoming.
Shawn Michaels’ music starts… Vince McMahon looks up to the rafters “OH MY GOD ITS CAMERON PAYNE!! THATSAHUNDREDFEETINTHEAIR!!!”  Cameron Payne is dancing to the music as he is lowered down to the court.   https://youtu.be/N5mxCv-4dF0
sources says Cameron Payne is shooting 100000 mid range jumpers in preparation.
WTH is this theme about? Tell me about Cameron Payne.
That's Laker Slayer Cameron Payne to you.
Back when Cameron Payne was the worst player in the nba and semaj Christianson ran the second unit
The Jokic is on me. I’m Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne would have been ejected instead for blocking Bron's bicep and unsportsmanly-like keeping the ball from LeBron
I’ll trade one Cameron Payne for Mr Luka
Cameron Payne
"I can't believe you just wrote ""Harden, Durant, PG, Cameron Payne""  Like...  (P.S. we literally have evidence with Washington that Westbrook's contributions do in fact lead to success.)"
Pg had best season of his career with russ before he choked in playoffs. Houston was unnstopable before russ injury last year. Russ made playoff with so much worse okc you cant even imagine. Cp had shai as second option while russ had like andre roberson. Cameron payne was out of the league for a reason. He was worst player in the league before russ and with russ. Durant literally won MVP with russ
[When I saw Cameron Payne enter the frame:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybuXvTQGmu0)
Unless you're Cameron Payne.
"Ayton is the biggest surprise for me, definitely acquitted himself well and has been exactly what the Suns needed.   Reggie Jackson also went from last guy on the bench to a pretty important player for the Clippers and is one of the reasons they are still alive in the playoffs.   And last but not least is Cameron Payne, what a story.  Really helped steady Phoenix when cp3 was hurting against LA"
Cameron Payne
"""Cameron Payne... I mean Nikola Jokic... Oh, I've just been informed that was Chris Paul who made the shot. Good shot."""
"No one simply dances in front of Cameron, of the house Payne without being properly challenged"
Yeah. Why are they cheering for Cameron Payne???
"Cam Payne. His form unorthodox but he’s a dog. Attacking bigs in the pick &amp; roll, shooting 40+% from 3. He’s not afraid of the moment. My pops called him the guy who be dancing with Westbrook before now he’s like “Cameron Payne was a good pickup for the Suns”"
"It doesn’t seem fair to judge someone’s character on the fact that he gets angry and has frustration fouls. Also, he apologized to Cameron Payne before he left the court. It’s impossible to determine intent, but it seems he apologized because he didn’t intend to hurt anyone. Anyway, I think he’s a good dude. I’m not a nuggets fan, but hope he has success, like winning a championship."
"You think that's bad? My daughter literally asked me ""is Cameron Payne going to die?"". How do you think it feels explaining to your 3 year old that they've likely witnessed the end of a man's life?"
Jokic literally took Cameron Payne out back and shot him. He fucking shot him.
"This is all jokic's fault though. Jokic has a deep history of throwing tantrums after missed calls/calls he didnt like, and this is a textbook example. While Cameron payne did flop a little bit, thats just the scrappy shit you do in the playoffs especially. Booker didnt deserve the tech, since he was just sticking up for his teammate and there was not conact between the two. Jokic getting a flagrant 2 is questionable, but it does fit the description of a flagrant 2."
The Oscar goes to Cameron Payne. Should have been F1 but Oscar winning moment of Payne seal the deal.
DANCE ON EM CAMERON PAYNE
"Batman couldn't kill the Joker, but Cameron Payne and Co. did."
Yeah but it was only Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne looks like Sid from Ice age
Cameron Payne is the worst. He’s like the fifth member of *NSYNC.
"So, I just bumped into former Chicago Bull Cameron Payne at Barnes &amp; Noble in Asheville, NC. I was walking past, and noticed it was him, and said:  Me: ""I think I know you"".  Cam: Looking at a book ""Heh"".  Me: ""Sorry for being starstruck, I've been watching you since I was a kid""  Cam: ""No problem man"" Holds out hand  Me: I shake his hand, nod, and walk away, feeling kind of awkward for having approached him  Flash forward 20 minutes or so, I'm in the bathroom, I go to wash my hands and the stall door opens up. I look up and see Cam standing there like: 0_0  Me: Laughing ""I promise I didn't follow you in here!""  Cam:""...alright...""  Cam: walks over to wash his hands ""You know, there's a life story in here somewhere..""  I look up and see him grinning at me in the mirror reflection  Cam: ""..even childhood heroes have to poop.."" He pats me on the back and walks out  Dead serious, true story, happened not less than an hour ago."
Is it just me or did anyone else find it hilarious that the cameras were zooming in on Cameron Payne who looked dead and all you could hear was MVP MVP MVP
Nuggets fans hate it. Old School NBA fans hate it.  Suns fans want him kicked out of the league. Cameron Payne haters want the foul on Payne for flopping. Regular fans who have no affiliation wanted it to be a 1 but understand the 2.
"That was not done on purpose by Giannis, he was just positioning himself for the rebound. Just bad luck. And Jokic should have been a flagrant 1. He made a play for the ball, Cameron Payne just a little bitch taking acting lessons from diva Chris Paul"
"I met Cameron Payne at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that).  Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit.  “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?”  Then out of nowhere Cameron Payne shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.”  And I (being a big fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.”  Cameron was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Cameron Payne and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents."
how else do you get it out of the powerful hands of cameron payne
"“There was a wind up of the face, and follow-through. Cameron Payne has been ejected”"
"lmao actor of the year, cameron payne"
I strongly dislike Cameron Payne
I know they teammates and all but I’m not getting in a fight over no Cameron fucking payne
Dude you have a Cameron Payne flair lol
"As a soccer fan this reminded me of Zidane, except that'd be if this was the last minute of the NBA Finals, Jokic was about to retire, and he literally punched Cameron Payne in the face. Still, crazy stuff."
"Cameron ""In"" Payne"
The fan on the TNT stream is letting it rip into Cameron Payne lol...but why? He didn't eject Jokic
Cameron Payne is a bitch
They talkin shit to Cameron Payne now.
"hahaha anyone hear that guy yelling at payne  ""GROW UP CAMERON"" lmfaoo I love that harmless type of banter"
"Fully deserved. I love Jokic, but that shit was weak as fuck. Play the game or go home. Don't take it out on fucking Cameron Payne of all people."
Cameron “feeling the” Payne
Cameron Payne is a fucking pussy
CAMERON PAYNE IS THE GOAT
Suns signed Cameron Payne for that moment
"He definitely got fouled. But that was dramatic, pathetic and soft by Cameron Payne."
Why would you haymaker Cameron Payne lmao
Cameron Payne is a really good actor
Cameron “Neymar” Payne. Stand the fuck up
"Cameron Payne used to be Westbrook's hype man and cheerleader in Oklahoma. I guess Phoenix is the only team, that know how to utilise him in the regular season"
Cameron Jebediah Payne
Cameron of Payne
"The problem I have here is you're looking at each move individually, panning them for being 'bad', and ignoring the result of those decisions.    &gt; he gave up TJ Warren for nothing  He gave up TJ Warren for cap space and used that to pick up Ricky Rubio.  Rubio was a massive upgrade over our past PG rotation and it wouldn't have happened without the TJ Warren trade.  Ricky Rubio was very good for the Suns.  &gt; The Cam pick is so overrated. He reached for no reason to get an off the bench rotation player. Cam would have been available in the 20s or later.  Cam Johnson plays off the bench, sure.  For one of the top teams in the league, in the playoffs, against top tier opponents.  Also, that trade back from 6 brought in Dario Saric, who, apart from the few weeks after he had Covid, has been one of our most important, and impactful, bench players.    &gt; And he traded a FRP (ended up being Desmond Bane) for 1 year of an aging Aron Baynes.  Aron Baynes played great basketball under heavy minutes in replacement for a suspended DeAndre Ayton.  We literally do not make the play in tournament without him.  You're also leaving out a few key pieces of this whole thing.  The first being the trade for Kelly Oubre.  Kelly Oubre immediately improved our locker room culture.  The entire ""Valley Boys"" brand and mentality stems from Kelly Oubre.  Secondly, he brought in Cameron Payne from the Chinese league just before the bubble.  Cameron Payne has been our best bench player in a group of guys that all contribute when they get minutes.  Finally, Monty Williams, enough said.  &gt; one trade that he lucked into imo bc CP3 wanted to play with the core that Jones had no part in drafting, and Crowder signed bc of CP3.  You think CP3 wanted to come to Phoenix without this team going 8-0 in the bubble and without Monty Williams as our coach?  He doesn't.  Give credit where credit is due, CP3 wanted to be here as a direct result of the improved culture, coaching, and play.  All of which were the effects of James Jone's actions.  If the moves James Jones made notably improved the quality of our team, they were not bad moves."
"Westbrook, KD, Ibaka, Nick Collison, Adams, Cameron Payne, Kanter, Roberson... that's all I got. Maybe Semaj/Huestis idk"
What? Have you watched cameron payne and jordan clarckson play? That's the furthest thing away from fundamental basketball. They  are shooting some of the wildest shots in nba.
CAMERON PAYNE
Halliburton plays as a 2 guard /wing alongside DeAaron Fox who's the point guard.... no reason the same couldn't have happened with Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne is excellent at the basket ball
CAMERON PAYNE
Cameron Payne has came a long way from one of the rat children of Pakistan to stepping up big for the suns this playoffs
50% Cameron Payne
u/erantien Cameron Payne is still in the playoffs and Luka isn’t. Cam Payne &gt; Luka
Cameron Payne
"Same, I know we were a long shot but we also had no business being as good as we were up until the bubble. Now that Russ is eliminated I’m pulling hard for the other great Thunder PG: Cameron Payne."
Can't forget about Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne is the greatest sun to live
Dont think cameron payne has ever committed a foul all his life.  FUCK THE REFS
I wish I was as confident as Cameron Payne
CP3 finished 5th in MVP voting to play worse than Cameron Payne in the playoffs 👀
Was that Lil Dickey with Cameron Payne?
Cameron Payne is a clown
cameron payne got a lot taller and lighter
"The Chris Paul factor in Phoenix is so sick. It allows Phoenix to feel so *complete*, and that every role needed on the court is fulfilled.  But my favorite thing about them is that, when Chris Paul subs out for Cameron Payne, the whole team's offensive structure changes accordingly. Chris Paul's offense is very methodical; watching for cuts, screening and rolling, crashing the paint and passing out. Cameron Payne speeds everything up; lots of swinging passes, lots of live dribble passes, transition 3s, etc. And it's not just Paul/Payne; it's the whole team, all at the same time.  Phoenix is special. They're my pick out of the West."
"I can support this, plus we have future MVP in Cameron Payne"
Cameron Payne&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clarkson
Does it really matter what they were. With us Portis is a really good 6th man and Bryn Forbes is a great shooter. Both probably getting paid in the off season.  Cameron Payne was playing like a 12th man and now he's a productive backup pg on the Suns.
Cameron Payne too
the timeline in which cameron payne is a contributor on a legit contender is a timeline im glad to be a part of
"When Cameron Payne threw that crazy lob from distance I thought the place exploded, the tv microphones couldn’t handle the eruption"
Cameron Payne against the Lakers
Cameron payne isn't even looking at booker on offense. That's gotta change
Cameron Payne makes some mind-numbing decisions
if cameron payne goes off... game over
If Cameron Payne doesn't average 15 points a game I'm calling my lawyer.
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Bro Cameron Payne just schooled the Lakers, and Johnson is great off the bench."
"Yeah they would be separate transactions. They could offload him to a tanking team and attach picks. Then sign someone with free space. Cameron Payne comes to mind, iirc he’s on the min and a free agent this offseason."
"Terrence Mann, Reggie Jackson, Batum. clippers guys stepped up big   Cameron Payne, PJ Tucker, Gallonari, Kevin Huerter"
"Interesting, in that sense I agree with you on AD. Serious disagreement on how Jokic is not 1A though. He carried that broken nuggets team all the way past the (actually healthy) blazers.   I'd probably put Jimmy butler at 1B, except for last year when he had covid he's put teams entirely on his back during the playoffs.  I would probably drop cp3 at least to 1C if not lower, I think the suns wouldn't have won any of the series they did if their opponents were healthy. Cp3 was an important if overstated cog in a deep team. There were a number of times where you could genuinely put him as the third most important player after ayton and book, which imo pushes him down. I think a big part of why they lost to the bucks was actually not playing Cameron Payne enough to just change the pace they played at, because Milwaukee was just too good a defensive team to allow for that slow paced play. They abused his methodical approach and forced him into a number of uncharacteristic turnovers."
cameron payne could do it easy. Current Melo or Rubio too.
They could win with fucking Cameron Payne instead of KD. LOL
"I mean you called the dude a clown, saying he's talking down to professional athletes when he didn't. Just let people have fun man it ain't that serious.   The same dude also said ""can’t knock him for trying to get his foot back in the door. it worked for Cameron Payne"". Just feel like you overreacted about someone simply saying they were laughing."
Yeah but Cameron Payne still had/has the legitimate skill to contribute at the NBA level. Brandon Knight is just a shell of his former self.
can’t knock him for trying to get his foot back in the door. it worked for Cameron Payne
you could look at it as a momento of the past.  dude put in work and turned it around.  in chicago we had similar experience with cameron payne
The series looked over because Cameron Payne was the Suns point guard in the second halves.
I'm not even sure this guy is a Sixers fan. Seems like a troll account.   He literally asked if you would rather have Ben Simmons or Cameron Payne a month ago
These are his last 15 picks before this draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis Semaj Christon

"Ok cool he isn't better than Curry no qualms there but to say he isn't in the same stratosphere??? Is something you would say about.......idk Frank Campazzo, or Cameron Payne. (off the top w/o thought) believe that Dame is a top 10 player so I would consider that putting him in the same ""stratosphere"".   Again there's levels some are higher echelon than others but Basically to me its just a metaphor for approximating players with comprable talent level or achievement  which imo is any superstar today (or top 10 player)."
Shades of Cameron Payne lol
"It wasn't just those two, there were a bunch of point guards who were available ahead of him: Lowry, Lonzo, Dinwiddie, and even Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne if they'd been willing to move. Schroder tried to play hard ball in a market that was already going to be saturated with players at his position even before Westbrook and Kemba were in play."
"Even if he really wanted to stay in Phoenix his agent still needs to be fired. He was eligible to get the same starting salary with the Suns that Reggie Jackson got with the Clippers, as both teams had early Bird rights on these players. I'm guessing someone else out there probably would have paid Payne more to leave, but even if his main goal was to stay in Phoenix he still could have got significantly more to do so. It's crazy that [Reggie Jackson got $7 million more guaranteed from the Clippers in two years](https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1423694622522478599?s=19) than Cameron Payne got from the Suns for 3 years, especially when Payne is 4 years younger than Jackson is."
"I'm glad that Caruso got that contract. I even wanted the Lakers to match it, and yes I know that then the team would then have to pay some major taxes. I just think that Payne took a very team friendly deal. He showed up for the Suns in some pretty big games this year, and if the Suns don't pick up that last year due to injury or others reasons, Caruso could make almost twice as much as Payne.   Cameron is in his prime, and this could be his last chance at a big contract. If I were him, I wouldn't have signed that contract, especially that team option for the last season for only 2 million.   If I was a fan of the Suns, however, I'd love this deal."
Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott to the Thunder for god damn Cameron Payne. I still get nightmares from Gar/Pax. So glad we’re doing better now
absolutely unreal... dude was a laughingstock and basically out of the league and the total 180 on his image post-Warriors is so complete that the US National team felt comfortable reaching out to him last minute to replace a guy from the squad. unreal  really sometimes is about the team you land on and the opportunities you get. Cameron Payne before the Bubble would have been best known by NBA fans as the scrub on the bench who did all the intricate dances with Russell Westbrook in OKC. in basically 1 year he went from Chinese league player to guaranteed bigtime NBA contract $$$ after getting a shot with the right team and backing up the right guy
"I don't think either of those players were getting 20+ million more than they just signed for. That's what Reggie Jackson could be giving up by re-signing. Plus in the case of Cameron Payne, he'll likely have another opportunity when his new contract is up.  Reggie Jackson was lucky to sign for the minimum and this is his last opportunity for a big contract. He's not getting another one in 3 years.  I just think it's more likely that he didn't end up getting those big offers that people speculated he would get. I think the ""he just wants to play with his friends"" is less relevant."
"&gt; Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas  *screams internally*  &gt; Trading Korver for nothing  This infuriated me to no end because I loved Kyle Korver  &gt; Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne  *actual screaming*  God fucking dammnit we really traded up for Doug, then traded him away before his rookie contract was even up for a bunch of absolute garbage. And we threw in Taj Gibson as well, what the fuck  And as it turns out, it took a while but Cam Payne is actually decent, but we waived him."
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
"Cameron Payne, the dude is hot garbage on the court. We had court side seats when he played in the G-League &amp; my group heckled him off the floor. The fool got benched &amp; was just glaring in our direction. C’mon just improve your game, Rat Fink."

"It would be LeBron, Dean Wade (D-Wade), Cameron Payne (CP), and LaMelo Ball (Melo)."
I read crime penetration as Cameron Payne oh damn my brain
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
Sounds like Dragic may be to Dallas for Powel  but I would prefer Moses Brown for Achiuwa  and Dragic for Cameron Payne
CP3 stole money from Cameron Payne
"I think fans severely overrate Cameron Payne, this is a fair deal."
The guard market has been shockingly tame. GTJ got $16m/year when it’s was assumed he’s was getting $23m/year. Cameron Payne and TJ McConnell also got team friendly contracts.
Is there even a report about that kind of contract being offered to Cameron Payne or are people making assumptions?
Wow. Cameron Payne definitely could have made more elsewhere if he wanted.
Cameron Payne just got 19/3 WTF
This man stole from Cameron Payne lmaoo
Cameron Payne needs to fire his agent and hire Doug McDermott's guys 😂
Especially because we're also talking about Cameron Payne here lol
That’s old cameron payne money lol
"""I've always wanted to fry eggs on any random surface exposed to the sun. living in phoenix, I have those opportunities. Give me six million a year and I'm good!"" - Cameron Payne, probably."
"Where are Spencer Dinwiddie and Reggie Jackson going? Also, doesn't it seem crazy that Schroder could get $20 million when Cameron Payne is apparently only getting $6 million? I'm really amazed that anyone thinks this highly of Schroder."
Cp3 resigns   Simmons gets traded   One of (Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne Lonzo ball Schroeder) Get a BAG and are considered massively overpaid
Bro how you you rate Cameron Payne if he was magic Johnson?
"Will he? Those aren't the only point guards who will be available. Is Schroder considered next up over guys like Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne and Spencer Dinwiddie? I think the market may be very thin for Schroder. But if teams are really targeting him, doesn't that make a sign and trade more likely? I'm not sure which teams want to blow a bunch of cap space on Schroder."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Cooper or butler could be huge for the Suns if they gonna part way with Cameron Payne.
Why did Charlotte draft Cameron Payne??
Lmao I wouldn’t even trade cameron payne for him
"A lot of NBA players, current and former, browse this sub. From the guys I've talked to, Daniel Theis, Goran Dragic, and Cameron Payne I know for a fact are here religiously. Most players actually prefer reddit over other platforms since it lets them remain anonymous. I've heard that Curry is a huge proponent of online privacy."
"But their role players did step up. Cameron Payne and Cam Johnson played great, it’s a shame Cameron Payne didn’t get played more. Granted Jae crowder did go ice cold in some games, but pat connaughton was as well, so suns legitamelly had chances to put all 3 of those games to bed. DeAndre Ayton did have some poor games but he’s playing against a former all star and a back to back league mvp and a Greek demigod"
"not all the time. You want solid players that have certainty too. Not everyone is gonna develop to Kobe, but if not maybe they can be a solid rotation player and come off the bench. Those players are key too. Cameron Payne played solid for the Suns even though he is considered a scrub in this sub."
"The difference is that Suns already had Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, and more importantly - they have shown to the management that they are capable of winning before going all in with CP3 and Crowder. Suns were good enough to be 5/6th in the West with Rubio, but it was CP3 who pushed them into contender status.  In Pelican's case, they have a core of two players who still have to learn to play together and show they can win. Adding a 35-year-old Lowry makes them barely a playoff team with no much room to grow. By year 3, Lowry will be 38 and they'll find themselves without young prospects and not enough meat to make some serious noise.  EDIT: they did get  Valanciunas, and that is a huge plus."
Cameron Payne
So they are targeting Cameron Payne?
"Also when he plays against Lakers. Patty Mills, Gary Trent Jr and most recently Cameron Payne. These dudes gain buffs when they play us."
Cameron Payne or Jalen Brunson are in the discussion. But Morris is damn good.
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
Slander to Cameron payne.
Cameron Payne is 3 years younger lmao
"Slightly off topic but mildly interesting:  - redemption arc Cameron Payne played in zoom freak 1s  - during the regular season, Khris Middleton played in the 'infamous' mambacitas"
He pushed for OKC to draft devin booker and they drafted Cameron Payne instead
"The only time both the Suns and Lakers were healthy, Suns won. Lakers were celebrating winning 2 games against Cameron Payne."
"I just don’t get using turnovers as an argument for Booker &gt; CP3 when Booker’s had the same number or more while not getting the same assists. CP3 had 5 assists and 3 turnovers tonight. Booker had 5 assists and 6 turnovers tonight. Booker also played 46 minutes, most of his team, and was the only player besides Cameron Payne who played 10 to not get a single steal or block. And it’s not like his rebounds made up for it since he got 3.   The reason I feel like CP3’s been better is he can impact the game on more levels so when he struggles on one aspect, he can focus on the others. Booker’s had his moments but for the most part, his game revolves on being able to score."

The preferred timeline to NBA Champion Cameron Payne
Why did Cameron Payne only play 10 minutes?
Did Cameron Payne die? Why did they leave the choker CP3 in the entire 2nd half when Payne was lighting up the 1st?
Cameron Payne is lighting it up in the first half &amp; the Suns don’t go back to him in the 2nd. Horrible coaching.
I don’t feel bad for CP3. He should’ve went to the coach &amp; told him that Cameron Payne needs to start &amp; he’ll come off the bench.
"If Cameron Payne were getting CP3s minutes, Suns would have already won the series in 5."
Cameron Payne Bobby Portis and two brothers of players from the 2018 meme Bulls are out in the finals tonight  2018 Bulls NBA Finals when
If in 2016 you told someone that Cameron Payne and Frank Kaminsky would be getting minutes in a finals series for Phoenix they’d shoot you in the face
No he complains and hits Cameron Payne in the throat
just me or Cameron Payne has a punchable face
Truly astounding that Cameron Payne is getting minutes in a must-win finals game. Good for him
Giannis with a Cameron Payne like performance.
I don't understand why they don't play Cameron Payne like at all. He's got 10 points in 6 minutes and is electric.
Was sold on Giannis FMVP but now I think it’s Cameron Payne
"Honestly, Phoenix isn't playing *that* well. The only player who's at all been above average is Cameron Payne. Paul has been pretty good, but 6/10 with 4 assists isn't really setting the world on fire.  It's just been that the Bucks were straight dookie, outside of Giannis."
bobby portis vs cameron payne please
Shout out to Cameron Payne for keeping the Suns in the game
"CP3 and Book should be playing out of their minds tonight if they want to stay alive, so far it’s been Cameron Payne instead"
There's no way Adam Silver lets the Finals end with a game where the two leading scorers are Cameron Payne and Bobby Portis.
Put Cameron Payne back in leading scorer on the Suns why take him out?
"Giannis is doing well as usual, but Cameron Payne is on fire."
Not before Cameron Payne
Cameron Payne playing like Game 1 DJ Augustin
Everyone on PHX has variations of shit shooting (1 of X)     Then there is Cameron Payne keeping hope alive
they look so sorry rn  EDIT: EXCEPT for Cameron Payne
Why don’t they pass to Giannis with the mismatch on Cameron Payne instead of a running Pat 3? I swear they make me want to punch a tv sometimes
IF Cameron Payne saves the phx szn he deserves finals MVP
House of (Cameron) Payne.
"As we all predicted, Cameron Payne has to carry these plucky upstarts."
"Cameron ""Bring the"" Payne!"
Cameron Payne the better CP?
Cameron Payne outplaying CP3 lol
You have Devin Booker and CP3 and Cameron Payne has to bail you out. Unbelievable
"""Cam Payne"" for Cameron Payne is another basketball one I have actually heard that I don't like."
"Players that are no longer on the team from 2 years ago (not gonna name EVERYONE, just the notables):  Qunicy Acy, Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Dragen Bender, Isiah Canaan. Tyson Chandler. Jamal Crawford. Troy Daniels, Jimmer Freddette, Richaun Holmes, Josh Jackson, Tyler Johnson, TJ Warren  Players that remained on the team:  Deandre Ayton, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges  Players they have acquired since then that are on the team this year:  Cameron Johnson, Chris Paul, Jaw Crowder, Jalen Smith, Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky, Cameron Payne, E'Twuan Moore  I dont know about Monty but James Jones deserves a ton of credit."
CAMERON PAYNE
Suns have Cameron Payne and Cameron Pain
CAMERON “TANK COMMANDER”PAYNE
How in the hell was Cameron Payne -21 in under 10 minutes?
And Cameron Payne
Why exactly is Cameron Payne going 12th?  Overall terrible list
" &gt;	Two defensive centers - Gobert and Ayton.    Really understating how much better Gobert is than Ayton. Guys like mikal bridges and Cameron Payne are inexperienced, while Joe Ingles, Bojan, Derrick Favors, Jordan Clarkson all have experience."
&gt;  6 years ago and haven’t been discussed since and then ask other too disprove it.  It wasn't 6 years ago. It was written in 2007!  &gt;then ask other too disprove it.  You are the one that said it was disproved multiple times though. If you just said you don't know much about it but doubt it I would understand but I really think it holds up.  &gt;One minute you are bringing up Cameron Payne as this big loss and the next the suns have the best bench in the league.  It is both and the Suns bench was even better when Cam was on it. It was really good at absurd high levels but slowly went down as the year progressed but is still number 1 in the league.  &gt;Like either you need him greatly and him being injured is a problem or you don’t need him and him being injured is irrelevant.  He helped a ton and was one of the top reasons the Bubble Suns were so good as well as Suns hot start of the season but after a while the Suns are really deep they learned to adapt.  &gt;Dallas has been missing 4 out of their 5 starters  Dario Saric Missed 17 games this year. That is about the same as Dorian Finley Smith and Josh Richardson have missed combined.  In addition Cam Payne has missed a lot of games and he is one of the most important reasons the Suns have been doing so great this year (their bench). I am not saying the Suns have been hurt as much as the Mavs. I am simply saying Mavs aren't the only ones hurt and it isn't fair the discount the success the Suns have had because their opponents were hurt but they weren't.
Only on Reddit can you bring up some obscure term two journalist discussed 6 years ago and haven’t been discussed since and then ask other too disprove it. Like come on.   Well which one is it? One minute you are bringing up Cameron Payne as this big loss and the next the suns have the best bench in the league. Like either you need him greatly and him being injured is a problem or you don’t need him and him being injured is irrelevant. It can’t be both. The fact that we are even discussing a guy playing back up minutes as a problem when Dallas has been missing 4 out of their 5 starters for more than a third of the seasons is ridiculous.
Which advanced stats do you think Cameron Payne is leading in dude? The guy is playing 17 minutes a game.
Cameron Payne
*Correction to your post: It was Cameron Payne who hit the three that broke the record not Devin Booker.
Cameron Payne is the sixth man that other sixth men aspire to be
"Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a second-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Cameron Payne, Anthony Morrow and Joffrey Lauvergne  Maybe not the worst but I still don't understand it"
Imagine telling people a few years ago that Cameron Payne and Frank Kaminsky would drag a team to the playoffs.
His name isn’t MJichael. It’s Michael. Bad comparisons.  And comparing Cameron Payne to Carmelo isn’t nice.
Is Mike James MJ? Can Cameron Payne be CP3? Is Chris Kaman Meth Curry? Come up with a new nickname
"He did nothing the KD years. Never made any trades or signings. Drafted guys like Mitch McGary, Cameron Payne, and Perry Jones III."
"Oooh, yeah, agreed. Add Cameron Payne, too."
When did Cameron Payne become such a stone-cold killer in the fourth quarter 😂
"to help you out I’ve written something for you that you can just copy &amp; paste;  Dear Moderators,  First off, big fan of your work…if it’s not too much trouble can you please add the player flair ‘Cameron Payne’ to my username.   Thanks in advance.  HeterosexualHunk"
"Really didn’t think the Warriors would have a chance on the second night of a back to back against a full Suns squad. I really love how the Warriors use the Sun’s overplay against Steph against them, back door cuts, fake hand offs, lobs over defenders looking for Steph. Everybody growing up is always taught to keep an eye on the ball and an eye on your man, against the Warriors, you gotta keep an eye out for Steph as well. Damn proud of the Warriors. For the Suns: Devin Booker is a fucking problem, scores at will and near impossible to defend 1 on 1. CP3 did his usual thing too. And wtf, Cameron Payne was killing it too in his reserve minutes.  Only thing I thought sucked for the Suns was Deandre Ayton, I really thought he would punish small ball Warriors and Kevon Looney, but he didn’t really do shit"
He saw Cameron Payne and just proceeded like he was playing the thunder
Cameron Payne
cameron payne

"Never thought I’d say that Cameron Payne would be the best player on a team with Cp3, Booker, and Ayton. He single handedly kept the Suns from this game looking like a massacre with that streak of points"
"Suns shooting just as well as us and Cameron Payne having a season high game, lol"
Everyone asking who is Cameron Payne. The question is *What* is Cameron Payne?
When did Cameron Payne get this good?
And bum of the night goes to Cameron Payne
X_X  Cameron Payne and Torrey Craig killing us a 2nd straight game
Cameron Payne
"If Anthony Edwards and LaMelo ball regress to playing like Kevin Knox and OKC Cameron Payne, sure  Jokes aside it’s always possible but I think Ant and LaMelo have more gifts physically but also have shown more star potential."
"Suns against 76ers...and they win in 6 (remember, we are assuming both the Lakers and Nets don't make the finals, which means we are assuming the Suns probably beat the Lakers en route to the Finals which would be an insane momentum booster for them).   Monty just has too many weapons in his disposal, he can make 3 teams from his roster (those who watch suns games regularly know) , especially his bench who we have seen beat the starters of other teams on numerous occasions on their current 53-18 run from last season's 8-0 run in the bubble!:  Team 1 : Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, DeAndre Ayton  Team 2 : Cameron Payne, Langston Galloway, Cameron Johnson, Torrey Craig, Dario Saric  Team 3 : E'Twaun Moore, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader, Jalen Smith, Frank Kaminsky  The only person among the 15 ppl here who is unproven is the 10th draft pick Jalen Smith who hasn't gotten any burn.   We've seen Team 2 outscore other starting lineups with their 3 pt shooting (3pt percentages = Payne 40.7%, Galloway 45.1%, Johnson 36%, Craig 38.2%, Saric 34.5 %) and defense  And We've seen team team 2 win it as well in pt differential with defense (Carter/Nader) and microwave offense as well (Moore, who's been a 7.9ppg scorer in his CAREER and Kaminsky who had a personal 7-0 run against the clippers just a few days ago).   The Suns haven't been this deep, even dating back to the late 80s and 90s KJ and Barkley teams as well as the SSOL teams. There isn't a drop off whenever the starters leave the court, both on offense and defense. Them sweeping the Jazz and being 27-9 against. 500 and above teams is also a solid indicator of how well they hold up against playoff teams.   I honestly think they have as great a chance as any even if the Lakers were at full strength because of the chemistry and cohesion that hasn't been seen in a Suns team in over a decade worth of basketball... And as u can see, it's not only because Of Chris Paul but because of their really good roster from top to bottom.   Suns will be champions this year, and will win 4 games before losing 4 games against any team in a 7 game SERIES (they haven't lost more than 2 in a row in months... Wc is also testament to Monty and his coaching staff) . GO SUNS!!!"
"Ranking our bench contributors:  1. Cameron Payne  2. Cameron Johnson  3. Dario Saric  4. Torrey Craig  5. Jevon Carter  Wild cards / unlikely to get playing time in the playoffs, but still threats:  1. Langston Galloway  2. Frank Kaminsky  3. Abdel Nader (if he is even healthy by the playoffs)  Payne is the go-to guy when book / cp3 are off the floor. Even when payne shares time with Book, they are 1A / 1B together. He leads our team in buckets near the end of the shot clock, and we sort of trust him to bail us out when nothing's going in.  Cameron Johnson is a guy who's gonna keep shooting no matter what. He could have 3 points on 1 of 9 and still get hot and make any game into a blowout. He's also an underrated defender, rebounder, and has a nice dribble-drive.   Saric has slumped hard for a few months but before that, he was the best backup big man in the entire league, almost averaging 50/40/90 on double digit scoring and elite defense. Those numbers have angrily regressed to the mean unfortunately, but we're all holding out hope that he progresses back somewhat.  Torrey Craig is one of the most valuable bench pieces regardless of scoring. He is maybe second to Ayton in terms of rebounding, aggressively chasing every defensive and offensive rebound. He's one of the few people on this team who can consistently play above the rim and has a trustworthy shot from 3. We never ask him to create but every now and then he will surprise with an end-of-shotclock midrange that goes in.  Jevon Carter is a guy who we've been trying to figure out his role on the team for a bit. He's usually the guy we sic on opposing guards to harass them for 94 feet but his shot has been solidly improving over the last month and a half or so. We've basically allowed him a green light on catch-and-shoot 3s to try and take out the decision making and it's had pretty solid success. He also has an underrated midrange but we don't ever really want him to take multiple in a game unless we're leading by double digits.  Wild cards:  Langston is instant offense. Second fastest slinger in the west behind Curry. When he's in we basically ask him to run the corners, spot up, and pull if he has 2 inches of space on the 3. Sometimes he gets supernova hot and ends up with double digits in 2-4 minutes of game time. He's a defensive liability unfortunately.  Kaminsky is our NONONOYES guy, but that also makes him our NONONONO guy. Sometimes he plays really, really well and that makes our weakness of relying on Saric less of a weakness. Unfortunately, if he makes 1 3, he'll try to go for another through a stepback.  Nader -- when he played -- was maybe the only guy on the team with a consistent ability to get to the line. He was also a big body who could sometimes hit crucial 3s, but nobody really trusted him over any of the wings. The addition of Torrey Craig has made his niche on the team mostly irrelevant, although it will be nice to see him back if he can recover from his knee arthroscopy before the end of the season (unlikely)."
"It’s actually disgusting how good Suns role players are, Cameron Payne, Cameron Johnson, Mikel Bridges are all incredible."
"Then we have a fundamental disagreement on how good we think Isaiah is, because there is no way i think Trey Burke and Cameron Payne are better than him. Not that i think he is a starter or anything, but could he do Burke's job slightly better? Imo yeah."
Denver signed Austin rivers earlier today and Portland needs a defensive guard if anything. And I would rather use guys like trey Burke; Cameron Payne has also been solid for the suns this season.
"&gt; Now let's think about this moving into the playoffs. You normally play 8 maybe 9 players during the playoffs and is Isaiah better than any playoff teams starting and backup guards (also think of fit during this does said team need a more offense or defense off the bench at said position).  Backups? For sure, Portland and Denver don't even have a backup PG and other teams use guys like Trey Burke and Cameron Payne in that role, both of which are easily replaceable by Isaiah."
CAMERON PAYNE!!!
God it makes me so happy to see Cameron Payne balling out
When did they sign Cameron Payne?
In an alternate universe you included Cameron Payne and Justin Patton in every answer.
"KD wanted OKC to draft Devin Booker and lobbied hard for it. Unfortunately, they couldn't and drafted Cameron Payne."
"I mean none of my guesses were going to include Cameron Payne or Justin Patton, so that takes away 1000 guesses"
Cameron Payne being a meme known for his pre-game celebrations to a quality role player is a turn I think few expected. Just making plays
Fuck you Cameron Payne
"Wait, how is Cameron Payne involved?"
"The Suns have some underrated role players man. Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne. All long boys with insane shooting."
Cameron Payne is a good one
"I see this a lot, but I don’t agree. I’m not a big floor/ceiling guy in general, because guys jump out of the mold all the time. Giannis, FVV, Siakim, Grant this season, young Kawhi, etc..  Sure I’m a Homer 4 Hali, but it always grates on me to see people say so matter-of-factly that a rookie is going to develop one way or another. We thought Tyreke Evans would be a perennial all-star. Cameron Payne was surely out of the league within a few years when he was a rookie. Wiggins has been from expected floor to expected ceiling and everywhere around and in between  I’m just sayin.. I know it’s all just our predictions but I see a lot more for Halliburton than efficient role player and it’s funny to see folks pigeonhole him into Malcolm brogdon when it’s only been like 50 games (and brogdon is much better than he gets credit for)"
"Look at these ""centers"" Harrison Barnes and Cameron Payne go at each other"
"At least you got a first from us for him. You drafted Jusuf Nurkić and traded him(with Gary Harris) for Doug McDermott. You then traded McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second(Mitchell Robinson) for Joffrey Lauvergne, Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne. All those guys left the team that offseason."
Cameron Payne
"He’s like Daenerys Targaryen, you have to list off all his titles. Cameron Payne, first of his name, Bulls Legend, Sixth Man of the Bubble, dance partner of Brodie, etc."
But the other guy just told me its Bulls legend Cameron Payne.  Which is it?
Derozan. But I think you go with someone who's going to be able to match with the timeline.  What about Cameron Payne?  Just going through a free agents list for low cost high upside guys.
"Not all of it was bad luck. Presti  just did a terrible job filling the roster and loved drafting with crappy picks (Mitch McGary, Cameron Payne) instead of trading for better players. A team with a 2 man offense and atheletic bruisers that can't shoot or score is bound to collapse. The year KD left Westbrook had to extert every ounce of strength to make that team servicable. His on-off numbers show a clear picture that Okc without Russ or KD was the worse team in the league."
That's Bubble Suns Legend Cameron Payne TO YOU!
Cameron Payne been in his sophomore year for 7 years
"No sir, That’s Phoenix Suns legend Cameron Payne put some respect on it"
"Ugh.  No more clips of Cameron Payne dancing, please."
That’s bulls legend Cameron Payne to you
Cameron Payne was such a clown back then lmao.  Happy (and honestly a bit surprised) that he turned things around.
"Hopefully he turns his career around like Cameron Payne, love this guy’s motor"
"&gt; look at their draft picks for the last decade  Yeah, let's look at their draft picks over the last decade when their only picks not in the 20s were Steven Adams (12), Cameron Payne (14) and Eric Bledsoe (18). It's hard to draft great role players when they are dealing with the crap shoot of the late first round."
Cameron Payne...Wow...Just wow
Cameron Payne would destroy those guys one-on-one.
"Yes but the idea is that we had Jimmy when he was in his prime years and we didn't build around him. Had we actually put in the effort to build him a real team instead of surrounding him with the corpse of Dwade and Rondo + MCW, Cameron Payne, Lauvergne and Anthony Morrow...the Bulls may have had opportunities to make a final or an ECF."
Cameron Payne and Cameron Johnson are both better than LeBron. The numbers don't lie
Cameron Payne looks like a very familiar cartoon mouse but I can't figure out which one
Cameron Payne is unironically a good post defender jeez.
"deandre ayton, cameron payne."
Cameron Payne
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
"Gary Harris is missed. Murray can’t defend Cameron Payne, let alone Curry."
"Cameron Payne, Cam Johnson."
no cameron payne
On-Off basef on 10 games is pretty dumb  Jokic has a +28 on/off. You can also find stuff like:  * Cameron payne having +30 on/off net rating  * Both Tobias Harris and Embiid having +27  * Nico Batum having +28  * Willy Cauley-Stein +27
For “point guard of the future” Cameron Payne
"If you think he’s getting protected over Saric, you haven’t watched the Suns play at all. Dario has been the Suns anchor in the second unit since he got there.   Cameron Payne is a possibility, but the Suns bench *needs* a point guard, so unless we get someone in a trade or FA, Payne would be a necessity."

There is no ceiling for Cameron Payne
Cameron and Cameroon Payne both went off tonight
Cameron Payne definitely made a huge comeback in his game  happy for this guy. damn near was out the league
Not as good as the Cameron duo of Johnson and Payne
"I remember reading a few years ago that the ""name, records, numbers, etc."" will go back to Seattle when they get a new team.      So silly things like Gary Payton being the all-time assists leader for the Thunder and the retired numbers will go back to Seattle. I vaguely remember Cameron Payne not being able to wear #1 because it was retired by Seattle."
I think 5% chance I can beat Cameron Payne.
"This game was basically swung on a 19-0 run to start the second without Devin Booker, Suns made sure [to do a tribute to vintage old school Suns basketball during that stretch](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kq9z6l/against_the_clippers_last_night_devin_booker_was/gi2kfs9/)  That Phoenix opponent 3 point shooting luck regresses kinda hard last night   Heat check Paul George game [lot of it was just him flexing like this](https://go.nba.com/21z4) not much you can do. This isn’t a good matchup for Phoenix because they lack too many wings you are comfortable putting on Paul George and kawhi beyond crowder and Bridges. The guy who honestly did the best job on PG last night was maybe Chris Paul which isn’t ideal. Bookers defense has been better this year [but he isn’t ready for this responsibility chasing guys through screens isn’t his strength](https://go.nba.com/14n8) neither is reacting quickly in space [and rotating](https://go.nba.com/n19p)  This was interesting there was atretch in the 4th last quarter last night you look up and you see......small ball center Kawhi Leonard as the Clippers lineup [taking away that rim from Cameron Payne](https://go.nba.com/troi). Something you’ll see in the playoffs maybe   Response was pretty cool from Phoenix Saric helped lead the comeback at the end of the 3rd. Bridges and Crowder did what you want vs Kawhi Leonard he wasn’t getting to the basket a ton. Suns didn’t get great offensive looks in the half court last 5 min when it wasn’t Booker pushing off misses that helped seal it."
"Completely different situation in 17/18, he had dudes that were all world shooters and great defenders, with a HoF coach.   In sports, when you are one of two only decent players on your team “forcing plays” happens too often. I can’t believe I am defending KD right now but he is not the reason they lost. Averaged 30/8/3 with 2 blks and 2 steals per game, only player with a decent +/- on his team...please tell me how good Andre Robertson, Steve Adams, Dion Waiters, Randy Foye and Cameron Payne are and how they were good enough to compete against the warriors?  He isn’t the reason they lost, but when you lose, they always blame the best player for not being better."
Cameron Payne was touted before as a bust during his okc days but he really bounced back so well rn with phx.
"CP3 lowkey getting overrated. The suns were already hot last year and Cameron Payne has been leading the bench unit well.  CP3 will show his value overtime like that clutch basket he hit, but people seriously need to stop trying to give him all the credit."
"Oubre was a part of some of our best lineups (which also happened to be some of the best lineups in the league).  It was not addition by subtraction.  What happened in the bubble was Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson both expanded their games and filled the offensive void that was left when Oubre was injured.  Also, Cameron Payne was brought in and immediately added an offensive threat at PG that could distribute and play aggressive defense.  Add Dario Saric coming in to form and basically being a walking double/double off the bench and it all just kind of came together.  No, Oubre was fine for us.  He wasn't perfect, but he was a plus player on the court."
When did Cameron Payne get good? He sucked on the bulls. I thought he was out of the league.
The rare bad Cameron Payne game.
Ill take Cameron Payne over Westbrook at this point.
"Those are the types that cry the most. When the Lakers lost to the Suns a few games ago, a camera caught Lebron James on the sideline yelling at Cameron Payne to stay humble. When's the last time Lebron dunked without making a spectacle of it?"
"The Bulls traded Doug McDermott and Taj Gibson for Cameron Payne, who proceeded to play some of the worst basketball you have ever seen. Payne looked like what you would imagine a random guy getting picked off the street to play in the NBA. He literally, multiple times, fell down while bringing the ball up the court. I'm glad he has put it more together with the Suns, but it was one of the worst trades I have ever seen. I'm glad we have new management!"
"Cameron Payne and Joffrey Lauvergne for Taj Gibson, Dougie McBuckets and a second rounder. It was daylight robbery"
"Okc sends Anthony Morrow, Joffrey Lauvergne and Cameron Payne (when he was terrible, and Chicago personnel later said he shouldn’t be in the NBA)  Chicago sends Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2nd round pick"
Good lord y’all are overrating his defense so much now that he’s gone. Literally no one is going to slow down Ja right now. This is the same guy who was getting cooked by Cameron fucking Payne lmao.
"Well a lot of shorter basketball players have that classic basketball proportions of extremely long arms and legs. Ex: Cameron Payne is barely 6 feet, but has a wingspan of 6'7.5"""
I’m hoping we can bring in Cameron Payne in time to play against the Lakers
"LeBron doesn’t have to stay humble, he’s LeBron. He could’ve been drafted first when he was 16 if that was legal.   Cameron Payne was, actually, at home a year and a half ago. He’s playing well now but it’s unlikely that he ever makes an all star team. That’s why LeBron gets to tell him to stay humble."
"I was watching and Cameron Payne said he was going to get a tattoo that says ""Chosen One"""
"Sure, but why do people feel the need to constantly bring that up as if it's the thing that defines him? Not the children who live in poverty but thanks to him have food on their table and a first class education?   Like...this post is about him talking shit to Cameron Payne. A regular NBA thing...and people bring up china. Does that make sense to you? If you don't have an agenda, what does one have to do with the other?"
Cameron payne just doomed them come playoff time lmao..u gotta talk when u get the chance though u cant blame him.
"Man if I were cam i'd feel sooo good if bron was jawing at me like that. I'd be like ""damn i really got in lebrons head and im cameron fuckin payne lmao"""
"lmao, ikr, this doesnt show lebron being dominant it shows him being pathetic, if im in the NBA, even scrub level im not going to sit on the bench and jaw with cameron payne of all people. gawddamn"
Cameron Payne a suns legend already purely because of how much lakers fans hate him 😭😭
"&gt;	Lebron James to Cameron Payne …..  whatch yourself, you on thin ice, Bron!"
Cameron Payne getting underpaid because of Sarver sucks but I’m glad the team could keep him. He fits the guard rotation so well
Cameron Payne got the facial structure of a goat
Lmao why did Cameron Payne look at the camera like that? 😂😂😂
"Mvp: Giannas. Lakers too stacked. Nets durant and harden cancel each other out. Curry-&gt; 2nd  Dpoy: Ben simmons on another team or Bam adebayo   Sixth man: Grayson Allen, Cameron Payne   Roy: Scottie Barnes.   Coach: Hawks coach. Nuggets   Mip: Michael porter,"
1. Chris Paul  2. Devin Booker  3. Deandre Ayton  4. Mikal Bridges  5. Jae Crowder  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Abdel Nader.
Lord Sim are you still a big Cameron Payne guy?
One good pick out of his last 14 prior to this year's draft:  Aleksej Pokusevski Theo Maledon Vit Krejci Darius Bazley Hamidou Diallo Devon Hall Kevin Hervey Terrance Ferguson Domantas Sabonis Daniel Hamilton Cameron Payne Dakari Johnson Mitch McGary Josh Huestis
"Depth can be gotten easily.  Guys like Jrue Holiday, Cameron Payne, Jae Crowder, Booby Portis, Brook Lopez who make the rest of the roster of championship level teams are traded, waived, or developed all the time.  Lakers won a championship with Caruso starting game 6, with guys like Rondo and Dwight Howard filling major roles on the team.    Philly should have said ""Take anything from our team except Embiid"" for Harden, and then built around those two."
In my unbiased opinion MVP: Devon Booker MIP: Mikal Bridges DPOY: Deandre Ayton 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Jalen Green
"MVP: Damian Lillard  MIP: Wendell Carter DPOY: Anthony Davis 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Davion Mitchell  Not outright predictions, but if the stars align I think these players could walk away with some awards.  Dame is the backbone of Portland, and if they end up in a 1 or 2 seed come playoff time, I could see Dame walking away as MVP.  I was high on Wendell when he was drafted, but he has never really lived up to my expectations. I could see him taking a big jump offensively coming into his first full year in Orlando, if he gets his 11PPG up closer to the 20 mark, he will be a MIP candidate.  AD has always played third fiddle to Giannis and Rudy when it comes to DPOY. If he can stay healthy and get his BPG back to the 2.5 range, he could finally end up as the DPOY.   Cameron Payne is a little bias from me. but after the playoff run he had, I think monty will use Cameron Payne a lot more to give Chris paul some rest. He could win it   Davion Mitchell has just about everything he needs to be ROTY except for maybe the name recognition. Elite defender, and not a slouch on offence either."

Cameron Payne for phx. Dude was in the g league and before that he was a joke.
"Forgive me oh wise pelicans fan.   Dude I’ve watched Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Kris Dunn and Tomas Satoranski point guard my team for the last 5 years. No matter how badly you guys want to piss in my Cheerios it’s not going to ruin the excitement to see a competent point guard lead this team.   Lonzo is 23, is fun as hell to watch, and has been improving rapidly as a player. I’m thrilled to have him aboard and have faith he will continuing to develop."
Eric bledsoe Myles Turner Jamychal Green Mikal Bridges Robert Covington John Collins Thaddeus Green Dorian Finney-Smith Royce Oneil Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne
"I think they can do a lot better, even in that scenario, than trading for 2 years of Vucevic, coby white, and a Portland non-lottery first, which is the only pick the Bulls can trade because all their first rounders after 2022 are subject to being traded.   Coby does nothing for them, they don't need him with Cam Johnson, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Cameron Payne on the team already. His role will be very small. Vuc is in no way valuable enough to make that trade work."
"Not only this, but I think there's another thing people aren't considering which is time.    A trade now gives Morey time to make other trades.  Just because they lose Simmons for pennies on the dollar doesn't mean they're stuck that way.  Given that we *know* what we're getting in Simmons, a change of scenery for different guys, letting Maxey show if he can grow, and doing other trades to get better fitting role players around Embiid is not giving up on their championship aspirations.  Morey wants to hit an easy home run for the score of course, but you can also score if you hit 4 singles.    Ideally, since we know they have to get rid of Ben, I think the best thing is to get rid of him early for whatever they can get, then use those pieces in the next year to trade for slightly higher ones, or better fitting ones, and retool that way.  Time is the only thing Morey can't trade for and he's wasting it by taking his chances at a trade deadline desperation move by Portland, Washington, or Minnesota.  I think its better to get the Sacramento deal done now, accept that they may not compete this year, but by next year Morey can work his magic and upgrade what he has.  And who knows?  Maybe Maxey will turn into a great guard, certainly Cameron Payne wasn't well-known until the Suns made it to the playoffs and he elevated his game, Buddy Hield might be an even better shooter with Embiid taking the attention off of him, and I'm sure Thybulle would work on his shooting more than Simmons would.    Of course we could all be praising Morey as a genius if they do somehow land Dame/Beal, but its not likely."
&gt;	We as sophisticated basketball fans here acknowledge that a Cameron Payne for example should get more attention on ESPN.   OP knows what they’re talking about!
"Agreed, I think Davion is one of those high floor low ceiling prospects. I like him and I think with his strengths he's gonna be in the league for a long time, but I don't think he's ever gonna be an all star talent. I'd compare him to someone like George Hill or Cameron Payne"
You hit the nail on the head. This is the kind of crap OKC tried to pull in 2015 when we drafted Cameron Payne. Guess who sat the bench while we choked on a 3-1 lead in the WCF? It would've been way better had we traded that late lottery pick for a back up point guard or even a rotation player and actually got a guy who could contribute. We were basically one piece away from going to the finals and why did we keep Payne sitting on the bench during that run? Because we hoped he would become a starting level player one day and contribute. We all see how that worked out.   OKC did this a lot not just with Payne. Hopefully if we ever get back to that level again we won't make the same mistake and trade the high potential bench guys for some real talent that can help us win.
Cameron Payne
"i guess it depends on the team but if I'm the 76ers last year if you replace Ben Simmons with someone like Cameron Payne who is willing to take open shots, slashes pretty well and spaces the floor for Embiid they make the ECF."
"Cameron Payne for Ben Simmons, who says no?"
"Fr, add Cameron Payne and we got the rat bros"
"LeBron couldn’t even move laterally. Cameron Payne was getting past him man, if him &amp; AD are 100% they beat the Suns in 5 games man. I can’t wait for this next season."
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
Cameron Payne continued the tradition of speedy role player PGs playing like superstars against the Lakers lol
"Cameron Payne is definitely not a star, but he's admirably fought his way back to the league.  If 4 years ago you told me he'd be one of the better players on a Finals team, I would call you crazy."
Cameron Payne
Why is McGee starting? I would have Mikal at SF and Crowder at PF. I would have Elfrid at the PG and Cameron Payne at SG since he is a PG/SG.  I would have George Hill at PG and Jrue at SG. I think the Bucks would win in 6.
booker and cameron payne.  ;)
"It's such a shame that a lot of the role players they had (Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne) never blossomed like they are now. They needed that extra firepower"
The next Cameron Payne.
Cameron Payne
"Definitely Cameron Payne. Every time I would see him in a game starting from his OKC days I’d wonder how he was still in the league bouncing from team to team.   After this past season and especially the playoffs, I’ve come to appreciate his perseverance and the work he’s put in. It shows and he’s hooping out of his mind. Rooting for him!"
"Dude if I told you to use a calculator and then you put in the wrong equation, yeah, you're gonna get the wrong answer.  I explained how I think advanced stats should be used in a reasonable way. Your method of using them indicates that Cameron Payne and De'Anthony Melton are ""better"" than Jamal Murray, because the way you use them is misleading. Just because you look at them in that way doesn't mean we all have to."
"Ironic that now that he's in Phoenix, Arizona, Cameron Payne finally *isn't* sweating during these conversations."
Yeah. The defense was not getting to their spots.   Underestimated the pace of the Suns. Booker being smooth and stunning surprise by Cameron Payne! Still nuts lol
Good Cameron Payne would’ve really been nice to have in the 2016 playoffs before he broke his foot and lost all his confidence. Glad to see him ball out last season because people forget he showed flashes his rookie year
"Lmao damn can you tell me which 7 of Ricky Rubio, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Kelly Oubre, Cameron Payne, Dario Saric, Aaron Baynes, Cameron Johnson, Jevon Carter didn’t belong in the NBA?"
Similarly to Cameron Payne as well
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
"Decades apart, Kevin Garnett took the floor against both Magic Johnson and Cameron Payne. He [scored 11](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/kevin_garnett_vs_magic_johnson.htm) against Magic and [0 against Cam Payne](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201601120MIN.html)."
You are out of your mind. Cameron Payne is and always will be the goat. Period.
"That's when a great front office will shine...for instance, getting Torrey Craig for Cash Considerations was an awesome move for the Suns to gain depth. The Suns stacked up on their positions to ensure if anybody goes down,they have quality players at EVERY position:  Point guard CP3 Backups - Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Tyshon Alexander  SG - Devin Booker Backups - Langston Galloway, Jevon Carter, Abdel Nader,   SF - Mikal Bridges Backups - Cameron Johnson  PF - Jae Crowder Backups - Torrey Craig, Jalen Smith  C - DeAndre Ayton Backups - Dario Saric, Frank Kaminsky  You could literally have the first five out of the game and a lineup of Cam Payne, Etwan Moore, Cam Johnson, Torrey Craig and Dario Saric can win you games if needed...and that's all because the front office put this team together with a salary cap in mind. That's what I'm talking about regarding preparing your team to win if injuries do happen to your starters."
Chris Paul plays slower than Cameron Payne
Cameron Payne is already a guard version of him. But in playoffs.
"TBF though, the Clippers sold out on stopping Booker in G2 of the WCF and Cameron Payne went off. Nobody thinks he is going to go on another CamPayne like that."
u really think chris paul wont play better than cameron payne
I think we actually have a better chance. Cameron Payne was cooking us and when CP3 is in Cameron Payne won't be.
Is Jeff Teague capable of a Cameron Payne level redemption arc? Better question - is the ECF where you really want to find out?
" &gt;So again because you think again thats gospel, luka and his team are sitting at home while Ayton is a main reason for a team potentially going to the finals.  And again you're using the same bullshit argument people used against Booker for years. Ayton is the third option of the Suns.  Luka is the first and probably the second for the Mavs. And that's because he doesn't have a Booker or CP3 level teammate. Which is also the reason his team lost. But if you remember his team was also up 2-0 like the Suns on the Clippers who were at full strength.  Another fact is that the Suns haven't faced a single fully healthy team all playoffs. The beat the Lakers without AD, they beat the Nuggets without Murray and they're beating the Clippers without Kawhi.  Now I say all of this not to devalue Strong or his accomplishments but only to point out that pointing solely to winning as a reason for a player being more value is asinine.   &gt;I'll take Ayton 100 % of the time if given the chance for the redo, Luka ended up at the best fit for his playstyle, and the fact that you can't comprehend that system matters for player growth and optimization is concerning.  And that's moronic to me. I'll take the best player.   &gt;Key example Cameron Payne, he was tossed out of the league and was a laughing stock of a bust, put the right coach and system in and now he's looking like a 6moty type player  I attribute that less to Suns themselves and more to a guy having to go to China out of the league and reevaluating what he was doing with his life and coming back stronger from it. Like PJ Tucker did."

"I specifically heard Stephen A say something like this when he was with wilbon on something that he would rather hang out in LA than Phoenix or Milwaukee to cover the Finals but that's just a man's opinion. that's not the reflective attitude of the media or network.   Going to the contrary of OP's post I've heard a lot of commentary about how well constructed the suns are and how acquisition of two veteran players have increased these young guys performances and how that's catapulted them into this national spotlight that they wouldn't have otherwise been in. There is a lot of credit deserved and a lot of credit being given to James Jones, to Monty, CP3 and the young talent for rising up. We didn't hear much about Cameron Payne until this conference finals even though he had some good minutes during the LA series when Paul was out but it's coming around. I just don't think a first round or a second round media narrative focuses on the little guys but it probably should. Just like Heurter didn't get a lot of attention until his close out game. These kids are capable of it and that needs to be highlighted but because it hasn't happened often yeah you're going to talk about the big names."
That’s CAMERON “29 POINTS” PAYNE to you
"Wild that a guy averaging over 16 a game on 73% shooting is just being spoonfed. I don’t know why other teams haven’t just tried this???? If only they had.... Cameron Payne....?  Refresher from less than 24 hours ago for any clowns in here that think Ayton doesn’t play a massive part in creating looks and easy buckets for himself (tip, you might want to watch the part of the game other than just whoever has the ball in their hands for once): https://youtu.be/eCRwRZVHfcU"
 He already possessed Cameron Payne in game 2 according to ESPN
"This year its Reggie Jackson for sure, and runner up Cameron Payne"
"""*You guys are losing to a dude named Cameron Payne, come on!*"" - Anthony Davis in the huddle encouraging his team during game 3 of our series."
"well, if we're talking about inexcusable... how about 3 refs missing Demarcus Cousins shoving Cameron Payne pretty hard at center court?  And then shoving Booker?  There was still .7 on the clock.  Should have been techs on him and an ejection."
It’s been so awesome to see Cameron Payne step down from his tank commanding duties so he can drop 29/9 in the WCF.
Cameron Payne was the worst player in the league when he was in Chicago though. That parts true.
Cameron Payne was psyching him out behind him. That actually worked
"I’m so freakin happy for Cameron Payne man, dude’s playing the best ball of his entire life when it’s mattered most."

"NBA fan from Scotland here, didn’t see game live but watched highlights this morning and was super pleased to see Ayton put this away, Cameron Payne handling business while CP3 out too, hope Suns win the chip!!"
Not just that it took 29 from Cameron Payne and 24 from Ayton and they still would have lost if Pandemic P hit those free throws  I wouldnt be super confident if I'm the Suns esp considering it seems like Ty Lue figured out how to give Booker problems as evidenced by his poor shooting % in game 2  Hopefully CP3 comes back and they take care of business to avoid any other injuries  Really hope the Suns can pull this one off
&gt;thank Cameron Payne for God!!!  FTFY

Cameron Payne. Good for him
"It might get lost with the late-game heroics of Ayton, but the Dancer was dancing the night away. What a game from Cameron Payne, stepping up in the absence of CP3 and with Booker having a very tough night."
"I once went to a Summer League game to watch Lonzo/Tatum/Dennis Smith Jr etc play and ended up seeing Denvel Valentine and Cameron Payne during their shootaround before the game started.   I shit you not they missed about 20/22 shots and I literally thought to myself that these guys will be out of the league in a couple years time.   Denzel Valentine is still Denzel Valentine but my god I would've never thought that Cameron Payne would be the leading scorer in a Conference Finals game, huge kudos to his growth"
Cameron Payne is Frodo confirmed
There seemed to be more going on than just that. Cameron Payne seemed to be getting into it with someone.
Laker Slayer and Clipper Killer Cameron Payne.
Pretty sure Cameron Payne said in a post game interview they knew the refs would be less likely to call stuff like that on the last play
Cameron Payne 🤝 Chris Paul
thank God for Cameron Payne!!!
"Those stats gotta be wrong, I swear Ayton had 14 rebounds in the fight half, no way he only finished with that many.  Also, what the fuck Cameron Payne shot the ball 24 times? Is this real life?"

Holy shit what happened to Cameron Payne. All I remember him being was Westbrook’s dancing buddy and getting injured whenever he got traded.   How did he turn his career around?
Imagine telling bulls and thunder fans 3 years ago that Cameron Payne would lead a conference finals game in points and assists. What the fuck did this dude learn in China.
Why the fuck is CAMERON PAYNE taking clutch time shots?! Thes motherfuckers watched too much bruce brown ffs
Phoenix are clowns for letting Cameron Payne ISO. Go to booker for fucks sake
Suns really about to end up relying on Cameron Payne to close this game.
should be suns ball because of cameron payne having 29 points. clips don't want it.
Cameron Payne was cut from the Raptors a couple weeks into the 2020 season and he’s now not only starting for the 2nd seed in the WCF but balling out. What a glow up man. So inspirational.
cameron payne has 29 points in the conference finals  cameron  payne  no bulls fans would belive this 3 years ago

"No, 40% of block attempts are not full swing attempts to make hard fouls out of anger and frustration.

In the backcourt. Out of frustration. And people are still defending him as if he were making a legitimate play on the ball and just accidentally missed."
Watch him become Cameron Payne 2.0.
"Jokic lashed out at an opposing player out of frustration because he thought the ref missed a call and his team was about to be swept.

Cameron payne
just yesterday some people here wanted him benched for Cameron Payne
“Jon Jones enters the game for Cameron Payne. Let’s get ready to *RUMBLLLLLLLE*!”
Everyone thinking about the leap Giannis would make while I'm just wondering about the leap Cameron Payne makes after winning the finals.   league fucked
Bench CP3 for Cameron Payne.  That was physically painful to read
"He's become one of my fave players... playing against my team.  Excellent player and his conduct is what I wish more players follow.    Man, if Cameron Payne leaves I'd have him on the Suns but Reggie also deserves a big contract to reward his performance."
"uhhh if they do that they jeopardize their future.  How are they going to resign Ayton, bridges after next season? how can they resign cameron payne this off-season?  all of them are getting a significant pay increase, 100m 3 years for a guard turning 40 isn’t a great idea"
I would have shat myself if you told me that Cameron Payne would make the NBA finals before the Bulls in 2018...
"Lol, I remembered this comment too. I couldn't believe this shit. Chris Paul has a great season, plays a couple bad playoff games and suddenly isnt as good as Cameron Payne. This is the worst sub of all time."
Where is the Cameron Payne option
"Reggie Jackson, Cameron payne, and Austin rivers are about to get paid"
I was part of those poor takes but in stretches when CP3 slowed down the game so much I think we wanted more energy like Cameron Payne brings in.  You can't deny seeing that we didn't look like the same team when the flow slowed down versus our faster paced offense and ball movement.
cameron payne. would do wonders for his legacy and redemption arc
Lmao can always count on Cameron Payne to do some wild dance on camera.
Cameron Payne really took the Suns to the finals in his first season. Different.

Cameron Payne looks like what? 😂😂
My guess is Cameron Payne is going to run with the first unit and Chris Paul will play with the second unit/bench the second half (until it's less than 5 mins left in the 4th)

\&gt;gets outplayed by cameron payne  \&gt;expect 120M  \&gt;ok.jpg
"nah, I rather watch Cameron Payne vs Lou Williams than KD vs LeBron. Lmao what is this question"
Cameron Payne going to win the FMVP
Cameron Payne worries you more than Deandre Ayton?? Lmao
I know you guys got the dubs against us in the regular season but “lockdown” isn’t what I’d use to describe Ayton defending Giannis personally.  Cameron Payne worries me much more than Ayton does but it wouldn’t surprise me if Ayton shifts into an even higher gear and gives Giannis trouble.
Imagine if the Suns lose the 3-1 lead due to CP3 playing major minutes over Cameron Payne.
I can guarantee you that you should be more worried about Cameron Payne. That was the real X Factor against the Lakers.
don't forget booker - who flails all the time. Cameron Payne is right there as well. Jokic swipes and touches head of a Suns player - it's ejection. Booker swipes across the head of PG13 in exactly same manner. They don't even review it.
Cameron Payne is making less than 2 million this year.
"Ironically, I'll take Cameron Payne despite him being an absolute meme when he was a Bull  He's developed into a solid guard who can hit some 3pt shots (over 40% from 3 this season with Phoenix) and of the trio is the most willing passer.   The Bulls have bucket getters in Lavine &amp; White at guard, but neither of those are particularly good playmakers. So yeah, give me the most pass-first of the trio"
Cameron Payne has no basketball iq
"Cameron payne, he was more consistent in the regular season and is younger"
If Suns win this championship I want a Giorgio Armani underwear ad featuring Cameron Payne
"Man. It never ceases to amaze me that Cameron Payne went from Russell Westbrooks dance partner, to playing in China, and now being a part of the Suns success this season.  Glad for this dude."
"While not nearly as big a deal as most teams injuries, Cameron Payne who had been huge for us is injured."
Steve Kerr Steph Kerr  Paul George George Paul  Lebron James Lejon Brames  Devin Booker Devon Booker  Demarcus Cousins LaMarcus Cousins  LaMarcus Aldrige DeMarcus Aldridge  Pat Bev Fat Bev  Rajon Rondo Rayjawn Rondo  Ernie Johnson Bernie Johnson  Kenny Smith Jenny Smith   Trae Young Swae Young   John Collins Juan Collins  Kevin Huerter Devin Huerter  Cameron Payne Cam'ron Payne  Obi Toppin Tobi Toppin
"Uh huh. If he was still playing, that would've benefitted us because Cameron Payne was playing well over his head. If he was really that injured 3 weeks after the fact, he wouldn't be playing. In fact, he was looking really good against the Nuggets. Stop with the bullshit"
"I would think the main difference between it being a deflection off the player dribbling and it occurring during the natural motion of dribbling would depend on the intent of the player, not necessarily the amount of time the ball stays in contact with their hand.   If Cameron Payne has the ball knocked out of his hands, but the ball makes contact across his entire palm over the course of 1.5 seconds, it would remain as his teams possession if his hand stayed in the natural motion of dribbling. If he tried to correct his hand at all to compensate for losing the ball I think that would be enough reason to say it’s a deflection of Payne"
"LAC players seem toxic to me. Lots of intentional shoulder bumps and pushes once the play stops. Even younger players, like Terrence Mann, has picked it up, pretending to calm Cameron Payne down when that last ""pat"" was a downright shove."
3 posts by this guy.  Two about Ben Simmons being worse than Cameron Payne and Tyler Herro.  Now one where KAT is better than Embiid.
Never knew Cameron Payne had this much impact on the locker room
The only CP I know is Cameron Payne
"I'm 48. I grew up idolizing Isiah Thomas. He wouldn't even make a roster now. Cameron Payne would humiliate him. And if Cameron Payne were transported back to 1990, he would put up 25 &amp; 10 with all league defense while revolutionizing 3pt shooting.  Every generation of sprinter and swimmer is better than the generation that came before them. By mathematical fact. And by *a lot*. It's not close. So why on earth wouldn't it be the case that basketball players get better every generation? We do know they shoot better. All time league record 3pt shooting and - AND - free throw shooting! For all your glorious ""fundamentals"" from the Red Auerbach bullshit days, players weren't *nearly* as good as stepping up to a 10 foot line with no defense and making free throws. The NBA of the 60s was basically the wnba now - way smaller, way less athletic, AND way worse fundamentals. Your heroes were essentially slightly taller female players of 2021."
"I actually really like NOT reviewing that out of bounds call where it would have been technically out on Cameron Payne. There’s been a lot of talk about how with the use of slow motion this call is ruled inconsistently, and I think what they did here could be the answer to this. Means we aren’t slowing the game down with more reviews, and these calls are consistently called the same way throughout the entirety of the game (fine with replay being used for more contentious calls such as the one off bridges earlier in the game). However, this needs to be done EVERY TIME, as it was not done in game 2 and led to a turnover.   If you want good refereeing, you need calls to be consistent for every team and every game. It almost feels at times the final 2 minutes are played with a completely different set of rules than the rest of the game and this is so incredibly frustrating for me to watch and I’m sure it is for the players as well."
in the last few mins:  \- missed an obvious Terence Mann foul on a point blank layup  \- Cameron Payne was the last one who touched it out of bounds when Bev/Batum defended him
"Ok Kawhi is out, did y’all forget that suns was missing their first option Cameron Payne in game 3?"
Anyways Cameron Payne girlfriend is fucking sexy af
We can call Cameron Payne Mighty Mouse.
Sixers should trade Simmons for Cameron Payne and Dario Saric.
Didn't Cameron Payne just jump backwards 6 feet after shooting a three and the replay was shown??
Cameron Payne has that face…. Can’t tell what it is but it’s a very annoying face….lol
"Cameron Payne delivers the pain when he's healthy, I hope the suns go to the finals it would be a great story for Chris Paul, I even hope they win the championship as well. From a lottery team to a championship team in just one trade"
Who knew that Cameron Payne would be an X Factor when the season started
"it's not only about the shooting, CP3 was ball-stopping a lot. cameron payne for example kept putting pressure on clippers defense in first 2 games, but cp3 just dribbled and dribbled until the end of shot clock"
I'm not worried. We got it down to 8 after playing with zero energy on both sides of the ball with both stars having their worst game of the season. It was literally tied with Devin's worst fg% of the entire season. Chris Paul shot 48% for the season and in the mid 50s for the playoffs so far. If those dudes hit in the 40s each then that gives us about 14 to 16 points which is the difference I'm the game already. That's not even including Cameron Payne being back. It's stupid to overreact to recency bias after watching this team for 85 or so games now. Except you probably haven't so you wouldn't know this stuff.
"Booker has had a strong postseason but his postseason is a mix of crazy good games and mediocre games without much in between. Although this one last night he was just really bad worst one of the playoffs so far. This is [alot of what's going on](https://twitter.com/MikePradaNBA/status/1408268764886482950?s=20). Also Booker's wretched footwork defensively keeps showing up and is the reason for alot of these defensive fouls. This [will not get it done either](https://go.nba.com/y86v). Just gotta probably use him more off ball to start game 4 to get him going. I do think he'll figure it out and wont stay tricked by Beverley. The more he runs and incorporates Ayton in pick and rolls the better generally it is for him.   Cameron Payne injury is a problem, CP3 went back to some of his bad traffic cop habits from the beginning of the year needlessly slowing down the pace sometimes in the first half.  Ivica Zubac really was what won this game for LAC. Batum's minutes have yo-yo'ed the entire postseason it's back down lower than what its ever been, Mook is still banged up, youll get 30 min of Zubac again in game 4 and what he does is one of the big hinge points that will decide the game."
[he got injured and didnt return to the game](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2945184-suns-cameron-payne-exits-game-3-vs-clippers-with-ankle-injury)
"he was dribbling and dribbling sooo much. cameron payne was constantly putting pressure on clippers defense in first 2 games, you can't just dribble behind the 3-point line against this clippers defense"
Cameron Payne is the most important CP on the Suns change my mind
"&gt; Lmao George wasn’t even near when Cameron Payne got injured.   Someone helpfully corrected me -- it was Batum who threw the push in the back.  Yeah, Crowder slipped up on that one, can't argue with you there. But if you're going to argue that it was equally physical on balance, we're gonna disagree."
This game needed more Cameron Payne.
Lmao George wasn’t even near when Cameron Payne got injured. Rondo was diving for a loose ball and Payne ran into him. The play crowder went under George was pretty dirty if you wanna talk about that.
Is Cameron payne the greatest guard that Westbrook has ever played with?
“We got Cameron Payne at home”  Chris Paul enters the game.
Get well Cameron Payne.
Yup. I agree.   And Kawhi is a better player than Cameron Payne will ever be lol may be hard for you to admit though. “We lost tonight because we didn’t have the Suns legend Cameron Payne 😩”  Have a nice night.
Clippers lucky the suns lost their beat player Cameron Payne
Cameron Payne: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/payneca01.html  Kawhi: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonaka01.html  These dudes are nowhere near the same lol
Ty Lue: We have no answers for Cameron Payne.  Cameron Payne:
"As a Thunder fan, knowing that the Suns could really use Cameron Payne feels like being in an episode of the Twilight Zone."
Change my mind: Cameron Payne is the Suns second most important player.
"I’d argue that Kawhi is a better player than Cameron Payne, but maybe they’re the same quality player.  Not diminishing all he’s accomplished though that Payne."
No kawhi no cameron Payne smh
"I missed it, is cameron payne hurt/out?"
"CP3 is great an all, but CP3 in means less time for the GOAT Cameron Payne."
Will Cameron Payne spit on himself for the third game in a row? Now taking wagers.
"Why do you think they are just as good?  They are up 2-0, but they have won by a  combined 7 points against a team that just played back-to-back 7 game series and is missing their best player  Cameron Payne just had an excellent game, but he's not CP3"

"Barber and facial reconstruction plastic surgeon: ""What'll it be?""  Cameron Payne: ""The Lou Williams look. But don't use a photo, it has to be from memory."""
Cameron Payne has come a long way. dude has been hooping all over us since the regular season
Cameron Payne did a fantastic job filling in. Doubt he can repeat that but he has been great these first two games.
Cameron Payne played out of his mind so no I disagree with you and I think we were winning that game regardless of who plays
Yea I agree he’s not getting benched he was useful and he plays w grit which is valueable as shit vs these young suns... but for real tho bro Cameron Payne of all people scored on him like 4x that shit was ridiculous
19/3/7 with a steal and 2 blocks from Cameron Payne. Just as we all expected.
"Damn Suns, y’all wasted a great Cameron Payne game."
"Cameron Payne, what a great story!"
The Cameron Payne glow up 😩
The lakers really being cooked by Cameron Payne huh.
Cameron Payne without the payne
Cameron said they will know PAYNE.
Cameron Payne the new CP3
Who is Cameron Payne?
lmao just a min after this cameron payne drills a 3 in caruso's face
This will probably go down as the Cameron Payne Game
you think laker fans made up Cameron payne being a bum?
Cameron Payne looks like if Lou Will went through a Lou Will filter and plays like him on offense too
"cameron ""steve nash"" payne"
The audacity of Cameron Payne lmao
And Cameron Payne splashin 3's in their face
Cameron Payne ladies and gentleman
"Cameron Payne is playing like a hall of famer, and you all have him as a backup? Jesus Christ."
I always confuse Cameron Payne with Adriean Payne
"Cameron f**king Payne, ladies and gents.  Win or lose tonight, hopefully this game really drives home the point that the Suns are absolutely for real this year."
"I said it in the game one game thread, and I'm going to say it again.  By the end of this series, the world is going to see how good Cameron Payne is."
who is that man and what did they do to cameron payne.
CAMERON FUCKING PAYNE
This will probably go down as the Cameron Payne
Bulls legend cameron payne
Raptors legend Cameron Payne
Cameron Payne is the best player in the court
If we lose because of fucking Cameron Payne we don’t deserve to advance out of the first round.
CAMERON PAYNE
Raptors legend Cameron Payne 😈
Cameron Payne used to be a meme and now look at him.  Respect
Cameron Payne. Playing defensive tackle on one end and sniping on the other  You LOVE to see it
cameron payne is one of the weirdest looking dudes i've ever seen
Cameron Payne just jumped and grabbed hold of AD and I bet yal still gonna complain about the call.
If you would have told me 3 years ago that Cameron Payne would be leading the number 2 ranked Phoenix Suns against a Lebron led 7th seed Lakers team in the opening round of the playoffs... I would say yes... that sounds about right for the NBA
I go to college currently where Cameron Payne went.
As a thunder fan watching Cameron Payne tonight is fuxking WILD
Cameron Payne really feeling himself
Cameron Payne is giving me bad memories of Leandro Barbosa blurring past our defense.
they're letting cameron payne run around and foul like jevon carter on press virginia lol
I miss cameron payne :(
Cameron Payne ego is on high rn cus CP is out. You aint the guy bro stop chucking shots
Cameron Payne used to play on the bulls and he was trash.  Is this still true?
Did the Cameron Payne and Chris Paul inclusions not tell you I was joking
"Just spent 10 years in Thai prison, is cameron Payne the best PG in the league right now?"
Cameron Payne strikes fear into my very core
Cameron Payne is the best player to come out of Murray state
Refs got Cameron Payne feeling like a super star
I refuse to believe this is the same Cameron Payne that played in Chicago
Cameron Payne looks like a Kobe pinata you'd get from a shitty liquor store.
Cameron Payne being a competent NBA player is something i never thought was possible. Happy for him though
Cameron Payne looks like he’s in Payne
Cameron Payne got a black eye from last night?
Cameron Payne look like he got beat up
Cameron Payne looks like he got his lunch money stolen
Why does Cameron Payne have a black eye?
All I hear is suns are deep but trotting out CAMERON PAYNE!!? He’s doo doo
"I mean, it's a foul when Trae and Steph pull on somebodies arms, just like its a foul when Embiid hacks someone like Kemba walker when he drives into the lane.     I don't know why this is the hill to die on.  Chris Paul committed a foul, committed a lane violation, the call was made and reviewed and they played on.  The techs that came on that play didn't even involve Lebron, was Cameron Payne and Caruso going all middle school slapping the ball out of each other's hands.  All the players on both teams just kind of left Lebron there.  No one went after CP3, no retaliation needed.  The Lakers and Suns all knew what was up.  Whistle was blown, let's get on up and get ready for some free throws"
"""I would fuck the shit out of Cameron Payne"""
Bulls fans 🤝 Lakers fans: eff Cameron Payne
Top 5 Suns of all time:  5. Boris Diaw  4. Penny Hardaway  3. Dan Majerle  2. Eric Bledsoe  1. Cameron Payne
Yes. Refs decided to ruin the game by taking Cameron Payne out. Next they're gonna eject E'Twaun Moore. Then it'll be obvious how rigged this is.
Chesapeake Energy Arena Dance Floor Legend Cameron Payne
Raptors legend Cameron Payne
Adam Silver called in called Cameron Payne and told him to shove Caruso and then toss a ball at him...right.
Cameron Payne died for your sins
Cameron Payne
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAMERON PAYNE IS EJECTED FOR THAT? WHAT THE FUCK.
CP3s foul was a normal one. Cameron Payne was classless here. Harrell being dumb but that’s expected.
Bruh they ejected Cameron Payne for what???
Goodbye “Cameron Payne”
#CAMERON PAYNE EJECTED FOR DEFENDING HIMSELF FROM HARRELL? The fuck
Cameron Payne can go practice his handshakes in the locker room
LMAO they took it all out on Cameron Payne
Y’all need to stop that was an arm bar. Cameron Payne shoves AC. I don’t know what Trezz is doing there
Cameron Payne transformation from Russ dance partner to solid rotation piece  - Respect
is this the cameron payne from okc??? looks like a totally different player
cameron payne is outsmarting lakers rn lmao
Suns have no chance if they’re going to be playing Cameron Payne a lot
CAMERON PAYNE
"Rough list of things that comes to mind:  * Acquisition of jae crowder (replacing kelly “black hole” oubre)  * The rise of cameron payne as a high quality roleplayer  * Player development, most notably bridges and ayton  * Monty Williams moving dario from the starting 4 to backup 5, where he’s more comfortable offensively and defensively   * Vastly improved health. Last year, the suns had many positive indicators when they were healthy like win %, +/- data of their starting 5, and of course going 8-0 in the bubble. Ignoring all the other things in this list, they were setup for a big improvement just from being healthy. And the thing is, not only have they been *extremely* healthy, but leaguewide health has taken a huge dip, with more injuries from the shortened season and players missing time from covid protocol. Health has been HUGE for the suns.  * Last, obviously cp3 has helped quite a bit. It’s just when you consider all the improvements to the team, a huge upgrade in health, and the indicators last year of an upward trending team, I don’t see any reason to think cp3 has had MVP level impact."
1. Devin Booker  2. Chris Paul  3. Mikal Bridges  4. Jae Crowder  5. Deandre Ayton  6. Cameron Payne  7. Cameron Johnson  8. Dario Saric  9. Torrey Craig  10. Jevon Carter
I really thought Cameron Payne should be in the mix
All this to get clamped by Cameron Payne
"CP3, Book, Mikal, Jae Crowder, DA, Cameron Johnson, Cameron Payne, Jevon Carter? (8 seems like a tossup tbh)"
"And it’s dogshit for playoff ball, especially when you’re matching up against us. Cameron Payne? Darko Saric? Kaminsky?   You saw how useful Craig was against us in last years playoffs.   You’re just going to have to watch how we match up in a playoff environment to understand just how bad your bench is I guess. Not one of those two “Bigs” can help you when Ayton gets into foul trouble, which you know he will in every game with AD and Drummond.  This always happens with you small market franchises. You have to be shown how bad your teams are in the playoffs before you believe it because you think regular season basketball means something.   Playoff ball is about matchups. You don’t match up with us at any position."
We were resting all our starters and even cameron payne in the end. He was 8 for 9 before he attempted this shot so it only makes sense he took it.
Cameron Payne looks like Sid the Sloth
The Kingslayer Cameron Payne.
"I think AD's injury pretty clearly affected the Lakers more than CP3's injury, as 1) AD was taken completely off the floor, and 2) Cameron Payne played lights out and helped cushion the loss, and you can't say the same for AD's backups. That's why it's not as simple as healthy CP3 = win for the Suns in G2 and G3, becuse then maybe Cam Payne doesn't explode for 19 or 15.  If we're assuming 1) completely healthy CP3 and AD and 2) LeBron is still hobbled by the ankle, I certainly give the Suns a chance, it'll be a tough series for both teams for sure. I'd still go with the Lakers in 6, but I wouldn't think it's a sure thing."
"The suns definently exposed the Lakers depth we have. Chris Paul absolutely cooked us. Even Cameron Payne. It was unreal. Chris Paul brought the energy and nobody matched it. Cam Payne too even. That’s my frustration with AD. I love having him completely, I just wish he would go back to Pelicans AD who would totally want to dominate games instead of trying to play second fiddle to Lebron when Lebron wants him to the the guy. I agree he has been in his head. The talent and everything is there, he just hasn’t completely pieced it all together to be a complete force. I hope he is able to do that and stay healthy. Drummond is a monster on the glass, but you are correct in him needing a PG or someone to tell him where to be. He’s a liability without it offensively due to the fact he doesn’t know how to space the floor whatsoever. I’d also wish he would give more effort to be a rim protector. He’s got the size, if Bam can do it, Drummond can, too.   Truthfully, given the cap of Lebron and AD, we will need someone on the cheap. Conley and Lowry are free agents I think that could fit , but they make too much money. Personally, I’d like Spender Dinwiddie. Can score very well, and is a capable facilitator. Defensively, we can coach him up and bring him to the defensive mindset the Lakers play with. Shouldn’t be crazy expensive either. I think he may have a player option, though. I’d like him a lot. Lonzo is available , but he is an RFA and I’m not sure he would want to come back. May be an awkward situation and I’m not sure he brings the scoring we need for starting PG. Pelinka will work his magic I am sure. Finding the brain is the key part. Lebron still has a lot of say over the roster, though. I think dinwiddie would be amazing if it could work out. Instead of paying a lowry or Conley type, pay someone good who is cheaper and fill out the roster better. We need quality depth, not just capable depth. Great depth brings you deep in the playoffs as well as having the stars. Bench is very important to bring that spark to the game"

Cameron Payne Finals MVP 😂 LePayne
every time I think of Cameron Payne I think of the summer league game with the bulls where he fell down bringing the ball to halfcourt like three times. Wild and also kinda great to see he’s become an actual useful NBA player in the end.
The Cameron Payne effect
"Title should read 'Lebron gets fouled by Cameron payne, no call so is late to the next play.'"
He's playing for the Suns under the name Cameron Payne
cameron payne looks like Remy from Ratatouille...... that being said secure the ring king of the ugliest jumper 2021 playoff run !!
"yeah but when cp3 wasn’t playing, cameron payne did a good job, meanwhile nobody can replace AD"
I mean MJ lost in the first round to legendary HOF teams. Lebron lost to Cameron Payne

Does Cameron Payne do anything this quarter but drive at the basket and miss layups
Cameron Payne looks like he sells smoothies to Hannah Montana or whatever the fuck that character did
That missed Cameron Payne layup with 3:40 left is when I knew the Lakers were going comeplete the comeback.   Just one of those highlights they show when they recap the game.
Why is Cameron Payne trying to play hero ball every time he touches the ball?
"Cameron Payne needs to finish more, but he's always able to get past people and can hit shots."
Is it just me or does Cameron Payne got the same face shape as the Raquelle laker fan on Twitter
Cameron Payne has some donkey teeth
Talking about Cameron Payne like he doesn’t absolutely suck
lmao that's the Cameron Payne I know
Even superstars like Cameron Payne have off nights
I thought Chris Paul was insane when that report came out about him likely declining his player option. Watching Cameron Payne run the offense when he is out I am starting to understand his mindset
they are only paying less than 2mn for Cameron Payne
"Cameron ""The Sponge"" Payne"
I'm a Cameron Payne fan. Dude making the most of his opportunities.  Didn't realize he was out of the league for a second.
"Cameron Payne pisses me off every time I see him play now because, for whatever reason, he couldn’t do this for Chicago."
Cameron Payne will be fire in this offseason.  Dame vs Cam would’ve been fire
What the fuck was Cameron Payne just yelling at the refs lmaooo
cant believe lebrons actually getting cooked by fucking cameron payne
"It’s time to admit Lebron is done, he’s washed. His legacy is on the line tonight and he’s nowhere to be found, getting outplayed by cameron payne, can’t say I’m surprised. Shame on you LeFraud, all you’ll be remembered for is winning Mickey Mouse rings, Unbelievable."
Cameron Payne &gt; the entire NBA
“Cameron Payne has been one of the biggest stories this round”   Immediately gets stuffed like thanksgiving 💀💀💀
"Seriously, was Cameron Payne this good this whole time?  How bad were the Bulls?"
Cameron Payne just whinges non stop I swear
Word. Cameron Payne went from journeyman to big time hooper.
"[Wojnarowski] Scott Foster called a technical foul on Cameron Payne for taunting. Payne yelled ""Get him a body bag!"" from the bench as Davis laid on the floor after being fouled hard by Jae Crowder."
So Cameron Payne can blow by him again?
“You are gonna start Cameron Payne and you are gonna like it”
"I think round 2 of whoever makes it out of these series will still be good.      Nuggets/Suns: MVP vs Ayton, Facu vs Paul (someone is getting ejected), Austin Rivers redemption vs Cameron Payne redemption. Can AG defend Booker?     Nuggets/Lakers: WCF rematch. Two hobbled teams (I'm just gonna go ahead and predict that AD will miss more time), Lakers are basically the Pistons to the Nuggets Bulls, Nuggets traded for AG specifically to defend Luka, Kawhi and LeBron, so will he be up for the challenge? LeBron legacy under fire, AD toughness under fire. Who has better role players?     Blazers/Suns: Hello elite guards! Dame vs Booker would be wild. Can Nurkic slow down Ayton?      Blazers/Lakers: First round rematch from the bubble. Elite guards vs elite size. Melo vs LeBron.      Can make any of the matchups interesting if ESPN producers think for a second."
Cameron Payne
And Cameron Payne is a future MVP
Nah that is Cameron Payne lol.  Rondo is Gumby.
Cameron Payne
I want to see Cameron Payne drop 40.
Cameron Payne and all dissenters should be guillotined
"The Lakers got worked and should get ripped for the kind of effort they came out with in the first half. That said, regardless what people tell you LeBron still clearly isnt 100%(neither is Chris Paul) and his inability to pressure the rim and do anything on switches right now gets magnified when AD is out. Suns had no problem switching Ayton onto him both he and LeBron knew LeBron just wanted the step back in those spots.   Bad Marc Gasol showing last night again trying to contain Cameron Payne on drives who's been at worst the Suns 3rd best player in the series. Schroder costing himself a bunch of money right now, didnt have it on defense at all either."
"Ok but Dame dropped 55 points and lost in a close game in 2nd OT.  Curry averaged 30ppg while being double teammed.  These 2 were very clearly not the problem  Lebron on the other hand was not good tonight and game was over in the first quarter. He can't even defend Cameron payne and gives up on his team every other play. People also didn't say it's his fault but its really never his fault according to his fans. If he loses its the team, if he wins its all him."
I remember when Cameron Payne was horrible through thunder periods but he developed into a good player so happy for him.
Cameron Payne
LeBron's new daddy cameron payne
Cameron Payne exists.
Cameron Payne scored 10 points in about five minutes in the first quarter tonight.
"That's nothing unique to the Lakers or anything, though. every team after a good stretch of games props their guys up. Look how everyone's talking about Cameron payne in this thread lmao. When the team is playing bad, when nobody on the Lakers has been able to hit a shot for like the past 3 weeks, shits gotta change.   When AD went out I didn't expect us to take the series. But we just can't be getting cooked like this either. Schroeder &amp; KCP especially can't play how they did tonight and they've been underwhelming all series.   And i just don't know what the alternative is. If the Lakers don't trade some people.... What do they do? Run it back? We're not a young team, we aren't going to ""grow"" to get better. People need to go and get moved or else this team peaked last year and we're blowing AD's prime and lebron's final years for nothing."
"Stop, if he beat this team we all know the narrative, a banged up cp3, cameron payne and bunch of guys who played their first playoff series. stop lying its cringe...."
Cameron Payne easily.
"I hear your. He’s not 25 anymore though. He has to be sly and is still getting his teammates open looks.   He didn’t do enough this game, but the supporting cast was horrible.   His defense has been ass for a decade. Lakers are supposed to be best defensive team in the league and were getting fooled by Cameron Payne"
Shut it down. Lakers can’t stop Cameron Payne
Yes. Cameron Payne is indeed the best player in the world
"""It's gonna be completely nuts, but it's also gonna be awesome,"" Monty Williams said. ""The whole city's gonna be behind us. We're gonna be on SportsCenter every night. If we lose, it's gonna be the end of the world. If we win, it's gonna be wild. But no matter what, it's gonna be fun.""  And so, Williams went outside and sat by the desert while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, we got Cameron Payne on our team,'"" he said. ""'The best player in the world is a Phoenix Sun.'"""
"Aside from that stretch in the 3rd where he hit his open 3s, LeBron James was a virtual non-factor in this game.  The Phoenix Suns are rolling. Devin Booker put in his best performance since Game 1, and Cameron Payne showed up as well. Ayton was limited to a mere handful of shots, but was still impactful regardless.  Chris Paul, despite off shooting, was in control of the game until he got bumped in his injured shoulder. Hope he's better by Game 6.  Speaking of injuries, the Lakers really, really missed Anthony Davis this game. With elimination on the horizon, will they put him back in even if he's not 100%?"
Cameron fucking Payne.
[so im just going to go ahead and dust this bad boy off](https://streamable.com/38fh8)   Cameron Payne take a fucking bow  Best thing about this game tonight is not having the subreddit flooded with 600 clips of fucking Alex Caruso or someone doing a simple layup
Lakers didn't trade for Lowry only to get cooked by Cameron Payne. You hate to see it.
"He is getting smoked by Cameron payne the last 2 games. If you are a good defender you bring it in every play. The argument of ""i can if I try"" is what I say to myself when I fail an exam. The point is to do it, not if you can"
"THT, Caruso...I can go on. Who do the suns have off the bench Cameron Payne. LMAO. What a pathetic performance by Lebron and Lakers. They should sweep the suns even without AD."
Ill have cameron payne than him rn
Why couldn’t Cameron Payne play like this in Chicago?
Imagine someone out there just haaaaaating Cameron Payne
So it's probably not a good thing that the Suns leading scorer after a quarter is Cameron Payne
"Cameron Payne is literally defibrillating the Suns and Booker’s ass right now, keeping them alive.    Booker is pure dogshit."
If the suns somehow make it out of this Cameron Payne for MVP. Only one who can hit his shot tonight
Monty needs to man up and let Cameron Payne continue running primary PG duties for the rest of the game  CP3 ain't it rn
"Cameron ""The Chipmunk"" Payne vs Bobby ""Crazy Eyes"" Portis is the Space Jam we all really wanted."
"Cameron Payne bailing out CP3 and devin booker, cmon now dawg"
Cameron Payne legit a goblin
"The Suns backup PG is Cameron Payne. Who is the Suns backup SG?   But also, CP3 was injured/sick all through these playoffs. Which isn't to say grain of salt, but that the regular season numbers are probably closer to what should be expected from a healthyish Paul."
CP3 was at like 60% for the first three games. And in those games Cameron Payne had the best stretch of his career and effectively filled in for bum shoulder CP3. CP3 came back strong towards the middle of that series.   LeBron was at 60% the entire series. Statistically it was probably his worst postseason ever. AD was hobbled that entire series and then missed like 2.5 games. KCP missed a game and then returned too quickly only to get injured again.  The injury luck in that series massively favored the Suns even when accounting for that CP3 pinched shoulder in the beginning.
"Sure, but a big part of that is because the Lakers only had 6 weeks off following their championship win and the start of training camps, and AD was recovering from [an injury he got in Game 5 of the Finals](https://youtu.be/M--IRVucDW8) which in retrospect looks suspiciously like it ties in to the injury issues he had this year. AD needed time to recover and then time to get ready for the season, but the scheduling didn't allow it. You'll find out all about that next season with the short break you guys are gonna get after the Finals ends tonight.   Last season the Suns had the benefit of being so bad that they missed the playoffs entirely and got two nice long breaks and were able to come into the season refreshed and ready, and it showed in their health and availability this year. We'll see how you guys do with it next year when your guys are also going on short rest. I'm particularly going to keep an eye on CP3 with his durability issues (isn't he supposedly hurt right now? Could impact his off-season), Jae Crowder (back to back extremely short off-seasons), and Devin Booker, who's going from tonight's game straight to Tokyo to play for the next month. And of course next year you guys will be without Saric and probably Cameron Payne once he gets a bigger offer in free agency. Best of luck with that, no excuses, ok?"
"Suns missed a lot of shots? [everyone but Cameron Payne (3-7, 42.9%) and Torrey Craig (1-4, 25%) made at least half of their shot attempts, with seven players shooting better than 60%.](https://www.nba.com/news/inside-the-box-score-2021-nba-finals-game-5)"
Cameron Payne is who I thought Elfrid Payton was going to be.
Cameron Payne will win Finals MVP CMV
"If you made a playoff team of the best minimum players for the regular season, could they win a championship? Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne have me thinking, yes."
Ah yes Cameron Payne is the leading scorer of the game just like we all expected.

I saw Cameron Payne get called a technical for pushing a hand away earlier and I've seen Simmons shove dudes like twice now with no call. NBA officiating is confusing
CP is Cameron Payne right?
"That comparison is a true one that a lot of people really kept seriously arguing and now they’re going to pretend it was either never said, or they were joking.   It was said and they were not joking.   Having said that, the shit Simmons is getting recently is probably going too far into the other extreme. Had some mans here saying they’d take Cameron Payne over him."
Dude didn’t you read it? Cameron Payne makes them a super team.
Cameron Payne and Booker did a fine job at that by themselves

"You are silly. This man put together a team that was one quarter away from beating the 73-win Warriors. And did it almost entirely through drafting, player development, and the secondary free agent market. Get out of here with “he should have drafted better role players.”   If you think that the Cameron Payne and Mitch McGarry picks prevented them from winning a title then you are a moron."
Yeah Cameron Payne is about to lock him down boys /s
In about a week it will be Cameron Payne
"It's ok, we have CP15 in Cameron Payne."
I thought Cameron Payne was going to be a great 6th man and I was really wrong and then really right
"depends if you count the play in as the playoffs imo. cameron payne is solid but his impact doesnt approach cp3s. theyd be hard pressed to beat out the grizzlies warriors and lakers, and they got the 2 seed after missing the playoffs the last 10 years. Super possible they just dont stay mentally tough long enough to get the job done"
"&gt; The Texan's owner is super-religious so his guy is a pastor. Cuban's ""language"" is cutting edge number-crunching and tech, so his guy is a crypto-enthusiast and gambler.  What's funny is that the Texans regressed this year and Dallas haven't won a series in a decade.  I get the need to use analytics but it seems like in basketball every year there is a random ""where did this come from"" game from a role player that you can't predict in any model (Jeff Green getting hot from 3, Lou Williams going off last night, Cameron Payne playing well against the Lakers).  Or a random injury that takes a guy out in a pivotal moment.  Sometimes you just have to be able to live in the moment and go with the hot hand and not be so married to analytics and metrics.  I feel like basketball is the ultimate momentum game.  Sometimes the snowball gets moving and just can't be stopped.    Basically what [KD said years ago](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1184140634208329728)"

1. Cameron Payne  2. Devin Booker  3. Chris Paul   4. DeAndre Ayton  5. Jae Crowder  6. Mikal Bridges  7. Frank Kaminsky  8. Torrey Craig  9. Dario Saric  10. Jevon Carter
I'll never forgot when Stacey King said he would've slapped someone in the face if someone had told him Cameron Payne was capable of playing well (this was when he was on the Bulls and hot garbage).  He's come so far since then.
"Cameron ""Here Comes the"" Payne"

#Cameron Payne
Cameron Payne being a good player is a cool story line
"Cameron Payne has been more likely to run up to the perimeter and shoot a 3 than any single Laker this series. Suns have had a ton of unexpected guys get hot in these games. Lakers have had guys like Kuz and Schroeder go ice cold, while guys like Caruso and Gasol can’t get that hot to begin with from offense."
"&gt;G4 they just had a horrendous 3rd  yeah because LeBron was their only player capable of initiating the offense and he just...didn't try to for the entire 3rd quarter (and a bit of the 4th). AD out, Schroeder can't run an offense just get himself looks, and Caruso was not playing PG so LeBron instead doesn't attempt a FG until 9 minutes have gone by, instead makes 1 pass and takes 3 steps in 10 seconds with zero off-ball movement, and gets blown by on 3 out of 4 possessions by Cameron Payne.  I'm a huge LeBron fan but he is rightly getting lambasted for this. It's hard for Caruso to run an offense as well when LeBron moves off-ball like and episode of ""My 600 LBJ life"". Phoned in game 4 in a game that could have been completely different if he was even a little bit checked in and trying to exert his influence on offense in the second half"
"Yup, hell even Cameron Payne is having his way on the perimeter dragging Lakers bigs out the paint. That leaves Ayton to feast with no big standing in his way."
“There is no ceiling for Cameron Payne”
Giving Cameron Payne a a lot of press here. Feel like Cp3 deserves some.
"I thought i was losing my mind reading all of these garbage takes the last 2 weeks. Good to see there are still sensible people in this sub.  This sub really said lebron james is an elite defender and kawhi is not even good anymore only to see lebron get smoked by cameron payne tonight.   For some reason people have a hate boner for kawhi when he is one of the most likeable dudes in the nba up there with steph. He just minds his own business and plays basketball, but apparently he is not a good leader cause he doesnt scream to the refs even though he is putting up 40 points left and right. Same goes for PG13 that has been carrying the Pacers for like a decade before he gets traded"
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they’re looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they’re playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It’s just impressive that they’ve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he’s balling tf out  I’ve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he’s what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
Kawhi to the Suns for Raptors Legend Cameron Payne
"Idk maybe their role players wont be shooting for 60% from 3 for the whole series. Just a thought  r/nba real quiet right now. Called leonard a trash defender and an overrated player while lebron ""actualy plays elite defense"" james got smoked by cameron payne.   Lakers fans on suicide watch tonight, take care everyone &lt;3"
r/nba about to go mental. They told me kawhi plays no defense and lebron is an elite defender while lebron was getting bullied by cameron payne earlier.  Lakers fans on suicide watch tonight
"Its because lebron stans said Lebron plays elite defense, much better than kawhi actualy. Getting exposed by cameron payne lol"
Cameron Payne
OKC Legend Cameron Payne
CAMERON PAYNE-T   sorry
Cameron Payne tho
Cameron is bringing the Payne
"Who cares when Cameron Payne can have Drummond and AD standing over him but still make a 3, while nobody on the Lakers team is guaranteed to make an open 3?"
Cameron Payne ladies and gentlemen.

Crazy how Cameron Payne went from a meme as the worst player in the league to carrying tf outta this team in 4th quarters 😂
"Just got out of jail, is Cameron Payne the best player in the NBA?"

What is Cameron Payne trying to accomplish talking to LeBron lol
He should be suspended for head butting Cameron Payne in game one so I don’t miss him
"These types of foul calls drive me insane. No one who has ever played a second of basketball in their entire life thinks these fouls should be a thing. Offensive players are creating dangerous plays by kicking their legs out like they’re having a seizure and the league does nothing but encourage it.  Edit: the second after I post this comment, Wesley Mathews injures Cameron Payne by shouldering him in the ribs in a completely unnatural shooting motion. And he gets rewarded with the foul call. Absolute insanity."
More like Cameron IN Payne
Cameron Payne looking rough 😭
I just shit myself I swear I thought I saw Cameron Payne in a suns jersey 💀
Oh shit Cameron Payne
Shoutout to my man Cameron fuckin Payne. That guy was playing super confident and would’ve had even two more assists if Crowder made his shots.  Glad he’s found a fit
