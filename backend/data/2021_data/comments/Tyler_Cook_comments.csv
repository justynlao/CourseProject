Their only other option was to let Tyler Ulis cook. I think they made the right choice
I guarantee Tyler Herro's girl can't cook like Ina.
No... A lot of non-point guards score in a very on-ball manner. KD is one such player. Grab the ball at the top of the 3pt line and let him cook. CJ McCollum is another example. Tyler Herro isn't like that. He catches the ball and makes his attack immediately upon the catch or he passes it off. He needs the ball delivered to him in spots he's comfortable playmaking from.
"I think the reason we're interested is bc we have 3 backend roster spots open as of today. We had 3 10-day contracts expiring this weekend.   So yes, ideally we'd love an athletic big, but the real way Sean Marks is looking at it is... would you rather have Blake Griffin or Iman Shumpert? BG or Andre Roberson? BG or Tyler Cook?   So whether he'll get minutes, will be a topic of discussion, but having him on the roster over those other 3 seems like a no brainer."
"Hey, I tried to name a fact about Tyler Cook."
Obviously this team could never compete with the Nets who have both Bruce Brown and Tyler Cook
A trained professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of Tyler preparation.
"If he married Stephen Curry, his name would be Tyler Cook Curry.  That would be funny"
who is tyler cook and should we be scared?
Nuggets legend Tyler Cook
"That's actually Tyler Cook, a player just signed to a 2nd 10 day contract. Bey threw up an 0/8 because he's a bit streaky at times. He got it back together tonight though. also got racked in the nuts by Deni, but he's okay."
haha that's Tyler Cook getting nailed in the face later in the game.  Didn't feel like making another thread for it so i just tacked it on the end of the video.  Moving forward i'm gonna feel inclined to put it in all clips from now on.
Tyler Cook is a good player I hope he finds his footing in the league soon
"They have let Iman Shumpert, Tyler Cook, Norvel Pelle, and Andre Roberson go this year"
Nuggets legend Tyler Cook™
Happy for Nets legend Tyler Cook
Pistons 2021 draft class combined for 73 points tonight.  85 when you add the rookie we signed (Tyler Cook).
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"This season we signed Tyler Cook to a 10 day, he impressed so much we gave him another 10 day, and then a full multi year NBA contract. Dude is a monster attacking the rim. He’s like what we hoped Blake would be"
That's why you don't mess with Tyler Cook. Tyler Cook comes to play!
"My ideal starting 5 for this necessary tank game:  \-Jahlil Okafor  \-Corey Joseph  \-Saben Lee  \-Tyler Cook  \- Servydis Deividas  Just run them for the whole game, that should do it."
"I think one of them is Tyler Cook, who's on the Pistons."
"We have a team option for Tyler Cook. Diallo is indeed a UFA. I wasn’t really thinking the roster in the future, just thinking of the roster as it stands right now."
Assuming you mean Frank Jackson I agree with this but would swap Sirvydis for Diallo and Sekou for Tyler Cook

We’re talking ab individuals and then you bring up the fact that Kuzma tagged along for the ring.. alright man. Never seen Kuzma cook in the playoffs like Tyler has
Tatum Beal McCaw Tyler Cook &amp; Mclemore
And he was just guarded by Luka Garza and Tyler Cook.  He will not be facing poor defenders like that in the NBA on a nightly basis.
No knock on Sengun...but keep in mind he was being guarded by Luka Garza (who can't guard a turtle) and Tyler Cook (who is undersized and not a capable NBA defender).  I would have loved to see Sengun guarded by Isaiah Stewart.
"It’s also the 2nd game of summer league where they aren’t running many plays, Tyler cook and syrvidas are giving him zero help to space the floor looking completely awful, and while learning how to play with another dynamic ball handler. Y’all need to chill."
and Tyler Cook
 Tyler Cook and Luka Garza blew like three layups combined each. You can't always go off assists because Cade was dropping some dimes his teammates just weren't converting.
Tyler cook having the pistons highest plus minus shows how misleading that stat can be
Cade a better man than me cause I wouldn't be dabing up Tyler Cook at all after he been fucking up my assists like he has been.
Tyler Cook is not making himself money this week
Tyler Cook making Cade feel right at home last night
"at 1:18 in the video, standard entry bounce pass into the post, Cook just doesn't catch it. Nothing wrong with the pass.  at 1:28, Tyler Cook calls for the lob and can't finish. Good defensive play by OKC, but Cook probably should finish that one. Chalk it up to good defense.  at 3:37, not a great pass from Cade there, too low for a big man, but it still could have been handled. This one's on Cade.  at 4:05 lofts it up there for Cook nice and soft, and Cook forgets he has hands. Probably not high enough for the oop but still should be an easy basket 9/10 times. Easy dunk or layup that instead was a turnover.  at 4:13 Cade leads Cook in transition on the run with a bounce pass about as well as you can, and Cook can't come up with it cleanly. Had an open lane for a dunk or likely would have been grabbed and fouled."
I thought he had some great feeds. Scrub big man Tyler Cook blew 3-4 easy lob plays.
"Bruh watch most of Cade's turnovers today, 4 out of 5 of them came because Tyler Cook can't catch a pass to save his life."
"Did you watch the game? Tyler Cook 4 passes that would have been wide open dunks/layups. Obviously Cade turned it over a lot, but people aren't saying it for no reason."
He woulda had way more assists had Tyler Cook not had brick hands
I used to feel kinda bad that Tyler Cook got cut. Not anymore.
Good defense but really couldn’t getting it going offensively.   Tyler Cook should never see an NBA court dude dropped like 5 Cade assists just in the 4th
Tyler Cook was the real star tonight. Woke up feeling dangerous.
"This tyler cook guy is awful. No size, no hands, no finishing ability, no defense"
Reminder that Cade will have Jerami Grant and Isaiah Stewart rather than Tyler Cook.
Tyler cook is probably not making the team
"He's fine, his passing has been good but he's no joke had three assists dropped by Tyler Cook right at the basket. He's missed a few open threes and his perimeter defense has been flat out bad. He's still aggressive going to the hoop and still shooting but I think he'll need to demand the ball more. Definitely leaves a lot to be desired but he's also only played short bursts."
Tyler Cook has no business being on an NBA team
The only reason the pistons are losing this game is Tyler Cook
I think it was Tyler cook
Not to mention Tyler Cook is also on the Pistons!
"He basically had free reign in Summer League and he was usually the worst player on the court, which is crazy considering we played Tyler Cook"
Matt Mooney  Malik Newman  J.P Macura  Marques Bolden  Ante Žižić  Tyler Cook  Dean Wade  Sir'Dominic Denzel Pointer  ————————  All of these players were on the same roster. Guess the team and year
Agent does more than just handle your one max contract though…and also Noel bottom of the FA barrel?! He most def was not back then. More just a mid FA not a Tyler Cook - Svi Mykhailiuk type
It’s Tyler Cook lmao
Tyler Cook
"Heat are going to go to the finals again:  1. They have one of the deepest teams  2. Tyler Herro is going to cook bench units alive  3. Kyle Lowry will bring much needed play making.  4. Bam should have taken a huge step forward.  5. Overall, they have no major weaknesses and can match up with anyone in the East."
"I'm 6'6"" and purely in strength, I can hang with the average NBA player. But, when I was an upper classmen in high-school, and in the best shape of my life, and full of that teenager energy, and playing ball 5 or 6 days a week, a couple of prepubescent kids who would go on to play at USC and KState before making it to the NBA could cook me and all of my boys. Anybody who didn't play at least high-major ball that thinks that they have a shot at this feat in a competive scenario is out of their minds.   But, if I had somebody like Bird or LBJ to throw me an outlet on a cherry picker, I might be able to score a bucket. And maybe if I could lob it up from half court to like, Wilt or AD or somebody that could throw down even my high and wide pass, then there's an assist. The rebound would be easier for me than most, since I'm actually comparably tall to perimeter players, but it would still be about 99% luck. Even if I was matched up against Mugsy or like, Tyler Ulis, I wouldn't have much of a chance barring a perfect bounce. Still, I wouldn't say its impossible if your coach and teams goal was to get you your stats."
Lower usage Era buy not necessarily better defensively.  Today you have to cover all 5 positions as a player because most teams have 5 guys who can shoot.  Back then maybe 2 players on the floor at a time could shoot 3s and it's much lower volume.  Also heavy one on one defense equals lower efficiency .  Depends who Tyler has on his team.  The 2021 Heat would cook in that Era. But Tyler alone would probably struggle.
Broadcast clearly didn't plan on Tyler Cook making an appearance as they have said 0 about him
Lmfao. Tyler cook on the bulls also has one
Jimmy butler left so Tyler herro could cook the Lakers
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
