Moses moody is looking like a lottery pick fortunately and unfortunately for the hogs. 1 and done lottery pick has its benefits tho I guess for the program
Moses Moody looks to be getting the respect he deserves as a prospect. Both Mason Jones and Isaiah Joe are already showing promise as second round picks

"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"

"Suggs too. Along with the guys you mentioned are seen as ""can't miss"" guys.

Dlo and Ant gonna give the warriors Moses Moody
Moses Moody ain't going top 10 is he? Dude shit the bed
"The Thunder planned this horribly; they're tanking in a season where there are multiple other teams tanking just as 'effectively' as they are.  Even with how dreadfully awful they have been for the last 25 games, they might end up with the 6th pick in the draft and miss out on both Cunningham and Green.  I don't think people are really going to be rising up out of their seats excitedly when Oklahoma City ends up with Scottie Barnes or Moses Moody."

But I feel like Ash Ketchum in the first episode of Pokemon where he's going through the pros and cons of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander then he just oversleeps and misses out on all three. Welcome to Detroit, Moses Moody. Hopefully Weaver can work his magic."

"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."

"Yes I think trades are likely. However, its not just 2 more young guards, Moody is a 3&amp;D 2/3, so I'm not really sure it's fair to call him a ""guard."" He very much could be in the Oubre role if Oubre leaves. Moses Moody has a 7 foot wingspan.   Second, backup PG I think is a need for your team and I think Davion Mitchell is the most NBA ready one at that pick, especially since he's a very good POA defender, who could sometimes spell Klay and play alongside Steph against smaller lineups. Just my 2c."

"Great player. Not a great fit with the Warriors. I can definitely see him being a future-all star, if he gets the chance, but the Warriors are better off with Moses Moody or James Bouknight"
I don’t really think the best player available vs draft for fit debate is the same for every team. Like the Pistons/Rockets/Cavs would be idiotic to not take any of the top 3 in the draft because of fit simply because none of those teams have an established star. Suns made a correct gamble that Booker would become that Star but it’s entirely different positions. I’d compare their draft situation to one like the Pelicans now. Teams with their “star” that aren’t good but trying to win as soon as possible. In those cases you do want to draft a bit more so for fit but it’s not mutually exclusive. For example I think a player like Moses Moody could be both the best player available and best fit for the Pelicans. As for past Suns picks that didn’t pan out I don’t think that had to do with draft philosophy they just were busts which happens every year.

Moses Moody is nice. I’ve seen him being compared to Middleton and I definitely see it
How the Hawks look with Hunter back. Last series really made me interested in them.   Also as a Arkansas fan I’m excited to see Moses Moody play.

"Lol watch, Draft day comes, and the Raptors are going to trade down with the magic to take both Keon Johnson and Moses moody"
"Nobody is coping we were fucking debating about Keon Johnson vs Moses Moody before the lottery, we’re going to turn Suggs into an All-Star."
Nazreon Reid  Moses Moody  Bol Bol  Udonis Haslem
I think Giddey (and honestly all of the other jumbo playmaker wings like Wagner and Jalen Johnson) will be off the table by then. Giddey is pretty heavily mocked for Indiana.   I’ve seen Davion Mitchell and Moses Moody mocked to you all and they seem pretty solid as high floor prospects who could give you all some Immediate depth. Not high on Moody that much anymore since he’s bit undersized to be a 3&amp;D wing but yeah
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
I've seen a lot of mocks that have GSW taking Davion Mitchell at #7 and Moses Moody at #14. In the worst-case scenario where they can't get a trade and Oubre walks then it fills out their depth with some high-floor rookies.  PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole  SF: Wiggins / Toscano  PF: Draymond / Moody  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid roster - definitely some concerns about injuries and age but if the dubs Core 3 hits that spark again then there's enough ammo for one last run.
"Trade one of them, maybe with Wiseman and S&amp;T Oubre for some veteran help. If you trade 14, Davion Mitchell or Bouknight would be nice at 7. If you trade 7, I think Moses Moody or Usman Garuba would be perfect at 14. I guess it would depend on who you get in the trade though."
"I'd take this package as a piston fan for Jerami Grant. I don't think the Raptors make this move as I think they are very close to the playoffs again being back in Toronto and adding a Suggs in the draft. The pistons, on the other hand, could greatly benefit from capitalizing on Grant's value while adding young assets. Mostly, I'd be excited about getting the 7th pick and potentially adding someone like Moses Moody."
"It likely wouldn't be kuminga with that pick and we'd be gambling on wiseman who hasn't looked good. Just doesn't seem worth it to lose pascal for a pick that'd be like moses moody or something, if this was a top 4 pick in this draft sure it makes more sense"

"Moses Moody at 7 seems like the consensus unless one of the top 5 guys falls out of the first 6. At 14 I think it varies a lot. Some guys want Ziaire Williams, others want someone like Trey Murphy"
Moses Moody
I like Moses Moody and Ziaire Williams. I think that Williams has the potential to be something special after a year or two of development. Moody is a solid day one player.
Just be happy we are not debating between Davion Mitchell and Moses Moody
Give me Moses Moody who was literally Cade’s HS teammate
"Yeah this draft really deep. I’m really high on Moses moody who predicted to go around 12. 6,6 with a 7ft wingspan great defensive potential still a lot of work on his overall scoring tho"
"&gt; On KOC’s mock draft, he compares him to Sabonis, Vucevic, and Enes Kanter. Honestly, feels like they just picked three bigs who weren’t originally from america  Yup. Also see them comparing Giddey to Joe Ingles, and Moses Moody to other guys with long arms"
They should take Moses Moody and Corey Kispert
"I prefer Moses over Davion. Davion's shooting last year looks like the definition of an outlier season. His FT shooting has progressively degenerated from bad (67%) to worse (60%). Meanwhile Moses is a great shooter and has good size and defensive instincts.   I'd take Moody, then Wagner, then Bouknight, then Barnes, then Davion, in order of preference"
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Except it's not that deep. Great top 4, steep drop off after that. Scottie Barnes and Moses Moody are not franchise changers."
"Mobley has a good chance to be the best defender, Moses Moody looks like a classic 3&amp;D type dude"
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Honestly, I think most Thunder fans are so focused on praying they get two Top 5 picks in the lottery, they haven’t bothered thinking about later picks. But personally, I hope they get a wing. I like trying to trade up for Moses Moody in the late lottery, but there have also been rumors that Presti gave a promise to Chris Duarte.  EDIT: As for picks in the 20s, Jalen Johnson seems like the high-upside, low-floor pick Presti likes to take chances on."
moses moody?
Moses Moody for Kyle Anderson ?
That’s like finding out Moses Moody becomes a superstar for the wizards and leads them to a title
"Don’t know much about high school basketball but it seems like Montverde is the most stacked basketball school. Cade Cunningham played with Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, DayRon Sharpe (all R1 picks) and Houstan who will be a R1 pick next year."
Moses Moody.
*Moses Moody liked this.*
I wonder if he would fight a Moody Moses
"Carlisle traditionally has not played rookies and Duarte is about the highest floor prospect in the draft. He'll be able to slide in and contribute immediately.  When you're as ""win-now"" as the Pacers are it doesn't really bode well for player development so getting a plug-and-play like Duarte makes a lot of sense for us.   I was high on either Franz Wagner or Josh Giddey but both of those guys were off the board by then. A couple of guys in a similar vein to Duarte that were available were Corey Kispert and Moses Moody.   Apparently GSW really wanted Duarte since they're trying to make the most of the rest of their core's prime."
"Oh yeah, and Moses Moody is also a young SG with a great three point shot drafted in the lottery, with a long 7'0 wingspan that can make him a quality defender, so he may get benched this season if Moses Moody overachieves..."
For all OP knows Moses really is Moody.
Who is Moses Moody?     /S
Buddy Cleveland drafted Evan Mobley not Moses moody
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey
"A: Jalen Green B: Davion Mitchell C: Moses Moody D: Alperen Sengun E: Usman Garuba  PG: Mitchell, SG: Green, SF: Moody, PF: Garuba, C: Sengun  Wasn't even trying to go all-in on the Rockets boys, it just worked out that way."
Bro I somehow didn't even include his name 😂😂 i was talking about Moses Moody.  I feel stupid as fuck right now lmao
Moses moody will be a great player in the Warriors' system.
"It's honestly not surprising how awesome Jonathan Kuminga has looked.  Actually, IIRC we were both on the same mindset that JK was the best BPA at the 6th spot, and I said it was basically set in stone not drafting him would be a huge mistake.  &gt;I just don’t get it, he clearly is good at basketball, he’s not some uncoordinated bumbling doofus, he was playing against grown professionals on the worst team in the league and took a ton of shots he probably shouldn’t have been taking. Dude is great at drawing contact, has shown the ability to create his own shot from anywhere on the floor, he’s just an awesome prospect IMO. Barnes has way more question marks imo, I’d take Kuminga 10/10 over him, but I also totally understand why teams like Barnes.   &gt;   &gt;What’s the argument for anyone else over Kuminga? Sengun is the only one I can make an argument for, and he might not even go top 10. Bouk has the same problems as Kuminga except he’s older and has lesser physical tools, Moody is way more limited, Mitchell is older and lower upside, who’s the guy that’s going over Kuminga at 5 or 6  [https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA\_Draft/comments/oqxo2y/hedo\_on\_a\_mission\_he\_predicts\_sengun\_at\_8/h6fi9cu?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/oqxo2y/hedo_on_a_mission_he_predicts_sengun_at_8/h6fi9cu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  To be honest, I really don't understand why OKC chose Giddey over JK. I wonder if it's something we'll look back from years from now on. GSW lucked out drafting someone like JK and Moses Moody though, they got two excellent two-way wings that could definitely help fit and establish their death line up 2.0"
"Was super high on him last year during the draft cycle. You see how Mikal Bridges has evolved into a highly impactful player and one of the best 3&amp;D prospects of the past few years, then you see how Vassell was putting up similar numbers to Bridges' age 21 dominant junior season while he was a 19 year old sophomore. Plus he was showing shot-creation growth in his second year of college. I think *low-end* he's a premier 3&amp;D wing, high-end he's a All-Star shot creator &amp; lockdown defender.  Similar rationale is also why I'm high on Moses Moody even though this question isn't about rookies."
"When you look at Mody Moody, Mody…Mooses…Mooses (Moses Malone!) Mo-Moses Moody"
Throwing my allowance on Moses moody roty
Moses Modi... Moody Mouses
"Hell yeah. Here's hoping this is a big ol' win-win. Moody gets to be on a good team with Steph and Klay and hopefully have his quality Summer League performances transfer over to the regular season, and the Razorbacks can use his success for recruiting purposes.  It's really nice that Muss can tell future prospects that they can come be a one-and-done at Arkansas and still get drafted high by a quality team like Moses Moody did. Also doesn't hurt that Portis, Gafford, and Beverly all are doing well these days, with Portis having just won a title :)"
Seriously if anything I can’t help but laugh when I see Moses moody and think of perk’s variations. definitely not an annoyed feeling

"from the play on the court to the 20 minute late start to that garbage moses moody interview in the huddle to these garbage split-screen interviews during the game, this is without a doubt the worst basketball game i have ever watched"
"&gt;  and looking at our 2015/16 squads, we had Barbosa/Livingston/Iguodala/Speights/Ezeli coming off the bench with some David Lee, Ian Clark etc.  &gt; The only player who could be on that level next year is Poole, if he keeps developing. JTA is a good piece but he's more of a Draymond and needs people to work with. We also don't have a big as talented or important as Bogut  Poole? Are you fucking serious? You also have Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr., Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga, Bjelica, and Looney. That’s very comparable to what you had then."
"Cade, Scottie Barnes, and Moses Moody were in 1 team in highschool. That's pretty crazy"
"IMHO, the Raptors should absolutely do a trade like this:  GSW get: - Siakam  Raptors get: - Wiseman - Kuminga - Moses Moody - Wiggins (balance the salaries)  Wiggins' contract will be over in two seasons, and next season it'll be a tradable asset. The Raptors could get a lot of young talent to build around and make OG, FVV, and Scottie the main stars.  Hell, the Raptors could send Dragic to the Warriors, as well."
"It was [a profile](https://theathletic.com/2754000/2021/08/08/warriors-moses-moody-summer-league-49ers-sunday-randomness/) in The Athletic, so there's a paywall."
Spell his name right OP it's Mody Mooses Moses Mody Mooses Moody
Moody Mobley? Moses Moobly?
"Nobody is saying that, Moses Moody had a similar stat line in his summer league game (19/7/2) and he also got a post like this."
Yep same exact thing with Moses Moody. He really barely showed any real defensive upside at Arkansas but everyone's thinks he has huge defensive potential just because he has a 7ft wingspan as a 6'4 wing.
"Wait I’m sorry, I thought his name was pronounced Modey Moo Moh Moh Mosey I mean Moses Moody"
Moses Moody will play his entire career for GSW end of conversation.
Moses moody
"Who's gonna have the better career?  James Bouknight, Joshua Primo or Moses Moody?"
* PG - Stephen Curry * SG - Anthony Edwards * SF - Kevin Durant * PF - Jayson Tatum * C - Anthony Davis * Zach Lavine * Donovan Mitchell * Bam Adebayo * Zion Williamson * Cade Cunningham * Moses Moody * Trae Young
Bulls are the jazz of the East this year and grab the 1st seed.  Moses Moody wins ROTY for golden state as they take the 2nd seed in the west
"I still don't get the Kuminga pick honestly.  Sure he was ""BPA"" but he's definitely the biggest project in the lottery and absolutely does not fit the Warriors timeline. I personally would have gone with Wagner because like Moses Moody he's a guy that can hit the floor running immediately.  I know that GSW was heavily gunning for Duarte but we nipped that in the bud pretty quick lol."
All he has to do is pronounce Moses moody
I think it’s moody Moses !
Upcoming entry:  Moses Moody: Mody Mooses
"Maybe. My point is that the Pacers could have taken Duarte at 22, and used 13 on a younger player like Moses Moody"
It's Moses Moody for gods sake Perk!
"Morey rn is asking for Klay, Kuminga, and picks. Warriors probably will entertain a package of Wiggins, 2 of Wiseman, Moses of moody mod moses, or Kuminga. Throw in a pick. Needs a 3rd team."
Lmfaooo that Draymond layups sequence has the same vibes as Perkins tryna say Moses Moody
"20 years from now:   &gt; Moses Moody has announced his retirement after an illustrious two-decade career, spanning 5 All-NBA selections, 4 Finals appearances, 2 championships, and a Finals MVP.  **u/Diggg_it** 10842 points  Modey Moosey"
Moses Moody sounds like a good name for a rapper
His nickname should be mody moodsy mody mood m-mody mooses mody mooses mody mmo- MOSES MOODY.
"This my ""Spurs-like"" wet dream. Curry winning FMVP at age 38 with multi-time all star Jonathan Kuminga, all-NBA James Wiseman, and 2xAll Star Moses Moody with 6MOY winning Jordan Poole to get Curry his 6th championship."
Edit:. Not Kai but Moses Moody
We did draft Moses Moody with that exact intention
"While they will have to prove they can stay available and can still perform I *love* the Otto Porter and Bjelica signings.  It was super obvious how crunched the floor was for the Warriors starting lineup and how hard that made it on them offensively. A team with Curry shouldn't be in the middle of the pack offensively, of course when Curry sat the team had a ridiculously low offensive rating.  Now it sounds like Oubre will be gone, maybe a sign and trade if we are lucky, and both Porter and Bjelica can shoot.  Moses Moody projects to have a wet shot, Poole is starting to look like a future 6MOY, then you add Klay on top and I really see the potential for the Warriors to be better than expected next season.  Too bad they couldn't swing Mills, he would have been a huge get as a quality back up PG, something we really haven't had since Livingston."
Time to trade for Moses Moody
No idea why they picked Mitchell either lol. Could have taken Moses Moody or Ziaire Williams or some other good wing. Kangz I suppose.
Moody Moses
Bi-polar for moses moody.

He’s not getting a better role with the Lakers. Unless somehow he was afraid of getting beat out by Moses Moody. Does have a better shot at a ring though

Moses moody isn't pro ready  And posts this shit lmao
"Warriors gonna have to throw in some 1st rounders to make it more balanced, hell they might gotta throw in Jordan Poole or Moses Moody in there too"
Don't s*** on moldy Moses.  Moody moldy is a future goat
"&gt; Moses Moody at $2,968,400 would work.  That was a lot of work for a great punchline. Thanks for the info, I did not know that and will most likely forget it."
"Since Warriors are over the luxary cap then they can only take on 125% of outgoing salary + $100k.  So you just find out how much Jerami Grant makes next year: $20,002,500.  Then you find out how much Wiseman and Kuminga make next year:  $9,166,800 + $4,555,300 = $13,722,000.  Then you take the higher salary, subtract $100k and divide by 1.25: ($20,002,500 - $100,000)/1.25 = $15,922,000. Which is $2.2M more than Wiseman and Kuminga's combined salaries.  So, yeah. Gotta send filler. Or Moses Moody at $2,968,400."

Moses Moody over Kispert any day. Moody is pretty NBA ready for being 19.
"Kuminga would’ve been the top pick in next years draft.  He reclassified to go pro early, he should’ve been a HS senior this last season.  They got a lot of value in him and Moses Moody is the exact type of player who can step in immediately.  They’re not asking Kuminga to lead the team, they still have Steph, Wiggy, Dray and Klay"
"Woj doesn’t have sources? MTII also:    *They were ready to take Arkansas' Moses Moody at No. 7. But as the whispers suggested, Jonathan Kuminga, once considered a top-five pick, was sliding a bit. When Kuminga fell to the Warriors, they went ahead and jumped on the good fortune. The picks of Josh Primo and Ziaire Williams pushed some of their desire players down the board. Moody fell right to them. Based on their board, they essentially got two top-seven picks.*"
"On the third one, it sounds like he ends Moody and Moses with a question mark"
"He's gonna be Mody Moodsy when he plays like shit, and Moses Moody when he plays well, then back to Mody Moodsy when he plays REALLY well"
"Moses Moody, Jericho Sims, Day’Ron Sharpe"
"No, it’s a bad pick because they already have the back court of the future in Fox and Hali.. there are still better prospects at the wing and forwards like Zhaire Williams, Moses Moody, Chris Duarte and big like Kai Jones or Alperen Sengun on the board..  Davion is not gonna be effective next to Fox and Hali and that is just not gonna help the Kings nor Davion develop anything"
"It was honestly pretty hilarious watching him fuck up again and again, the Moses moody flub had me rolling"
"Adam $$$ilver rigged this year's draft, all so we could pick Moses Moody at #14"
I feel like we haven’t had a Moses since Moses Malone until Moses Brown last year and now we got both Brown and Moody
"Dude spent like 8 picks in a row telling teams to draft Moses moody and then stroked out when he actually got drafted lmao  Also he knows like 5 players and just talks about them the whole time, I think he wanted golden state to look at the center who got drafted like 29th with pick 7"
Absolute steal with Moses Moody...wtf dubs got their guys
Moses Moody is such a good name.
Moooosy mody mosy moody moody moses
"In the book of Moody Moses, where Moses was just really passive aggressive to the other Israelites."
Moses Moody sounds like someone who’s gonna be Kentavious Caldwell-Pope type of player. Remind me in 3 years.
Moses Moody ROTY
"Difference being that this year GS has Moses Moody.  Very bold to call LAC a ""lock"" over them and Portland, imo...  A lot riding on PG13's shoulders."
"They’d look worse. Brooks would be a great get, Ben would be redundant with Draymond on the team.   Plus, if I’m them I am *not* racing to get rid of Moses Moody or Wiseman. Wiseman’s value has never been lower, and he still retains all the upside he had pre-draft"
"He’s just another role player. He’s not bad. But teams tend to over react to their bench talent.   Talen Horton-Tucker really is just a regular bench guy, same way Alex Caruso is, same way that Poole is. They’re not bad players and they’re not busts or anything. But they’re literally 12-15 minute a game guys and nothing more.   It’s okay to like role players but we don’t have to hype them up as way more than they really are.   Food for thought: Poole played last year. He’s probably not better than Klay Thompson and Moses Moody so I don’t know how many minutes he even gets this year on a WINNING warriors team.  Any role player can score 12 a night on a losing team"
"I just saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/ojqmu3/nba_mock_draft_based_on_vegas_odds/) on nba draft vegas odds that some people probably bet money on Moses Moody getting drafted before 13. I just hope this doesn't become an addiction, because sooner or later some people are going to lose a lot of money"
"Moses Moody was not drafted for his potential, he was drafted as an NBA ready body who can help space the floor and defend.  Kuminga is the raw pick."
Moses moody and kuminga more than likely aren’t gonna be good. They’re both very raw rookies who were drafted for their potential. And yeah Steph Curry and green is nowhere near KD harden and kyrie
"Healthy Klay, Curry, Green, Kuminga and Moses Moody doesn’t beat the Nets?  Healthy Murrary, Joker, MPJ, Gordon and Barton don’t bear the Nets?"
His brain melted trying to say Moses Moody during the draft.
"Wonder how the fit with Moody Moses, Moose’s Mody, or Moses Moody is with Embiid or Wall?"

Do you ever have a dreams that Modey Moosey... Modey ... M-M-Modey.. Moosey.. M-Modey... Mosey.. Moses Moody do you so much you can do anything?
"Moses Moody, Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham, Caleb Houstan.  That’s a loaded HS team.  No wonder 6’8 Cade wanted to be PG"
"I swear to god I'm developing a rare form of dyslexia where I cannot even read ""Moses Moody"" correctly.  Every time I look I see ""Moody Mosey"" or something like that."
I still can’t hear the names moses moody without perk yelling Modey Mooses in my head
"I’m placing bets on Moses Moody, Mossy Mods, Moody Mooses, and Moises Moddy. Gotta play the field and hope on pulls through."
Cunningham got called Cum-in-hand by one of the summer league commentators too.   Moses Moody got off lightly being called Mody Mooses by Kendrick Perkins.
"It’s pretty weird to look back at peoples opinions when he was drafted.  It’s just arguing about who’s going to be best between Okafor, Embiid and Noel.  Basketball is strange like that, some people thought Okafor was the best prospect in 2015 and hindsight tells us you’d rather have Cam Payne who was drafted at 14 than have Okafor.  It’s just really weird.  Like can you guys imagine if 6 years from now were like “wow it’s no wonder Jalen Green is out of the league.  I would have even rather had Moses Moody.” It just feels totally alien today even though this sort of thing could happen again."
"James Wiseman definitely. His biggest problem was on the defensive side, as raw as he was he still got buckets on the back of his physical gifts and he also shows the potential to have a real jump shot.   Jordan Poole, the Warriors 2019 28th pick, took a massive leap from his terrible rookie season. In his rookie season injuries forced him into heavy playing time he wasn't ready for and he put up some of the worst numbers in the league for any player getting regular minutes.   His shooting splits his rookie year were 33/28/80, contributing 8.8 points a game. He reportedly is one of the hardest workers on the roster and the next season, especially in the back half, he was a really effective NBA player and a much needed offensive outlet next to Curry.  That 2nd year his splits improved dramatically, 43/35/88, scoring went up to 12ppg while playing (slightly) less minutes. He had some great games and some great highlights. In the 2nd to last game of the season the Warriors sat Curry, Draymond and Wiggins. [Poole dropped 38 on the Pelicans.](https://youtu.be/xAGf5WjekW8)  Then this season they drafted probably the most athletic young player in the 2021 draft, Jonathan Kuminga. He doesn't have a jump shot (though the form looks OK), he's pretty raw but he has tremendous upside. He also has shown a little bit of an ability to pass, which for a guy like him who will likely be drawing help defenders, is an important ability.   [This was the Summer League highlight that probably shows off his potential the best.](https://youtu.be/mYdEFa95r2I) Crosses up his defender, takes off from right inside the free throw line, launches, hangs, and throws down a monster jam.   Finally there is Moses Moody, who the Warriors selected with the 14th pick. A young player with good length, Moody projects to be a good to elite shooter in the league, has the length to defend multiple positions, and most importantly for the Dubs right now has a natural feel for the game. He's only got average athleticism but he's no Duncan Robinson. Last season showed the Warriors how important it is to have guys who are feared outside the 3pt line, that early season lineup was barely middle of the pack **offensively** when Curry was on the floor (which is crazy) and historically bad when Curry was off the floor.  Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody can become great players. I think the Warriors *nailed* the 2021 draft. A great high ceiling player and a more win now player who still has a good ceiling. They brought on some of the best player development coaches in the world this off season, including Kenny Atkins, Jama Mahlalela  and DeJan Milojević.   These young players are all on long rookie deals and those kinds of high upside cost controlled contracts are so important for a team like the Warriors who already have a veteran core making big money.   People are severely underestimating what the Warriors can accomplish over the next several season."
"I swear we haven’t had a Moses in the league since Moses Malone and now we about to have 3 Moses of Brown, Moody and Wright"
Woah. Didn't know Moody Moses had hype coming outta HS.
"&gt;If Andrew Wiggins went back as the best current player and the money to make the deal work, the reward for Philly would, or could, be some combination of 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, and 2021 lottery picks Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.  lmao?!"
"MVP: Steph Curry  MIP: Jordan Poole  6MOTY: Jordan Poole  ROY: Moses Moody  COTY: Steve Kerr  EOTY: Bob Myers  &amp;#x200B;  J.k, 6MOTY probably goes to Clarkson and I reckon 6MOTY to Cade."
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."

Poole is great and will probably contend for 6moty, but JTA is 28, he's not gonna get a whole lot better.  &gt; let's not forget the 2 steals of the draft-kuminga and moses moody  I like these guys as prospects, but they're just rookies. And Kuminga will likely see time in the G-League and not be an immediate contributor."
"It's not just klay. I think warriors will be dangerous with or without klay next year. With iguodala back for more vets prescence, and 2 40% deep shooters signing in Bjelica and otto porter jr. that steph desperately needed for the floor spacing, great role players/stars developing in JTA and poole. This team will surprise people for sure imo  let's not forget the 2 steals of the draft-kuminga and moses moody, which warriors just so happens to pick up both."
"Honestly, based on the title I thought he was just gonna go back to mispronouncing ""Moses Moody"" again."
While I would have liked to see the Warriors play in the playoffs I don't think that roster was built to go deep and it gave us Moses Moody at 14.
"""mody moodsy mody mood m-mody mooses mody mooses mody mmo- MOSES MOODY"""
Why the fuck would we give up Mody Moody Moses or Kuminga for Simmons? All that for a guy that’s not even a good fit.
So we can get moments like this: [Moses Moody](https://youtu.be/dDGCqmBtpqI)
Also the whole “Moses moody” fiasco. Teaching the analysts how to say the names of draft picks should be the absolutely minimum.
Moses Moody
Seeing him fail to pronounce Moses Moody is one of my favorite all time clips
"And the dude fucking stutters! No offense to stutterers. But Perk's a TV ""analyst"" with bad takes and bad stutter. Mody Mooses, Moody Moses, Mowses Mowdi."
Moses Moody will help the Warriors more than both this season

"Every time I read Moses Moody I just start to laugh, this has continued since draft night."
"Moses Moody on seeing Ben Simmon's jumper: ""Man, it looks different in person, that was obviously my first time seeing it. But watching that repetition, that exact same shot every one, I mean I sat there &amp; watched him shoot for 20 minutes, and it didn't touch the rim a lot, I can tell you that."""
"Moses Moody on seeing Kelvin Benjamin’s eating: “Man, it looks different in person, that was obviously my first time seeing it. But watching that repetition, that exact same spoonful every one, I mean I sat there &amp; watched him eat for 20 minutes, and he didn’t put the spoon down a lot, I can tell you that.”"
I'm here for the obligatory Fuck Kendrick Perkins comment on every Moses Moody thread. Mf spoiled this guy's name in my mind.
"I simply cannot read ""Moses Moody"" without hearing Kendrick Perkins trying to say it."
"Moody Mo, Modi Moody, Mooses Moody, Mooses Modie, Mody Moses, and Moody Moosy"
Perk couldn’t even pronounce Moses moody we would be doomed
That’s why he couldn’t say Moses Moody
ESPN is banking on him going full Moses moody every segment
You mean Moses Moody
Perk is still trying to pronounce Moses Moody.
"Idk, but all I know is that Alex Caruso and Moses Moody have to be on the g league or on 2-way contracts of that squad or something"
He can’t even say Moses Moody
"&gt; bench = supporting cast  No, bench specifically refers to…the bench.   &gt; And what exactly did the Warriors do this offseason? Get back 38yo Iggy? Sign Otto Porter while losing Oubre?  Drafted Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. Signed Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and Andre Iguodala.   &gt;  No one seriously thinks Warriors got better if we don't factor in Klay yet.  They improved significantly. You can’t seriously think Oubre, Bazemore, Paschall, and Wanamaker contribute more to winning than OPJ, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica, and Iguodala…"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
One day Moses Moody will get there
moses moody praying yall get ahead by 20 or down by 20 so he can get some minutes lmao
Shout out Moses moody with the 46 seconds
"Pretty funny but it's a tougher than you would think for these guys. They've grown up being the hero baller on every team they've played for that could singlehandedly win a game with two on them.  The guy who's coach said ""just give ANT the ball and watch"". I knew a guy who played against Moses Moody in high school and that was literally their only game plan. Learning to trust your teammates when you've only played with bums (comparably, not actually) can be tough."
"24/7 Sports Composite has Bronny ranked #38 in his class. Probably not one-and-done unless he improves significantly, but let’s not act like he has no shot at making it to the NBA. Moses Moody was #46 in the 2020 class and ended up being a lottery pick after 1 year."
"It's me, Moses Moody"

You mean Moody Moses
Moses Moody got the W
Moses Moody won his game
Jordan Poole / Moses Moody / Jonathon Kuminga / James Wiseman
"This is going to sound very reactionary and hot take-y, but I think the Warriors could legitimately win 60 games. A lot went wrong this game; huge size mismatch, fouling way too much, sloppy turnovers, and an off night shooting for Steph, LeBron and AD dominated the game. Plus the only true center on the team will be out for at least the next month, and their second best scorer is out probably even longer.  But this team already has a lot of chemistry. The collective IQ is clearly at the same level as the Strength in Numbers Warriors, they have the personnel to put at least 4 shooters on the floor at all times, the passing and vision from everyone is there, and despite the off night Steph is still very much an MVP caliber player. Jordan Poole looks like the real deal albeit still figuring it out, and Moses Moody looks like he fits right in already.  This team is good, and if they sustain it, they're a top 3 team in the West, maybe the league."

"Give an inch to Moses Moody, two inches to Kuminga, and the other two inches to Draymond."
"I, like many Pacers fans at the time, really wondered why we selected Chris Duarte over Moses Moody on draft night. But Duarte has been really impressive over summer league and preseason. Can’t wait to watch this guy get better!"
Makes sense. Moses Moody is just a younger and better version of him at this point.
"Moses [""when you look at mody moosy mody moo mo mody mooses mody mooses mody what he did at the mo moses moody what he did in college""](https://youtu.be/dDGCqmBtpqI) Moody"
"Moozis ""Moses Moody"" Modey"
"Sierra Canyon is stacked. They had Moses Moody, BJ Boston, KJ Martin, Zaire Williams and Scottie Pippen Jr all on the team the last few years. Essentially if you were not a future NBA player you haven’t gotten much playing time recently. That makes it hard to evaluate players like Zaire Wade and Bronny who might’ve dominated at a smaller school but didn’t get much playing time here. I believe Bronny has been an underclassmen and is now going into his junior or senior year so it’s not a big deal that he hasn’t played but it would be if he doesn’t get playing time now."
"the 2019/20 Montverde Academy team with Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, Dayron Sharpe, Moses Moody, Caleb Houstan (projected 2022 lottery pick) surely stand a chance"
"Moses Moody is legit. He's not as flashy as Kuminga but he does a lot of things well, especially things that Steve Kerr really likes, and it looks like our offense makes sense to him in a way that it didn't to our most recent crop of rookies (Poole in his first season, Wiseman, etc). I would not be surprised if he was getting end-of-rotation minutes by the end of the season. Will he have a better career than Wiseman or Kuminga? IDK but he'll be more useful to the team this season and next, probably."

"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
"You guys are really managing to have both the present and the future covered with the young players you've got...   Jordan Poole, Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Wiseman"
Ironically the best type of player that would fit perfectly with suggs would be someone like moses moody which is a guy we passed on in the draft.
"Although it’s one game.. our bench shooting looking real nice too. Nemanja, Otto, Damion, and Mulder. And then there’s rookie Moses Moody who’ll only prob play garbage time for now but may eventually get in rotation."
"Warriors got Moses Moody cause of it, so there is some silver lining amongst that horrible horrible shot"
"Other than my own team I’d say bulls, Lakers and warriors (specifically Moses Moody and whenever Klay comes back)"
Him thinking the Perk Moses Moody slip up is the funniest thing in the world and making reference and bad impressions of it on multiple pods is the most cornball shit. Agree with OP as well

Curious about Moses Moody now
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
"I want to preface this by saying I don't want to trade Myles at all. That being said, I like the idea of Andrew Wiggins and Moses Moody was who I originally wanted us to draft. So IF we had to trade Myles, I could see a Myles + Lamb for Wiggins + Moody deal working out. Duarte and Wiggins would help cover up Sabonis defensively, plus we'd have some young guys with potential in Moody and Jackson."
LMAO Moses Moody the rookie needs to be freed?
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
You forgot Rookie of the Year. Moses Moody poised for a breakout
Something that people are not realizing is that warriors are this good AND THEY HAVE ASSETS TO TRADE FOR A STAR.  They're not rebuilding. Curry has a few years of primetime left. They're gunning for another ring.   They can trade:  - Wiseman - Kuminga - Moses Moody - Picks  For just about any star or fringe star in the league. Minnesota is dumb enough to give them KAT for all these rookies and a pick. Hell they could just give back Wiggins. There's so many options.   AND KLAY HASN'T EVEN COME BACK. If Klay is 70% of what he was before it's over.
Moses Moody has the largest forehead I have ever seen for a guy that young
Something something pig wants syrup - Moses Moody.
"Is there any universe where this goes through?   Warriors get:  * Dejounte Murray   * Jakob Poeltl   Spurs get:  * Jordan Poole  * James Wiseman  * Jon Kuminga   * Moses Moody  The Warriors get two fantastic players for their youth. Spurs get an injection of young talent. I know the Spurs want to try to compete while Pop is around, but is this a good trade on paper in your opinion?"
Best I can do is Modi Mooses? Moody Moses?
Every time I see the name Moses Moody I can only think about Kendrick Perkins mispronouncing his name for literally five seconds in a row. One of the funniest clips of all time.
"ESPN: ""All NBA players are pigs"" - Moses Moody"
Downvote all you want but Mobley and Barnes are absolutely better players.  Mobley was a freak in college and Barnes was more hidden by his coach as they had a deep team.  Meanwhile Cade Cunningham wanted Isaac Likekele to run the team.  The only worse 1st rd pick was Moses Moody because at least Cade will have a long NBA career.  But he’s a top pick so it will end up being below expectations.

"People gonna clown Perkins for messing up an easy name, but if you look at how English phrases adjectives and nouns, the adjective usually come before noun.  So ""Moody Moses"" as opposed to ""Moses Moody"" could be how his brain processed it at first and Perkins tried to fix it but man, he might've eaten too many chicken wings before doing this broadcast."

Coming into the league with a good spot up jumper will make him a great fit next to an established #1 scorer. He should be able to contribute to a team day one as a 3 &amp; D wing with the potential to grow into more as he develops. Moses Moody isn’t the most explosive athlete in the gym, however his 7 foot wingspan allows him to fill the athleticism gap with top end wing length. This length allowed him to average nearly 6 total rebounds per game at Arkansas (2 offensive RPG), shoot over defenders, and be a plus defender. On defense Moody is a sticky defender who has the tools and potential to be a big factor for the team that selects him. Moody plays defense with active hands and has the defensive instincts that make him a good team defender. It is rare not to see him crowding the space the space of opposing ball handlers, a sign of someone confident in their defensive ability.   Moody may never be the type of player capable of putting a franchise on his back and carrying them to a championship but I believe he will be the type of player that you can feel confident about on the floor in the deciding minutes of a playoff game. As we just saw in the 2021 NBA Finals, those players can be the difference between holding up the Larry Obrien and catching slander on every form of media for a few days. If I could decide where to put Moses Moody, I would send him to the Golden State Warriors. That would be scary.  &amp;#x200B;  More words here:  https://www.picknscroll.com/2021/07/2021-nba-draft-3-prospects-to-watch.html"
"""Kuminga has no intangibles""   me: fuck this shit they're called that for a reason   ""Moses Moody has intangibles""   me: oh shit he's got intangibles, great pick!"
Someone please clip and post Perk trying to say Moses Moody
"moosey, modess moody, moses mose, moo, mose moo, moses moody"
"They have Sabonis, Turner, Levert and Brogdan. Better to compete now. It’s not like taking Moses Moody would make it so they didn’t have to rebuild in the future. The rebuild is coming in the future, one way or another. There’s no one they could’ve picked here who would’ve made it so they don’t have to at some point in the future."

MOSES MOODY STILL ON THE BOARD?!
Wow. I really thought Moses Moody was the pick for them.
Man I really wanted the grizz to get Moses Moody
I'm Moses Moody ready
"the Grizzlies have made so many great picks recently that I want to give them benefit of the doubt, but I really don't get this one when Moses Moody is right there"
I want Moses Moody in Charlotte
I was hoping Sacramento picked him to keep him away from you guys but damn Morant/Bouknight would be a deadly backcourt. Or if not Bouknight Moses Moody
Kings better pick Moses moody or Sengun here.
Moses moody and Sharpe too
Moses Moody and because I’m an Arkansas fan. Can kinda compare his game to Middletons.
Sources say Moses Moody going 1st overall
"According to the draft combine measurements, Bouknight is 6'3.5"" without shoes and 6'4.75"" in shoes with a wingspan of 6'8.25"" and 190lb.  That's why I was higher on Moses Moody this year, who is 6'4.5"" without shoes, 6'6"" in shoes, weighing 210lb, and with a 7'0.75"" wingspan.  I can't seem to find Suggs on the combine list so I guess he didn't do the combine, but according to nbadraft.net, Suggs measured in at 6'3"" barefoot, 6'4"" in shoes, 194lb, with a 6'5"" wingspan in 2018. So it depends on how much he grew in the past three years, but I can definitely see him growing past Bouknight in that time.  Shit. I guess Suggs is bigger than Bouknight."
"love the moses moody take, not sure why you have mobley and cade in a tier above jalen green though"
1. Jalen Green  2. Cade Cunningham  3. Franz Wagner  4. Evan Mobley  5. Davion Mitchell  6. Alperen Sengun  7. Jalen Suggs  8. Jared Butler  9. Sharife Cooper  10. Moses Moody
moses moody &amp; suggs will have the best careers bouknight will be a beast too
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor

With #5 I'm almost certain it'll be Scottie Barnes because of how much our FO values character. With #8 it depends on OKC and GSW but my guess is the pick will be Moses Moody.
so many good names. moses moody and bones hyland are my favs.
Moses Moody is gonna be the steal of the draft.
"You guys honestly could even be in a position to trade back.  From pick 6 on a lot of teams want specific players but that’s where things kind of explode.  Moses Moody, Franz Wagner, Jonathan Kuminga, Bouknight.  I could see you guys getting a lot of value for that 6th pick.  You figure that 6th pick is what, a 3rd or 4th pick most years?"
If this is the case guessing they are looking at Moses Moody or Davion Mitchell
Moses Moody and Ziaire Williams
moses moody will be special
i know hes projected lottery so not really a steal but whoever gets moses moody is getting the best player in the draft
I think everyone will say Moses Moody should’ve been a top 5 pick looking back at this draft. Josh Primo and Kessler Edwards are my pick for steals.
**Hungry Division**  Moses Moody  Feron Hunt  Cade Cunningham
"Moses moody, josh giddey at 7."
Wait until Hield underperforms and doesn’t meet the ridiculous expectations set on him by sports media. We’ll enjoy Moses Moody and Jared Butler
"It's probably more picks and someone like Bazley going the other way. I still think that the pressure is on Cleveland to win relatively soon and they could do with a guy like Jerome or Kenny Hustle off the bench. Nothing spectacular but just solid, productive role players. If Barnes is not there at 6 which is unlikely, moving up to get Mobley is the right move. For the Cavs, getting off Love and removing the obligation to pay Sexton provides greater flexibility. Garland, Allen and Okoro are all interesting young players. Adding a strong pick at 6 say Moses Moody or Franz Wagner or even Josh Giddey would fit nicely into their core"
if it isnt for moses moody i do no want to trade up
"Kuminga is a raw prospect and the GSW dont wanna waste Curry, Dray, and Klay's prime  by getting players that are gonna take a long time to develop. If they really want players that would help them, they should get James Bouknight, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody, Davion Mitchell, Corey Kispert."

magic should try to go bouknight + moses moody
Guys like Moses Moody and Corey Kispert are projected to be NBA ready but they are pretty far away from being complete prospects.
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
"In the worst-case scenario in which they have to use their picks they can get some really solid bench depth that they're hurting for.   Davion Mitchell at 7 seems solid, especially considering their bench PG is *checks notes* Nico Mannion.  At 14 I'd go for a roleplayer wing - Chris Duarte, Moses Moody or Trey Murphy.   PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole / Damion Lee   SF: Wiggins / #14 / Kent Bazemore  PF: Draymond / Juan Toscano  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid lineup in the West. Obviously it depends on the big 3 playing out of their minds to get deep into the playoffs but the talent is there."
I’m a Arkansas fan so I’m excited to see where Moses Moody ends up and few other Arkansas players if they get drafted. Other than that I’ll probably just check notifications or look on here to see
"Moses Moody is a very fun player but I'm not so sure how he fits on the grizzlies roster, unless I'm forgetting some departure"
"Idk much about their needs but maybe Moses Moody, Franz Wagner or Kai Jones would be a good fit and they’re all slotted around that area in the draft. Maybe Josh Giddey? Guess we’ll see"
Jones at 10 would be crazy. I could see them going for moses moody or davion Mitchell around that spot
Moses Moody reminds me of a lite Malik Monk coming out of college. He doesn't excel at driving to the lane. How many top SG's can you name who aren't good at driving/finishing in the lane. We already have Grayson Allen who can play that role for cheap
"Comments like “you do realize there is more to basketball than shooting” is some extremely lame shit that screams a very low level of actual hoop knowledge. No fucking shit there’s more than shooting, but you’re talking about a prospect whose primary skill is shooting.   I mean again, you’re in the minority of Arkansas fans if you think Moody had a better career at Arkansas than Justin Smith.   No, I’m saying that if you think Moody averaging one more rebound a game than 4 different guys he got more than 10 minutes a game than, then you’re seriously overrating Moody’s large number of uncontested rebounds. Moody wasn’t even the best freshmen perimeter player rebounder at Arkansas, Davis was.   I mean you’re arguing for the dude who played his best basketball of the season while we were on the outside of the tournament looking in, then as his focus within the offense decreased and was given to guys like JD and Davis, we got significantly better. I don’t think that’s a great sign for Moody, I know that might be a hard concept to grasp though.   Vanover played the exact same minutes in the 4 game stretch without Justin as he did before that stretch. Jaylin was the one who took most of Justin’s minutes when he was out, and Jaylin was good enough to be a starter come tournament time. Meanwhile Moody’s first replacement off the bench was... Desi Sills, who had a horrible junior year and regressed significantly.   Moses has the stats for being a better defender and rebounder... despite having worse defensive stats and averaging 2 less rebounds in 2 more minutes a game?????? You legit have no clue what you’re talking about if you think Moody was as good as Justin on defense or rebounding. Can’t say that’s out of line with the rest of your takes though, at least they’re consistently bad.   Do you?!?!?! It’s almost like playing better during the stretch of the season that got us a tournament spot and playing significantly better during the actual tournament... means something? Hmm, who knows though, I mean I’m sure when Moody was putting up 24/9 against Texas-Arlington, you gave that the same weight as the tournament.  It’s wild that in this conversation, you’re coming away thinking you know what you’re talking about. Literally everything you’ve said would be in the minority of Arkansas fans who actually understands basketball... and even those who don’t lmao"
"&gt;Lol this sub Reddit bro I stg. Y’all act like you know ball way more than y’all do.  Weird projection  &gt;Yes, I do know there’s more than shooting, especially since that’s Moody’s best skill. Additionally, yes I saw Arkansas play almost every single game so yes I saw that Moody was not nearly as good of a defender as a lot of “draft experts” say, and you’re crazy if you think his rebounding is anything to write home about.   Guess what dumbass me too. Its almost as if I have 870 and a razorback tatted on me. Weird right?  &gt;Moody has solid NBA defensive upside because his build and athleticism, but he was by NO means a lockdown defender, much less our best perimeter defender. I mean he wasn’t more important in the biggest games of the year, and   So you're saying a 6'5 guard that plays mostly on the perimeter but was a top 20 rebounder in the SEC as a freshman is a bad rebounder? Guards don't typically put up those numbers in any scenario.   &gt;Arkansas wasn’t even going to make the tournament until guys like Devonta, JD, and Jaylin started really producing at a high level in the second half of the season.   Really? The team played better when the role players played better? I've never heard of such a concept.  You're really a basketball genius buddy.  Showing it with each sentence.     &gt;Justin Smith was clearly the better player if you take into account the whole season or just the most important games. We were 24-4 in games Justin played including the elite 8 loss, we were 1-3 without him.  Ok so i already explained that.  Going from Moses and Jalen to JD/Desi/Devonta is lower drop than going from Justin to Connor. Again that doesn't mean Justin is better than Moses only that our back up guards were better than our back up bigs. You are basketball genius yet you keep missing that .      &gt;Justin was a significantly better defender and rebounder than Moody and was our second leading scorer,   No he wasn't.  Like what is there even to debate.  Moses has the stats and he's more skilled and well rounded.   You saying this isn't based on anything objective.    &gt;and when the tournament came around it wasn’t even close between Justin and Moody. Moody might’ve had the slightest of edges going into the tournament, but you are in the small minority of Arkansas fans if you watched the entire season and the tournament and didn’t come away thinking Justin Smith didn’t have a better Arkansas career than Moody. Smith was a senior though.  Moses played poorly in the tournament. Devonta played well in the tournament. Do you understand the concept of sample size?   I can have a discourse with anyone but you wanna talk out your ass and then talk like you know shit? L o fucking l"
"Supossively we like Wagner, Bouknight, Giddey, and Kuminga. Our sub is also high on Moses Moody. Those seem to be the 5 names we're trying to trade up for."
They really want Moses Moody at pick 10  ^I ^hope
I dont think its a ruse. Rumors are we're high on Moses Moody. Going up 7 spots by only taking on Bledose's contract (which isnt terrible) and giving up Grayson Allen (who we likely weren't going to resign) would be worth it. 10 gives us a shot at Moody or we could look to trade up again to get him by packaging 10 plus some players.
"Right on, I’m personally a bigger believer in Moses Moody, Franz Wagner, and Keon Johnson than Bouknight even if it’s not Barnes or Kuminga at 6"
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"three top 6 picks for a public school. fucking absurd. [first time *any* HS team had 3 lottery picks](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-11-18/chino-hills-high-three-nba-draft-lottery-picks)  (montverde had cade, scottie barnes, and moses moody who are all likely goin lottery this year though. not public)"
Moses Moody. Both wore Red.
"Because most lotto picks usually become moses moody and bouknight or whatever. Unless u jump into the top 4 lotto picks shouldnt really expect to net you an allstar, hell even the top 4 shouldnt.  But most if not all teams who trade for dame/beal should be competitors making their picks in the 20’s for a few years at least."
Moses Moody will be the best play to come out of this draft. PG on steroids

"Memphis will trade up to around 8-12 area and get Moses Moody, and he will be ~Tyrese Haliburton level"
"Cade Cunningham will be a top 15 player by the end of his rookie contract.  There will be 30-40 legit NBA players to emerge from this draft, far more than average.

Moses Moody? A top 10 draft pick this year? Fuck are you talking about dude
bro what? moses moody is about to be a draft pick this year lmao he isn’t old
"Moses Moody turned 8 a little over one month before The Decision, of course it's true. You're the one saying random shit."
Moses Moody about to go in the lottery too
It's crazy.  I was in high school watching those great C Webb/Bibby Kings teams.  They have a good core now with Haliburton and Fox.  If they draft someone like Moses Moody and he turns out to be really good they'll have a shot at the playoffs in couple years
Very bittersweet for me as someone who fucking loved Bobby at Arkansas.  I was really happy he went to the Bucks when he signed lol.  Maybe in 8 years we'll make it again and Moses Moody can fuck us up
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
