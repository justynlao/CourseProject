"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
"The Thunder got *very* lucky. They had the Clippers over a barrel. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a player no sane team would have given up (you just don't give up young players Jerry West is high on), and Chris Paul went Veteran Mentor.  Generally speaking, smaller-market teams *can't afford* to risk blowing it up, especially if that would require offloading a beloved fan-favourite star who doesn't actively want to go."
How close is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to making this list?
"Hey man, great post. Here are the best current Canadian players by province (unfortunately this only covers 4 provinces):  Ontario: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 21.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 6.2 APG, 50.5 FG% (Honorable mention : Jamaal Murray)  Quebec: Chris Boucher 16.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.5 BPG, 72.9 True Shooting % (Honorable mention : Lu Dort)   British Columbia: Brandon Clarke 13.2 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG  Saskatchewan: Trey Lyles  7.3 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 1.1 APG (Has only played 7 games so far so the above numbers are his career averages)"

"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"

I don’t want to overreact but I think Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the best player in NBA history.
"After the game, Sam Presti ran down to the Thunder locker room to congratulate the players.   ""WHAT IN THE FUCK ARE YALL DOING?"" Presti yells  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looks at the ground.  Lu Dort was already hiding in the bathroom.  The rest of the team is motionless."

"&gt; “I’m a grown man, so I’m gonna do what I wanna do,” Hill said after the Thunder’s 112-102 loss to the Spurs. “If I wanna go see my family, I’m gonna go see my family. They can’t tell me I have to stay in the room 24/7. If it’s that serious then maybe we shouldn’t be playing. It’s life. No one’s gonna be able to just cancel their whole life for this game.”  &gt; The NBA and National Basketball Players Association agreed to several new protocols. Among them, as Hill referenced, is that players and staff are required to quarantine at home or in their hotel rooms when they’re not practicing or playing games. Exceptions include outside exercise and essential activities, like grocery shopping.   &gt; When on the road, players and staff are prohibited from leaving their hotel or having guests in their hotel rooms.  “We wanna play the game,” said Hill, a 13-year NBA veteran. “That’s what we love to do. But at the same time if we’re casting all these rules, this and that, maybe they need to reevaluate what we’re doing.”  ...  &gt; “I just don’t understand some of the rules as far as we can sweat 48 minutes with the guy next to us and the team next to us, but we can’t talk to him after the game,” Hill said. “It makes no sense.”   ...  &gt; “It’s challenging, obviously, not being used to all the protocols and all the rules, but for me personally it’s what’s necessary,” Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of this COVID thing. If it means wearing my mask on the bench the whole time then it is what it is and I gotta do it.”   &gt; Thunder guard Hamidou Diallo downplayed the challenges of adhering to the protocols.   &gt; “The rules are set, and it’s either you follow them or you don’t,” Diallo said. “If you don’t follow them there’s gonna be consequences to that, and if you do follow them hopefully God willing we’ll stay healthy and we’ll keep playing the game that we love.”   ..."

"To be fair, it's an organization that helped build a legacy on great drafting.  It's not the most profitable franchise and it's not a guarantee that the fanbase will maintain any sort of interest in a tanking team.  Most fans aren't championship-or-bust minded.  There's something to be said for staying competitive and trying to pull a Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Kawhi, Devin Booker or Michael Porter Jr. around the middle of the first round."

"**TEAM CANADA**  After the success of the Toronto Raptors franchise, Canada finally earns a second team again, and unites a cast of all-Canadian players to fill it with their Maple Leaf pride.  Quickly, the team proves to be more than a gimmick. In fact, they fit together well. Lead guards Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander prove to be a good tandem, given Murray's ability to shoot and score and SGA's ability to slash and his size to guard bigger guards. The two both average 20 PPG on the year, nearing All-Star status.  The rest of the team is a mixed bag. Andrew Wiggins has big moments here and there, but Lu Dort appears outmatched for most power forwards given his limited size. Chris Boucher holds his own down low and nears the league -lead for blocks, but has some issues staying out of foul trouble over the course of starters minutes.  Overall, the team flies around .500 all season long, and fights for a playoff spot. Unfortunately, the league stuck them in the Western Conference to split them from Toronto, causing them to barely miss out with a 40-42 total record."
"Steph, Klay and Draymond could be playing together under Steve Kerr in Bumf\*\*kville, Montana and they still would get top tier free agents if they had the cap space. Clippers on the other hand only needed to show half as much competence to get their two stars. But even if they didn't make those moves, I'd wager that they make the playoffs this season with an all-star SGA leading the team. You have to actively try to suck to be as bad as some of these franchises. Forget Doncic, the Kings could've drafted one of Trae Young, Shai Gilgeous Alexander or Michael Porter Jr. at 2nd and they still would've most likely been a play-in team this year."

"Andrew Bogut played him in the NBL and Russ was a comp he  made as well.  &gt;It’s very hard to judge some of these young kids because the jump from high school is a big step. Our league is officiating different. It’s physical, zones can be played. I think he’s done a pretty good job. I like his upside. As far as his length and athleticism, playing the point, I think he’s in that mold of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. His 3-ball’s not there yet, but he does a great job getting in the paint, he’s a willing passer and he’s very good defensively.   &gt;We played him in the preseason and he blocked a few 3- point shots from our guards that he had no business getting a hand on. So he’s very athletic in that sense and he has some dog in him. He was very fiery when we played him, very (Russell) Westbrook-esque with his emotions, and yelling, which I respect. He went out there and really plays like he cares. He’s inconsistent, which can be a knock, but we are a professional league and there are only nine teams. It’s very competitive and once you’ve played a team once, everyone knows each other’s sets, and what they’re trying to do, so I think he’s handled himself very well to this point and I think he’ll be a good guy in the draft. I think he has a chance to be a very good player."

Got me there. Giannis is no Shai Gilgeous-Alexander tho
"Yeah I guess so, but there are plenty of guys who score efficiently but they don't have much help so they are the only one who can score well, it doesn't mean the stats are empty, cuz someone needs to score points. Guys like Kelly olynyk, jerami grant, Collin sexton, Shai gilgeous Alexander, Zach Lavine, KAT. They all score efficiently and in bunches but their teams are below average or bottom feeders, but they aren't empty scorers. I think jerami is for sure not more than a 3rd option on a championship team but he is with us and helps keep the team from getting blown out every night"

"Serious question: Is SGA Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and is ""SGA"" the accepted thing to call him? No disrespect. I'm only asking because I literally had to look it up"
&gt;  I don’t think there’s a wrong choice here tho  I disagree. Michael Porter Jr is as dumb as a rock. I don't think you can teach someone like him how to have a BBIQ. Incredibly talented kid and I'd love to be wrong. But I'd take Shai Gilgeous-Alexander every day of the week.
"u/Sparks0480 is right that the best way is to watch games. You don't need to rush this and try to become an expert analysis by the end of this season's playoffs. Maybe some people portray themselves as knowing more than they do (and I'm guilty of that myself), but I think there's more enjoyment in just watching games for entertainment.   Responding to some of your post's specific prompts:  &gt;I'm also sadly from Seattle where we were robbed of our basketball team so not sure who to root for either.   You don't need to root for any particular team, and you might consider following specific players for the next couple of seasons and that may lead you to follow their teams by proxy However, there's a lot of chatter about a Seattle-based expansion team which might be created in the next 5 years, so you may wish to save your team loyalty for if/when that happens.  &gt;I don't fully understand it from a player perspective and technique/gameplan perspective.  Watch the playoffs in particular for game plans and adjustments. Try to follow a couple series and watch all the games in their entirety. This regular season is kind of wonky with the various absences (injuries, COVID protocols, etc) and the compressed schedule so this has not been a great season for adjustments. Many teams are just trying to be healthy by the start of the playoffs. They don't have time to implement new defensive schemes for each opponent every other night in the regular season.  &gt;Who's important to which teams  On good teams, that's usually their best couple players. On up and coming teams, that might be rookies/sophomores who the team hopes can develop and turn into an All-Star caliber player in a couple years. For example, a good team like the Lakers has LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the Lakers want those two guys healthy for the playoffs. A team that is trying to rebuild like the Thunder has Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lu Dort and they want those two to show development and gain experience through the course of the season.   &gt;what teams/players have rivalries  Many. Too many to list. Some are more historical (e.g. Lakers v Celtics from the 80s) and some are modern social media beefs (which I personally don't think are worth following).   &gt;what teams need what kind of players  Everyone wants talent. In the NBA, arguably more so than sports like NFL and MLB, talent wins out. It is very rare for a team to win the title with a player who is not a top 5 MVP candidate or 1st Team All-NBA level of player. The 2004 Pistons are the rare exception which I think highlights how important elite talent is for winning a title. But only 1 team can win the title each year and I don't think that means 29 teams are full of losers. Teams can define success in different ways.   Teams with stars might want other high-level talent to try and win while they have a healthy and prime-age star. Teams with lots of young players might want to focus on player development and locker room culture and internal improvement. Every team has different needs and also different resources available because of the nature of NBA contracts and how much money teams can spend on player salaries.   &gt;how do basketball teams practice for playing against different teams, techniques and formations, etc.   In the regular season, very little. This season, even less. The playoffs are where you will see game to game adjustments like tweaking the starters or the player rotations. Good coaches can take in what did and didn't work from game 1 and try for a more advantageous set of match-ups in game 2.  &gt;What's a good way to learn things of this nature?   Watch games and have fun. You're watching to have fun so make sure it is fun for you and don't worry too much about how other people are doing."
"Like u/ThatBull_cj noted, you're using possessions/game for 48min here rather than possessions played by these players. Luckily [nba.com has possessions played by each player.](https://go.nba.com/tm0a) Using those and the data above, you have the % of possessions played that each of these players is doubled, below.  1 Luka Doncic (DAL)  **38.4%**  2 Trae Young (ATL)  **37.9%**  3 Damian Lillard (POR)  **32.8%**  4 James Harden (BKN)  **30.8%**  5 Chris Paul (PHX)  **35.2%**  6 Bradley Beal (WAS)  **29.1%**  7 De'Aaron Fox (SAC)  **29.8%**  8 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC)  **31.1%**  9 Ja Morant (MEM)   **31.7%**  10 Stephen Curry (GSW)  **28.9%**"
"What in the hell are you talking about?  This is my entire fucking point dude.  &gt;Trading for Kawhi Leonard cost the Raptors.  No shit, and benefitted the Spurs ability to try and remain competitive because they received something in return.  &gt;Trading for Paul George cost the Clippers.  Again, no shit, the Thunder are so ridiculously flush with First round picks that they can reasonably hope to begin a rebuild and possibly swing for the fences in a few years because of it.  &gt;How the fuck is one method worse than the other?  Because the best active player in the NBA decided amongst himself, another all-star, and a third top 5 active player to bounce for nothing more than: one worthless pick swap, pair of 1sts **ONLY** through the life of James' contract (which clearly meant they weren't sniffing the lottery) and a trade exception good for one year.  Now let's compare that with the Clippers trade for PG.  Clippers receive: Paul George   Thunder receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Galinari, 2021 unprotected first (Heat), 2022 unprotected first (Clips), 2023 lottery protected first (Heat), 2023 pick swap w/ Clips, 2024 unprotected first (Clips), 2025 pick swap w/ Clips, 2026 unprotected first (Clips)  The Clippers were able to assemble their idea of a Superteam and secure Kawhi, and the Thunder have a literal warchest with which to rebuild.  I hope this helps."
"Kevin Durant wouldn't join a Nets team that already have Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum &amp; Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
**WHERE IS SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER?**
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

"My favorite player is LeBron, and I've liked him ever since he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine like 20 years ago. But I would advise you not to be a LeBron stan.  Here's some young and exciting players that I love to watch:   \- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City** \- Crafty young point guard with an all-around skillset   \- **Lamelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets** \- Great passer and playmaker, and still super young   **- Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies -** Explosive athlete, a point guard who plays above the rim   **- Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings -** Smooth, reliable guard who plays like a veteran  Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Trae Young are all really good and young, but they already get lots of fanfare."
So 90 guys total in the entire league? Assuming it is a 15 man roster and there are 6 teams. There are 30 NBA teams currently and 5 starters to each team so 150 Starters. Who would be the starters for each team? I don't think a guy like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is going to be a bench warmer and the 15th guy who gets in the game when they are up 30 on the other team.
"Because they make multi millions and are always talking about player empowerment and wanting to win. This way they have a chance themselves to put their team in the best position to win in the future years. I wish Lu Dort and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a chance to do this for Cade. Unfortunately, they have to wait for the odds."
"&gt; Luka is compared to them because he is a one-man force  Should be compared to other 1 man forces who are inconsistent with defense, and don't shoot from range at a super high clip like Russell Westbrook instead then.   &gt;He takes 35% of Dallas shots, mostly more or less ""self-created"" (while he leads the league in unassisted shots btw), and assists 43%  Ya because he has the ball in his hand a ton. If another star comes on this team who needs the ball in his hands, he will be less valuable.   &gt;also can be easily argued to be the best unassisted scorer  So many of his points are unassisted because he doesn't let other people get the ball to pass and playmake.   &gt;I dunno I cannot look at the description above and see where it becomes comparable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.  SGA is shooting more efficiently and has way better defense. (Luka defense is ""improved this year trust me guys"" just like Kanter's is every year). I wasn't comparing playstyles as much as I was comparing impact on team."
"Luka is compared to them because he is a one-man force every game that these other players only are sometimes. He takes 35% of Dallas shots, mostly more or less ""self-created"", and assists 43%. One is league-topping, the other 3rd after Westbrook and Harden. The quality of that plays and shots (above league's average) is kinda insane considering so much is done by one man. He is argued by many specialists to be the best passer in the league, but *also* can be easily argued to be the best unassisted scorer in the league.  I dunno I cannot look at the description above and see where it becomes comparable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander."
"JVG was not the coach, it was his brother SVG.  And he destroyed the Pistons (as GM) for a decade trying to build around Andre and Reggie Jackson, and then mortgaged the future by trading away assets (Tobias Harris and a pick that turned into Shai-Gilgeous Alexander) for damaged goods (Blake) on a massive outsized contract."
"   &gt;Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray   &gt;   &gt;If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo.     What is this crap? YOU are the one underrating Dlo, Lonzo is certainly not better than Dlo, Murray isnt, maybe Conley is, and Shai is."
"&gt; nobody overrates dlo   Anyone who thinks he's good is PG is overrating him. Casual fans still consider him a star.  Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players?

"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
"This post is pretty dumb and he is not getting traded, but for the sake of arguing, let me see if I can take a stab at naming some players that may be similarly valued...don't bite my head off if you disagree.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Bam Adebayo  Donovan Mitchell (maybe a little more valuable)  Christian Wood  Zach LaVine"
"""Anyway here's why we can trade Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a future second for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Zion Williamson"""
"There’s a significant difference between CP and Jimmy in that Jimmy’s vocal about when you’re stepping out of your role, but CP is really great about communicating the limits and specifications of your role before you do too much. And Jimmy’s even said as much (that interview he did on JJ’s podcast gave a lot of insight into this). It’s a difference in leadership style that makes Jimmy a more feast or famine leader than CP.   CP’s worked to get the most out of young guys on his team his whole career. We’ve seen guys under 25 have great showings on his teams. Off the top of my head Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan, Clint Capela, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and now DA, Cam Johnson and Bridges all got great starts to their careers by getting guided by CP on how to to fit their games around him because CP is one of the all time great floor conductors. Paul’s just always on time and that consistency is great for young players.  My only concern for a CP/KAT pairing would be if KAT would be reduced to a rim running center I think that’s a waste of his 3 level scoring game."
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. he’s not unknown now but I watched him play his rookie season against the timberwolves when he was on the clippers, and I was thinking he was really good like he’s been in the league for a few years. When I found out he was a rookie I was very surprised, he’ll be a top pg in this league soon."
"* If Karl Anthony Towns could stay healthy, he’d be the same caliber of All-NBA center as Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert. * Gobert is easily a Top 15 player in the league. * Clint Capela is a borderline All-Star and one of the most underrated players in the league. * I’d sooner have De’Aaron Fox or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander than Ben Simmons."
Post ASB Shai Gilgeous Alexander also averaged like 27-7-7 (albeit in only a few games til his injury) but no one will ever talk about that

"Which of the following players are you taking Bagley over?  Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter, Collin Sexton, Kevin Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Briges, Michael Porter JR"
&gt;PG - Trae Young   &gt;   &gt;SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   &gt;   &gt;SF - Luka Doncic   &gt;   &gt;PF - Michael Porter Jr.   &gt;   &gt;C - Deandre Ayton  IDK I still think Brooklyn is scoring 199 pts on that team 4 out of 7 times.
"I want to establish some criteria for how I choose these players. Underrated to me means unrecognized winning equity. In other words, players in situations where their absence would substantially hurt their team's winning/play off record but are not largely recognized by casuals, media, forums, etc.  There isn't any order to this, but I did try to keep it current...  Don Mitchell (and almost all of the Jazz except Gobert), Malcom Brogdon, Jrue Holiday, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Vucevic are the first to come to mind.  I'd also like to add that Jokic gets a lot of hate, but that dude is the whole reason Denver is staying afloat. His hate to me makes him seem underappreciated if not underrated. People are acting like his MVP is by default, but he's a worthy MVP regardless of who got injured. Embiid went out and the 76ers were still beating people. If Jokic went down, it is safe to assume the nuggets would have lost about every game."
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander next year truss 🤞🏾
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""

There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"LMAO, I watched the guy play at Kentucky for the Wildcats and thought for sure, him and Shai Gilgeous Alexander would become perennial all-stars... never seen a dude, revert and become a turnstile so quickly. Didn't Knox have the worst offensive/defensive ranking out of literally everyone his sophomore year?"

"I agree that the Clips kind of sold their soul to get Kawhi and PG. They had such a promising mix of young talent and good veterans like Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and JaMychal Green. I was so disappointed they traded away Tobias Harris, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Landry Shamet. That 2018 team was awesome to see, it felt like those young OKC and Warriors teams before they found real postseason success.   They technically replaced them all pretty well on paper, but they lost a lot of chemistry in the process and I don't think Kawhi and PG have been a great fit in personality or leadership.  If things blow up this year which I'm kind of hoping they do, I'd be excited to see how they can refresh with Mann, Kennard, Zubac and others. They have pieces where they won't be a dumpster fire like the post-LeBron Cavs, but who knows what happens."
If we kept that 2018 team + made the correct draft choices:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Donovan Mitchell - Devin Booker - Tobias Harris - Andre Drummond
nah shai gilgeous-alexander is the goat
"“During an impassioned speech, in the middle of the season after a loss, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander told the Thunder that they were going to make the playoffs despite all the injuries, the CP3 trade, and losing streaks. They proceeded to sit him for the rest of the season and ended up tanking to the 5th worst record in the league, though it wasn't quite bad enough to gain the highest chances in the lottery.”"
"$300,000,000  Five first-round picks  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Danilo Gallinari  All for the chance to drop games to a bitch-ass white boy every playoffs"

"The problem is our good players skew heavily towards guards that play a similar style. We have a lot of good players, but a lot of good players all with similar strengths and weaknesses.   You can make that work if your good players are LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, but when they're Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, you need some chemistry."
Wish we had Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous Alexander.
"I can't believe hall of famers Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort all played together for one season :O"
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland’s Damian Lillard or Washington’s Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland’s Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"

PG: Fred VanVleet SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander SF: Ben Simmons PF: OG Anunoby C: Jaren Jackson Jr
Wasn't Shai Gilgeous-Alexander theirs too?
"**PG: Paul George**  Unfortunately, there appears to be no PG in NBA history with the initials PG. I'm gonna cheat and slide Paul George in there.   **SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander**  Fits perfectly  **SF: Sherell Ford**  Never heard of him. Only small forward with the initials SF. He played one season in his career. Started one game, where he played 14 minutes and put up 2 points on 1/6 shooting along with 0 rebounds, 0 assists, and 1 steal. Liability in our lineup.  **PF: Phil Farbman**  Dude played in the 40s lol that's how desperate we are. According to basketball reference he was a forward. Doesn't have his position other than that, so we'll count it even though he was 6'1. Didn't play in the NBA either. Put up 3 points per game in the BAA in 1949 though!  **C: Clint Capela**  This seems fair"
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at SG
"&gt;During last night’s event, The Playbook Vol. 4, team advisor Jerry West spoke on several things, including the team’s free agency acquisitions, the rookies taken in the draft and his outlook for the team. One of the most notable things he mentioned though, revolved around rookie point guard Terance Mann.  &gt;West said that he believes Mann will be playing a lot by the end of the season. Coming from The Logo himself, this is a big endorsement for Mann.  &gt;With the departure of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the Paul George deal, the Clippers looked like they would be lacking depth at the point guard position. They had taken Terance Mann in the second round prior to the trade, but no one knew what to expect from the Florida State prospect."
So…  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don’t grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don’t think they will?
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should be on that list.  Unfortunately, he's playing in OKC, and nobody sees, hears or thinks about him."

"So we should judge things, like the quality of a team, based on how people felt a year ago, rather than current performance ?   I fucking love Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, but I watch enough basketball and am not stupid enough to suggest he’s better than Luka. You should try doing the same with your star"

"It goes back further:  July 20, 2007: The Phoenix Suns trade Kurt Thomas and 2 first round picks (2008 &amp; 2010) to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick.  June 26, 2008: The Seattle SuperSonics draft Serge Ibaka 24th overall in the NBA Draft using the first round pick from Phoenix.  June 23, 2016: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Victor Oladipo, Damantas Sabonis, and Ersan Ilyasova.  July 6, 2017: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George.  July 10, 2019: The Oklahoma City Thunder trade Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 5 first round picks (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 &amp; 2026), and the right to swap first round picks in 2023 &amp; 2025.   But what about the Suns, who triggered all of this madness in 2007? Well, they traded Kurt Thomas for cap relief and a 2009 conditional 2nd round pick. They used that 2009 conditional 2nd round pick they received from the SuperSonics to draft Emir Preldžić, who would go on to never play a single minute in the NBA, as is tradition. As for that precious cap relief, the Suns went on in that offseason to sign Richie Frahm who was almost immediately waived, Brian Skinner who would average 3 points and 3 rebounds in one season with the Suns, and acquire a 35 year old Shaquille O’Neal from the Miami Heat, who would ultimately cement his legacy as one of the all time greats with rebirth in his new franchise. Just kidding, Shaq averaged 16 points and 9 rebounds in one and a half seasons with Phoenix."

2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous.

Shai Gilgeous Alexander being top 10 I have no doubt about
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Young, seems to have high basketball iq, can score, pass, but has not played enough to really show how good he can get. I think he can be a superstar point guard in the league"

I said  &gt;and your team can't find **a buyer with an appropriate offer** you're gonna have to play.  &amp;#x200B;  by any chance you remember what OKC got out of the  Paul George trade? let me refresh your memory:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Danilo Gallinari  Miami Heat 2021 unprotected first-round draft pick  Clippers 2022 unprotected first-round draft pick  Miami Heat 2023 protected 1 through 14 first-round draft pick  Right to swap 2023 first-round pick with Clippers  Clippers 2024 unprotected first-round draft pick  Right to swap 2025 first-round pick with Clippers  Clippers 2026 unprotected first-round draft pick

"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
"Yep, and if he doesn't he will get the same contract as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signed."
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was confused when he didn’t see Mike Muscala run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Shai saw teammate Muscala, who was lagging behind. Shai said one word to Muscala. ""Oklahoma."""
"I know this isn't the thread for this, but he (NAW) originally went to my small high school. Crazy seeing him and his cousin (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) ball out."
"Reminder, the Clippers FO gave up Danilo, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ***FIVE UNPROTECTED 1ST ROUND PICKS, AND TWO PICK SWAPS*** just to satisfy Kawhi's desire to play with Paul George.  #***THEY ARE FUCKED.***"

"From Fischer now:  Another player frequently mentioned as available for trade during draft week was indeed 23-year-old point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, yet sources told B/R the Oklahoma City Thunder never offered their young star in trade conversation to acquire the Cleveland Cavaliers' No. 3 choice. In those conversations that ultimately fell short, the Thunder only offered packages including present and future draft capital. Oklahoma City and Gilgeous-Alexander are expected to come to terms on a lucrative five-year, maximum-contract extension before the start of next season.   What was it you were saying?"
"You said Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was better than Jayson Tatum. This isn't a Boston fan thing, man, god damn."
A lot of people felt the same way when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was drafted in the lottery
OKC are 12 picks in and still haven't got that 'scorer to complement Shai Gilgeous-Alexander'
&gt; Per @JakeLFischer the Cavaliers would turn down an offer of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the no. 6 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft for the no. 3 pick.  WTF! This can’t be true.
No shame for anybody who didn’t know. SGA = Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
"Even if he shoots league average from 3 the rest of his career his scoring ability off drives is seriously elite and will always be the main feature of his offensive game.   In year 3 he is already comparable to the best in the league when it comes to scoring off drives and pick and roll actions:  “He shoots 55.1 percent from the field out of his record-setting drives and 51.4 percent after three or more dribbles. Among the 11 players — all ball-dominant offensive leaders — who shoot five or more twos per game after holding the ball for six or more seconds, Gilgeous-Alexander is the most efficient scorer. He leads the league in the percentage of his twos that are unassisted.  In the pick and roll, Gilgeous-Alexander is the second-most efficient scorer in the league, behind only Steph Curry.”  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/shai-gilgeous-alexander-knows-only-one-gear-drive/amp/"
"The title should read  &gt;Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is ""no longer impossible to get"" *[as long as you have the first pick in the draft to trade]*  The first pick has always opened a lot of otherwise locked doors. I wouldn't get excited if I was any other team."
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander looked pretty good in a Charlotte hat
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. People treat him like a superstar. He could become one, but he isn't yet."
Hyphenated last names are the new market inequality.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Talen Horton-Tucker  Keita Bates-Diop  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Wardell Stephen James-Curry
I agree with looking for a blue chip prospect in addition to picks.  The only problem is I don't think we got that offer.  I would've loved to get what OKC got for Paul George. They got hella picks in addition to Shai Gilgeous Alexander. The nets just didn't have an appealing young player and i'm not convinced any NBA team out there made an offer like that for Harden.  They added more pick swaps on top of hella picks to compensate.  James Harden is 32 and only ones that even wanted to go all in on him were win now contenders who didn't really have appealing young players.  It's not like we were offered Jamal Murray. Hell [This Denver Nuggets source says they never even offered MPJ plus hella picks](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/22/nuggets-jamal-murray-james-harden-trade-rumor/)  Jokic only 26 so I doubt their picks ever good anyway though.
"What I did was watch Nba highlights on youtube, and just followed players I found entertaining. From there I just supported my favorite players team, which was Westbrook and the thunder.   But if you dont wanna do that, here are some good teams you could support:  Bucks: just won the finals, Giannis is pretty entertaining and they’ll be good for many years  Mavs: Luka Doncic is one of the best already at a very young age, has potential to be an alltime great  Nets: KD, Kyrie, Harden, all very entertaining. You would be supporting a superteam though, and they wont be around for many years  Pistons: #1 pick in this years draft, probably gonna draft Cade Cunningham  Thunder: Thousands of draft picks, and have an amazing young talent in Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Lakers: Lebron  Timberwolves: Have been bad for a while, but with Anthony Edwards entering his second year and KAT at center, they are starting to show some promise.  Obviously there are tons of other fun teams in the league, but these are some that I personally think would be fun to support. Enjoy!"
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Shai Gilgeous Alexander
I asked for trade offers around the league for Ben Simmons in the NBA 2K22 franchise mode. Here were the three best offers:     * **Ben Simmons for Khris Middleton**    Don't know what the Bucks are thinking. They just won a championship and now they are trading one of their key pieces. Simmons and Antetokounmpo is some awful spacing.   * **Ben Simmons and Danny Green for Brandon Ingram and Garrett Temple**    Don't know what the Pelicans are thinking. This might be the last straw for Zion. Zion and Simmons is some awful spacing.     * **Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ty Jerome**    This is totally unrealistic. Presti isn't getting any picks.
"PG: Shai Gilgeous Alexander  SG: Paul George (allstar)  SF:  Kevin Durant (superstar)  PF: Jayson Tatum (allstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  \---  Bench PG: Fred Vanvleet  Bench SG: Mikal Bridges  Bench SF: OG Anunoby  Bench PF: Robert Covington  Bench C: Myles Turner  \---  Third string: Marcus Smart  Third string: Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;  I think starting lineup is basically impossible to guard. Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
I just read the title. You got me there. LeBron always a must watch though even if he’s playing a bottom of the barrel team.   Shai Gilgeous Alexander then.
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
RJ Barrett will be a top 30 player at the end of this year   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will be a top 15 player at the end of this year
"KAT Giannis would be so OP, so I went with that, but make Klay Shai Gilgeous Alexander, and you can replace Khris with Kawhi"
This is an interesting question. All these players have similar minutes played and games played last season (with Shai playing 35 games as an exception).I took a numeric approach to ranking these players.

The big difference is his minutes. You can look at [last year's projections](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/shai-gilgeous-alexander/) still. It's weighting in the time he missed into the projection. It's not going to be a long term injury so it makes the model off by a bit.

"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Best = Jaylen brown or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   Worst = Stanley Johnson
"These are the players I can't remember hearing a bad thing about all summer long. When a person says any of these names come up on a podcast, the other person immediately falls all over themselves to agree so emphatically that they might also take some credit for bringing him up. Saying you expect big things from these players is like saying the password to enter the sports media hootch parlor.   ...and if you have a 100% approval rating from group-thinky NBA podcasters, I'm sorry but you are probably overrated.  1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  2. Deandre Hunter  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Bruce Brown, Jr  5. Isaiah Stewart  6. RJ Barrett  7. Matisse Thybulle  8. Aaron Holliday  9. Luke Kennard"

"It is still a max extension, you completely stubborn dolt.  And the contract Ayton is discussing is the exact same contract.  The last year will become guaranteed based on provisions.  That doesn't prevent it from being a max contract.  Again, thinking you are right and every single NBA reporter is wrong is a level of arrogance that bothers me.    From the articles linked:  'Porter becomes the fourth member of the 2018 draft class to sign a max rookie extension with the super-max provision, following Luka Doncic, Trae Young and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander."""
"...that's what a max contract is.  The largest contract possible, including kickers to make it even bigger if he hits certain milestones.  That is literally the definition of a max contract.  You are talking about a SUPERmax contract, which is what Luka got.  You think you are right and literally every reporter is wrong?  Sweet christ, dude.  MPJ signed a maximum extension.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-porter-jr-nuggets-agree-to-five-year-designated-max-extension-guaranteed-for-145-3m-per-reports/#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future.-,Michael%20Porter%20Jr.,team%20during%20the%20upcoming%20campaign.  How are you gonna read articles from SI, CBS, ESPN, Woj, literally the Nuggets and MPJ themselves talking about the fact that is a maximum extension and then say ""No he didn't.""  The level of confidence, when you are shown clear sources proving you wrong, is literally astounding.  Max contracts are different for different players depending on certain milestones.  SGA also signed a max extension that is the same contract MPJ signed. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31945995/shai-gilgeous-alexander-agrees-5-year-172-million-maximum-rookie-contract-extension-oklahoma-city-thunder"

"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is definitely a centerpiece-level player and Lu Dort is a legitimate playoff-rotation-level player.  Admittedly, though, Shai was a lucky acquisition considering how the PG13/Kawhi/Clippers stuff went down. Presti leveraged his position wonderfully, but it was a super unique acquisition that required a lot of other pieces to work out that way.  And Lu Dort was an undrafted rookie who bet on himself and it worked out wonderfully in our favor.  But otherwise we have a lot of assets and not as many legitimate pieces. Presti's done the ""easy"" part really well; the hard work is turning ""assets"" into actual players.  I'm very high on Josh Giddey, but things remain to be seen if players like Giddey, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley, Theo Maledon, Ty Jerome, Tre Mann, and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl are actual winning basketball players or not.  Presti's amazing, but realistically speaking, he's done well with step one and we have a long way to go before we can call the rebuild a true success or not."
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1.
