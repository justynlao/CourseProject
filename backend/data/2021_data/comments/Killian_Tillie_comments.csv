"The one left out, John “Jitty” Konchar, had some absurd highlights while the game was still at stake too. He had an absolutely beautiful block, a feisty dunk, and he basically only produces good minutes when he gets the chance.  The Grizz are playing really good team basketball, as expected by a team coached by a Pop/Bud acolyte who actually knows what he’s doing. The bench is the most devastating part though, Ja aside. There are so many crazy dangerous dudes on that bench, and they work so cohesively, not to mention the guys like Justise Winslow, Jontay Porter, and Killian Tillie, who haven’t played a minute for the team yet. Obviously Justise is a bigger deal than the other two, who were UDFA darlings, and the idea of Justise Winslow fits so well with what the Grizzlies are trying to do. Anything positive this year is gravy, and there’s so much to like about the future potential of this squad that didn’t stockpile picks or spend half a decade tanking to get here"
"Neither Jaren Jackson Jr nor Justise Winslow have played yet this season. Both Ja and Jonas Valanciunas missed 3 games of the 7 game winning streak. And of course they've been without young, end-of-bench players like Killian Tillie and Jontay Porter for the entire season."
"Bless his heart is right for Sean, lol. I also haven't seen anything from Killian Tillie that says he's going to be a difference maker for us, but I'd love to be proven wrong"
"I can’t tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we’ve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja’s career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin’ 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"
"There’s a decent chance, if he can stay healthy, that Killian Tillie will be a steal as an UDFA as well"
Does Killian Tillie get minutes? Wasn’t he a beast at Gonzaga ?
I tuned in during the 4th quarter just to see my man Killian Tillie on the bench. He’s one of my favorite players from Gonzaga and I was so sad when he went undrafted. He was injured a lot in college and that really affected his draft stock... but I’m stoked Memphis picked him up and he’s back with his old teammate Brandon Clarke. That was a really exhilarating last few minutes. I’ll always root for Memphis because of those two guys. So glad you guys won tonight!
killian tillie or some shit like that
"Ja Morant is becoming one of my favorite players to watch. I’ve been tuning into a lot of Grizzlies games this season because I’m a huge Gonzaga fan and they drafted Brandon Clarke, plus they signed Killian Tillie to a two way contract after he went undrafted this past year. They also signed David Stockton to their G-League team. So they’ve won the hearts of many Zags fans. But watching Ja has been fun as hell. He’s so damn explosive."
"Congratulations, Lakers. You came out not wanting to play basketball and we scorched you 22-2.   Then the referees decided to get involved.  It shouldn't take 29 to 8 free throws for the reigning champs to hang with the Grizzlies playing without JJJ, Justise, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Deanthony Melton, Sean McDermott, and Killian Tillie."
"maybe if you throw in a few scrubs like trae young, clint capela, and oneka okongwu, and turn the picks into pick swaps we could consider parting with deanthony melton and maybe also killian tillie or jontay porter"
He was being whooped by John Konchar and Killian Tillie at times
So glad my man Killian Tillie got some playing time tonight
"I really liked Killian Tillie and Johntay Porter pre draft, I haven’t seen them much this year. Then John Konchar (sp?) is really great for them too. They are super deep"
All KT Team  PG: Kenny Tyler from “The Sixth Man”  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Khloe’s babydaddy Tristan Thompson  PF: Killian Tillie  C: Karl-Anthony Towns  6th man: Kris Tapsporzingis
I love Killian Tillie and want nothing but good things for him
Busting out secret weapon Killian Tillie
"Killian Tillie has gotten more play than Porter so far (Porter played some G league games and looked okay). I liked what I saw from Tillie in his limited playtime, willing to shoot the 3 with minimal space, good footwork and hands on D, but he probably didn't get enough reps with our core guys for Jenkins to try him out in the playoffs."

Killian Tillie was a potential lottery talent who went undrafted due to injuries
Killian Tillie is going to make you regret this list
"Sad Jontay couldn’t work out, but his injuries were always thought to be pretty debilitating, even more so probably than what MPJ dealt with. There could easily be more at play there too, but, like, there’s no reason for the Grizz to have Jontay, Killian Tillie, and now Santi Aldama more or less completely overlapping when none of them are playing meaningful minutes hopefully  I won’t be surprised if he pops up as being certified good sometime in his 20s if his health ever lets him get back on the path he was heading though. Hope the best for him and happy we got the first crack at him"
Remind me! 1 year.  I'm thinking he will be waived. Feeling Killian Tillie or Rade Zagorac vibes. Hope not though.
Very fair critique. Perhaps Killian Tillie over Adams could push the Jackalopes into contender status.
"Grizzlies' Killian Tillie's brother Kévin Tillie won volleyball gold this summer, coached by their father Laurent Tillie."
