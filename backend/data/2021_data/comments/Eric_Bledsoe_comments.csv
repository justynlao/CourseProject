Should have been Wes Matthews and Eric Bledsoe splitting the award. Clearly they are what made the bucks the best defense in the league last year.
"Yeah, FVV is built closer to Eric Bledsoe than Trae Young haha"
"&gt;ESPN’s Bobby Marks took a look at the extensions that were and weren’t handed out on Monday and offered some analysis on Ball’s situation. Marks cited a pair of recent contracts as barometers for Ball heading into contract negotiations.  &gt;“If Ball stays healthy and plays at a high level this season, a new contract should start in the $16-18 million range next offseason, similar to the Hornets’ Terry Rozier and Spurs’ Dejounte Murray (keep in mind that the $16.8 million salary this season of teammate Eric Bledsoe ranks No. 22 among all point guards). The high end for Ball would be the four-year, $80 million contract that Malcolm Brogdon signed with the Indiana Pacers in 2019.”  This was written back in November before Giannis resigned with the bucks. A lot of teams were preserving cap space for next summer and now whats left?   Its obvious that a lot of you let your emotion cloud your judgement with contracts. Your opinion on lonzo are irrelevant, if he rediscovers his 3 ball then he will be highly sought after next summer. Someone is going to pay him big money."
"Man if only we had good individual defenders like Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, or that Josh Hart! Maybe we could add in a great help defender like Steven Adams!  Then you know what we could do? Give them more than 18 games to judge whether or not its gonna work."
"You mean a guy like Eric Bledsoe? Whose an all nba level defender? Or a guy like Adams, a known rim protector?"
Nothing can hurt me after giving up 16 3s to Eric Bledsoe and the Ball brothers over the course of 2 games.
And that is a DISGUSTING ACT by Eric Bledsoe. And it’s UNFORTUNATE that we had that on our air live
Mini-Bledsoe goes to join Eric Bledsoe? No thanks
I think the way he gets to the restricted area to make the shot is a big part of the equation. Like Jrue Holiday and Eric Bledsoe are not typically breaking ankles on the way to the rim like Kyrie is.

"This is a classic example of trying to play basketball on a stat sheet. Kyrie’s ability to finish at the rim is unparalleled. If you’re telling me you genuinely think that Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe are better finishers than Kyrie Irving, then I know you haven’t watched any 3 of those players for more than 5 minutes, total."
Don't forget the other guy in the same video. Eric Bledsoe was called mini LeBron in his younger days
i was gonna say him and Eric Bledsoe are so much more ripped than d fish of all people lmao
Eric Bledsoe at pg
Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe &gt; Jrue Holiday apparently
Tonight versus the Bucks Eric Bledsoe has more wins than Giannis got against the Heat
"Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball, and a couple boxes of rice"
eric bledsoe took the trade personally
Eric Bledsoe is not good.
"Honestly, the addition of Jrue Holiday *and* the subtraction of Eric Bledsoe can go a long way."
"Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball, and JJ. Reddick traded to the Pelicans."
"Eric Bledsoe, Kira Lewis, and your choice of Josh Hart, Nicolo Melli, NAW, or Jaxson Hayes all make the money work. Not to mention an ass load of picks/swaps"
"OKC is not going to take back Westbrook even if you give them 2 future 1st. Thunder are invested on developing young players. Washington can try the Pelicans for Eric Bledsoe. Pelicans will not take your pick, they're the one who will give you 1st round picks."
"&gt; look at their draft picks for the last decade  Yeah, let's look at their draft picks over the last decade when their only picks not in the 20s were Steven Adams (12), Cameron Payne (14) and Eric Bledsoe (18). It's hard to draft great role players when they are dealing with the crap shoot of the late first round."
I think it was Paul George and Eric Bledsoe (in a three team trade)
I remember there being reports that they wanted Josh Jackson and Eric Bledsoe from the Suns and got turned down. And thank god they turned us down.
Eric Bledsoe is also a good player (I agree w you tho)
"Fox looks so much better than that lol and of all teams, he destroyed your Nuggets on both ends of the floor to start the season. If you think he’s Eric Bledsoe than you are a very bad judge of basketball skill"
y'all think the kangz finally got one?  the last pg they hyped up (and ended up maxing) looks like he's going to be eric bledsoe
these guys really building around eric bledsoe
BBB fans currenttly blaming Stan Van Gundy and eric Bledsoe lmao
"Maybe if we were more of a running team but this team is too good in the half court to consider that. I wouldn’t want Eric Bledsoe with the ball in his hands making decisions in our offense, and he’s not well utilized at all as an off ball guy. He’s not a good enough shooter and the Clippers don’t have room for another on ball scorer. He needs to go start for a young athletic team or convince SVG to run again.   In a vacuum Eric Bledsoe is a more talented well rounded player than Patrick Beverley but that trade would 100% make the Clippers worse for sure."
"Pelicans receive: Lowry Clippers receive: Eric Bledsoe and Aron Baynes Raptors receive: Lonzo Ball, Ivica Zubac, Marcus Morris, Pelicans 2° round pick 2021"
"I know he didn't really do anything bad this game, but there's nothing I dislike more than watching Eric Bledsoe play basketball."
The idea of Eric Bledsoe is always better than what you actually get out of Eric Bledsoe
eric bledsoe might be the worst player of all time
"Theres a difference between constructive criticism and just rude criticism. Theres also a difference between that and plain ignorance, which is where you are at. And its arrogant at that.  Just this thread ive seen you say thay Eric Bledsoe barely touches the ball and that Brandon Ingram is a ""dribble bro"". Here is the fun thing about the NBA. All of this stuff is recorded so I dont just know from watching, I know for a FACT that you are wrong and have the numbers to prove it.  Bledsoe averages roughly the same number of touches per game as both Zion and Ingram. Unless you wanna make the claim that neither of them touch the ball very much, you are clesrly wrong.  As for ""dribble bro"" he dribbles less per touch than both Bledsoe and Ball. So uh, you can try that again as well.  As for Adams, well uh, if you see him doing nothing but clogging the lane, well then. Well lets just say youre special and leave it at that.   Like I said. Can I get ""I dont actually watch this team for 1000, Alex?"""
Eric Bledsoe doesn’t fit in. He’s inconsistent with the 2nd unit and is the 4th offensive option for the 1st unit. He needs to be traded soon.   He’s also been weak defensively but it isn’t stated as often as Zion because Bledsoe has proven to be a good defender over the years.
"Brandon and Zion need reliable shooters who can space the floor for them. Zion's grabbing 30 [in a crowded room](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsMjrnxXYAclbMn?format=jpg&amp;name=large), I think BI looks exhausted by late quarters after driving through like [four guys](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsJP2jfUwAQuGlx?format=jpg&amp;name=large) at a time all game.  People just don't see Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, or Eric Bledsoe as threats and they feel free to leave them unguarded and go crowd the #1 guys.  During the Lakers game, Schroder guarded the shit outta Nickeil Alexander-Walker though because he'd had a 37pt game against the Clips. I think Nickeil could be a good starter for us at SG if they let him get minutes.  BI and Zion are actually pretty good at creating looks for others, and our rookie PG seems pretty good at creating looks too. Just need dudes to stop bricking 'em."
A hole the size of Eric Bledsoe
"I wasn’t a fan of the Adams move, but so far he has shown good chemistry with Zion, and He’s having pretty good on-off ratings (that may be because of their lack of good bigs)  My perspective on this year is that it’s for young player development, getting a higher pick, and making their vets look good enough to shop them.   Eric Bledsoe, despite his shortcomings, still has excellent advanced stats and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a contender try and trade for him. (Him for Kelly Oubre could be a very interesting swap, warriors defense would be great with Steph/Him/Wiggins/Draymond/Wiseman, but the lack of shooting would be concerning)   Personally I see them losing a lot of games this year and getting a wing with a top 7 pick (one of the Jalen’s or Kuminga), then flipping assets down the line, something the Adams extension can help with, especially since it’s in the 10-20,000 range"
"I mean I get it, but we had Eric Bledsoe, an aging George Hill and  divicenzo running point, tough to run an offense without an true point guard. Middleton can't guard the best player on the other team and run point every play. Hands were somewhat tied. Jrue was such an underrated pickup cause of this. Having d.j augistun too means we can actually implement an offense with gianiss as the roll man"
&gt; Eric bledsoe needs to move to a six man role and become more of a super energy guy   Mr. I-Don't-Wanna-Be-Here putting his ego aside and coming off the bench behind players 8-9 years younger than him. I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.
Yeah Eric bledsoe needs to move to a six man role and become more of a super energy guy turning his defense into transition points. Starting guards have a hard time moving the ball against him imagine him going against back ups most the game. I also like him coming off the bench as he is more aggressive than lonzo.   We have a fairly deep bench rotation between bledsoe jj and hart. With naw in the starting lineup he falls down in the scoring order and should allow him to be more efficient. It also opens up the lane for zion. NAW catching a corner three is way more dangerous than Eric bledsoe.
"Yeah I think they should try and flip Kyrie into a PatBev/Eric Bledsoe type and a rim running Center that can protect the rim, Capela for example  That'd be the perfect lineup"
"If GS is willing to give up its draft capital, than you could probably get your pick of player from any of the non-playoff teams this year.  That wolves pick has crazy high value, if I was a rebuilding team that’s had some struggles, I’d be willing to give up a ton for it (wizards, Bulls, Kings)    Some basic trade ideas would be like   Hield for Wiggins and two firsts (maybe or maybe not the wolves first)  Oubre + a first for Eric Bledsoe   Oubre + Smailegic + wolves first + 2023 first for Zach Lavine   List goes on etc..."
Incorrect per your beat writer Eric Nehm: https://theathletic.com/1109269/2019/08/02/how-a-moneyball-approach-might-help-the-bucks-overcome-the-loss-of-malcolm-brogdon/  Here is Bobby Marks explaining how it could be done: https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/26114530/what-eric-bledsoe-new-deal-means-bucks
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
If the Bucks get decent play from the PG position in the playoffs they are going to the finals. Everyone is so busy talking about Giannis not getting it done that we don't talk enough about how fucking terrible Eric Bledsoe was in the playoffs. Just fucking awful.
"I can't remember where I read it, but I think the issue was ego/talent. He went to a team with Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. That team also eventually acquired Isaiah Thomas and Devin Booker. He was a young player on a team with established guards and then a franchise guy. I think he didn't appreciate his role or minutes. Lots of talented guys wash out of the league because they don't understand how to stick. I also remember him not being able to really shoot, so it probably contributed to his leaving the NBA."
"I saw Eric Bledsoe the other day walking down the street, with no shoes. He stopped right next to a telephone pole that just happened to have quarter inch increments marked. So I got a good look, he was definitely 6 foot 1/4 inch, without shoes"
"Eric Bledsoe, now in person!"
Yeah it's me Eric bledsoe I am 6'1
Eric Bledsoe just giving FVV as much space to shoot as possible made me want to rip my eye out.

I think the trade was done because for one they need an elite point guard/playmaker and Eric Bledsoe just disappears in the playoffs.  Also I think it was also to show Giannis that they’re willing to make moves for him to stick around and sign the super max.
This clip does not exist. Anthony Davis WOULD NEVER allow a pawn like Eric Bledsoe to block his shot
Eric Bledsoe and John Wall
"I'll be honest here. After what happened in the past 2 seasons, I don't give a flying shit what happens in the regular season. The Bucks could go 70-12 for all I care.   Right now, I'm just hoping that Holiday doesn't disappear in the playoffs like Eric 'unplayable in the playoffs' Bledsoe and that Bud would actually play the starters 40 minutes per game."
Basically Eric Bledsoe or the greatest player in NBA history
"Is Lowry &gt; Danny Green + Maxey in terms of impact, not just this year, but in future years going forward? That's the question Morey's gotta ask himself. I like Maxey a lot, he's going to be good, can envision him being the next Jrue Holiday, or at the very least, better Eric Bledsoe.   A 2-for-1 swap leaves you with a 9-man rotation of:  Starting 5: Lowry/Shake/Simmons/Harris/Embiid   Bench: Seth/Korkmaz/Thybulle/Dwight  That's a damn good team and has higher upside than the current team does right now."
"You're just making things up.  &gt;The Cleveland Cavaliers reportedly were in talks to trade Kyrie Irving to the Phoenix Suns in a three-team deal in June, according to Jackie MacMullan of ESPN:  &gt;""In mid-June, shortly before [former general manager David] Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson.""  &gt;**That trade came a month before Irving requested one out of Cleveland**  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2752210-report-kyrie-irving-trade-for-paul-george-eric-bledsoe-was-explored-by-cavs  The whole reason Kyrie requested a trade in the first place is because he was included in trade talks."
Wasnt he defended by allnba defender and superstar Eric Bledsoe?
Someone want to remind me what Kyrie did the last time he was in a playoff series? Because I’m 90% sure I remember him getting out played by Eric Bledsoe
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2755855-lebron-james-reportedly-upset-cavs-didnt-trade-for-paul-george-eric-bledsoe?share=other
"Lol at you   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21941260/nba-playing-lebron-winning-nba-title-kyrie-irving-decided-move-question-why  In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and [Channing] Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson. No formal offer was made by any of the teams, but news of this potential transaction stung Irving, who, sources close to him say, became convinced that LeBron's camp, which also represents Bledsoe, orchestrated the trade talks.      Team and league sources refute that, saying that it was Griffin who initiated the trade talks with Phoenix. Griffin, who is close with Irving, sensed both his unhappiness and his restlessness and was preparing for the possibility that Irving would request a trade. But once Griffin was no longer employed by the team, the conversations stalled. Cleveland then engaged in talks with Indiana and Denver, according to league sources."
There were rumors that the Cavs were going to get Paul George and Eric Bledsoe for Kyrie and Kevin Love. 2017 offseason
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
It's just insane to me when you compare it to the Jrue Holday compensation Jrue Holiday got 3 picks(2 unprotected) 2 pick swaps George Hill and Eric Bledsoe while James Harden got 4 unprotected picks 4 swaps and Victor Oladipo. I dont buy the leverage thing either everybody knew NOP wanted to trade Jrue last offseason also.   The Denver thing to me you just cant pass up an opportunity like this at this price if you are a small market team. If MPJ or Murray are off the table in a Harden discussion it just means you arent actually serious about trying to win a title.
Can we interest you in Lonzo Ball &amp; Eric Bledsoe?
Could work as in you could in theory build a team around him that could eventually be a contender. If they have Simmons they're in rebuild mode. What they put around him is up to them. If Giannis had Kawhi and Beal next to him they get to the finals but he had Kris Middleton and Eric bledsoe
"""Died"" is a stretch but Eric Bledsoe"
"One of the main knocks against him was that he was undersized. If we're going by listed weights, he's only 5 pounds heavier than Eric Bledsoe."
[Drew](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/04/eric-bledsoe-drew-terry-rozier-feud-comments-press-conference-video-celtics-bucks-nba)
Eric Bledsoe has had a disastrous impact on Lonzo's career lol
a drive and kick to eric bledsoe is so damn irresponsible
Well shit now that I have a Pels fan to talk to lol how do y'all feel about Eric Bledsoe? Just curious
"The spacing won't change. People aren't gonna defend Eric Bledsoe or Lonzo, Redick or Hart differently just because they start hitting more shotsp"
"1) Lol at implying that **Eric fucking Bledsoe** shooting 38.5% from 3 is a problem (Or Ingram being at 37%) - overally they're at 34% wide open which definitely isn't great, but it's not horrific, and I'd only expect them to be around 37-38% given their lack of shooters (they were at 40% last year)  2) You're also implying that shooters exist in a vacuum where the other guys around them being very poor shooters doesn't lead to them having lower quality shots  3) Zion was going to get to the rim no matter what. The problem is that there's always going to be multiple defenders there, and as a result he's not nearly as effective as he should be  21 a game on 59% TS% is really good, but it's not going to cut it when he's a terrible defender and is getting just 1.7 assists to 4.2 TOs. He'd be a lot more effective with spacing, which would open up easier drive attempts and passing lanes"
imagine picking eric bledsoe over Mr. President
"And not meaning to directly compare the two players or say that Pascal is doomed to be trash .... but Eric Bledsoe had two 30 or more point games in the first 15 games of last season as the *third* option. (One game with the same 11 of 21 shooting as this Pascal game, and another where he went off with 12 of 14.)  Then had one 30 point game the rest of the season.  Then became Drew Bledsoe once again before all was said and done.  So, just saying.... some people might want to hold off on celebrating his ""return"" until the dude has more than *one* good, but not great, game."
Bardley's defence has been amazing. It often looks like no one can score on him on the perimeter. Thats what all-defence looks like...not Eric Bledsoe
"Great response, genuinely.   If you want to compare superlatives used about the two you should listen to Taylor’s semi recent podcasts about the playoffs/finals. He seems genuinely shocked at AD’s awareness and mobility and really goes heavy on the modern Bill Russell comparisons, which is basically the most superlative defensive compliment in Ben Taylor’s book:   I do agree that KG was the best perimeter defender of his era amongst bigs but AD is also arguably the best at that among bigs currently. The problem is you’re seeing more and more bigs with KG type mobility so it’s becoming less standout ish in a way. You have guys like Ben Simmons, Giannis, Bam, Jonathan Isaac as well, a collection of 6’11 hyper mobile defensive minded guys the likes we’ve never seen at one time.   Also for DRAPM, it is ultimately an all in one statistic. And clearly has its flaws. On that same list you linked, Jokic is top 20 in DRAPM, Eric Bledsoe has a higher DRAPM than Paul George or Kawhi, and Ricky Rubio is higher than Lebron. None of that makes sense, which puts into question how good of a metric it is at assessing overall defensive impact."
"OP listed Eric Bledsoe and Ricky Rubio lol, I think Bynum fits right in. No one said all-timers only, just quality players."
He was... the Rip Hamilton and Eric Bledsoe plays?   Just because I like a player doesn’t mean he’s infallible and I have to ignore anything bad...
"Pels fan here jrue is mad overrated. This little cliche that all nba players consider him the best defender yet the media ignores him is sooo played out and viral for no reason. He is a great defender but as far as his tangible impact on a team, I gotta say I don't think Eric Bledsoe is much of a change at all."
Ah yes famous sixer Eric Bledsoe trying to guard Kawhi from scoring.  Accidently came to the game in his Bucks jersey but the refs let him play anyways.
"Apparently basketball is no longer a team sport. Tatums third option is Kemba Walker, Giannis’ is Eric Bledsoe"

Eric Bledsoe from 3 against the Raps: 8/14  Eric Bledsoe from 3 against every other team: 4/18
Yea that’s Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe
Zion get to play with Kyrie &amp; Harden then gotta go back home to Eric Bledsoe boy life ain’t funny at all.
The players look like Eric Bledsoe in a barbershop
&gt; Hahahahaha  Not sure why you’re laughing. No elite paint scorer or slasher has ever been completely locked down before.  &gt;And what was his opponent's game plan?  Collapse the paint and force Eric Bledsoe to shoot.  Are we gonna act like Tatum didn’t play like dogshit against Giannis in the playoffs?  &gt;Uh yeah because I'm talking to you. Pretty easy to tell.  Hahahahahaha
"&gt;Have you noticed any teams defend that particularly well?  You mean an actual screen the screener play or actual spain pick and roll not just a decoy? For an actual Spain P+R often you want both on ball defenders to switch to screw up the two screeners who are kind of like toggling together. Ive seen the Clippers blow it up before they have the personnel for it.   If you mean just the conventional pull up 3 out of pick and roll they were getting beat out of last night the center can come up higher. But the best remedy tbh is just see the screen coming and get over it, Eric Bledsoe in Milwaukee this was what he did better than anybody Milwaukee was very conservative with their drop also and it worked. There are definitely alot of plays Simmons gets over fine we only remember the ones he doesnt because they result in 3s but it can be an issue.   Embiid can come up higher a couple of his deep drops were kind of lazy and random March reg season type energy. But yeah he's never gonna come up high to the level of like what an Anthony Davis has shown"

Did he really have 12 of our first 14?!?    ALSO can you fill me in on why BI only had 25 minutes while ERIC BLEDSOE had 42
A reminder that the Pelicans extended Adams for 17m. Eric Bledsoe played 43 minutes.
He is a former Atlanta Hawks legend the same way Eric Bledsoe is one of the greatest three point shooters of all time.
Eric Bledsoe
That Eric Bledsoe is a good defender
Y'know technically Eric Bledsoe is just outside the top 200 in career three pointers made. That's out of thousands of NBA players historically! So in that lens I say Marv is right here!
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"Either Eric Bledsoe is a low effort, low IQ player or he really doesn't want to play in NOLA. Probably a combination of both but man has he been bad for NOLA."
Recency bias but crunch time Eric Bledsoe is ugly
"Need the role/support players we sign/trade for to stop shitting themselves immediately upon landing at MSY.  It started with Eric fucking Gordon and continues today with Eric fucking Bledsoe. We’ve done some dumbass things to ourselves like Ajinca but man. Really doesn’t help when you go to the FA market, pay market price, then the player throws a hissy fit because he has to leave LA/Boston/Miami to play in New Orleans.   Not the Bledsoe is doing this - he’s just sucking big time lately - but Eric Gordon man. Fuck Eric Gordon."
Im convinced were tanking. Anybody who let's Eric bledsoe put up this many shots is not trying to win. Get his ass off the floor and let Kira and NAW show what they got.
"Replace Eric Bledsoe, who’s just an old vet who’s around to cash in on his last contract and playing like it  Bring in some legit snipers. Redick ain’t doing it this year, but if we had last years version with this point Zion/JJ screen game we’re running rn, ooooooweeee (Mr. Poopy butthole voice)  Get some gritty, lunch pail defenders to keep on the floor with BI at all times"
"did Eric Bledsoe suck this badly in Milwaukee, too? He’s atrocious. I’ve never wanted a player off of a team so badly.  Also fuck these refs, Zion doesn’t get half the calls he deserves"
"If only one of the greatest shooters of all time, Eric Bledsoe would have made that shot."
Game on the line? Need a three? I want Eric Bledsoe shooting it. Fuck yeah
Marv really called eric bledsoe one of the greatest 3 point shooters in nba history
JJ Redick = Eric Bledsoe / Lamelo Ball = Thanasis Antetokounmpo / Sam Merrill = DJ Wilson  any i missed?
"Eric Bledsoe, one of the best 3-point shooters ever"
"Have you ever thought maybe Bucks had Eric Bledsoe, who constantly choke in the playoffs, and Giannis that can't shoot? Like, did you watch the series and notice how Heat defended Lopez?"
Eric Bledsoe revenge game part 2 Cajunbugaloo
Relying on Eric Bledsoe adjacent to come back spells trouble in any case
"Eric ""Aqua Dagger"" Bledsoe will always have a place in my heart."
Eric Bledsoe Sr.
Eric Bledsoe is like Jrue Holiday if Jrue Holiday fucking sucked
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
After Eric Bledsoe and Earl Watson quit on the team I seriously doubt that Booker will go Klutch
"SVG is fine, but yea the team is made up almost entirely of under 25 players, and an almost washed JJ Redick and a checked out Eric Bledsoe."
I have one Jaxson Hayes and Eric Bledsoe offer here
All my homies hate Eric Bledsoe.
Eric Bledsoe is 35 and has the lowest IQ on the floor
Eric Bledsoe stole one last season. Didn't think he deserved it at all
"David Griffin constructed an ill roster. I think SVG has the right ideas wanting to make them defensive minded, but most of the personnel just isn’t there or does it consistently. JJ Redick looks like a shell of himself. Lonzo’s not exactly a beacon of consistency. Zion is still learning when to insert himself especially in crunch time. Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe are just questionable fits too.   They need trades"
"Yeah, in the Ty Lawson, Mike Conley, Eric Bledsoe tier"
"Not stated here is Eric Bledsoe shooting a tick under 40% from 3 this season as well, which is the highest percentage he's had since .397 in 2012-13."
"theres literally two guys in the starting lineup who dont shoot outside of the paint and then eric bledsoe who has the numbers going right now but nobody is fighting over screens or closing out hard to try to stop his jumper.  his percentage on 3s currently is an outlier and is still being treated as such by teams.  now for your second part, this really isnt arguable, they have not shown to be a good fit on either end at any point.  it doesnt take a genius to see this.  you arent even trying to give me a legit rebuttal here so ill assume youve thought about it a bit and came to the same conclusion as anyone whos watched the pels."
"Its hard to win when you cant close out games nor defend the 3 or the paint even though the latter is their main focus. The team has no defenders, Eric Bledsoe is the best one and he's really only shows it on a good team like the Bucks.   &amp;#x200B;  I feel as if they start relaxing as soon as they have a lead in the fourth because this type of meltdown has happened multiple times.  This team has two all-star talents and a possible fringe all-star as well. I know they're young and there's going to be growing pains but this stuff shouldn't be happening. At least not so often"

"Have you saw Eric Bledsoe this year? Zion gets lost sometimes or is not the quickest to recover on the perimeter but it’s not been down to a lack of effort recently. Also his playmaking is taking huge strides and as a team we have been successful when he has the ball in his hands and is controlling the offense. The 3pt shot volume will continually increase, although I don’t disagree that he should maybe attempt a few more. His form isn’t too bad and the percentage is looking nice despite low volume. Either way, just because he is so dominant at finishing inside doesn’t make him a one trick pony"
Blake Griffin Eric Bledsoe love child
Jrue Holiday's floor is not lower than Eric Bledsoe's. Consistent defense plus whatever you get offensively is always going to be better than Bledsoe where defense is meh and the offense is also hit or miss.
They had to go all in though. Eric Bledsoe wasnt getting them there
[and i don’t think he’s in a hair salon this time](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2740296-eric-bledsoe-told-suns-i-dont-wanna-be-here-tweet-was-about-hair-salon-per-gm.amp.html)
"Eric Bledsoe at one point was the best defensive point guard in the league. When he was on the Clippers they had the two best defensive point guards in the league on the same team and he was arguably the best. The people who watched their games that year know what I'm talking about, they were locking up all the PG's."
"Sorry if we are going into pure drafting, and nothing in regards to fit or retaining players OKC blows everyone out of the water, even the Spurs. OKC has drafted 3 MVPs in 3 consecutive seasons. Not only that, look at some guys like Ibaka, Sabonis (trade on draft night), Brandon Clarke, Adams, Reggie Jackson, Eric Bledsoe, Big baby Davis, Luke Ridnor, Carl Landry, Corey Maggete, Nick Collison"
"they tried to trade him for paul george and eric bledsoe and when he found out, he requested a trade.  it's fair game to me"
"I was at the game when Eric Bledsoe [flopped](https://youtu.be/Ar-3r24sshI) when Lou Williams drove past him. It got challenged, there was absolutely no contact, and if they’re was, it was because Bledsoe put his face in the way of Lou’s drive (blocking foul on his face?). The refs decided that they liked they’re call on the floor.  They would rather lose all of their credibility than admit that they were wrong."
Dillon Brooks or Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe Kyle Lowry
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
See: Eric Bledsoe
Maybe LeBron is better than Eric Bledsoe
Literally got outplayed by Eric Bledsoe. Mindblowing
"&gt; With tonight's win, the Phoenix Suns will finish above .500 for the first time since 2013-2014  &gt; The last Phoenix team to finish above 0.500 was led by the trio of Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic, and Gerald Green. That team finished with 48 wins but missed the playoffs.  lol... meanwhile the wizards/bullets are sitting over here like “you think that’s a string of mediocrity? I’ll show y’all mofockers a string”. (Proceeds to drop 40 seasons of bullshit on table)  The wizards/bullets have not won 50 games (59% of 82 game season) since... 1979. Just think about that. The last time the wizards won 50 games in a season the empire strikes back was still in production.  The 48 win 13/14 LOTTERY season for the suns would have been the wizards second best record in that span. Just think about that. Second best season since Jimmy Carter was in office and it wouldn’t have even given them a playoff birth."
Eric Bledsoe hardly played that year. It was all dragon

Eric Bledsoe: I don't want to be here
Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes and Kira Lewis Jr all made some strides but then *also* promptly got injured.  I felt like we were really starting to turn a corner post-ASG and post-Minny loss too. Now everyone's just injured and we're trying to scrape by with new vets and.... Eric Bledsoe.
"The perimeter defense is designed to give up 3's rather than allow inside scoring. This results in teams lighting the pelicans up from 3, which in this era especially is tough.  The team collapses regularly in the 2nd half. This may be the result of their youth but they certainly don't seem like they want to win games. They have a hard time staying hungry and focused.  SVG has made some very questionable decisions around rotations and holding off on timeouts.  Eric Bledsoe is an incredibly frustrating player to watch. He makes some really sub-NBA level decisions every game and his defensive focus/effort is often truly awful.  A lot of the pieces don't complement one another.  The team hasn't really had a solid back-up 3 or 4 until the trade to get James Johnson.  The offense can grow very stagnant with Ingram getting tunnel vision and dribbling out the clock before putting up a contested midrange jumper. He's made a lot but missed a lot too.  Overall the team is just very young and poorly constructed."
"If Lonzos 3pt shoot isn’t falling, he can’t do much else in regard to scoring for us. Perimeter defense has been bad all year. Eric Bledsoe is terrible. Steven Adams gets more hate than he deserves but he’s been less than stellar. And now our guys are getting injured left and right"
"you do realize the wall works because when giannis kicks it out to a guy like eric bledsoe, they turn into a 24% 3pt shooter in the playoffs?  some of yall dont watch the games and it shows"
Sounds like who’s the team scapegoat with extra steps  Eric Bledsoe for the question btw
"Yeah, we don't. But to get an assist, the receiving player has to hit his shot. So getting assists isn't as easy if your 3pt shootng pass receivers are 32.6% Josh Hart and 19.6% Nicolo Melli. Or Eric Bledsoe who does at least hit 36%."
Since when is Eric Bledsoe back to being the Bucks PG? Ah naw? They have the best two way PG in the league now? Enjoy rooting for the Nets in the ECF
Got John Wall and Eric Bledsoe paid too
Pretty sure Eric Bledsoe or TJ McConnell would skunk this dude bro
First Eric Bledsoe now this?
"That's also what makes him closer to eric""mini lebron"" Bledsoe"
He's not Eric Bledsoe. He's *closer* to Bledsoe than he is to Holiday.
Lmao this is almost exactly what happened with Eric Bledsoe too right? He had a really good game and then the Bucks are like “ive seen enough”
Schroder is closer to Eric Bledsoe than he is to Jrue Holiday
Eric Bledsoe fucking sucks so much comparatively oh my god
what if eric bledsoe stayed with us
don't want to hear nothing about fox being underrated ever again  glorified eric bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe couldn't even hit a 3 against the Hawks bench this just makes Giannis carrying him to the 1 seed even more impressive
I wish this game was on ESPN so we got one of those bottom screen graphics like the Trae x Wiggins one vs GSW a week ago  Personally I would enjoy a Nathan Knight x Eric Bledsoe popping up at the bottom of my screen

Wow even Eric Bledsoe huh  Tatum had kyrie irving/Marcus Morris/Marcus smart/al horford/jaylen brown and couldn’t even get out the second round
&gt;Even Eric Bledsoe   Not even worth debating you
"He has Ingram, Lonzo, Steven Adams, even Eric Bledsoe. Tatum has Jay and Kemba. Name another."
Dude had Eric Bledsoe at the end of his bench never played him. The guy gets traded to Phoenix he is a borderline all star
Eric Bledsoe wasn’t overrated until this year. He was excellent for a lot of his career up until last year
His value is kind of low because of his injuries but I've been advocating for a PatBev-Eric Bledsoe swap for a while; sort of a sell-low for both parties.  The Clippers need a proper point guard and have extremely limited assets (as shown by the fact that they were only able to get Rajon Rondo for Lou Williams). Bledsoe can't shoot for shit but he'd only be there to make plays (remember he averaged 6 assists a game in the playoffs last year) and play defense. Hopefully Ibaka being a stretch-5 counteracts the lack of shooting.  The Pels get rid of a logjam in their backcourt while getting a guy that helps space the floor (PatBev is like a career 40% shooter from 3) who fits really well next to Lonzo.
Eric Bledsoe is by far the most overrated
"&gt;Historically though, when you think of the greats how many of them are above 6'3?  It's not just about height, it's about total size.  Almost all the great heavyweights other than Tyson and Frazier are his height or taller, and all of them are much more stoutly built.   Russ has like a 30-32"" waist, he is slight even for a nba player.   He is 2 inches taller and ~15# lighter than guys like Donovan Mitchell, Eric Bledsoe and Reggie Jackson, and none of those guys are particularly built or chubby.     You may notice that the all-time great heavyweights all have relatively wide hips and waists (like Ali, Holmes, Tyson, Foreman and so forth who are all at about 36"" waist in their prime).  It provides a leverage advantage and allows them to pack on additional mass to protect themselves from blows.  Westbrook may have the height and reach to be one, but he isn't built like someone who is meant to fight at heavyweight.    &gt;As for the other stuff, its not that he doesnt have those, its more that basketball doesnt present the opportunities for it  Right, that's my point.  We don't have anywhere near enough evidence to indicate that he has the potential to be an all time great like OP was claiming.  Being an elite athlete alone isn't close to being enough, and the particular natural talent variables that make for a good boxer don't share much overlap with those that make for a good basketball player."
Yeah maybe it'd be like Eric Bledsoe or someone like that who would give him problems. Too bad Ray Felton doesn't still play. That guy wouldn't budge.

I'm Eric Bledsoe and I have to say that this really struck a nerve.  I hope you're happy with yourself

"This year no College team is nearly dominant enough. I do think the 2009-2010 Kentucky team has a chance to hang with a bad NBA team.   PG: John Wall SG: Eric Bledsoe  SF: Darius Miller  PF: Patrick Patterson  C: Demarcus Cousins  Depth is an issue but that starting lineup is solid.   The 2014-2015 Kentucky team is also a possibility. You had Andrew and Aaron Harrison, Trey Lyles, Karl Anthony Towns, and Willie Caulie Stein starting with Devin Booker, Tyler Ullis, and Dakari Johnson off the bench.   Not saying they would win, but saying they’re maybe in the “on a random night” proximity."
This guy should start with lonzo over bumass Eric Bledsoe

When you left crying at Smoothie King Center, Eric Bledsoe was holding hands and dancing with a female and took down her number. Multiple people in the house know, therefore you should know the truth."
Eric Bledsoe is the nastiest skank bitch I've ever met. Do not trust him. He is a fugly slut.
By Far the most passionate thing about Eric Bledsoe I’ve seen. Dude is just a solid point guard holy fuck
"No but he does chuck up bad shots in the 4th quarter of close games. Eric Bledsoe is the real issue, he shouldn't even be on the court in close games. Any of the other guards are a better option at this point, so they have some type of spacing"
Eric Bledsoe made two consecutive game losing plays lmao
Why anyone would ever play Eric Bledsoe in high pressure moments is beyond me
"Eric Bledsoe can go to fucking Lithuania and play. I don't ever want a team to suffer his ass play.  To be fair, I love Dame equally as much as I hate Bledsoe. Just hate when it is the Pelicans.... Twice now this season."
Eric Bledsoe is so ass
"No but you don’t get it, he has bad point guard defense. That means he’s literally a scrub, Eric Bledsoe better :)"
She has the same form as Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe doesn’t wanna be here
Eric Bledsoe for Monty Williams who says no?
"I know they realistically still could beat us, but the way we've been playing all year has essentially been practice for playing against the defense that the Heat beat us with last year, and Giannis is getting very good at it. Plus, the Heat are certainly worse this year than last while the Bucks added Jrue Holiday instead of praying that Eric Bledsoe doesn't completely ruin the game for them. I would pick Bucks over Heat for sure right now"
"Eric Bledsoe averaged 10, 4, 4 against the raptors on 29% from the field and 17% from 3 but yes sure only Giannis free throws lost them that series lmfao. And didn’t Giannis also foul out of that game or something and they weren’t favourite against that Celtics team it was a 2 vs 7 match up and this is before he got to his MVP level but you just say what you like"
Trying to steal Willy GOAT too? Y'all cold.  Steph Curry for Eric Bledsoe.
The Bucks had Eric Bledsoe.
"Not sure if you realized but basketball is a team sport. I wonder how many games the bucks would have won in 2019 if Middleton missed 24 games like CP3, Brook Lopez missed 14 games like Capela, Eric Bledsoe missed 14 games like Eric Gordon and a myriad of other injuries to their role players."
"No it doesn't.   It's almost always the point guard even on all time great defenses because that's the smallest defender.   Tony parker on the spurs. Fischer on those Lakers years. Rondo on the 08 celtics.   All those guys were very good defenders, and still the weakest on the floor on those teams.   Those warriors were putting out lineups with 3 and 4 all nba first team level defenders at a time. Of course Steph was the weakest. He would've been even if he was also all defense, simply because of size. Like... Eric Bledsoe, who made all defense last year, would've been the worst defender in a lineup of Klay, iggy, dray, and Bogut lol."
"The Suns tried to brand Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe as the Slash Brothers  https://www.nba.com/suns/gallery/five-amazing-stats-you-didnt-know-about-slash-brothers#  Rose and Butler were also called the Slash Bros for a bit in 2015/2016 range, but it didn’t catch on because the team was mediocre."
Eric Bledsoe for Aaron Gordon is more to my liking but Magic would laugh at that
"OKC has a vested interest in making sure the Clippers stay mediocre so I can't see them trading Hill to them. Also what assets do they have to trade for Hill? Lou Williams makes sense salary-match wise but he straight up said he'd retire if he got moved.  I think the Clippers need a playmaker but they have to lower their expectations. I don't even think they can get Ricky Rubio now. As much as I hate to say, two potentially obtainable playmaking upgrades are *gag* Elfrid Payton and Eric Bledsoe."

Paul George is the Eric Bledsoe of Star players
It’s not bad. But who’s the best player he’s drafted since 2009? Eric Bledsoe?
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team!

Incoming RJ Barrett for Eric Bledsoe trade by Thibs
SVG’s brain doesn’t adapt to new info   I swear to god he just looks at day one starting lineup info and goes “yup this is my team forever”  Eric Bledsoe has no business being a starter when NAW or Kira can be getting experience
Load up the team with shooters and don't spend an off-season trading for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?
"This team stinks. Eric Bledsoe fucking sucks. He either has naked pics of Griff and SVG or they’re playing him to up his value. If it’s the value thing, pretty counterproductive because he’s tanking his value. He is absolutely garbage and lethargic."
"I know this is shitty of me. But as a pels fan, all of my rancor is centered on Eric Bledsoe lol"
Eric Bledsoe is the Pels PG....
"By getting 2 late firsts, Eric Bledsoe, and 2 pick swaps that will likely never convey?"
"For UK, you should definitely move Randle to the bench, put Book and Murray at the wings, and probably have Fox as starting PG.  Also, wild the John Wall, Demarcus Cousins and Eric Bledsoe are old men getting bumped from the rotation now."
"I miss Jrue so much. Can’t believe David Griffin turned him into Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams and a few middle schoolers smh"
Eric Bledsoe
"I'm livid every time I have to watch Eric Bledsoe on the Pelicans. How this man stole 1st team all defense I'll never know. He was put there because of the success of his team and the quality of the players around him and not of his own accord. Watched Holiday for years, this man doesn't hold a candle to Holiday as a defender."
Lol but you aren’t getting Ingram for him... I’ll Give you naw Hayes jj and Eric Bledsoe
"George ""the iceman"" Gervin.    The big ragu (donte divincenzo)   Aqua dagger (Eric Bledsoe)   Flatass john henson."
"Below average starter implies:  The Washington Wizards are not a meaningfully different team if they replaced Russell Westbrook with Eric Bledsoe or Patrick Beverley. Not only that, but they might be a *better* team.  They could make up for:  1st in the league in assists  Top 10 in rebounding  Top 20 points per game  By getting Bledsoe? Getting the third 30/20/10 game in history didn't help them beat the pacers?  Sheesh. Westbrook is worse than I thought I guess. Here I was thinking he was some kind of Hall of Famer!"

Pelicans team construction makes no sense. Pelicans coach decision makes no sense. Pelicans in game made little sense Not giving zion the ball makes no sense Playing Eric Bledsoe that much makes no sense   The pelicans season as whole got them exactly where it should've. That's the only thing that makes sense.
Athletic guard who can't shoot. Basically Eric Bledsoe but worse.
So your case is that Kyle Lowry is so good that he should be looked at as fondly as Eric Bledsoe?
"Which is bullshit, Lowry doesn’t have some of the accolades he deserves.   Theres 2x all defensive nods that went to Eric fucking Bledsoe that should have been his, he should have been at least All-NBA 3rd team instead of Westbrook last season. Don’t even start me about his 2016-2017 season either."
"""""I don't wanna be here""  -Eric Bledsoe""  -Toronto Raptors"
"Eric Bledsoe getting into All-Defense last year was dumb as shit. He was a decent defensive player on a great defensive team. But he was no where near one of the 4 best defensive guards in the league. Fuck, he wasn't even top 10."

Idk for what but get rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
Castaways? I’m pretty sure some of those castaways are better than Eric bledsoe and Steven Adams easily
He literally got injured 1st quarter of game 3. Congrats to the heat for beating eric bledsoe.
Pels have been the #1 defense in the entire league for the past ~20 games actually if you can believe it. Mainly has to do with Eric Bledsoe finally giving a modicum of effort that reflects his all-defensive reputation and Naji Marshall being given major minutes instead of being chained to the bench like he had been for most of the year.
Y'all told me David Griffin is a fraud and can't draft/is a trash GM tho. If Eric Bledsoe didn't wait until the season was already over to give a half of a shit the Pels would be cruising right now.
Eric Bledsoe struggles in the playoffs. replacing him with Jrue Holiday is going to make a huge difference for the Buck's offense come playoff time
Eric Bledsoe
He literally used to shit on Eric Bledsoe in threads.  Stop lying to yourself dude.
"Huh? I didn't make any excuses, I'm not even the original commenter moron, I'm just responding to your comment about ""\[taking\] a shot at the super young team"". They have no excuse for being sub 500 in any universe with 2 all stars, coach or not.  You're the one trying to make excuses, ""young"", ""worst coach"", BI has been in the league for 5 years, Lonzo 4, Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, etc. You just sound like a sad, cynical bitch trying to take what little satisfaction you can in the Lakers failure, when the Pelicans have been failing for the past 20 years LOL  Guess you gotta enjoy it whenever you can"
Eric Bledsoe
"Uh..he's 185 at 6'3. That's really small. His thin frame and leanness makes for good aesthetics which is why you can be tricked into thinking he's bigger than he is. For reference, Eric Bledsoe who's actually pretty built and thick is listed at 214 while being 2 inches shorter than Curry."
Eric Bledsoe.
Eric Bledsoe the tank commander
Eric Bledsoe has never been an All-NBA quality defender and if you think he was it’s because you didn’t watch him.   This regression was pretty predictable because ‘poor focus’ and inconsistency are synonymous with Bledsoe.
"Maybe if he traded for players who could hit jump shots, zion could go to work down there? Instead, this moron traded for Steven Adams ($29 m, and a $19 m extension coming, signed off again by this same moron), Eric Bledsoe ($16 m), and James Johnson ($16 m).   This guy also drafted a lane clogging center in Jaxson Hayes at 8 over Tyler Herro.   Whose idea of a lineup combinations of the following is a good idea:  Zion.  Adams.   Ingram  .       .   Hayes.    Johnson . Bledsoe.   Ball Lewis.   .   Hart?  What possible lineup is going to give proper spacing?   They could have gotten into the Turner for Hayward SnT and send picks to Boston, or they could have just sent #4 for him to Indy after the AD trade. But, this idiot thinks he has the magic touch with drafting.   Yes, zion is getting hacked. But it's partially your fault because of incompetence. Maybe he'll stfu and hire someone who doesn't eat glue and then let that person make personnel decisions for him."
yeah i don’t want to see eric bledsoe in a pelicans uniform ever again
Lmaoooo eric bledsoe booty juice
"&gt; &gt;1. **Re-Sign Lonzo Ball or let him walk?**   Let RFA play out. New Orleans has the upper hand in regards to holds. Work out a S&amp;T if the price looks to get to be too much.   &gt; &gt;2. **What to do with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?**   Move Bledsoe as salary ballast for a bigger move as MKE did, using actual assets to offset his poor value on the court. This is preferable this off season but could be pushed to trade deadline.   Adams is... Fine. At 17M he's not a value, but not crippling. Jaxson Hayes or a better acquired C can easily take his minutes as season goes on. Again, could be moved as salary ballast in off season or at the deadline.   &gt; &gt;3. **Keep coach Stan Van Gundy?**   SVG is going nowhere. He was brought in for long term development and stability. Considering the next to no off season and limited practice time this season, the individual development of young players has been fine. Team defense has actually improved as the season has gone on. He's likely not the answer for a contender, but he'll get at minimum one more year.   &gt; &gt;4. **What to do with Brandon Ingram?**   Ingram has already been paid. He is a big question long term if his defense doesn't improve, but they will give him at least another year unless the perfect fit alongside Zion becomes available. He fits well with the city of New Orleans and star level players actually wanting to be here should not be taken for granted. If he regresses in fit/defense this can and will be revisited next off season."
what did my man goga even do? if i was a coach i wouldn't even yell at eric bledsoe like that
"wasn’t eric bledsoe all-nba last year? He’s like 6’1”.  and teams don’t “hunt out” switches to fvv. If he gets switched onto a big man in a pick and roll he’ll try his best to hold his own, primarily by trying to swipe the ball away before they can even bring the ball up. More often than not, he’s getting a steal or “block”."
"Kevin Love is def a front runner, but shout out to Eric Bledsoe"
"Ok but NOLA got promising young players like Lonzo or Ingram. We sent the Pelicans Eric Bledsoe, who is a net negative rn"
"He’s going to be one of those players that every team wants, I see him turning into a Jrue Holiday type player. Hope he stays with Zion though, just need to get rid of Eric Bledsoe."
"I’m not really sure what you’re arguing here.  You seem to be mad that they’re correctly not penalizing Zion’s brilliant play even tho the team is mediocre— even tho you’re saying he shouldn’t be penalized for “big numbers on a bad team”.  And they’re not even that bad. They’ve hovered around .500; pretty solid considering basically every team ahead of them in the West standings projected to be a better team at the start of the season. And the Eastern conference is the strongest it’s been... this century?  Not every team can win, it’s just not possible. Also: Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe could not be a worse fit next to Zion. Lonzo and Ingram just barely make it work. And he’s still scoring at ridiculous efficiency. If you put him on a good team with good players he’d be unstoppable. I at first thought: “there’s no way I’d take Zion over butler or PG.” Then I thought “wait a minute, he scores 30 and only misses like 4 shots a game, maybe I should take Zion over those guys.”  He’s insanely efficient, and, like you said, that means it’s not empty stats. He’s not totally out of place where he’s ranked. Like everyone else on the list, you could probably argue he deserves to be both 2 spots higher *and* 2 spots lower."
"Yeah. Maybe a JJ Reddick, or a Steve Adams, or a Eric Bledsoe. Maybe a James Johnson"
"ppl here have no idea what the standard for ""non-starter"" really is. No one ever makes threads about like Hamidou Diallo or Gary Harris bad games because no one cares like they do for more famous players. Eric Bledsoe is starting next to Lonzo and he's hasn't played well much since joining the pels.  Lonzo is an NBA starter easily. His good games are great and posting his worst game of the year on reddit doesn't make all of his bad games like this one. He's fucking 23 years old, scored 33 the other day and triple doubled before that and now he has no shot at EVER being an all-star. ok then  knicks wouldn't start him over elf?"
Good. Fuck Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe was tired bro let the man rest
The honest reason is:   Stan Van Gundy insists on playing Eric Bledsoe. It's borderline inexcusable. I'm pissed as a Laker fan because Vogel plays Drummond too much. But Svg playing Eric Bledsoe *any* amount of minutes is far worse.
Finally I can watch the Bucks play without suffering through the ineptitude of Eric Bledsoe.  *Jeff Teague has entered the chat*  God dammit.
Benching Eric Bledsoe
Fuck Eric Bledsoe  At what point in this player empowerment bullshit can this team not even expect vets they trade for to fucking show up and give baseline effort  I will root against this trash mother fucker the rest of his career  Look at this fucking garbage
Google Eric Bledsoe tweet and you’ll read about it. It’s pretty funny.
Someone rate this on a scale of 1- Eric Bledsoe
Patty Mills is such a better play-in headliner than Eric Bledsoe.
I strive to make this Eric Bledsoe
"We have walked through the valley of the shadow of death, and passed Michael Beasley / The Morri / Eric Bledsoe / Bender.Chriss.Jackson.Len.  All false prophets....and look at us now."
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
please foul out eric bledsoe so we can be #saved
Does Eric Bledsoe hate us? Why is he doing this?
Can we do surprising one a bad way? Bc I have no clue how Eric Bledsoe was all defense over jrue
But the physical dimensions of the guys you're comparing to don't make sense.  Jorden is 6'6 and 210ish lbs so he has 20 lbs plus 2-3 inches on Dumers/Payton.  Lebron is 6'8 and 250 while Smart is 6'3 and 220 lbs so Lebron has a 30 lb plus 5 inch advantage on Smart.  Kawhi is 6'7 and 230 lbs while Eric Bledsoe is 6'1 and 210 lbs so Kawhi has a 20 lb plus 6 inch advantage over Bledsoe.  The weight difference is sorta close if you squint but height which is obviously really big in basketball isn't close at all.
Eric Bledsoe was indeed a terrible comparison
Did you really just compare HOF players like Payton and Dumars to Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe?
"Eric Bledsoe so I could just go out there, do fuck all, get paid, then start the next night."
or Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams lol the whole pelicans starting five is better than DeRozans according to ESPN.
Idk man. Is he better than Steven Adams? Eric Bledsoe? Tyler Herro? Seems like a stretch to me.
He was definitely good against the Bucks.   People think he was better than he was though because of the iconic moment he showed up in a Drew Bledsoe jersey while outplaying Eric.
"Or maybe we’ll sign Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe to- oh, wait."
That’s nothing we have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
"Eric Bledsoe is so bad, jesus"
we need talent  if Zion has to share the starting lineup with Eric Bledsoe &amp; Steven Adams for another season I might request a trade.
"Trade Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe , figure out my life with Lonzo and surround him with shooters   Brandon Ingram is a top 10 scorer in the league (averaging 25+ on high efficiency with the worst spacing in the league) . Get 3 and D defenders and you’re a championship contender for the next 10 years . Personally I wouldn’t let go of Lonzo but BI and Zion are a very very very good core . And fire Stan Van Gundy.   I don’t completely blame him as Bledsoe and Adams do put you in a horrible place in today’s NBA but he’s not it ."
"They got a handful of vets that were... meant to be locker room leaders...  J.J. Redick, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe...  And the guys like them but they didn't establish a culture the way Julius Randle has for the Knicks. Or Jimmy Butler for the Heat. Or Chris Paul/The Suns. Conley is that dude on the Jazz.  We just don't have that."
What's comparable is thinking a bad defensive team making strides defensively is necessarily more impactful than making strides offensively. Why do you think floor spacers will bump the Pelicans up a couple of spots offensively but somehow a couple attainable defensive players can make a marked improvement?   Having Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adam's clogging the paint with the most dominant paint player in the league is a glaring offensive issue that needs to be fixed urgently.
"I like Josh Hart a lot too, but the main issue is he’s not a great 3 point shooter. That’s why I prefer him as the 6th man and he can of course play a lot of minutes and he’ll play the important defensive minutes. If Hart could ever improve his 3PT%, then he’s a great option at SG. But if Lonzo leaves, they can try to make a bid at Duncan Robinson with the cap space, but the problem is Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams’s contracts for the next few years will limit mobility to sign FAs. I think Zion thrives the best when playing with pace and space (so a lot of 3+D guys around him). I think C is a bigger issue than SG though right now. Adams absolutely hurts Zion a lot."
"Get rid of Eric Bledsoe would be number one. Now I understand why the Bucks flamed out, because Bledsoe is a detriment to that team. He’s like the Javale McGee of shooting guards."
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he’s too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he’s probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it’ll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He’s already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"It's a mix of things.  If the shot isn't falling, has trouble getting FTs. He really only drives in the rare fastbreak situation, and sometimes when he gets fouled there's no call because he has no reputation as a slasher. Refs are weird. It's easy to block/foul him because of that. Meanwhile, Eric Bledsoe can't finish at all lately, but he can get the whistle/get easy points that way.  He's been coming off of injuries a lot this season (knees, now hips) and when he does, it's difficult for him to get back into shooting flow. So then it's ""0-5pt"" games. And that's sometimes weeks and weeks of inconsistency. Which sucks. Our backcourt isn't contributing, and then Zion and Brandon are left on an island.  *And then you have...*  Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball have similar issues with confidence/being consistent and I don't think they bring out the best in each other.  It's why I was begging them to play Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis Jr. more in Lonzo Ball line-ups. (And to start NAW.) NAW is more reliable offensively than Bledsoe, and Kira Lewis Jr. is a very good cutter and a fast rookie who helps your point guard get more eyes off of your star players. They're offensive threats and dudes you can swing the ball to, vs. Bled. (Who is left unguarded by other teams *a lot*.)  But, the roster this year wasn't built to help *anyone*. It hurts our star players the most---which is the most important part, but it sure as hell doesn't help the dudes like Lonzo, Josh in the line-up either."
It's going to depend on Giannis knocking down free throws and the other players not missing their wide open shots that he generates once team set up the wall again. I'm certainly more confident on Jrue doing so than Eric Bledsoe.
"He's behind Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball"
"Perhaps, but there's only so far a team as disbalanced as the Pelicans can go. A team with an Eric ""12 PPG on 38% shooting over his last 20 games"" Bledsoe and Lonzo ""75% of shots are threes"" Ball can only go so far. Teams need point guard play."

&gt;Eric Bledsoe might be a good player but the games I've watched have made him look like a bumbling idiot.  whhewwwwww have I seen too much of this man this year   🙀
"I've only watched a handful of games but my impression is that Zion is a star, BI and Steven Adams are quality players, Lonzo has promise, and the rest of the team needs a ton of work.  Eric Bledsoe might be a good player but the games I've watched have made him look like a bumbling idiot."
"Coach Pop gonna make everyone but Zion and BI beat us, so should be interesting to see if Eric Bledsoe/Lonzo Ball can score any points tonight..."
Do you really have an Eric Bledsoe flair my guy?
But we got Eric Bledsoe out of the babahahahaha I can’t finish that thought
"M(arvel)VP awarded by fan vote, early contenders Eric Bledsoe and Kelly Oubre Jr."
i still don't understand getting Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe and wanting to get rid of Lonzo Ball while HAVING ZION FUCKING WILLIAMSON ON YOUR TEAM
"What? Gary Payton is always brought up in discussions of the best defensive players ever. Ask some of these nba players now and former players who played against him and ask if he would be a good defender nowadays. IMO Gary would be Kawhi level of defense in 2021 for a guard size. Look at Jrue Holiday,Cp3, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe to name a few"
"&gt;*Do you guys really want to get rid of Lonzo that badly? I thought he was having a good season?*  I'm not mad if we match his offers, but I'm a little worried.  He can't drive to the basket/finish at the rim and he's sort of flirting with a mid-range game but it's not in his bag yet. He's tried it a few times recently.  When he has bad three-point shooting games he just disappears, and can't get free-throw points and that's kind of concerning for how much money he's asking for. (20m and up.)  Past few games he and Eric Bledsoe have combined for like 5pts... and aren't consistently helping out our forwards.  In an ideal world, he has that 3pt shot all season long and the other stuff wouldn't be an issue."
all my homies hate eric bledsoe
Kira Lewis subbing in and Eric Bledsoe sitting on the bench
"Great, Eric Bledsoe is going to replace him. And have fun in the lottery again next season.  The Pelicans do not have the luxury of letting players like Lonzo walk. You’re not going to sign better ones."
Or if Eric Bledsoe remembered how to play basketball/give a shit. He went from averaging 15/4.6/5.4 on 47.5/34.4/79 shooting in 27 minutes to 12/3.5/3.7 on 40.7/34.5/73.4 shooting in 30 minutes
"Lonzo is a distressed asset. He obviously does not want to be in NO. That roster is a mess, Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe provide no spacing whatsoever. I also think the locker room has checked out on Stan."
"David Griffin really put y’all in hell. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams are possible the worst supporting cast that could give to Zion and BI, zero spacing"
I was just jealous your players actually did it.  We just lost to the Knicks because Eric Bledsoe 'wasn't paying attention' when they asked him to foul when up by three.
"Bledsoe admitted SVG told the team to do it, and he just forgot. At this point I would rather have Eric Gordon back. At least he had the sense to be ""injured"" the whole time instead of playing and actively losing games"
Haha just force us to give the ball to Eric Bledsoe every possession and it's a Nets W
"lol the Pels are not good, as amazing as Zion is the Pels are a bunch of children still. The only guy on that team capable of being a closer is BI. Their defense still sucks and the floor is still low key a mess with all the mish mashed players. You question what the hell Steven Adams is doing there and then you question what the hell Eric Bledsoe is doing there and then you remember out of nowhere that Lonzo Ball still exists and is on there and holy shit this game actually traded away JJ Redick lol"
"CP3 had as much success with the Hornets as he did evertwhere else he went.   AD had daddy Lebron win him a championship.   Since AD, we have a different owner, front office, medical staff and coaching staff. The only things that have  remained the same from AD to Zion are the uniforms, arena and Fred Vinson.   The team currently has 2 Allstars under 24. They have the 2nd most 1st round picks in the leauge through 2027. They have 3 promising young players in Jaxson Hayes, NAW and Kira Lewis. So what is the incompetence you're talking about outside of Eric Bledsoe?"
Your Eric Bledsoe flair immediately disqualifies your opinion
Bucks were my all time despicable team with Tony Snell Thon Maker and Eric Bledsoe I never gave them enough props now here I am
Terry rozier really turned Eric Bledsoe from promising young point guard into a meme after one playoff run.
Should we get Zion the ball for the final shot?  Why? We’ve got Eric Bledsoe!
Eric Bledsoe has got to be the worst crunch time player in the league
"&gt;	Bledsoe made back-to-back all defensive teams, who would’ve thought he’d start to suck on that end and make rookie mistakes on the offensive end?   People that have watched Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs."
"&gt; Eric Bledsoe admits in postgame that he was supposed to foul Derrick Rose on Knicks final offensive possession in regulation -- before Lonzo Ball whiffed on his assignment in staying adhered to Reggie Bullock.  This probably implies that Bledsoe was told by SVG to foul, so they didn’t foul and they closed out on a layup to let up an open 3 to the Knicks best shooter"
Def Eric Bledsoe. Y’all should trade for him
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris are way more fraudulent than Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe but they get a pass ‘cause they play for a big market.
"Eric ""6 foot Giannis"" Bledsoe"
[From 2019](https://eu.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2019/12/31/nickel-psychology-behind-let-fly-and-why-works/2773222001/):  &gt; Budenholzer has stood by Eric Bledsoe after his shooting slump late in the playoffs and finally convinced Giannis Antetokounmpo he can and should take open three-pointers.
"&gt; In my opinion, Giannis keeps doing those stupid things because no one is telling him not to.  It's worse than that. [From 2019](https://eu.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2019/12/31/nickel-psychology-behind-let-fly-and-why-works/2773222001/):  &gt; Budenholzer has stood by Eric Bledsoe after his shooting slump late in the playoffs and finally convinced Giannis Antetokounmpo he can and should take open three-pointers."
Zion doesn’t have any limitations. He’s doing fine.  Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams hurt Ingram more than anyone.
"The roster couldn’t really compete night in and night out. The spacing was always going to be bad even though they got an uncharacteristically efficient 3P season out of a couple of their young guys.   There was never a world where Bledsoe would return to the bench, and extra tidbit since he’s paid and not competing for a championship he gives even less of a shit then he arguably ever has. Bledsoe was legitimately the least efficient guard playing 26 mpg or more in the whole league this year. Eric Bledsoe is who NBA Twitter thinks Russell Westbrook is.   Pair that with an otherwise fast and loose young team and Adams, who even though he’s still playing really good defense doesn’t fit well with this squad at all, and I don’t get how anything was supposed to fit with this team unless you were expecting Zion to go full Charles Barkley or Ingram to go full KD this year"
I like that he put the ball in Zion’s hands like a primary playmaker but playing Eric Bledsoe as much as he did ..🤢
Eric Bledsoe
"Middleton been playing ight since his slump the first two games, jrue during into eric bledsoe with play making did surprise me though"
Maybe if he added a couple of knockdown shooters like Eric Bledsoe or Lonzo Ball in the backcourt
And Eric Bledsoe playing 30 MPG
Or maybe he's just trying to find a fall guy for his trash roster construction. WTF was SVG gonna do with Zion and the amazing spacing of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
"Yeah the two egregiously bad decisions he's made so far are  1. Taking back Eric Bledsoe instead of George Hill in the Jrue Holiday trade. Zion plays almost the same style of ball that Giannis does, but Griffin didn't get the message that the Bucks were literally trying to dump Bledsoe because of how egregiously bad he was in the playoffs. I'm pretty convinced that they could've easily had HILL considering he was just redirected to OKC anyways. Hill's contract was much more manageable and he was a much better fit alongside Pelicans' core (spacing + decent defense) 2. Bringing in Steven Adams instead of Myles Turner. Myles Turner, while he is not as good at rebounding/boxing out, is a better rim protector and can actually space the floor on offense for Zion. One of the reasons the Bucks exploded was because they brought in Brook Lopez to clear out the floor for Giannis. Myles Turner was VERY AVAILABLE. The Celtics were exploring a market to redirect him and found that few teams valued him. The Pelicans coulda had him last offseason for super cheap  The team David Griffin is building around Zion, in spite of the fact that they have a shit ton of assets, is so bad that I'd be worried that Zion would take the qualifying offer just to gtfo  Pelicans need to fire him if they don't want Lebron 2.0 on their hands"
&gt; Who could’ve realistically done a better job when your starting 2 guard is Eric “I don’t want to be here” Bledsoe  anyone who wouldve made bledsoe *not* a starting guard.
"David Griffin needs to go ASAP. This guy has no direction. I don’t think SVG was the goat or anything but how are you going to fire a brand new coach after you create the roster the Pelicans had? Who could’ve realistically done a better job when your starting 2 guard is Eric “I don’t want to be here” Bledsoe, a grossly overpaid Steven Adams and some of the worst shooters in the league. Can Zion get some continuity with a coach?? Griffin needs to take responsibility"
I would much rather Eric Bledsoe retired more than anything.
"ESPN already had a Pels/Warrior promo or ad(ie the thing they show you on the screen during a game ""Tomorrow on ESPN at 9:30 Team X vs Team Y with a player on each team in the background) earlier this year where it was Eric Bledsoe and literally a head coach with Steve Kerr."
Most overrated player in the league. Getting paid max money to be Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs. Dude air balled an elbow jumper smh
you started Zion with eric bledsoe and stevens adams
Get back Eric Bledsoe asap so he can take the blame instead of the 2 times MVP
Are we sure that Jrue isn't just Eric Bledsoe in disguise?  Dude has seemed like a nonfactor most of the series.  How underwhelming.
Jrue Holiday channeling his inner Eric Bledsoe
I thought the Bucks got rid of Eric Bledsoe
Great the ghost of Eric Bledsoe has entered Jrue
"Bro we had to start Eric Bledsoe, that's honestly worse than an injury. I'm taking any chip to the bank."
"Gotta be Eric Bledsoe's ""Mini Lebron"":  &gt; Nov 15, 2012 &gt; Justin Verrier  &gt; LOS ANGELES -- It started with Jamal Crawford. The Los Angeles Clippers’ offseason import was instantly struck by how dynamic an athlete his new backcourt mate was, and so he needed a nickname that fit.  &gt; “Mini-LeBron.”  &gt; Thanks to Crawford, it’s what most of the Clippers are calling Eric Bledsoe these days. And now even his nickname-sake is joining in.  &gt; “[LeBron] actually called me that when we left the court,” said Bledsoe after the Clippers’ 107-100 victory over the Miami Heat at Staples Center. &gt; “Yeah, he did. He said, ‘This is Baby LeBron.’”"
"Eric Bledsoe is out on a day-to-day basis as the Bucks travel to Arizona to face the Suns in the NBA Finals. Apparently he won't be able to play road games on that series because, and I quote, ""I don't want to be here""."
Lol Eric Bledsoe would be pissed!
Eric Bledsoe died for this.
"I suffered watching goran dragic, Eric Bledsoe, and Isaiah Thomas share the court for this moment"
"&gt; Jokic playmaking elevates his teammates.  So what does drawing three defenders steps away from the perimeter do for your teammates? Every new Bucks player signed this season, with the exception of 36 year old PJ Tucker, has been shooting career high TS%. The four 'biggest' players to leave the Bucks roster at the end of last season (George Hill, Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews and Marvin Williams) are either out of the league (Marvin Williams) or are shooting 6%~ worse from the field (52-&gt;44, 47.5-&gt;42, 40-&gt;35) now they're on a new team.  Jokic *is* a better playmaker, but that isn't all that elevating teammates is and I really can't pretend like Giannis one of the best floor-raisers in the league. Just because it's not happening through passing doesn't mean it's not happening.  Also, Bucks can average less than 100 points if they're still winning games. Team's playoff record isn't the argument for Jokic."
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday"
imagine Eric Bledsoe doing what Jrue just did lol
When bucks fans tried to make Aqua Dagger the nickname for Eric Bledsoe...
gonna be real awkward when Jrue Holiday puts up worse playoff numbers than Eric Bledsoe
"Yep, Jrue has gotten exposed too. Glorified Eric Bledsoe"
Jrue Holiday is a more aggressive Eric Bledsoe.
"There’s a significant difference between CP and Jimmy in that Jimmy’s vocal about when you’re stepping out of your role, but CP is really great about communicating the limits and specifications of your role before you do too much. And Jimmy’s even said as much (that interview he did on JJ’s podcast gave a lot of insight into this). It’s a difference in leadership style that makes Jimmy a more feast or famine leader than CP.   CP’s worked to get the most out of young guys on his team his whole career. We’ve seen guys under 25 have great showings on his teams. Off the top of my head Eric Bledsoe, DeAndre Jordan, Clint Capela, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and now DA, Cam Johnson and Bridges all got great starts to their careers by getting guided by CP on how to to fit their games around him because CP is one of the all time great floor conductors. Paul’s just always on time and that consistency is great for young players.  My only concern for a CP/KAT pairing would be if KAT would be reduced to a rim running center I think that’s a waste of his 3 level scoring game."
"They have Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe making like 45m dollars combined, I'm gonna say they're fucking up"
"&gt;Dude was getting downvoted  He was getting downvoted because what he said was stupid. The 9th place team in the West wasn't going to beat the Heat in a 7 game series. The Suns were led by Eric Bledsoe, Gerald Green, PJ Tucker, Channing Frye, and Goran Dragic. 2 bench role players, a borderline all-star, and 2 league-average starters."
Right so you have no rebuttal then I guess.  Eric Bledsoe and George hill and 3 first round picks you idiot
"Literally every part of your comment gives away the fact that you have no idea what you’re talking about so I’m not taking the time. Look up advanced stats, remember defense exists, and look up how Eric Bledsoe and George Hill did this year."
"Crazy to think that Eric Bledsoe, Isaiah Thomas, and Goran Dragic all used to be on the Suns these days"
"This whole sub did. Eric Bledsoe was also ""mini Lebron"" and look how that worked out"
Eric Bledsoe would never.
man cosplaying eric bledsoe until 11 seconds to go
"If I learned anything from this game, you can take the Bucks out of Eric Bledsoe, but you can't take Eric Bledsoe out of the Bucks."
Jrue Holiday had been doing is best Eric Bledsoe impression up until this possession.
Eric Bledsoe doesn’t make that play
Shoutout Eric Bledsoe!
Bucks are become Eric Bledsoe.
All I know is…  Jrue Holiday is doing his best Eric Bledsoe impression. The Bucks offense seems to be dependent on his rhythm.
"The bucks never actually traded Eric ""Jrue"" Bledsoe"
Holiday doing his best Eric Bledsoe impersonation tonight.
Not sure if thats jrue holiday or eric bledsoe??
jrue holiday morphed into eric bledsoe
What’s going on? I thought that Jrue Holiday was God compared to Eric Bledsoe.
Can’t tell if that’s Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe
Holiday turned into Eric Bledsoe before our eyes smh
"If you’d actually watch the games then you’d know that all Bud has been doing lately is iso at the top of the key for whichever player lmao.  This is what I’m talking about, I didn’t say anything about the roster. It’s the coaching which has a lack of a creative offence.  AD also hasn’t done anything in his career without LeBron &amp; SPECIFICALLY RONDO out of all people while Giannis was almost up 3-0 on the eventual NBA champions if it weren’t for a 2OT with Eric Bledsoe is his PG. Arguably Giannis has been up against tougher defences as well yet put up decent stats.  It’s clearly the makeup of the offence.  This is what I’m talking about lol. You either don’t watch the Bucks or don’t know what you’re talking about, here it seems like both.   He literally did more with a worse roster &amp; carried a back court of Wesley Mathews + Bledsoe to one of the best defences ever, and last years roster was his worst yet.  Only 5 players in NBA history have ever won both MVP &amp; DPOY, and all besides Giannis have a championship to their name. However, the average age they all won their first title was at approximately 31 while Giannis is still only 26.   The players were MJ, Hakeem, David Robinson &amp; KG."
"Try to get better.   Literally, I’m on the train of swap PatBev for Eric Bledsoe and sign Elfrid Payton for a vet min. Im Open to all other discussion but it’s not like they have a lot of room here"
"Look at Malcolm Brogdon’s efficiency next to Giannis, look at Eric Bledsoe next to Giannis, look at Wesley Mathews next to him.   Giannis is a pretty great playmakers he’s obviously not LeBron in that category but he has some of the strongest gravity in the league next to Curry, if used correctly it would be very similar to Kobe &amp; Shaq.   If you actually cared to watch the games you’d know coach Bud has resorted to going ISO’s for all his players rather than having Giannis in the correct position where he’d be better utilized."
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * OG Anunoby  Raptors get:   * Eric Bledsoe  * Anfernee Simons  * 3 Pelicans 1sts  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  Blazers flip CJ, for a SF, a desperate need -- and OG is a top 3 perimeter defender in the league. They contend with Dame/Norm/OG/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans pay up to flip Bledsoe's useless contract for a great shooterwho helps space the floor for Zion.  Raptors pick up assets and a young player to further help them retool"
"Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, and a handful of mid-20s draft picks were a premium trade package? Somebody didn’t watch literally any of this season"
I was still a believer after 2019. There was the Eric Bledsoe debacle and I dunno thought I know he’s not a great shooter but some variance there. After 2020 against the Heat though? It just was what it was.
How about Eric Bledsoe
"If Eric Bledsoe was 7’6, would he be the greatest player of all time?"
"Not exactly the same at all - Steph Curry showed up this year, and was amazing to watch despite the fact that it was clear from the start that they wouldn't be contending. No Westbrook triple-double record or Wizards fighting into the playoffs because, fuck it, what's the point. Kyle Lowry gets 10ppg and gives up on defense because Raptors were bad this year.  If other players took not-bothering to seek a trade to the extent Blake Griffin did the league would be utter shit. I'd rather Pelicans Eric Bledsoe and Cleveland Kevin Love were the exceptions, thanks."
I mean he was pretty damn close 2 years ago with Eric Bledsoe playing like absolute dog shit as his supposed third best player.
"I think for small guards (under 6-3l we will see the raise of thick builds like Eric Gordon, Bledsoe, Mitchell, FVV, Lowry, CP3. Their base allows them to guard way bigger players.   If you're built like Pat Bev, 170 lbs 6-1, you can't play"
They lost George hill and Eric bledsoe. And replaced them with Bobby portis and Bryn Forbes and PJ Tucker
"Realistically, there is no way Bud keeps his job after this season. Imagine being the GM of the team, assembling this roster, signing Jrue Holiday, miraculously dumping the contracts of Eric Bledsoe and DJ Augustine, and STILL getting smashed."
Neither is Eric Bledsoe...
I'd rather have Eric Bledsoe than Khris Middleton right now.
khris middleton is a 6'7 eric bledsoe
idk. a lot of guys. how about Eric Bledsoe
Trade Porzingis for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. Then sign DeRozan after signing THJ to a team-friendly deal.
There are a lot of point guards more disappointing than Pat Bev. Eric Bledsoe has to be above him at least. Elfrid Payton?
"Dude thought he was Eric Bledsoe, and he was"
"For a second I didnt see the end quote on the SVG quote and thought he legit said "" Doesn’t help having Eric Bledsoe showing up being dogshit""    I like SVG too much so im just gonna believe he did say that at one point"
Don’t forget when Terry Rozier clowned Eric Bledsoe by calling him Drew Bledsoe. Pretty all time as well.
The lack of Eric Bledsoe
Trade him for Eric Bledsoe.
"Kyle ""Eric Bledsoe"" Kuzma"
What can you get for tucker? A 2nd round pick? Eric Bledsoe?
"This is vey hindsighty and I don't mean it as disrespect towards a man who has been top 10 at basketball in the world since I was in diapers but, man, that LeClassic performance was never coming, was it?  Booker had two rough games but he surpassed my expectations with his overall poise. Needs the pull up 3 to become a consistent weapon and he WILL be a top 10 guy in the league. Not there yet but busting it out to destroy the defending champs in an elimination game is cold.  Honestly, like in game 5, I have less analysis to make. Booker set the tone and the other guys played from okay to great, and it was enough.  Denver will be VERY challenging, although I'd slightly favor us just due to guard play. Excited for that series although I'll miss game 1 due to exam period :/   The Lakers got a ring out of the Klutch squad assembling so it's instantly worth it (I don't care in this aspect that they're supposed to be NBA royalty, they had a core that was going to be a perma 7-seed before going in on the LeBron experience) but it will be interesting to see who departs and who joins. Eric Bledsoe is a Klutch client..."
Who is worse Kyle Kuzma or Eric Bledsoe?
Do they want Eric Bledsoe 🤣
At least Eric Bledsoe always crossed half court.
Now that he's not a Buck I can admit: Eric Bledsoe getting the same shoulder tattoo as LeBron is the cringiest shit ever. Still love you aqua dagger.
Translation: He's in the same salon Eric Bledsoe was in before the Bucks traded for him.
"Eric Bledsoe is an amazing defender, we’ll give him to you"
What about former all nba defensive team guard Eric Bledsoe?
Wes Matthews playing like Eric Bledsoe
schroder is eric bledsoe without the defense
"Turning Eric ""net negative in the playoffs"" Bledsoe into Jrue ""really good in the playoffs"" Holiday was a huge upgrade."
"Can we interest you in an Eric Bledsoe mayhaps, maybe throw in a lightly used Steven Adam’s as well just to sweeten the pot"
Shooters so that Zion can more freely drive and that Ingram actually has space to iso. People were calling him inefficient but that’s a huge part of it  Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe are dogshit fits and are also on trash contracts
Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe was the problem
Same. I’m not super into the idea of trying to open cap space generally. Lowry is pretty good but that’s a lot of cap gymnastics and life is hard for 6’ 35 yo guards  But I especially do not want to see Eric Bledsoe on the cap sheet until 2027
Dennis is basically a prototype of eric bledsoe. A defensive guard that can drive but is a poor playmaker and shooter. Take that for what you will but paying him 100 mill is def out of the question
"He's definitely improved but he's always been a pretty good passer tbf, just doesn't mean shit when you have Eric Bledsoe shooting 25% from three"
nephews will tell you that's Eric Bledsoe
I don't even hate Eric Bledsoe. I was just disappointed in him. Gordon though? Fuck him.
"Mike james isiah cannon tyson chandler trevor ariza josh jackson elfrid payton eric bledsoe brandon knight dragen bender marqueese chris   If you think those guys are comparable to Porzingas, Seth Curry, Tim Hardway Jr then idk what to tell you.  When booker got a real team around him they became instantly better and probably make the playoffs is ayton doesnt get suspended"
Hey at least we got in return *checks notes* Eric Bledsoe and a bunch of picks that are basically second rounders
"Eric Bledsoe reminds me of the band teacher talking about Mulhouse   **”NOBODY LIKES MILHOUSE!”**  As a Pels fan not to compare Eric Bledsoe to Milhouse, who has redeeming qualities"
They said Jrue Holiday beat the Eric Bledsoe allegations😂😂
"Your franchise is trash and you’re going to lose Zion just like you lost AD and Zion is going to win a championship as soon as he leaves the garbage Pelicans just like how AD and soon to be Jrue Holiday did before him. Lonzo Ball is gone next year and no one is going to take trash Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe off your books, enjoy being a fan of a trash franchise and stupid as hell you said 25% and then said “oh he improved to 36%” aka you don’t even watch the games of the team you support cause that’s the only reason you would be incorrect about how JJ Redick has been playing all year LMAO."
Both Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams will have each earned over $160 million in career salary after their current contracts are over. Good lord.
"Eric Bledsoe was quite good or descent in circa 2010 in his Clippers/Suns tenure. But after that, I have no more idea about him."
"Eric Bledsoe was himself often mockingly referred to as Drew Bledsoe, especially by Boston fans because of his poor performances against Rozier."
Be happy with Eric Bledsoe LOL
Hes honestly top 2 in the regular season. The guy had a team with eric bledsoe as the 3rd best player to the best record in the league in back to back years.  Maybe he has issues in the playoffs but his roster hasnt been that good before this year. So yes he is top 10.
polite way of saying “fuck Eric Bledsoe”
When I first saw that I thought it was some kind of idiotic galaxy brain allusion to Drew Bledsoe and was hella confused. Only after thinking for ten seconds did it dawn on me that they are trying to insult him by comparing him to Eric Bledsoe. Do with that info what you will but I had to get it out.
"The Bucks proved that you need an actual PG to run the offense and not Eric Bledsoe.  That’s the main difference between this year and past failures.  It’s not an it factor, simply some styles of play are just more successful in the regular season than the playoffs when teams can more heavily gameplan to exploit player weaknesses.  Westbrook, Simmons, Derozan are easy examples"
"It's actually 2 picks and 2 swaps, I think. Which makes it all the more better.  I have a feeling we might have went for it if Kemba didn't have that regenerative knee surgery or something at the start of the season, and we might not even need to give Smart away.  A lineup of Smart-Holiday-Brown-Tatum-Williams III would have been a defensive nightmare for other teams.  Edit: [Source](https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee)"
And Eric Bledsoe
Jrue Bledsoe and Eric Holiday?
Where's that flow chart that shows Khris Middleton going from Kyle Kuzma to Michael Jordan? We need one for Jrue where he goes from Eric Bledsoe to Gary Payton
Eric Bledsoe was 1stTeam All-Defensive as a Buck…
Eric Bledsoe must be sittin' at home feeling so bad. Poor guy.
"I mean shit if this is what happens every time someone makes a Bledsoe comparison then goddamn it, Jrue is literally Eric."
Eric Bledsoe ain't doing what Jrue did today
Yeah no disrespect but that’s not an Eric Bledsoe play lol
Jrue went from being Eric Bledsoe to Point God
Eric Bledsoe could never
ERIC BLEDSOE COULD NEVER
No way Eric Bledsoe doing that shit. WHEW
"JRUE ""I AIN'T ERIC BLEDSOE"" HOLIDAY"
Eric Bledsoe seething rn
"he has always been better than eric bledsoe, haters btfo"
"Jrue ""not Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday mvp of the game"
"As a Pels fan, I want some of you smartasses to compare Eric Bledsoe and Jrue Holiday now. Jrue is a fucking star"
Eric bledsoe could never
Took Jrue long enough to have a good game. Man looked like Eric Bledsoe for the first 4 games
Eric Bledsoe was what was holding the Bucks back the last 2 years.
JRUE IM NOT ERIC BLEDSOE HOLIDAY
Walmart Eric Bledsoe 😤
Eric Bledsoe playing pretty good
Head Coach: Mike Budenholzer  PG: Eric Bledsoe  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Julius Randle  C: Rudy Gobert
"&gt;It’s Giannis’s fault that he’s useless outside of 3 feet...  Yes. Literally everyone knows this. That's his game. But that doesn't mean that his teammates aren't at fault either.  &gt;The trap works because Dame has no one to pass to...  In the same way that the wall works because guys can't make their shots. You're almost getting it!   &gt;You’re fucking hilarious. Making excuses for Giannis when he literally got outperformed by Lopez versus Miami...  Was more so talking about Lopez against Toronto, genius. It's not excuses. Statistically, his teammates were bad against the Raptors and Heat.   &gt;All of those guys performing better would not make Giannis magically become useful outside of 3 feet from the rim...  Are you dense? Having adequate spacing and respectable shooters means he can play his game to the best level. We get it, he sucks outside of the paint. Stop saying this like it's some ""gotcha!"" moment.   I feel like you're acting dense on purpose. If a guy who needs spacing has proper spacing, then he'll do better. Not a hard concept to grasp.  &gt;He hasn’t. But they’ve been sure of a hell a lot better than Dame’s.  Yeah, Khris Middleton's 13 PPG on 50% TS agains the Raptors and Eric Bledsoe have been so much better."
"&gt;Right, because it's Giannis' fault this his teammates don't know how to knock down wide open shots. Do you hear yourself?  It’s Giannis’s fault that he’s useless outside of 3 feet...  &gt;And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks.  The trap works because Dame has no one to pass to...  &gt;Yeah because guys like Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews, Nikola Mirotić, and Brook Lopez forgetting how to shoot a basketball would be much better what he has now.  You’re fucking hilarious. Making excuses for Giannis when he literally got outperformed by Lopez versus Miami...  All of those guys performing better would not make Giannis magically become useful outside of 3 feet from the rim...   &gt;It's actually hilarious how you're acting like Giannis has just been put in the best situations to succeed.  He hasn’t. But they’ve been sure of a hell a lot better than Dame’s. And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks."
"&gt;And that was caused by a personnel issue, not Lillard himself.  Right, because it's Giannis' fault this his teammates don't know how to knock down wide open shots. Do you hear yourself?  And no, it's because Dame doesn't know how to beat a trap and just throws up bricks.   &gt;Give him Giannis’s team and he would have outperformed him by far.  Yeah because guys like Eric Bledsoe, Wesley Matthews, Nikola Mirotić, and Brook Lopez forgetting how to shoot a basketball would be much better what he has now.   It's actually hilarious how you're acting like Giannis has just been put in the best situations to succeed."

"Eric Bledsoe, CJ McCollum, Aaron Gordon, Marvin Bagley, Andre Drummond"
Would you rather have Eric Bledsoe under contract or get a $19m check in youre mailbox?
Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams lmaoooooo  We could only trade with them if the blazers were gonna tank and valued picks and prospects over getting a star back.
We didn't trade for Eric Bledsoe we traded for the picks and to match Jrue contract and to send him to a contender for his loyalty and professionalism to the org.
Eric Bledsoe lol
"Lol this is like me telling Eric bledsoe to just be more like curry or CP3... Ayton is a team first, smart defender Wiseman hasn’t demonstrated anything resembling Ayton"
"But based on your username, you and I can both agree that Eric Bledsoe is a bitch, right?"
"John Collins- Hawks, they’ll likely match whatever, and it’s better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he’s in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that’s even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I’ll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
homie thinks he can pull an Eric Bledsoe and get away with it.
"If Eric Bledsoe is getting 16 mil a year, Dennis deserves at least that"
Yes because we traded for Eric Bledsoe and nothing else. That trade was centered around acquiring Eric Bledsoe.
"eric bledsoe is the basketball equivalent of eyore, he’s has no confidence and doesn’t give a fuck"
Jrue Holiday is Patrick Beverley and Eric Bledsoe combined together in a unethical lab experiment.
Holiday's defense was great. That is why Booker's shots were so insanely impressive. Do not discount Booker by trying to make Holiday out to be Eric Bledsoe fam.
jrue heard y'all stopped calling him eric bledsoe so he had to let y'all know
Eric Bledsoe &gt; Jrue Bledsoe
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday"
Eric Bledsoe in disguise
"Jrue doing his best Bledsoe impersonation today, almost as if Eric never left"
"Holiday fucking sucks lmao. He tricked yall, he's been Eric Bledsoe the whole time"
Milwaukee traded all those picks and Eric Bledsoe for…Eric Bledsoe. Feel bad for Giannis.
Eric Bledsoe is in the building confirmed
"Anfernee Simons will turn into Anfernee Penny Hardaway, he will grow 4 inches and also become good at defense, Dame will turn into Tacko Fall and Nurk will be 5'11. Portland goes undefeated and Eric Bledsoe will drop 55 on the bucks in the finals to win in 4.    Those are my BOLD predictions."
"Maybe the Heat's zone, with much better defenders, not Jokic and Dirk. And Giannis doesn't need to be the main ball-handler. CP3 is no Eric Bledsoe."
And an Eric Bledsoe to brick the open 3 created by 3 guys putting a wall up.
I dont want Eric Bledsoe to be here
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"No, you just gave Steven Adams 17 million instead and traded for Eric Bledsoe who’s on a similar contract until 2023."
Lol imagine surrounding Zion with a starting backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Patrick Beverley.
"Muscular shooters with nice forms - Harden, Eric Gordon, Ben Gordon   Bledsoe was actually near 39% off catch and shots in Milwaukee during the regular season . His form is kinda ugly tho"
"Goran Dragic, Isaiah Thomas, Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe.
People were calling Jrue fucking Eric Bledsoe bro   The vast majority of Buck fans/watchers were not blaming the refs for his piss poor performances
"Jrue ""not Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday showing why he's worth Bledsoe and 3 picks."
"Call Jrue, "" Eric Bledsoe"" one more f****** time. I f****** triple dog dare you."
"Eric bledsoe,George Hill 3 unprotected Firsts and 2 first round swaps for Eric Bledsoe with good PR"
Jrue is just eric bledsoe with good pr
"Bucks can't even get better because they paid out their ass for Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday..."
Jrue “Eric Bledsoe” Holiday
Jrue is a glorified Eric Bledsoe
Go get Jrue Holiday instead of Eric Bledsoe
Zion played with Steven adams and Eric Bledsoe
Random off topic thought: I remember how people used to say in early 2010s how the young Eric Bledsoe will eventually start for the Clippers and send CP3 to the bench. Look where we are now.
"Call me crazy but I'm taking Zion over anyone before Anthony Davis on this list. He's an inside scorer on 29/8/4 per36, 65 TS% - if he's on a winning team we're not shutting up about him. Then you remember that he's doing that while the spacing around him is so busted it's like they built the team to challenge him. He scores at will in the paint while the two best shooters on his team are barely breaking league average from the arc, Eric Bledsoe is his point guard, and offensively Steven Adams can only do nothing or bring a big closer to the rim."
Bigger threat of Giannis getting gassed than the Suns  atleast CP3 and Book have each other and Payne Mikal and Ayton  Giannis has tall Eric Bledsoe and Dion Waiters on his team
"From the Pels perspective, this is trading down so you can unload the Eric Bledsoe contract for a far worse contract. Kemba gets paid twice as much and the second year is a player option instead of Bledsoe's team option."
It’s his fault he’s playing like Eric Bledsoe
Dennis Schroeder was lookin like Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs lol
"This guy could have had Steph, Klay, and Dray instead he  got Eric Bledsoe 2.0 and Harrison Barnes."
Those are some playoff Eric Bledsoe shooting splits
"Eric Bledsoe is so bad that despite these numbers, Jrue has been SO much better."
"The counting stats are very important here as well. Jrue has been disappointing, but he keeps the offense moving and keeps attacking.  **Eric Bledsoe averaged 13.1 pts, 3.9 rebounds, 4.6assists**  |Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |2017-18|28|MIL|NBA|PG|7|7|32.1|5.3|12.0|.440|1.0|3.1|.318|4.3|8.9|.484|.482|2.0|2.9|.700|0.4|3.1|3.6|3.7|1.0|0.9|2.1|2.7|13.6| |2018-19|29|MIL|NBA|PG|15|15|28.2|5.1|12.3|.411|1.1|4.8|.236|3.9|7.5|.522|.457|2.4|3.4|.706|1.3|2.4|3.7|4.3|1.1|0.4|2.2|1.9|13.7| |2019-20|30|MIL|NBA|PG|9|9|29.7|4.2|10.9|.388|0.9|3.6|.250|3.3|7.3|.455|.429|2.3|2.9|.808|0.6|4.0|4.6|5.9|1.2|0.7|2.6|2.2|11.7| |3 seasons||MIL|NBA||31|31|29.5|4.9|11.8|.411|1.0|4.1|.254|3.8|7.8|.494|.455|2.3|3.1|.732|0.9|3.0|3.9|4.6|1.1|0.6|2.3|2.2|13.1|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bledser01.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#playoffs_per_game) Generated 7/8/2021.  **Jrue Holiday is averaging 17.2 pts, 5.7 rebounds, 8.4 assists**  |Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |2020-21|30|MIL|NBA|PG|18|18|38.9|6.8|16.4|.417|1.8|6.2|.288|5.1|10.2|.495|.471|1.7|2.6|.674|1.4|4.3|5.7|8.4|1.4|0.3|2.6|2.1|17.2| |1 season||MIL|NBA||18|18|38.9|6.8|16.4|.417|1.8|6.2|.288|5.1|10.2|.495|.471|1.7|2.6|.674|1.4|4.3|5.7|8.4|1.4|0.3|2.6|2.1|17.2|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/holidjr01.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#playoffs_per_game) Generated 7/8/2021.

"I went to a Suns/Pels game in Phoenix when I was dating a girl who lived down there about 6-7 years ago. I was very excited to see Anthony Davis. I left with the impression that if I knew nothing about these players other than that one game, I would firmly believe that Eric Bledsoe was the best player on the court. He impressed me so much"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"this is to be expected, idiots, when you can’t keep a star like *Eric Bledsoe*"
"Lol no you guys won’t. I think you actually got worse this summer. Kawhi isn’t going to have longevity like Lebron, he’s already had too many issues. Eric Bledsoe about to build a brick house in LA"
"I guess he adds more offense from that position. Rondo and Pat Beverly are great intangible players, but you can't expect decent stats from them. Eric Bledsoe is guaranteed to get you at least 11-12 points a game with 3 rebounds."
Pels offloaded Eric Bledsoe. Neither NOLA or Sacramento are FA destinations unless you overpay. But sure
Delusional. He was traded for Eric Bledsoe for a reason.
"Surprised nobody has said clippers yet... Kawhi, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, Nic Batum even."
Trying to put non-summer league level players here:  Eric Bledsoe  Cole Anthony  Kevin Knox  Ben Simmons  Marvin Bagley  Andre Drummond  They might accidentally win more than one game. Mostly guys who are good players but really do not mind losing as long as they get theirs. They'll probably beat a really good team like the Bucks for that one win. LOL
"Congrats you traded the 10th overall pick, a future first, Eric Bledsoe (who we turned into Culver and huancho), the 40th overall which we turned into a late first, and Steven Adams for the 17th pick, the 50th pick, and a chance to sign an MLE center that might propel you to the 10th seed. I am so envious"
It’s kind of poignant that the Bucks replaced Eric Bledsoe with a guy who’s first name is a different spelling of Drew. I guess Terry knew what the Bucks needed to get to the next level.
"I think any random top 25 team is off.  And maybe not even the best teams some years could pull it off.  But I do believe some of the best college teams in history can definitely pull off some wins given 82 tries.  2018 Villanova I think has a shot.  They had Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divencenzo, Omari Spellman and Eric Pashcall who all made the NBA.  Phil Booth was in the G-League and Colin Gillespie was an all-American who will probably make the G-League or a European League after he 'graduates' next year.  Jermain Samuels might also go pro after he graduates next year as well.  That roster has 5 NBA players and 8 pros.  They were really good.  &amp;#x200B;  The 2010 Kentucky team was also really stacked.  They didn't win the title, but had John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, Daniel Orton, Patrick Patterson, Deandre Liggins and Darius Miller.  7 NBA players.  There are also a couple UNC and Duke rosters as well as Michigan's Fab Five.  Some of these teams I think can do much better than 1 win too.  Wouldn't be surpised if that Kentucky team could get at least 5."
Eric Bledsoe - missing layups
&gt; ~~Eric~~ Bledsoe in shambles   Drew
"duncan robinson, eric bledsoe, nerlens noel, marcus morris, and kevin huerter"
Was he really? I feel like he's been Goated in Boston ever since he wore that Drew Bledsoe jersey to the presser in the Bucks series to troll Eric Bledsoe who he was torching over and over.
And Eric Bledsoe played PG for the Pelicans last year.
The legend who mindfucked Eric Bledsoe.
Eric Bledsoe in shambles
"Who cares, the clippers point guard is Eric Bledsoe."
Eric Bledsoe was the PG last year and was probably the worst starting point guard in the league. Dumping him for nothing would be an upgrade at point guard.
"Lonzo isn't perfect by any means, but he's better than any guard he was replaced with. The only major upgrade is that SVG isn't coaching anymore, and I'd absolutely consider that addition by subtraction. In all fairness, the pels probably would have been way better last year with a coach that Eric Bledsoe didn't have some type of dirt on lol"
"For being elite at defense in the NBA, I completely agree 100%. If effort was the biggest determinant for someone's ability as a defender, Thanasis and Pat Connaughton would be elite defenders, and as much as I love them both, that's not the case for either.   On the flipside, though, if someone isn't at least a tolerable defender, it's an effort problem more often than not. IQ, size, discipline, athleticism, etc. still totally play a part in getting you there, but for the average NBA-level player, putting in effort on that side is generally going to be enough to at least make you not a total liability on that side. You can see how much of a difference it made with Eric Bledsoe this past season, for instance. He went from 2nd all-defense to a net negative on defense over the span of a single offseason because he just...really didn't care, for lack of a better way to put it."
Eric Bledsoe if he actually deserved those All-Defense votes
I was talking about Eric Bledsoe so Bron is fine
"A name people often bring up is Dwight Howard. Despite all his accolade his game remained limited, and he failed to reach the potential many people expected. Others argue his achievements throughout his career prove he in fact reached that potential.  Others I had in mind: Jeff Green, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Jennings, Michael Beasley, Rondo, Derrick Williams, and I always though Eric Bledsoe would be better"
He was just salary dumped for Eric Bledsoe.
"did grizzlies legend eric bledsoe tweet anything, he had a few weeks"
"league has evolved, now sometimes it's steve kerr's warriors vs. eric bledsoe and the pelicans"
"I watch more basketball games than most on this sub because I have nothing better to do.   Eric Bledsoe is walking into the best situation he’s ever been in his career. He’s an extremely gifted slasher who gets to play on what was statistically the greatest 3-point shooting team of all-time. There is going to be so much space for him to operate, and he can still blow by his man at ease. Look at what Reggie Jackson has done since he got to the Clips, Ty Lue is really good at getting the most out of score first guards."
"Culver, Juancho, and Rondo all for the rotting corpse of Eric Bledsoe"
"Yes because *Eric Bledsoe* was the best guard for Zion, that clearly shows that *Daryl Morey* is handling the Simmons situation perfectly, brilliant stuff r/nba"
"His ceiling is the opposite of high. He is extremely limited. He can’t create his own shot or for others, can’t play through or draw contact,  can’t score in really any way other than spot up shooting, and he’s not in any way close to elite at it. When transition is taken away the limitations become amplified, and that’s why he was one of the worst 4th quarter performers this season on the Pels, right next to Eric Bledsoe."
Eric Bledsoe the OG
So the Clips effectively traded Lou Will + Pat Bev + 2 2nds for Eric Bledsoe...  Can't wait to see what their new marketing campaigns. No way they're going for that grit and grind bs again.
A bad trade too. Imagine giving up pat bev as part of a 3 piece meal for fucking Eric Bledsoe...
"Honestly it's the Clippers solely in terms of players on the court. I know both of them get some sort of cap benefits but I'm not privvy to that at the moment.   Back when Bledsoe was on the Pelicans I was hardcore advocating for a Bledsoe-PatBev swap.   The Clippers have plenty of shooting already but what they need is playmaking. Bledsoe is a flawed, overpaid player but two things he can do pretty well are give you guard defense and playmaking (he averaged 6 assists a game during his final playoff run with Milwaukee).   With the re-emergence of Reggie Jackson, PatBev was redundant on the Clippers especially considering how injury prone he is. In the interim, a hopefully-healthy Ibaka can compensate for Eric Bledsoe's lack of shooting and when Kawhi is healthy they can go 5-out without Bledsoe anyways.  As for Memphis, I imagine they'll be able to flip both PatBev and Rondo without any issues."
"What i can think of right now...(this is just my opinion)  Overrated: Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe (I don't know why Clippers traded for him), Doc Rivers (I know it's about players but still...),  Underrated: CJ McCollum, TJ McConnell, Nikola Vucevic"
"I dunno if Eric Bledsoe is going to offer much in return, but I really dont feel like they lost much in bev"
Imagine Eric Bledsoe being more valuable than Rondo.
"The clippers,Eric Bledsoe in a 5 out system works best for him to drive to the paint"
Eric Bledsoe is the biggest winner of this trade change my mind
"I miss Eric Bledsoe on the Bucks...He was the best player for the HEAT in their bubble series, despite not playing for them. 9 games played in that years playoffs, 11 ppg on 39% shooting and 25% from 3. Def won us some games with that efficiency. Replacing Bledsoe with Jrue Holiday may go down as the 3rd best move in Bucks history, after drafting that Lou Alcindor guy (and keeping him away from the Harlem Globetrotters million dollar offer in 1969 money!! Thats 7.5 Million today) and drafting Giannis."
"""Is Eric Bledsoe the missing piece for the Clippers? Later on Undisputed."""
Eric Bledsoe
All that for Eric bledsoe
No it’s not. Someone posted the Cp3 trade to Clips  video with Blake and Deandre reacting while their former teammate Eric Bledsoe was traded   Now he’s traded back
Is this as terrible of a trade as it looks like on its face? *Three players* for Eric Bledsoe? He’s barely even a starting caliber player...
"If a trade benefits neither team, then it's probably teams playing ball with an agency. They're the real power brokers in the NBA.  Eric Bledsoe might not be looked upon highly right now, but he's represented by Rich Paul &amp; Klutch."
Never sign Eric Bledsoe to a 15 million per year contract
"&gt; CP3, Blake, Kawhi, PG, DJ, Elton Brand, Maggette, Kaman, Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Norm Nixon, Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman, Lamar Odom, Lou Will. Shit… you might be right.  That's 16, add Jamal Crawford, Eric Piatkowski, Montrezl Harrell, JJ Reddick and that's 20. He might have a case for top 20-25 with Miles, Richardson, Bledsoe, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, etc. But then again, Reggie Jackson, Batum, Mann, and Zubac might make top 20 now."
"Grizzlies legend eric bledsoe, never played a single game for them"
"\[Wojnarowski\] The Los Angeles Clippers are trading Patrick Beverley, the next 3 years, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu to the Memphis Grizzlies for guard Eric Bledsoe, sources tell ESPN."
Dammit! I fell asleep last night literally with an unsent comment to this asking “what about Eric Bledsoe” ugh would have aged like wine
DUDE last night I couldn’t sleep at 4am came across your comment and wanted to answer “what about Eric Bledsoe” to the guy who fired off names. When I saw this trade I was like no way time to edit that my comment aged like WINE!!.....I fell asleep with the comment unsent...
Eric Bledsoe hahaha. Jesus Clips
"I’m not sure who Eric Bledsoe is but I’ve definitely heard of 2 people going back for him, is Bledsoe that good?"
"you're right Eric Bledsoe is better.   better defense = Pat Bev \[but not by much, Bledsoe is also an all nba defender\]   better offense = Bledsoe \[volume shooter but Bledsoe has more offensive game\]   better passer = Bledsoe \[Bledsoe is a true PG he can pass, while Pat is a combo guard\]"
That seems like a lot for Eric Bledsoe
and the Clipper saved atleast $6 Million this season. But I don't know why they want Eric Bledsoe for their team
Eric Bledsoe key contributor
"&gt;Clips trade Patrick Beverly, a g-league player and someone who didn't even help in the post-season for Eric Bledsoe  who do you think bledsoe is"
Yeah I don't think this sub can get over their Pat Bev hateboner to notice that he had Devin Booker shooting under 40% every game the only player Eric Bledsoe held under 40% fg was Giannis.
"In what world, nay, in what **universe** Eric Bledsoe worth three players? Even  if it's salary matching, this has to be the dumbest fucking trade in existence because it doesn't really benefit either team. I mean, P. Bev is kind of cunt when it comes to losing and he's...not really going to improve that Memphis team, nor or any of the rest of those guys. And...Bledsoe couldn't hit the broadside of a barn during the Pels season this year or even show out on defense. So, I don't really see much point or purpose for the Clippers in trading for the guy if they're aiming for the chip. Seriously, Bledsoe had every opportunity to show everyone that he was absolutely worth keeping on Milwaukee and that they'd made a mistake trading him for Jrue...but...yeah. Things aren't going to go well for the Clips this year if they start Bledsoe."
**Why in the actual WORLD WOULD THE CLIPPERS DO THIS TRADE??????????????** Rondo AND PAT BEV FOR FCKING ERIC BLEDSOE???????????????????? Ayo this must be some sort of behind the scenes scam lmaoooooo I dont believe this
"Landing Eric Bledsoe? Not sure how long it has been since you've seen him play. Role player at best. Not a difference maker. Pelican fans are ecstatic him and his contract are gone.  Edit: when it comes to filling a role, even though I'm not a fan of Pat Bev, I'd take him on my team over Bledsoe every day of the week."
"Tank commander Eric Bledsoe saves the Clippers some money this year. I think it's a move signaling they do not want to contend while Kawhi is out, unless they can follow this up with something else."
Did Eric Bledsoe just purposely do bad in New Orleans? Why would LA do this
"Lmao yea of course bud. Eric Bledsoe was one of the worst players in basketball. Do you realize how fuckin stupid that is to say out loud?   There rookies who can’t keep up. Half the Thunder arent NBA pros. The Wolves won twenty games. But the worst player in basketball was veteran Eric Bledsoe.    You guys gotta relax, expectations don’t dictate how good players are"
Eric Bledsoe was absolutely terrible last year
Quick question?  Do the Clippers know that Patrick Beverley is better than Eric Bledsoe?
This has to be a joke eric bledsoe is bordline unplayable
Eric Bledsoe is a poor mans Lebron
"&gt; I didn’t see anything from This bucks team that makes me confidently say they could beat the 2019 Raptors.  That's fair - my argument really is that I think this Bucks team is better than the 2019 team (Eric Bledsoe -&gt; Jrue Holiday alone is a significant upgrade, and we unfortunately didn't get to see the improved Donte due to injury) and there's an argument that the series hinged on an extremely close Game 3, Bucks go 3-0 up and those later 6 point losses might be different.  &gt; Also another point, they’re a lot better because they had time to grow and their players improved. If the 2019 raptors had that same chance with Kawhi this wouldn’t even be a discussion.  Also fair - but it's against the framing of the question.

"that warriors take is hot garbage, they were trying to make a trade for another star but it takes two teams to tango. Not going all in on a Ben Simmons trade was the right idea. Otto Porter and Andre Igoudala were nice signings to help fill out the roster. They had one of the best drafts of any team this year and still have wiseman developing  in the wings. Don't know why they let Eric Paschall go but other they had a good off season   BI has  averaged 23.8/5.5/4.5, on 50/38/86 shooting splits  since coming to New Orleans and was an all star in 2020.He has clearly shown he can be the second best player on a contending team. The pelicans defintley should of gotten more in the bulls trade for lonzo but I like Tomas Satoransky, his height will allow us to play 3 guard lineups  like we did with lonzo. Getting rid of Bledsoe and Adams should be a huge boon for this team offensively and i expect BI and Zion will reap the benefits of the extra space that will be provided.  Jazz were the number one seed and got injured at the wrong time. I liked the Eric Paschall trade and the Rudy gay signing. They also have some interesting pieces they could package to improve there roster should someone they like become available at the deadline."
"1. The MVP race will be wide open with no clear consensus. Names thrown around will be Luka, Booker, Trae, Butler, Embiid, Tatum. Mid to late season LeBron, Giannis and Steph will come out of nowhere as emerging front runners leading to another MVP for Giannis.  2. WCF will be Nuggets Lakers  3. ECF will be Heat Nets  4. Nets will beat the Nuggets in the finals  5. Suggs ROTY  6. Thunder pick up more albatross contracts for picks, someone like Eric Bledsoe  7. Ant Edwards rap career takes off"
"I'd argue he ""regressed defensively"" due to how easy it was to score on the Pelicans as a whole.   BI, Zion, Steven Adams, and Eric Bledsoe were literally training cones on defense and no matter what Zo did alone, his numbers were slated to drop. He's not Jrue Holiday levels because he doesn't have the strength to match up with the top scorers but his team defense overall is top tier in my opinion. Dude is almost always there defending the right play or at least in the vicinity of where he should be. Once he muscles up and gets a bit more physical I can see him going back to being top 3 in advanced defensive stats"
"Yea and back then the Bucks had Eric Bledsoe as their starting point lmao if you go back and look at that series you’ll find that Giannis played fine, his team was just ass  Look at what happened this year when the Bucks were actually good"
"As opposed to Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe, which was the worst backcourt in the West..."
Where did I say that? You said they win if he isn't there and then go on to say he was the 3rd best scoring option. Which means scorer number 1 and 2 also dropped the ball. meaning they don't win even if he's not there. Your comment makes it seem as though him not being there would have meant they won but they lost for reasons that aren't Eric bledsoe.
"&gt;*honestly, the Pelicans feel like they're behind even us in roster development.*  Maybe a little bit.  Last season Coach Stan Van Gundy refused to play our younger players. He gave out a LOT of DNPs lol.  Eric Bledsoe was our most played player last season despite the fact that he hasn't acted---nor put the effort in, of an All-Defense caliber guard for majority of the season. He was terrible on both sides of the ball while our younger guys were actually pretty responsible/hard-working.  He really only wanted to play vets, and it drove the fanbase (and FO) crazy.  Because we do have young promising guys on the team that our FO *really likes*, but that didn't get to see the floor and work through their mistakes and grow from them. Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, didn't get a lot of playtime but especially our youngest rookie Kira Lewis Jr. lol. He only gave them minutes when he was forced to because of injuries."
"Pels won 31 games last year with a bad coach, bad spacing &amp; Eric Bledsoe. They’ve improved in all 3 areas."
"It's going to be the Pelicans.   Better coaching, more space, growth from their young guys, less Eric Bledsoe, less Steven Adams, more Valanciunas. They lost so many close games last year."
"1. Probably, unless Wiseman and a few of their other guys level up sudenly they probably be at most make the second round. 2. With Westbrook in i definetly think AD’s touches go down a little so it’s pretty likely. 3. I think people don’t think Eric Bledsoe isn’t like a rotation piece or anything. I just think if he is your starting PG you are probably a first round out. 4. That’s just sad. 5. Didn’t know his number isn’t retired. Wonder why. 6. Doesn’t that mean he isn’t skilled? There are plenty of players who are his height or even shorter who are top 7 guards. And even if you make him taller I can never see him being a top guard, maybe a 7,8 man on a team at most. 7. It depends because if he is on a team with another ball handler and scorer probably. But if he is like on the Sixers he will probably still be the same."
"Warriors won’t win a championship again with their  core 3  Zion will have a better season than AD in 2021-2022  Eric Bledsoe isn’t hot dog ass like everyone in this sub thinks, but he’s definitely still a lower tier PG  Although I feel bad for Kings fans, I want the Kings to be bad every year just so the league has a punching bag  Lakers should retire George Mikan’s number   If Raul Neto was 3 inches taller he’d be a top 7 guard   Take Jamal Murray off Denver and his production and stats would take a big hit"
Injuries are very different than Bud having an awful gameplan and Eric Bledsoe
"Bad luck and injuries were factors for our failure to make the play-in. When we had an easy schedule, Zion, BI, NAW, Hart and Adams got injured. Lonzo also got injured later on, and Bledsoe, unfortunately, was our only starter. Late game implosions — ranging from blown defensive tasks, to clutch time ISOs, to Eric Bledsoe — were also an issue throughout the season."
Eric Bledsoe
"i love zach lowe, but (trying not to be a homer here) the pels coverage is a bit odd in this article.  he says we moved ""down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry"". that's not true, we traded from 10 to 17, thats 7 spots. but regardless, in that deal we also moved eric bledose, who he doesnt talk about at all in the pels section. talk to anybody who watched this team last year, he was a total weight around the neck of this team, so that trade did a TON of addition by subtraction, in my view. he then says that if we improve next year ""it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram"", which could be true, but not having bledsoe or adams will absolutely help.   he also says ""The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic."" remind me which two picks we burned? we sent a lakers pick to the grizz, but the other we traded one for graham in the s&amp;t, but that one is lottery protected, after which it turns into two seconds. so if we don't make the playoffs next year, we dont trade a first rounder at all. i get zach needs to be concise, but thats fairly large context.  im totally open to calling the pelicans ""losers"" when it comes to free agency. we wanted lowry, we didnt get him, that's an L. not trying to nit pick, but i just have some issues with the context provided here."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
The irony of the bucks fan with an Eric Bledsoe flair calling other plays trash playoff performers is great though.

Eric Bledsoe with the all time self awareness when he took that extension from the bucks
"The idea is that it'd be baked into the Memphis trade, so you'd still have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams counting as outgoing salary"

I watched him play live vs their first round opponent in the NCAA. Forget who. I've literally never seen a quicker human being in person. I thought Eric Bledsoe was quick (saw him in high school).. Mitchell is on another level.
Man coulda been stealing cheques like Eric Bledsoe but ended up going Nerlens Noel.

Eric Bledsoe
Yeah the deadly duo of Paul George and Eric Bledsoe is gonna go beast mode.
"He increased his fga from year 1 to yr 2 from 15 to 17 and gained 4.5 more ppg on only 2 more fga while simultaneously  increasing his fg eff by 2.7% and his ft eff by 5.8. He didn't start running the point until almost 1/3 of the season and even then Pels players still bricked shots at an alarmingly high rate.   Devonte Graham  hit 38% of his 3s last year which is good but taking into account that 71% of his 12.2 fga were 3s he is a huge add for Pels spacing. Trey  Murphy is one of two players in college to shoot 50/40/90. In summer league he 16.3/7/2.8 on 54/44/100 and was named all summer league. Jonas Valanciunas is a huge upgrade and underrated pick up at Center he avg 17.1 and 12.5 on 59% last season. [Here](https://twitter.com/cclark3000/status/1419809641492619264?s=19) is the comparison of his range of scoring vs Steven's last year. Anyone who watched the Pels can tell you 6'6 Nickiel Alexander Walker is a huge upgrade over 6'1 Eric ""I wasn't paying attention"" Bledsoe.  Not only is it completely fathomable that Zion can hit the numbers I'm predicting, but he could do it on under 21 fga."
"idk if it's as jurassic as ben, but you could say eric bledsoe or michael carter-williams"
"Continuing to say that doesn't make you any more knowledgeable about the NBA than the last time.  Beverley was traded not once but TWICE this offseason for essentially nothing. Eric Bledsoe in one trade (lol) and then Culver (massive bust) and Hernangomez (mediocre rotation player who asked out of MIN) in another. No, he doesn't not have anything besides immaterial trade value."
"Given the reports about Zion, he's clearly not at a maturity level to lead a team. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were busts as veteran leaders. James Johnson did a lot for the team TBH if you watched their young guys down the stretch. More than JJ did all season. Iwundu, who they got in the deal, was part of the grizz-pels-graham deal that got them Jonas and Graham."
"&gt;Last year on paper, we had Zion, Ingram, Ball, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe who were all though if to be ark east good. starter level players. Then we had Hart on the Bench, and during the second half of the year, NAW and Hayes stepped up to become good productive players. NAW really should’ve been starting post all star break last year.  That still isn't more talent than the Knicks b.  Randle, RJ, IQ, D.Rose, Burks, Mitch(tho injuried), etc.  &gt;This year we have Ingram, Valunciounas, Graham, NAW, Hayes, Hart, Murphy, who will all be good positive players for us. I could’ve included Naji too. We also have Kira, Satiransky, who could possibly be solid.  We got the same core plus added Kemba and Forunier, a resurged Mitch, a more confident Obi, and some good rookies who have the ability to show out.   &gt;If Zion is as good to where people can say that we’re wasting his talents, then he should be able to carry us to the playoffs. This is not like when we had barely rotation level players starting for us during some of those AD years.  That's not how things work, lmao. You need a valid front office as well. Good coaches. Good chemistry. Etc."
"We had Lonzo, Jrue, JJ when he was good, Hart, Favirs before the bubble was solid. Melli was ok that year too.  Last year on paper, we had Zion, Ingram, Ball, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe who were all though if to be ark east good. starter level players.

I’m still not sure if Zion is committed or not, but he hast done much to convince me he’s fully committed."

Guesses:  A: Someone  B: Kyle Lowry  C: Eric Bledsoe  D: Jrue Holiday
Oh this tired trope again. The Lakers put themselves in a position to offer two max slots to LeBron and someone else (presumably Paul George) while still retaining enough young talent to flip for a 3rd star (which ended up being Anthony Davis).   The Pelicans drafted Zion and ever since have been throwing away assets and cluttering their team with negative value contracts like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. And this is following years of doing the same crap when Anthony Davis was there (like not hiring a medical/training staff for the team and acquiring and extending guys like Omer Asik). They're a poorly run team and always have been. You guys have been gifted three generational level talents in the draft in the last 20 years and you've wasted *all* of them. My guess is Gayle Benson is a shit owner just like her husband was and the team would probably be better off if she sold it to someone who knew what they were doing.
"eric bledsoe getting paid 15 mil to ""not pay attention"" to his boss but hey atleast he's admitting his mistakes! lmao"
"I get so excited seeing three front page posts about my favorite team, and then they are all referring to how Griffin is nuking the team or how Eric Bledsoe forgot how to play basketball after leaving Milwaukee."
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
"""I don't want to be hair"" -Eric Bledsoe always"
"LOL. 50 NBA games. Now that the dead weight of Lonzo Ball and the tuned-out Eric Bledsoe are off that roster, the sky's the limit for the Pelicans.  What teams have a player better than Zion? A few, but not many.  What teams' second-best player is better than Ingram? A few, but not many.  Every other team with both a best player as good as Zion and a second-best player as good as Ingram is a title contender."
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
"There’s a narrative no matter what, would’ve been Lowry washed if that happened. Personally I think while the Zion and JV fit isn’t perfect, at least they’re both threats to score bc Adams was too passive 5 ft from the basket a lot of the time.   And honestly almost anyone would be better than the effort we got from Bledsoe last season. Saw someone on Twitter rank players by a combination of a bunch of advanced stats and Eric was like 330ish ... Yet he was a starter who prob played more mins overall last season than anyone else on the team. Graham’s at gonna give it his all from what I’ve seen, has his flaws but he’s a shooter and a dawg so I’m in"
Anything other than a resounding yes is not a good answer. We had Eric Bledsoe ruin two of our seasons and nobody said anything except I believe in Bled.
Marcus Morris and Eric Bledsoe plus picks
"We can’t say Griffin hasn’t tried to help Zion. He gave him Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Steven Adams, SVG as a coach.   I just don’t think it’s enough."
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
"To be clear, Eric Bledsoe was the point guard last year. Replacing Bledsoe with Graham is a massive upgrade given the fact that Bledsoe was the least valuable player on the team.  Lonzo is bad in the half court. Straight up. Was the 2nd worst 4th quarter performer on the team last year to Bledsoe. His production will easily be replaced given he doesn’t do much box score wise.  Swapping Bledsoe and Adams for Graham and Jonas is an improvement. Giving Lonzo’s minutes to NAW and some of the younger guys isn’t really a big deal. The team is in a better position going into this season than last season."
"True, those are Eric Bledsoe type numbers."
"2016 Steph Curry - 30/5/7/2/0 on .669 TS% and not even a top 50 defender.   Giannis 2020 must be better than Steph 2016 then? If only ranking seasons was as easy as laying out statlines and comparing numbers. Your entire concept is flawed.  2019 Giannis wasn't even deserving of the MVP, so let's talk about the 2020 version. An All-Star in Khris Middleton, 2 All-Defense teammates in Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe. Weaker Eastern Conference. Giannis got the DPOY too because of a superior record and his team being defense-oriented. The majority wanted AD to get the award instead.  2021 Jokic did not have his best teammate in Jamal Murray for the business end of the season, and even he wasn't an All-Star. Without Jamal and basically any other guards, Nuggets somehow started winning more games. Finished 3rd in a stacked West, leaving behind legit contenders like the Clippers and Lakers.  Apart from all of this, Jokic almost had a 50/40/90 season as a big, which is almost impossible and unheard of. He couldn't miss games because Nuggets would lose every game by double digits otherwise. This should be reason enough to consider his historic MVP season over Giannis'.   Jokic is a shooting big while Giannis is a paint presence, and yet Jokic had a better TS. 2018 Harden is debatable, but both of Giannis' years were not that impressive, atleast not more than Jokic's."
"Then we would've run with Eric Bledsoe, Paul George, LeBron James, Kevin Love and TT."
"Avoiding Star players here—-  Watch: TJ McConnell, Harrison Barnes, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart  Don’t Watch: Malik Monk, Aron Baynes, Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe
"&gt;g league rejects  Such as CP3 (a top-5 all time pg), Clint Capela (PER of 23.8 - a limited but still useful stat), PJ Tucker (who was literally a starter on the Bucks team that you claim was stacked in 2021) and Eric Gordon.   Bro clearly you're delusional. That's not all-time talent but it's certainly not a bad roster and it's not far off the bucks who had: Middleton, Bledsoe, Brogdon, and Lopez.  Harden didn't carry alone - CP3 was huge for that team"
&gt;Eric Bledsoe  The only wanting to play in LA and young socialite  was just made up by random journalist with no source and was disputed by Simmons camp like week later saying happy play for any team other than philly. https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/report\_ben\_simmons\_willing\_to\_play\_for\_any\_team\_other\_than\_76ers/s1\_127\_35757812
"If you want a good regular season player, Eric Bledsoe is a fuck cheaper and will equally disappoint you in playoffs."
"I'm not arguing they're value, I'm talking about the quality of player demanding the trade.  Simmons is easily a better player than peak Bledsoe.  And I promise you a 25 year old DPOY contending player is still more valuable than prime Eric Bledsoe even with that contract."
Eric Bledsoe got traded for Greg Monroe and a first. You’re crazy if you think he was better than Simmons when he was in Phoenix or if he has more trade value than Simmons rn.
"Ah yes, the real reason Eric Bledsoe was held back all this time was because he didn't have good teammates lol.  Completely ignoring that Simmons has been **All-NBA** before."
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
I can't imagine he was seen with Paul George *and* Eric Bledsoe in the same week and they're not nudging him in the direction of accepting a buyout and giving a majority of his salary back. Would he though? Not sure.
For Eric Bledsoe do the scene where Andy comes back from rehab and tells Pam to call him Drew now.
"Eric Bledsoe, left wide open, bricks a layup. ""Me?"" he says, casting a devilish little grin, ""Well, I'm the Black Drew Bledsoe."""
"Trade him for salary filler. Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, and Luke Kennard basically matches salaries while still clearly making the clippers a better team. Then ask for like, a mf second round pick."
"Ah, the Eric Bledsoe strategy."
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
They don’t need…. Eric Bledsoe….. and Ibaka being finished means they would want to trade him. Taking off 25 mil between those two contracts.
Tbf asking slashing specialist Eric Bledsoe to play next to Lonzo Ingram Zion and Adams was an awful idea in the first place. Clips run 5 out
"That's what it's all going to come down to, whether Wall is OK with sitting out the season or not. When the Pelicans wanted to force Anthony Davis to sit and he refused and threatened to file a grievance with the league, I remember people asking why the Pelicans couldn't just sit him the way that the Suns had with Eric Bledsoe, and the difference was that the Suns had Bledsoe's agreement while the Pelicans did not.   If Wall is cool with this, probably nothing happens. But if he's not, it could get ugly like the AD situation did. Personally I think this is all just posturing by the Rockets to try to force Wall to give a lot back if he wants a buyout so he can go play somewhere. But he has moves he can make if he isn't OK with just being told to sit out all year. Maybe he doesn't care if he plays though, or maybe there's nobody out there willing to give him anything more than a minimum to play. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out."
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"&gt; it’s almost become the norm to shell out multiple firsts for good players  That's true, but all the recent trades have been a tanking team selling a star or key role player without caring about the quality of the matching salary.  Returning salary (not matching, because LAC had some, but not enough, cap space) in PG trade was Gallinari. Matching salary in Jrue trade was Eric Bledsoe (terrible deal) and George Hill.  Philly is in a different position because they actually care about the quality of the players they receive as matching salary (at least in order to flip them for picks in a pipe-dream Dame / Beal trade)"
"LMFAO this was the radio play-by-play, and I remember because I was actually listening to this game on 97.5 omw home from work. I legit thought Eric Bledsoe must have killed Embiid or something because Tom McGinnis doesn’t usually overreact like THAT"
"Well yea. Defense is a team thing. Stats for it are unreliable. Its hard to judge individually, especially since the actual game impact of your defense might not be felt. Jrue Holiday is a better defender than Eric Bledsoe, always has been, but Bledsoe made all defense over him multiple times because he was on a great team and Jrue not so much."
"I have to say, Fox is amazingly fast. Like, how is that guy so much faster than peak world class athletes??! It’s not like he’s only out there making Boban look slow or something..he even makes guys like Danny Green or Eric Bledsoe look slow, and those guys are all-defensive team caliber."
I feel like a quick smaller player like Eric Bledsoe would do really well.
"Yeah I think he’d be a way better playmaking ,smarter Eric Bledsoe."
Eric bledsoe?
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"If the Pelicans only got rid of Eric Bledsoe they'd win this easily. They also made a much needed upgrade at center with Jonas Valanciunas over Steven Adams. Have 6 different young players who will show growth in Zion, BI, Jaxson Hayes, NAW, Kira, and Naji Marshall and drafted players who can play d and showed out in summer league Trey Murphy (all summer league) and Herb Jones. Also Murphy looks like a sniper which is much needed."
And Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
"The Pelicans got a great return for both AD and Jrue Holiday when they traded them, but it's just reality that they've already squandered a big portion of what they got, and it started almost immediately. The Lakers gave them the 4th pick in the 2019 draft, which they could have used on DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland, but instead they traded it for Jaxon Hayes and NAW. They've now let Lonzo go with an extremely questionable return, and they traded away another first round pick they got from the Lakers to unload Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. This was after wasting picks and other assets to get Steven Adams in the first place, of course. They're a poorly run team so it's no wonder their star players always want out."
"That analogy is completely way out there. AD wanted out of New Orleans because they were wasting his prime years. He gave them heads up of where he wanted to go and where he didn’t want to go. He wanted to play ball for the Pelicans but the Pelicans insisted on benching him so he didn’t get injured and tank his trade value. Pels trade AD to the Lakers, they get a great return. They now make dumb moves like trading away Jrue Holiday, acquiring Eric Bledsoe or sign Steven Adams for a long term contract, or fail to re-sign Lonzo. Now Zion isn’t pleased and we’re close to square one,"
"Because Ben Simmons is still 24 with one of the best natural frames and athletic skillsets in the entire league?  At his absolute worst he's the 40th best player in the league. During the regular season Ben is top 20, and that is something Minnesota desperately needs just like Milwaukee needed MCW back during his rookie season or Eric Bledsoe during his years in Milwaukee. There is nothing on the table right now from Minnesota for a Ben Simmons trade that has the ceiling Ben Simmons has."
"Milwaukee was in the playoffs for 5 out of the last 6 seasons before winning your chip this year. That includes the Brandon Knight/OJ Mayo team in '15, the entirety of the Kidd era, the Eric Bledsoe years, I could go on. Milwaukee didn't go from 15-67 to the O'Brien trophy in 1 offseason you guys paid some bad contracts along the way and kept upgrading talent. Because thats how you do it.  Minnesota is in the basement right now like y'all were in '13-'14. Building to a championship is done in steps over a period of time. Adding Ben Simmons doesn't have to be the final step, for all I know he could just be the first step to a 2026 championship for Minnesota, but he makes them better today. And that has to be the consideration for their front office."
Just fucking take Eric Bledsoe man.
"You don't go from 14th in the west to championship level in 1 move. Get Minnesota to win a playoff series then talk about championships. Can you win a playoff series if Ben Simmons is on the floor for 30-35 minutes? Yes. Get there, then talk about championships. The Bucks slogged through years of Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs before they pulled the trigger on a championship move. The Raptors had DeMar for years before they pulled the trigger after multiple playoff disappointments. The Warriors had multiple playoff exits under Mark Jackson before they made their move, so on and so forth."
"He averaged .343 on 3.8 attempts his rookie year, .363 on 5.2 attempts his sophomore year, .383 on 7.1 attempts his third year, and then .326 on 6.5 attempts his fourth year.  Decent volume, but not really ""sniper"" percentages at any point.  Eric bledsoe, christian wood, and andrew wiggins each had a higher 3pt % this year than booker."
There is a pretty big difference between your own fans booing you and another teams fans and every player has very different mental health. Eric bledsoe was fairly open about his anxiety before and during games and I'm sure the criticism he took really effected his playoff performances with the bucks.
"I don't know why, but the first thing I thought of was Eric Bledsoe."
Eric Bledsoe
"""He got muscles for no reason, Eric Bledsoe"" is my fav, Mobsters- Sada Baby  I also like ""real G's move in silence like giannis"" freddie gibs"
"*Got muscles for no reason, Eric Bledsoe* will always be the best one"
Eric Bledsoe and Terrance mann
"I just think back to the Eric Bledsoe ""I don't want to be hair"" moment and how it was completely fueled by rich paul and how we haven't had to deal with him or any Klutch clients since. Been all improvement and good things, leading to our run last year.  Sixers fans, you might not want to lose Maxey but I promise things get way better when Klutch isn't in your building."
That's nba champion Eric bledsoe for you
Kyrie got shut down by Eric Bledsoe for an entire series.
"Hear me out .. Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and Terrance Mann for Simmons?   How could you say no to that?   We can even throw in Eric Bledsoe    You don't like that ..  hear me out   Buddy hield, Marvin bagely, and a bag of chips    You don't like that hear me out .... draymond green straight up   Lol"
Usually teams dont win games when their stars shoot this poorly but since defenses sell out to stop Curry both on and off the ball it allows him to shred defenses even when he puts up an Eric Bledsoe statline.   If you heard Giannis had 11 points on 18% shooting you would assume bucks lost  If you heard Kawhi did that then you would assume the clippers lost  With Curry its not that easy to make this assumption
"OP with 4 absolutely terrible posts now in 2 days  &gt;Can Killian Hayes be useful?  ...he's 20  &gt;Eric Bledsoe is still really good  Enough said  &gt;Will Sekou Doumbouya be waived by the end of the season?&gt;He made no progress from year 1 to 2 and still remained one of the worst players in the league, is it over for him?  Is it over for a 20 year old?    &gt;How many people actually call Ron Artest ""Metta World Peace""? &gt;I don't see anybody actually calling him that, I always went with Ron Artest, it's well established and rolls off the tongue well.    The reason that is a stupid post is Ron Artest's name is Ron Sandiford-Artest and he hasn't been Metta in years"
eric bledsoe on the bucks is an example of a role player who we talked a lot about in that way come playoff time.
"More importantly, got Eric Bledsoe in there"
"This is like the Mahomes ""if you adjust his numbers to league average, he's a mediocre QB"" post  Also imagine being an Eric Bledsoe stan lmao"
Eric Bledsoe is not “still really good” because he was never *really good*
Think big picture. We just went from having to deal with Eric Bledsoe and his partial guaranteed money next year to a free look at the #6 pick from two years ago.
"Lonzo Ball was one of the worst 4th quarter performers for the Pelicans last season, right next to Eric Bledsoe. He had a horrible netrating in the 4th quarter this year, despite the team overall having a positive one. You say that last season didn’t work because they choked games in the clutch, well Lonzo was a big part of that. His 3pt% dropped to 31% in the 4th quarter, he can’t put the ball on the ground, he can’t get to the line or make them consistently, and the pace slows down too so he’s less impactful there. You say Ingram is a bad closer and then hype up the guy every defense is cheating off to double Ingram."
Eric Bledsoe 💩
Eric Bledsoe  Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday
"idk about that these are just the top 14 behind LeBron  2. Anthony Davis – Los Angeles Lakers, PF/C  3. Ben Simmons – Philadelphia 76ers, PG  4. Trae Young – Atlanta Hawks, PG  5.

"Let’s keep going down the line Jordan Clarkson, Trey Lyles, Eric Bledsoe, Darius Garland, Talen Horton Tucker, Dion Waiters…a homeless person could have done those right?"
"…… okay.   Plenty of players do embarrassing shit. MJ had a gambling addiction. Dwight Howard had that press conference with Stan Van Gundy. Gordon Hayward had that weird Player’s Tribune article come out after his Celtics signing already leaked. Kevin Durant’s twitter burners. Paul George (just him. All of him).  And yet, AD got exactly what he wanted. The Lakers obviously got exactly what they wanted. And the Pelicans got an amazing package which would look better if not for random Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams trades.   So… I think your point that it was a mess is just asinine."
Eric Bledsoe instead of Ja Morant
Eric Bledsoe  Ja Morant  Russel Westbrook
Eric Bledsoe - Charmander  &amp;#x200B;  Andre Iguodala - Charmeleon  &amp;#x200B;  LBJ - Charizard
"Cam Payne, Eric Bledsoe, Lebron James."
"Nah, Eric Bledsoe tanked his value with poor play, but the Bucks still moved him for assets.   The Bucks didn’t call him a bum after his playoff performance, small difference."
Eric Bledsoe  Patrick Beverly  Mahcus Smaht
"David Griffin is a good executive. He got good value back for AD, and look he was able to get rid of Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe!"
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
"Not on his contract he isnt.  A team needs shooting, half court offense, rim protection and more shooting, and you can't afford all of those if you've made the mistake of paying Ben Simmons a max.  The absolute analogy is Eric Bledsoe on the Bucks - talented, and a better than average player ... but unable to provide the consistent-enough offense needed to win playoff games."
your team signed Eric Bledsoe and you're claiming they didn't hold him back lol. the fact that NOLA fans/NOLA management still don't realize he's a premier PG is proof of why he had to get out of there

The pels did hold him back and the answer is brandon ingram and eric bledsoe. The difference with the bulls is that only derozan is a ball stopper and even derozan is a more willing passer than bledsoe bi or zion. The pieces just dont fit in NOLA.  Their players play similarly to the stars in boston where iso ball dominates the way they play.
That's like saying lebron is a soft version of Eric Bledsoe
No fuck Eric Bledsoe stop complimenting  him
"the JV and 17th pick (Trey Murphy) for Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, and the 10th pick was a huge win for the Pels"
Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams
Eric Bledsoe did it just last year.
Really puts a damper on things when you say that Eric Bledsoe also did something similar
Eric Bledsoe had 22/5/6 in 14 minutes in the first half of a game last season. Not sure that game would be more impressive if he had sat the rest of the game with an injury.
"If you think a stat that has AD as the 34th best player in the league (behind Cody Zeller and Eric Bledsoe) from 2015 to 2019 is reliable, I don't know what to tell you."
"Mike Budenholzer is the epitome of failing upward. Yes the Bucks won, but look at how many fuckups happened on the way there under his watch. Bringing in Eric Bledsoe? Wasting money on a mid Jabari Parker? Anyone remember Malcolm Brogdon? His obsession with bargain players that were once great? This guy either the world’s smartest idiot or dumbest genius."

Eric Bledsoe is averaging 13.0/4.7/5.3 while shooting 43% from the field and 20% from 3.  Westbrook is averaging 12.0/7.7/8.7 while shooting 34.9% from the field and 9% from 3.  Both are washed up. Yes I understand its only 3 games.  And please stop being a box score watcher. Go and watch games he's in. His triple doubles dont mean sh!t if you actually watch games hes in. And obviously you dont so we can end the convo here
Washed up means he plays like Eric Bledsoe or Kevin Love.  He's still getting triple doubles. Something most players NEVER do.  I get that he isn't as good as he was. But he isn't washed up.
"Eric Bledsoe is the same way. IDK what his foul call would be this year because I don't keep tabs, but last season he was surprisingly good at drawing fouls without necessarily 'flopping.'  Sometimes just having the reputation of a high usage slasher can help ingratiate you to the refs I guess.  (U*nless you're a Big, then the refs go 'f---k you' lol.)*"
"Is this the same guy that was screaming like Embiid got shot [when Eric Bledsoe threw him a basketball](https://youtu.be/THZFrA6Q5K8)?  &gt; ""I haven't seen a violent act like that in years!"""
"I noticed at the end they mentioned how Ja was mature in that he wasn’t chucking up shots in high pressure situations, but passing it out leading to big time buckets, like Jarens for example.  Then in the last 2 possessions, arguably the most important possessions of the game, PG chucks up bad 3’s and they essentially killed any chances the Clippers had of winning.  Also Eric Bledsoe was huge at the end of the game, but speaking from a prior viewing experience when he’s cold it will not be the same as last night."

Eric “mini LeBron” bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe on a contender: Gary Payton  Eric Bledsoe on the Pelicans: Gary Payton II
Technically Eric Bledsoe revenge game here.
Who is ready for the Eric Bledsoe revenge game?
Eric Bledsoe.
"They were 2 games behind the Spurs starting the apathetic Eric Bledsoe for 70-72 games. Hell, don’t blow that 17 point lead in 6 minutes in Portland, have Lonzo cover the corner in MSG, and don’t foul Westbrook in Washington, (among many other crunch time failures), and there’s the play-in."
Lol no my dude you conveniently ignore lots and lots of   context that ultimately destroy your points  and  you keep firing out baseless takes the bubble was an even playing field and it's not like some lower seeded team made the finals the lakers and heat were both legit that postseason and you keep undermining the heat here... The lost because they had trash ass playoff choker Eric Bledsoe if you actually followed the bucks throughout the 2020 and 2021 playoofs you'd know how important Jrue was to defeating the Heat as opposed to having Bledsoe still also isn't Paul George known to dissappear and disappoint in the Playoffs? Prior to the 2020 playoofs he was tremendous last postseason and the clippers actually had a better roster my guy this is gatekeeping to the max lmfaoo
&gt; he passed and his teammates ~~stepped up~~ weren't Eric Bledsoe and hit shots.
Eric Bledsoe looking like what Russ was supposed to be for the Lakers for you guys.
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
Fuck Eric Bledsoe 😑
Esp with 2 main guys and a big bench guy out. But they still have good defense and decent shooting (great for both with all the others in). Question will be which Reggie Jackson and Eric Bledsoe will they get from night to night until Kawhi is back. And can they stay healthy as they have quite a few vets.
"Eric Bledsoe is one of those players that seems like they're 40 and have for years. I think Clippers are gonna be good, middle of the pack til Kawhi is back but they will be a very rough out in the playoffs. 5 seed my prediction."
and he couldn't guard eric bledsoe
lamestream media wants you to think that eric bledsoe is washed
how tf does eric bledsoe already have 18 points
Bledsoe vs curry(while Bledsoe’s guarding him)   Bledsoe: 13 points   Curry: 8 points   Does this mean eric Bledsoe is better at basketball then Steph curry? The numbers can’t lie.
the lakers need to find whatever the clippers are using on eric bledsoe to make him not superwashed
how does eric bledsoe have 15 points already
how tf does washed up eric bledsoe have more points than PG13
Eric Bledsoe with braids is distractingly ugly
Yeah if anything Eric Bledsoe is to blame for the Raptors loss. Giannis sucessfully kicks it out to him and he just bricked every single three.
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
Myles Turner being super available does not mean they are going to take anything for him. Bledsoe is garbage and is being paid 18mil himself. You think the Pacers are trading Myles Turner for Eric Bledsoe? Absolutely not.
I'm trying to think of Giannis and Bud saying something negative about even a player like Eric Bledsoe after his playoff struggles and I can't imagine them doing what Doc and Embiid did. And we're not talking about a max player here.  I just don't understand why the comments were necessary. You know the guy is fragile. Piling on was never going to be received well. Just say nothing and maybe this could be going differently.  And this isn't the first issue Doc has had with guys. This is becoming a trend.
Russel Westbrook is jus Eric Bledsoe with a Jordan contract
"kevon looney, lol  incidentally the only warriors starter that saw any minutes in that one game late last season where pelicans' only starter was eric bledsoe, and espn decided that wasn't good enough so they promoted it as steve kerr's warriors vs eric bledsoe's pelicans.  the disrespect! 😔"
"&gt;  So they win either way.  Just having a player under contract doesn't mean the team ""wins.""   AD was under contract in NO. Kawhi was under contract in SA. Harden was under contract in HOU. Ben Simmons is under contract right now.  You can't force a player to play, no matter what their contract status is. Phoenix already went through this with Eric Bledsoe, and ended up having to trade him for Greg Monroe, who they waived after 20 games. A big part of running any business is employee morale - especially if those employees aren't easily replaceable."
"He showed up and will play to get his cheque. There’s no stipulation in the contract that says he has to go hard on defense.   New Orleans wasn’t out here trying to suspend and fine Eric Bledsoe for being washed last season (effort was an issue). Guess what, you can’t fine a player for being bad.   Guys don’t play at the same level their entire careers so Philly can’t fine him for not being as good as he used to be."
Look at the Caruso situation or lonzo situation this off-season. Both sacrificed quite a bit on their respective teams and the lakers let go of Caruso because he would’ve been a luxury tax burden because his stats weren’t good enough on paper and everyone still shits on lonzo because he had to play next to Eric Bledsoe as a pg
He should just retweet the Eric Bledsoe tweet for mass chaos
"Wake up! You hit your head pretty bad.  Hayward injury? Tatum dunking on LeBron? Being a few minutes away from the NBA Finals? Terry Rozier being better than Eric Bledsoe? Kyrie leaving for Brooklyn? Dude, what are you smoking?   Kyrie’s making his first appearance back in Cleveland since the trade. Trading IT to Cleveland will surely lengthen his career and give him a guaranteed shot at a ring. Grab some popcorn, Celtics at Cavs for opening night is coming up on TNT."
Eric Bledsoe reference?
jrue bledsoe's defense is overrated and he shot below 40% from the field in 2/4 playoff series with the bucks 😭. eric bledsoe only shot below 40% in 2/9 series with the bucks lmao.
Damn? That’s even worse. No team with Eric Bledsoe should be top 5 anything. They were on a roll though pre-pandemic.
Either than the Nerlens debacle I’d say they’re definitely not terrible.  Just this summer Lonzo &amp; Gary Trent got great deals as role players. Eric Bledsoe has continuously gotten great contracts as well.
"Eric Bledsoe, Clips need him to at least show up and be competent on both ends for 20-25 minutes a game."
"Before this offseason I’d agree with you, but the organisation has made some extremely questionable moves since the lottery balls rolled their way in 2019.  They let Lonzo walk as a RFA for no reason whatsoever. They made his replacement a guy who has never shot above 39% from the field in his NBA career and a massive downgrade on defense. Overall they paid more draft compensation in the two deals than they received while simultaneously receiving the worse bundle of players both now and five years in the future.  My grievances with this team don’t stop there. They traded for a non-shooting big in Steven Adams knowing full well that their star’s main offensive weakness is perimeter shooting. They gave up George Hill, a first and two seconds in that deal. They gave up *Jrue Holiday* of all people for Eric Bledsoe, Hill, and a bunch of picks. They had the option of taking De’Andre Hunter and instead flipped him for Jaxson Hayes (again, not a bad player at all, but still a non-shooting big next to a guy who attempted 14 threes his whole rookie season) and some guys who immediately got flipped for seconds. As an OKC fan, I know all too well the importance of hoarding draft picks as a bad team, but *the Pelicans were not a bad team*. They finished 4 games out of the play-in spot in the bubble, were only 2 games out last year, and I guarantee that their 23rd-ranked defense would’ve improved if they had someone who made the All-Defensive 1st Team playing next to another All-Defense caliber guy in Lonzo in the backcourt, possibly enough to even lift them out of the play-in group. Long story short, the Pelicans have had plenty of chances to make the playoffs since Zion landed in NOLA, and they have capitalised on almost none of those opportunities.  To be clear, **I don’t believe Zion is nearly as unhappy as the media make him out to be in New Orleans, but there are certainly lots of reasons why he wouldn’t be totally happy with the team that drafted him**."
"All part of their plan to lower his value until they trade him for Luke Kennard, Serge Ibaka, and Eric Bledsoe"
"it was a move that was too criticized for how it affected the team.    sign and trade Brogdon net us RJ Hampton, Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.    RJ Hampton was traded alongside George Hill, Eric Bledsoe and picks for Jrue Holiday.    not having Brogdon on the contracts (under the tax) allowed us have MLE to sign DJ Augustin and Bobby Portis.    DJ Augustin was traded for PJ Tucker.    Sam Merill was traded for Grayson Allen.    in all comes down to hindsight, but not signing Brogdon has 1) still allowed us to win a title, 2) go over the tax and have a core of Giannis-Khris-Jrue for the next ~4 years, and 3) netted us Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, and Jordan Nwora who will all be in the rotation going forward.     on the other hand, if the Bucks had extended Brogdon, we still may win a chip in 2020 or 21 (not guaranteed obviously) but is that with Brogdon as the starting PG, or was he traded anyway for a higher tier player (could be Jrue, could be CP3)."
"Right but I feel pretty confident saying that Eric Bledsoe was one of the worst starters in the NBA last year, he absolutely did not deserve to get as much playing time as Stan gave him"
Bucks trading for Jrue. He put us over the top. Don’t win the ‘chip w/o him.  Meanwhile Eric Bledsoe has only spiraled down since then.
No no no no and Hell NO I’m not letting this shit slide lol  He was brought in to bring in championship culture  and a hard working mindset to the team. Let’s get the first thing out the win that Doc Rivers as a head coach only had 1 more regular season win in his tenure with lob city (57-25) 2013-14 Vinny Del Negro who at the previous season went (56-26)2012-13. The team already showed it could win regular season games the goal was to get over the hump to the WCF at minimum.  Reggie Bullock was hit with injuries so playing him was going to be difficult but Doc never went out of his way to play him.  Some ways through year two and Reggie is gone and thankfully found a lane in the league.  The Eric Bledsoe trade was botched in a few ways considering the hype and trade value Bledsoe had at the time. In hindsight the clippers never deal with Phoenix  and use Caron Butler to get JJ who was a S&amp;T and Butler ended up going to Bucks anyway  weeks later to return home. In the moment I’m still confused why Jared Dudley was a core piece in a Bledsoe trade.   Trading Dudley after 1 Year in a salary dump basically made no since at all. This move began the habit of wasting first round picks to just remove players from the team Doc didn’t like rather that using 1st to create stability on rookie contracts or add legitimate upgrades to the roster.  Jeff Green DID NOT play a big role for the team. Doc hated Lance Stephenson and wanted to play Austin Rivers more minutes (the one young player that was almost out of the league). Jeff Green joined the team and this was peak Mr. Inconsistent but he was a former Celtic so Doc loved him. By the playoffs Jeff Green went from starting 10 of 27 games to being benched and only saw his minutes kick up because Blake and Chris went down. You know what Jeff Green did after the season that we spent a 2019 first own? He left in free agency and another wasted clippers pick.  2018 was about a retool but likely rebuild. Chris Paul we going to leave and was fed up with Doc and issues with Blake. Doc did his best work with a rebuilding situation but even then let egos get in the way of the championship situation HARRELL
You think Reggie Jackson can keep the playoff form for 82 games? Eric Bledsoe going to dial back the clock to 3 years ago? Terrence Mann suddenly gonna be good for 16 ppg each night?  All of those players are going to play off of PG and the system so whenever PG struggles you'll see the Clippers struggle a lot.
He's just a taller Eric Bledsoe!

Jones looks like a genius for getting cp3 but Chris Paul initiated the deal and so I’m not convinced theyre that much better of an org than when Eric Bledsoe tweeted he wanted out so badly just a couple of years ago.
"There was a good twitter thread breaking this down but can't find it. Here's what I remember.  The Cavaliers were going to trade Kyrie. They were looking into Eric Bledsoe (haha) and so Kyrie was offended and he asked out before they could move him. He said he'd go to the [Timberwolves, Spurs, Heat, Knicks](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/21/16012292/kyrie-irving-trade-demand-cavaliers-spurs-heat-knicks-timberwolves-lebron-james) and they instead sent him to the Celtics.  So it wasn't really like he left Cavs in a one-sided manner to go on to do something better. He was kind of traded around and then eventually left to go to his hometown team and his father's favorite team."
He dropped 38 on Eric Bledsoe.
Because Stan van Gundey thought it would be better to be the slowest paste  team in the league while making Eric fucking Bledsoe the main guard ball handler
"Myles Turner is the only player on that list that is both better than Caruso and less talked about. John Collins, Roco, Eric Bledsoe all have gotten plenty of attention. Cam Payne has been plenty hyped by this sub ever since he turned his shit around and became a good player, and people were all over reggie jackson in the playoffs - both backup point guards in the same tier as Caruso imo"
Eric bledsoe Myles Turner Jamychal Green Mikal Bridges Robert Covington John Collins Thaddeus Green Dorian Finney-Smith Royce Oneil Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne
Yeah man Eric Bledsoe does this shit. Every pg should have this in their arsenal.
Led his team to the ECF? Last time Kyrie led a team they got destroyed and bounced in the 2nd round while Kyrie got outplayed and locked up by Eric Bledsoe and George Hill
Right now Ty Lue is sliding Eric Bledsoe into the starting lineup with Mann coming off the bench.  We’ll see what kind of rotation comes through when the season starts but 30+ minutes and that stat line with a number of other shooters may be optimistic

Eric Bledsoe
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"I'll say this time and time again, the fact that we got rid of Eric Bledsoe, who started and played more minutes than almost everyone on the team is a + for the roster. He didn't try, and we couldn't count on him to do anything last year except airball a 3 every game."
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
Eric Bledsoe  Donovan Mitchell Anthony Davis Jusuf Nurcic Talen Horton-Tucker  Mitchell and Davis get it done.  THT is underrated.  Bledsoe and Nurcic are gravy.
I get your point but the roster got better idk how you could say otherwise. Eric Bledsoe led the team in minutes last year. Replacing him and Adams with Graham and Jonas alone is reason for optimism.
Jrue holiday is not the difference Eric Bledsoe can do everything he does
Don't forget banishing Eric Bledsoe
maybe if the Bucks were still running out Eric Bledsoe as starting point
"The wall doesn’t work on this team anymore with the addition of Jrue, if it did the heat wouldn’t have gotten swept.  14/15 warriors can’t wall them at all  18/19 raptors wouldn’t beat this team since Jrue &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe"
"&gt; Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  I feel like a lot of these comments are made with so much confidence but when has this strategy worked?  We've seen plenty of instances where teams have put on this brave face and then bailed early because the trade value doesn't rise but it does sometimes drop even further.   We can look at Anthony Davis, James Harden and Jimmy Butler as examples where holding out didn't net a better return. We can also look at role players like Eric Bledsoe in Phoenix or Kevin Porter Jr in Cleveland.   Disgruntled players just don't sell for top dollar.   ***  In addition, the trade deadline is historically a buyer's market. It's a terrible time to sell an all-star because teams aren't in a position to refill their rosters after offering a big trade package.  [The history of trade deadline deals is incredibly weak.](https://ca.nba.com/news/revisiting-some-of-the-most-impactful-deals-at-the-nba-trade-deadline-since-the-year-2000/rk8sg9udnjt416rhzcbyald04) It's when you offload bad money or buy role players on expiring deals. It's not the time to be selling All-Stars.   The offseason is a seller's market, but the 76ers have decided to do their business in a buyer's market instead."
"He got the following guys a bag:  Tristan Thompson   KCP  Eric bledsoe   Dejuante Murray  Clarkson    Garland   None of these are top 10 players and all have or in garlands case will get a bag  Rich Paul may be unpopular, but i wouldn't say he's a bad agent"
"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
Eric Bledsoe comes to mind
Eric Bledsoe gives bums a bad name.
"this is the ""steve kerr vs eric bledsoe"" game"
I didn’t say anything about an entire year…  As of this time last year Jrue Holiday wasn’t on the Bucks and Eric Bledsoe was. Not sure why everyone acts like a deal NEEDs to happen. We have time…  A large portion of the NBA isn’t even eligible to be traded due to contracts signed this summer.   Why should the Sixers make a deal now? What’s the benefit? Embiid wants a championship. His goal isn’t to go 10-0 to start the season. We were a one seed last year and the year was seen as a failure. Regular season doesn’t mean much…
"Yeah it's fascinating on one hand because dudes have demanded a trade before but AFAIK it's been a long, long time since anybody actually went through with the ""or else"". Who's the last person to actually act out before the team caved and traded him? Vince Carter? I mean Eric Bledsoe got traded after a single tweet lol"
"You guys already sent out Pat Beverley, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu for Eric Bledsoe, so that was $23 million in outgoing salary right there. All you'd have had to do was include Kennard and you'd have had the salaries to match on Westbrook instead of Bledsoe. Kennard gets DNP-CDs fairly regularly (even in the playoffs) so it's not like he's worth keeping over having someone like Westbrook. Personally I think Westbrook is better than Bledsoe and Kennard, but maybe you disagree."
"Reggie Jackson / Eric Bledsoe / Paul George / Marcus Morris / Ivica Zubac  Honestly, seeing it laid out like that...this team goes from title contender to not scary in the slightest.  Like there's a chance the team doesn't make the playoffs if Kawhi doesn't play at all.  Am I crazy for thinking that?"
[how Eric Bledsoe got out of Phoenix](https://mobile.twitter.com/ebled2/status/922201984211369984?lang=en)
"Giannis has still proved himself with lacklustre shooting around him. He played like an all nba player with like Jabari Parker and John Henson in the same lineup as him. He played like an mvp with Eric Bledsoe there. Ben has 4 shooters around him, including the most dominant post player since Shaq who’s altered his game for bens benefit to take like 8 jumpers per game"

Grizz traded JV for Adams and effectively to move from 17 (Trey Murphy III) to 10 (Zaire Williams).   The Lakers first was the compensation for taking on Eric Bledsoe and allowing the Pelicans to take the trade exception for Adams salary.
"Adams was on a two year deal, and JV had a year remaining with a desire to be extended (NO gave him two more years). The Grizz are thought to planning to eventually move Jaren Jackson Jr. to the starting center.  Currently the point is to move more of the frontcourt offensive load to Jackson. Adams was supposed to provide defense and rebounding, and some protection for Jackson. In exchange for taking Adams and Eric Bledsoe, the Grizz moved up seven slots in this year’s draft, publicly saying they had intel that their target Ziaire Williams would be drafted before their pick. They also received the Lakers 2022 first round pick.   Eric Bledsoe lead to a domino effect of trades.   JV was a fan favorite in Memphis, but the org had no long term plans for him (just as they have none with Adams). JV played most of last season without Jackson, just like so far he’s been playing without Zion Williamson.   The true measure of the trade isn’t now; neither team was in the championship hunt. The measure for the Grizz will be years from now and how Williams does and what happens with that Lakers pick. One of the key rotation players for the Grizz, Desmond Bane was the 30th pick in the 2020 draft."
"You forgot CP3, Eric Bledsoe"
eric bledsoe is terrible at the game of basketball. Our offense is disgusting when he's in.
Eric Bledsoe
"Bet you could teach Eric Bledsoe a thing or two about NBA defense, huh champ? Maybe you should tweet him"
"im very sorry its funny when you add a sniff in the middle of the sentence lol   Eric Bledsoe on Steph: “It's horrible \*sniff\* because you think you got him covered. They'll get ball movement for a wide-open layup &amp; \*sniff\*  turn it down to look for him for a 3. By the time you turn your head, you think they're gonna lay the ball up \*sniff\*  &amp; he's on the other side of the court \*sniff\* shooting a 3.”"
I feel like In the past Steph would put on muscle in the off-season and then lose a little bit as the season started and progressed but now he looks like Eric bledsoe out there

Eric bledsoe and  ben simmons
Lol that's the most Eric Bledsoe thing I've ever seen
Eric Bledsoe
"Literally no one, the closest thing would be Donovan Mitchell or Eric Bledsoe. If you take height out of the picture Eric Paschall is a stocky dude"
fuck eric bledsoe
Eric bledsoe with 75% behind the arc. What a deadly shooter
I want to throw Eric Bledsoe in this pile.
"We almost certainly would have still failed in the playoffs due to Eric Bledsoe reasons, but the team really did look completely different before and after the covid break. We were obliterating teams."
"Muscles for no reason, Eric Bledsoe!"
meanwhile Eric Bledsoe just keeps bouncing around the league being the player most hated by his own fanbase lmao
"He's never been a very good shooter. The FT% in college over three or four seasons never eclipsed 70% despite him shooting 45% from three in his last Baylor season. Also, pull up shots are harder against NBA defenders as a 6'1 player. Maybe he'll adjust, but the 60% from the free throw line is what is damning (and yes it's a small sample, but the fact that it's a small sample is also damning because he doesn't get to the line).  He didn't rebound that well in college and rarely dunked which both indicate a lack of vertical athleticism. So maybe the comp is Eric Bledsoe but with less athleticism? I dunno.  He supposedly has an absurd work ethic so the Kings are probably betting on him to develop a shot eventually. I'm not as optimistic and was very low on him coming into the draft (I felt he shouldn't have been a first round pick), but I think the defense has at least made him a worthy first rounder. But to be worthy of a lottery pick he simply has to shoot better."
Fuck Eric Bledsoe. Dude is ripped and looks like he should be the quickest and fastest pg in the league but he’s shockingly average to below average. He always ends up on teams i like and makes me invest in him and he always disappoints. His subtraction was the main reason the Bucks won last year.
That's the man that ended ~~Drew~~ Eric Bledsoe
"Now look at the Lakers picks. I’m absolutely giddy as a Pelicans’ fan. If the Lakers pick falls in the top-10,  *David Griffin dumped Eric Bledsoe for nothing*. Imagine saying that at the end of last season."
"Eric Bledsoe in NOP would have been a better fit. Kuzma and Gasol worked salary-wise, replacing Schroeder at a cheaper rate, and allowed the Lakers to keep Caruso."
"Pelicans played defense as well as the crowd booed Eric Bledsoe. And if you watched the game, you should know how well the crowd booed Eric Bledsoe."
Eric Bledsoe for 3
"The man signed Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams, on a roster that has Lonzo and Zion. He clearly doesn’t understand basketball because those moves don’t fit at all"
"Eric Bledsoe trying to have a revenge game against us, how dare u"
"Well OP is clearly going for legends. Who’s a legend PG who is strong? Like Eric Bledsoe is jacked but not a legend. Same with SG. Like Klay is solid, but who is supposed to go above him?"
Rondo and Eric Bledsoe for a couple more.
John Wall and Eric Bledsoe started a movement.   You can also credit Derrick Rose at Memphis
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
Turns into Eric Bledsoe.
Eric Bledsoe is a really good defender lol (in the years he tried) and so is Pat Bev despite his reputation and WB's comments
"Yeah he's tall but he's still in that tier. Jrue effectively got traded for Eric Bledsoe, 2FRP, and 2 swaps. But Philly wants an all-star and a haul. Hence the problem."
"I want PG to win.  I know he's not the best offensive engine in the league (Curry, Jokic, Luka) and sometimes fans want him to have skills he doesn't have but he's consistently elevated teams to the conference finals that have no business being there if he's not a true superstar.  The Clippers are still humming along without another guy i'm sure is an above average starter.  Where were Zubac, Jackson, Batum and Eric Bledsoe before they got to LA?He's a great complementary player on both sides of the ball and truly makes players around him better by spacing the floor and taking on the most difficult defensive assignments in a way that more ball dominant, one dimensional players are said to.    We just want to clown on him for being a playoff choker when his numbers improve in the playoffs on the aggregate and the results speak for themselves, minus the ring. He's admitted to having struggles with his mental health but we were cold and unforgiving and quick to dismiss his successes.  He was the 20th ranked recruit out of California and built himself into a superstar.  I'm pulling for PG."
"Youre saying the JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Eric Bledsoe and KCP paydays didnt maximize their earnings?"
"They probably should’ve sought a young player too though, not just Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe
"An underrated stupid part is that they played Jrue and Eric Bledsoe out of position at the 2 for 2 seasons, to accommodate Lonzo, and then they let Lonzo go. Their perimeter defense is now in a shambles, and they don't have the interior defenders to cover."
"They've mostly been ridiculed for it from the perspective of ""look at how bad Eric Bledsoe is"" or by people just looking a reason to shit on the Pelicans for whatever reason."
"pick swaps are useless when you are a perma dogshit team vs a contender with a 26 y/o 2 time MVP...  so they got 1 washed Bledsoe and 2 first picks, if you wanna look at it that way and not include Adams, which prolly makes it look even worse as they either gave up RJ Hampton or a Nuggets first round pick and 2 second round picks... For that fucking contract. Just fucking unreal..  The only thing that might have value in that trade is the 27 Bucks draft pick (or ofc they somehow luck themselves into a good late first round pick in 25, which is unlikely as their best draftee (outside of the obvious pick Zion) in recent years is NAW lol)  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
Eric Bledsoe in his 3 postseasons with the Bucks :(
"It's crazy that he was ranked 82nd by espn at one point. Robert Covington, Davis Bertans, and Eric Bledsoe are some of the players ranked significantly higher than him."
"Look at who was in that 1st team. There is no way Eric Bledsoe is a better defender than Klay. Klay got robbed on this one. Pat Bev was 1st team in 2017. Klay got robbed again. All-nba defensive is overrated, especially for players who do a great job at clamping the other team's best guard."
Paul George wInning games with hartenstein and Eric Bledsoe. Not getting the credit he deserves
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
"I feel this isn't being talked about enough. In the last 2 calendar years, Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum and Eric Bledsoe all looked like they were on their way to being out of the league and now they're 3 of our best 5 players."
"That's  ""Pelicans starting Eric Bledsoe"" level bad. Yikes."
"eric bledsoe redemption tour  remember when people thought bledsoe was overpaid, he makes less than half of what westbrook does and he's doing a better job filling in for injured stars  coup of the year, what an upgrade from pat bev"
"Ah, so you don't fully know how the NBA cap works. It's cool, most people don't. See the Bucks didn't have enough salary cap to take on Jrue's large contract. To make the trade work they had to send salary out that almost matched with Jrues. That salary belonged to Eric Bledsoe. In exchange we got an extra first round pick.  Lonzo doesn't have an unconventional style and he sure as hell isn't a center piece to an actually contending team. He's a good role player who can make flashy passes. Look at the Bulls. He's their 4th best player and doing pretty well. The Bulls are doing good too, but no one expecte the Bulls to actually win the East. So, as the 4th best playet on a team Lonzo isn't good enough to make them a contender, why would people build with the idea that he's the #2 or #3 on a team?"
"The things where they were chosen to be on your team.  You had Lonzo and Zion, 2 players with unconventional styles but fortunately those styles mesh well together. The goal should have always been to build around those 2 + Ingram but Griffin doesn’t understand basketball at all so he decided to have Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams on his team, 2 players which are the antithesis of Lonzo + Zion"
What Eric Bledsoe thing? Where we got an extra pick to him on because his salary was needed to match with Jrue's? The Steven Adams thing? We sent a protected first for him and used a pick swap to turn him into Jonas. That is an overpay but it's not franchise ruining.  Injuries have done more to kill hope than anything and he doesn't control injuries. His biggest critique is how dishonest he's been around the injuries but no one outside of New Orleans fans actually cares about that and that had 0 effect on last season.
"He looks like he's lost a step.  I don't know if it's because he needs more time to get his legs or because he's older but check this out.  Eric Bledsoe fg% 0-3 feet from the basket  * '17-'18, .705 * '18-'19,  .726 * '19-'20, .709 * '20-'21, .681 * '21- '22, **.448**  Right now, he's having trouble getting to the cup and finishing once he gets there.  From watching him, he looks like he's lost a lot of bounce and can't get up in traffic like he used to."
"Not ones lead by David Griffin that’s for sure. A rebuild is supposed to give hope for a better future, but all he’s done is ruin that hope.  I love New Orleans so the Pels have been my second team for a while, but it’s just so frustrating seeing what he’s done with he’s had, the Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams things were just so stupid it still makes me mad"
"Eric ""Regular Season"" Bledsoe"
I LOVE ERIC BLEDSOE AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT
"Eric Bledsoe, the whitest of them all"
Eric Bledsoe found his salon
That's Eric Bledsoe to you sir
Just got home and was following the score on an app before I turned the game on. Did eric Bledsoe just become good all of a sudden?
eric bledsoe is the greatest point guard in clipper history
THE ERIC BLEDSOE GAME
Wow Eric Bledsoe making fadeaway
"Lillard, i would just do the eric bledsoe and say ""I don't wanna be here"""
It stopped working the day we traded Eric Bledsoe
"&gt; DRose, Brogdon, KCP, Dinwiddie, Smart, Rubio, Rozier, Conley, or even Lonzo Ball - all these guys are guards who definitely can contribute to a winning team, and you wouldn't need to give up more than just Simmons, at worst add a depth player or pick, to get even 2 of them.  I'd be surprised to find any of these players were being offered for Simmons. For a bunch of reasons.  &gt; All of those guys move the needle for the 6ers just like Jrue Holiday was the difference the Bucks needed to win a championship.  Milwaukee gave up Eric Bledsoe and some picks and got an elite defensive guard to be their 3rd-4th option. Do you think that a 4th option moves the needle for the sixers? Seriously?"
"I think last year's roster was loaded but it just didn't work. I mean lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Zion, and Steven Adams. That's a pretty good fuckin starting lineup. When do we start to look at coaching and offensive schemes? That team did not play up to what they could have"
Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe lmao
How has no one says Eric Bledsoe? He used to be called “Mini-LeBron”
Eric bledsoe
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
How’s the Eric Bledsoe experience though.
"It hasn't been a lack of effort.  He's just lost his explosiveness.  Check this out.    Eric Bledsoe fg% 0-3 feet from the basket  * '17-'18, .705 * '18-'19,  .726 * '19-'20, .709 * '20-'21, .681 * '21- '22, **.417**  His ability to finish at the rim used to be among his biggest strengths on offense and it has disappeared.  Even in this game, he got stuffed on a transition layup that he used to make routinely in the past.    He's trying, he's just physically not the same player he was even last year."
Eric Bledsoe is showing that he isn't a negative on the court if he isn't chucking up a ton of shots. I wish another Los Angeles point guard could learn to do that...
dame for eric bledsoe. who says no???
Everybody gangsta until Eric Bledsoe start hitting 3s
I have one Eric Bledsoe. Now what?
Shake milton for me. Imagine Eric bledsoe with even more audacity
Eric Bledsoe. One of the lowest basketball IQ guards in the entire association. There are G league guys I’d rather have out there than Bledsoe. Absolute bonehead

May I offer another player? Eric Bledsoe
"The sequel to the Eric Bledsoe Clippers experience is definitely ""straight to VHS"" material."
Eric Bledsoe
Welcome to your Eric Bledsoe moment.
It’s a tie between Eric Bledsoe and Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe
&gt;Clippers with Eric Bledsoe on the floor this season:  &gt;238 minutes &gt;-45 +/-  &gt;Clippers with Eric Bledsoe off the floor this season:  &gt;194 minutes &gt;+85 +/-
I think Eric Bledsoe may be the player in the league who sparks the least joy
Eric Bledsoe taught him well lol
"I'm a simple man. I see Eric Bledsoe fucking up, I upvote."
"Eric Bledsoe is the worst player getting regular minutes on the Clippers since we signed the corpse of Paul Pierce.  Yes, he's that bad."
Eric Bledsoe is so bad
Eric Bledsoe sit plz
You gotta think that Lawrence traded for Eric bledsoe to use him as a trade asset at the deadline. He's a negative every minute he's on the court
"It’s because Brogdon never showed an ability to be the primary ball handler in our offense. He wasn’t a great passer and couldn’t attack off the dribble as well as Bledsoe. His PnR defense was also no where near the level of Bledsoe’s - Eric was a big part in how good our defense was.  It’s not hard to see why we let him go since he was the 4th option in our offense, and his role was extremely replaceable since he spaced the floor, shot threes, and attacked close outs. Wes was nearly a good replacement since he shot threes at a league average and played exceptional defense on a minimum contract. DDV is now a Brogdon replacement basically.  I highly doubt we would’ve been able to do anything anymore significant with Brogdon rather than Bledsoe. Maybe he would’ve performed better playoff-wise, but he wasn’t anything special in the series against Toronto.  I’m just confused on why there’s a need to mention Milwaukee every single time Brogdon is posted. We’ve moved on from him and improved, at that. It should be over."
it can go either way. he's Paul George or he's Eric Bledsoe.
He’s a decent secondary ball handler but yeah he’s mostly a sharpshooter.   He also won’t solve their playmaking issues unfortunately. I’m telling you - expect a trade for Eric Bledsoe
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
"&gt;Well Giannis needs numerous shooters around him to be effective  This is like saying ""AD needs to be playing with LeBron to be effective."" Just a totally asinine, reductive statement.  Giannis' career didn't start two years ago. He put up 27/10/5 starting alongside guys like Thon Maker/John Henson/Jabari Parker/Eric Bledsoe, under a coach that literally discouraged shooting 3s.   Even after Bud came aboard, it's not like he's been playing with a murderer's row of elite shooting talent. It's just that they went from literally putting the worst possible team/coaching around him to saying ""hey, maybe we should try to surround him with some shooters"" and they turned into a 60-win team basically overnight with Giannis as the undisputed best player.   AD *HAS* played with ""a playmaker"" before LA. He's also played with ""numerous shooters."" I'll gladly admit that the Bucks supporting cast was better than the Pels' at their peak (although the gap is nowhere near as big as people make it sound) but giving a player the benefit of the doubt for doing less with less is not a compelling argument."
Ingram is an efficient 24/5/5 player at age 23...who are they supposed to get that’s better than him and fits Zion’s timeline?   Maybe not having so much cash allotted to Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams would help before blaming a young all star forward.
Van Gundy was such a bad hire. Imagine drawing up a play for fucking eric bledsoe to win the game.
Hey how’d you spend your Sunday?   Oh nothing just watched Eric Bledsoe put up 20 shots
Just the vintage Eric Bledsoe defensive experience with that foul
they ran an elevator screen for Eric Bledsoe 😭
"I really like his game. NAW is a pretty crafty three level scorer already.   Also hit some very clutch threes, despite being only a sophmore. Makes no sense that Eric Bledsoe gets so much more playtime than him :("
"&gt;joel put up 30/10 easily  There was nothing easy about it. Embiid kept gassing out in the 2nd half and falling apart.  That's the point, Embiid is great but he can't do everything himself and the other guys are a joke.   This will be Simmons's 3rd playoffs where he gets the ball taken out of his hands. Tobias will be trying to break 16ppg in the playoffs for the first time in his career.  You guys should have traded for Eric Bledsoe to complete the trifecta of biggest playoff chokers."
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"6’3 Lebron is Eric Bledsoe, Im taking KD"
6'3 Lebron would basically be CP3 but built like Eric Bledsoe. Pretty damn good player
Ok let's talk about Eric Bledsoe over Mike Conley and Melo
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
Eric Bledsoe with long arms
Eric Bledsoe with the highest +- of all players right now. Just like we all expected.
David Griffin trick y'all man. This dude really gave the bag to a declining Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe.
"Since the 90s days most of their big additions were from Trades (Charles Barkley, Jason Kidd, Stephon Marbury, Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson, Shaq, Eric Bledsoe, Chris Paul), or the players were on their last leg and turned their careers around in Phoenix (Grant Hill).   Steve Nash and Tyson Chandler have really been their only big signings since 2000. Nash was drafted there and Dallas didn't match Phoenix' big offersheet. He was also 30 and had back problems and had his lowest stats in 5 seasons. He was seen as a pretty bad signing all things considered. Tyson was considered a huge overpay at the time and still is in retrospect.   They definitely have been able to sign FAs, but they are typically in the Raja Bell tier of great role players/starters. Nash has really been their only major signing and it wasn't a huge signing at the time."
"I said in the post that Eric Bledsoe and Kris Middleton are both great players. But come playoff time they haven’t stepped up consistently. Like the heat series last year. The heat knew that and they weren’t really concerned about those guys, so the wall worked cause they could focus and stick with that"
"If you don't like that, you don't like Eric Bledsoe basketball!  ^^^kill ^^^me"
"Honestly I don't know if I want to be saddled with 2 years of Eric ""I don't want to be here"" Bledsoe"
I’ve never hated a player on a team I like as much as I hate Eric “Muscles for No Reason” Bledsoe
"Hassan Whiteside, Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe
He got that Eric Bledsoe energy
"At this point even 21 million/y seems like a reach, he's a skinny Eric Bledsoe."
Just Eric Bledsoe with an agressive accent
schroder the next eric bledsoe bruh
"one thing is for sure tho, he is absolutely better than eric bledsoe"
PatBev for Eric Bledsoe swap who says no
Eric Bledsoe vs Terry Rozier vibes
"When the Heat upset the Bucks last post-season there were a few things:  - Bud couldn't adjust &amp; underplayed his stars  - Eric Bledsoe  - The Heat benefited immensely from the bubble: Duncan Robinson &amp; Herro were scorching hot and by Duncan Robinson's own admission, he benefited from not having to deal with the pressure of a crowd.  - Bucks were missing a true PG, bench scoring, and tough veterans. Jrue, PJ Tucker and Bobby Portis address that  And they've also improved their outside shooting.  As ridiculous as the Nets are offensively I'm not convinced their roster will be able to beat the Bucks over a 7 game series there's a lot of gaps."
Just admit you didn't watch either team last year. Embiid and Harris have taken big steps because of the shooting and spacing. Tobias is much more efficient and quick with his scoring and better on defense. Embiid is amazing in the post and better at passing out of double teams. Bucks also added Holiday and that changes things so much from with Eric Bledsoe.
Good thing they don't have Eric bledsoe to pay instead
He had good regular season teams. They (I.e Eric Bledsoe) just dropped off in the playoffs but those teams would have made the playoffs without Giannis
I’d rather have Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs than Julius Randle
Easy  They turned Eric Bledsoe into Jrue Holiday
"George Hill was underrated on that team. He was a solid defender and if we needed a basket he almost always came through.  Jrue is a big part of the transformation but the Bucks upgrading their entire bench isn't talked about enough. This isn't the same team as last year, Only the core players remained. 4 players from last years team played yesterday.  **Players on the bubble team that are not in Milwaukee this time around**.  Eric Bledsoe • George Hill • Wesley Matthews • Marvin Williams • Kyle Korver • Frank Mason • Robin Lopez • Sterling Brown • Ersan Ilyasova • DJ Wilson"
Addition by subtraction. Eric Bledsoe doesn't have the ball.
"Not to mention the Heat lost Jae Crowder to the Suns, who was one of their best defenders. And they lost Olynek too who is a great 3-shooter. Add that to the fact that Jru Holiday is MUCH better than Eric Bledsoe and you see the result."
One hundred percent this. They now have two Middleton level players to back up Giannis instead of one Middleton and an Eric Bledsoe. Jrue takes pressure off of everyone. Not to mention PJ and Portis make their small ball options more solid. We should all be ready for the East to get very interesting the next two rounds.
"Bryn Forbes &gt;&gt; Kyle Korver (way past his prime)  Bobby Portis &gt;&gt; Robin Lopez (another rim protector that can shoot the 3)  Jrue Holiday &gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe (need I say more?)  PJ Tucker &gt; Eran Illyasova (more defense, and more corner threes)  This bucks team is KILLING it with their depth."
"While you’re right, this is as empty of a statement as saying Miami are frauds.  Present your evidence!  It’s bountiful.  We learned what the game looks like when Giannis guards Jimmy - Jimmy struggles.  Tyler Herro is not playing anywhere near the level he did in the bubble and I don’t think anyone is sure why, but it’s a huge factor.  Jrue Holiday is a huge acquisition and I didn’t check this for sure, but I’ll bet he led the Bucks in +/- this series.  He’s a huge upgrade over Eric Bledsoe who honestly really struggled with anxiety and pressure in playoff games.  You say “getting punched in the mouth made them hungrier and angrier” but I mean, that’s just something you say in hindsight that doesn’t really mean anything.  They prepared more for playoff basketball this year and learned a defense that switches everything.  They’re playing different basketball from last year."
Conclusion is that Eric Bledsoe is a fraud.
It is weird that no one wants to mention upgrading from Eric Bledsoe/George Hill to JRUE HOLIDAY as a reason to think these Bucks might be more successful
No Eric Bledsoe :(
"Not a Heat or Bucks, but I was predicting the Heat would win in realistically 4 games...or possibly 5 games. Never did I imagine the Bucks would win, let alone sweep the Heat. Last year, I was predicting the Bucks would beat the Heat in 5 games but they got completely manhandled. It was embarrassing to watch and I’m not a Bucks fan but I was so confident they were the better team. So for this year, I noticed how nothing changed. Same players, same coach = same result. Well, I was wrong. There were some changes: Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe. Home court advantage does matter when it’s not in a noiseless bubble. Jimmy Butler and the Heat started very slow this season due to injuries. Butler never seemed to be 100% or half as good as he was in 2020. That goes to show the wear and tear, the duress and extended postseason has on you.   Most importantly, it really goes to show the importance of those first two games. Last year, Miami dominated Milwaukee and won some close ones against the Bucks which affects your psyche. This year, that Game 1 OT win by the Bucks really changed the outcome of this series. I think if the Heat had won it, the Heat would’ve won this series. That Game 1 win by the Bucks finally gave them the confidence that they can beat the Heat. Meanwhile, it was a blow to the Heat for losing a gut-wrenching tightly contested game. The Bucks gained more confidence, the Heat lost some...and that dictated the rest of the series. And it can’t be oversold, Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe."
Anyone that watched Eric Bledsoe play the last 2 years knew what a home run trade that was. Just getting off Bledsoes deal was worth a first round pick at least. Getting a near all star caliber player who fits giannis perfectly takes it  over the top.
And their starting PG isn't Eric Bledsoe. The Jrue Holiday effect vs Eric Bledsoe is like going from Kwame Brown to Tracy McGrady
"Bucks fans deserve this one 100%. Too high of expectations last year with Giannis winning a back to back MVP and his point guard being Eric Bledsoe. Now that everyone seems to count them out and having Jrue, they're dangerous. They'd pose a good fight against the Nets, more then Ben ""help I can't shoot"" Simmons, Joel ""damn I'm always hurt"" Embiid and the 76ers."
"&gt; He’s a good shooter   Career 33% 3 point shooter, same as Eric Bledsoe."
21 Heat didn’t have 2020 Heat legend Eric Bledsoe
Yeah and spo didn’t have Eric Bledsoe to carry him this time
They lost Eric Bledsoe though
you don't care that they replace ERIC BLEDSOE averaging 12/6/5 on 33% FG and 24% from three with Jrue Holiday??   instead of Korver (retired)   Marvin Williams (retired)   they had Portis and PJ???
eric bledsoe punching the air rn
Shame heat legend Eric Bledsoe didn't show up in the series. Could have won if he did
Shame heat legend Eric Bledsoe didn't show up in the series. Could have won if he did
What no Eric Bledsoe does to a mf
Eric Bledsoe
I believe the biggest difference is replacing one Eric Bledsoe with a Jrue Holiday
I went to a Pelicans game this year and had to watch Eric Bledsoe play for 42 minutes
Eric Bledsoe has entered the chat.
&gt; startable two-way player?  Sounds like Eric Bledsoe after he leaves NOP!
Worked for Eric Bledsoe
Eric “all defense” Bledsoe
Porzingis doing his best Eric Bledsoe impersonation
"If I was pat bev height, I’d be a Eric Bledsoe type player"
This was with the Eric Bledsoe and Wesley Mathews backcourt.
It's really good defense. But media bias is so much more the pendulum of Heat blowing this instead of Jrue is way better than Eric Bledsoe
Brook and Giannis are making him miserable and he can't do his passing game because Jrue is not Eric Bledsoe and leaving the white kids open
"They were missing their all star from last year, heat legend, Eric Bledsoe"
Really the difference here lmao.  Went from Eric Bledsoe to JRue
Where's Eric Bledsoe when you need him
"A consistent wing shooter is a lynchpin in the Bucks offense. Without one, teams will just build a wall and let dudes like Nikola Mirotic, Eric Bledsoe, and the ghost of Kyle Korver miss open shots. Bryn's importance to this Bucks squad is understated."
Giannis was injured and their point guard was Eric Bledsoe
Don't disrespect bubble Heat legend Eric Bledsoe like this.
Honest question. Why do laker fans defend kuzma?? Hes like the eric Bledsoe of the lakers. A net negative on the teams performance
Eric Bledsoe
Heat missing their best player Eric Bledsoe right now.
"Yes, the upgrade from Eric Bledsoe who absolutely sucks to Jrue Holiday who is an All Star Caliber player is a big deal.  The loss of Jae Crowder is also a really big deal.  Not to mention Miami just got really hot at the right time, that wasn’t who they were all season."
The heat had eric bledsoe
have we all forgotten about the 4 v 6 game changer that is eric bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe MVP
"Jrue Holiday is an upgrade from Eric Bledsoe in *literally every way* and it makes the Bucks a much better team than they've been in years prior.   Nets vs. Bucks could really end up being the best series we get all playoffs, and it's coming in the second round lmao."
The Heat are really missing their best player …  Eric Bledsoe
I miss eric bledsoe :(
"Getting jrue holiday was like going from playing 4v6 to playing on 6v4. That’s not really saying how good jrue is, but really about how bad Eric Bledsoe was"
"All of their players from last year are playing worse, particularly Herro and Bam. The Heat traded Olynk and Avery Bradley for basically nothing (Oladipo). Ariza looked good towards the end of the season, but to me he's been washed for a couple years now. The fact that the Heat expected him and Iggy to play legimate minutes was misguided.   Then, the Bucks got way better. Eric Bledsoe is addition by subtraction. Having a guy like Jrue Holiday who's legitimately a top 10 point guard helps a lot. You can count on Forbes, Tucker, and Portis. Divencenzo and Connaughton are better. They don't even need to rely on Giannis to put up big numbers offensively. Finally, this Bucks defense is just crazy.    Still, talent-wise, this Heat team shouldn't be getting beat like this. Jimmy Butler and Bam are all-stars/All-NBA players. They can't get one game? If you watch them, they're playing with no grit or energy. No one on the court seems to give a fuck. Jimmy isn't yelling. Herro looks like he's straight out of college or something. There's something more to this somewhere. I bet we'll find out after they get swept."
imagine swapping Eric Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday
To be fair Giannis has always been the hungriest dude on the court it’s just demoralizing when Eric Bledsoe missed open shot after shot and Khris being non aggressive didn’t help.
"Shout-out bucks GM Jon horst, dude flipped Eric bledsoe and George hill for mother fucking jrue holiday"
Bucks lost an Eric Bledsoe and gained a Jrue Holiday.   Heat lost Jae Crowder and traded Kelly Olynyk for a Victor Oladipo with paper legs.
George Hill and Eric Bledsoe were the difference from sweeping a team to losing 4-1 lol
Eric Bledsoe
He’s also crucially not Eric Bledsoe lol
It's truly amazing just how huge a difference there is between Eric Bledsoe and Jrue Holiday.  Bledsoe beating Jrue to an all-NBA defensive team last year will be one of those things in like 10 years people will use as the gold standard to trash how biased the media is against non-playoff teams.
Eric Bledsoe went from clearly the problem with a playoff team to clearly a problem for a non-playoff team
Eric Bledsoe was a good dude and all but man it’s night and day lol.
"They fucking had Eric Bledsoe lol, man is ass"
"Bledsoe is better than Kennard though. If there was a swap, the Clippers would have to give up assets. Although, can you imagine? The Clippers being so screwed that the only possible solution is to double-down with Eric Bledsoe."
Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe
I'm just starting to realize how truly detrimental Eric Bledsoe was to you guys.
"List of mini LeBrons: CP3, Russ, Eric Bledsoe"
"No, the biggest difference is having Jrue holiday instead of Eric Bledsoe"
Kennard with picks (2027+) could fetch them Eric Bledsoe. But that would be the equivalent of tripling down.
Eric Bledsoe could have been FMVP 😱
Nah if you remember Terry accidentaly said Drew instead of Eric and then they had that little passive agressive jabbing throughout the series. Like Terry came to the arena in a Drew Bledsoe jersey and we had Drew say something on the jumbotron before the game
"If the Clippers throw in draft capital, the Pelicans will be happy to give them Eric Bledsoe for Kennard."
As did Eric Bledsoe :/
&gt; five Kyrie Sized LeBrons?  why would I want 5 of Eric Bledsoe?
"Steven Adams was almost unusable defensively if he had to get out of the paint this year. He rebounded good but much like in years past, he floundered about a quarter of the year in.   Kira wasn’t good most nights, but he gave effort every time he was on the floor. But we’re not talking about Kira. The problem is that you had Josh hart and NAW who outplayed Bledsoe most of the year (hart outplayed him the entire year pre injury) yet Bledsoe consistently got the preferential treatment and SVG would go as far as to COMMEND Eric for his toughness and defense. Yet blast the rest of the team any chance he got. So nah man,...it ain’t just guys being coached too hard. There is absolutely more to it than that. You can’t scream one thing and then allow that same shit to go down for your vets just because they’re vets. He’s always been this guy and always will. He wasn’t the right coach whether he’s as bad a coach as he looked this year or not."
It’s just a different situation. Giannis had to be on ball so much last year because our pg was Eric Bledsoe. Khris Middleton could handle part of the load but he’s really not strong enough to run the offense all the time. Having Jrue Holiday instead of Bledsoe allows Giannis to spend even more time off ball and Middleton to shift to more of a scorer role than creator role.
"I think it has more to do with the way he used them. Not so much hun being a hard coach. By all accounts Ingram is a fan of the hard nosed coaching. But you have to think they didn’t like watching Josh Hart regularly outplay Bledsoe (and the team play much better with him) yet continue to see Eric start and get 30+ mpg a night. Oh hey also probably weren’t too happy about watching Zo stand in the corner waiting for an open look , especially with BI referring to him as a generational passer. Just my guess."
"Eric Bledsoe single handedly got Terry Rozier a 50+ million contract.   Not that he doesn’t deserve it, but I don’t know if he would have the recognition around the league to get paid like that if he hadn’t clowned Bledsoe in the playoffs."
Eric Bledsoe must've been a net negative.  He shot 38.8% FG and 25% 3pt in the playoffs last year.
Pels fans this summer:   Fuck off  Edit: to Eric Bledsoe lol
"Detroit was.     The Pel's is not ""shitty"" you are right, but they underachieved by 3-4 wins lets not act like this team was ready to win a playoff series. The best player is 20 and had played 25 games headed into this season. They are one of the worst 3pt shooting teams in the league. All their role players are either over the hill or rookies/sophomores. The team replaced Jrue Holiday with Eric Bledsoe, who had the worst year of his career. JJ redick went from 15ppg on 64 TS% to benched and traded for a second round pick and James Johnson (who was legitimately better for the pels than JJ was this year)."
"&gt;Can trace a fair bit of this back to ""All NBA"" defender they brought in Eric Bledsoe gave zero effort all year and that probably had a fair bit to do with setting the tone. That and the no 2 on the team Ingram's defense was a joke for alot of the year  Who would have thought that Bledsoe would ever be unengaged and give up on his team? I'm shocked."
"&gt; I know for a fact that in the locker room, there are typically guys whose opinions don’t matter one bit. Eric Bledsoe is the guy in this case  Aight then whose burner are you because apparently you know everything about the Pelicans locker room lmao"
"I do think that and I know for a fact that in the locker room, there are typically guys whose opinions don’t matter one bit. Eric Bledsoe is the guy in this case. Especially with his history in Phoenix."
"&gt;Okay then why base your coaching decisions on a guy who has shown that he doesn’t give a fuck about the future of this team?  No one is making *coaching decisions* based on Eric Bledsoe, I'm saying his blaise attitude can have an effect on the rest of the locker room and how the coaching staff is perceived. You said no one cares waht he thinks. If you think that, then that just makes me think you are a kid who has never been in a team locker room before"
&gt;I bet you a lot of Pelicans players gives a fuck about what Eric Bledsoe thinks.  Then that's not on Stan. That's on them for looking up to a literal shit player who only puts in effort on teams he thinks deserves him when he sucks
"If you win the title, you win a title.  No one calls the Raptors title fraudulent, and they had to ply the corpse of the Warriors and Eric Bledsoe."
Bucks don’t have a big 3 lmfao.   Jrue is terrible just like Eric Bledsoe.
Is Jrue Holiday really that big of an upgrade over Eric Bledsoe?
"Jrue with the Eric Bledsoe special. 5 points, 4 rebounds, 11 assists on 2/11 shooting"
"Looks like Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday is back tonight"
"Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe, and three 1st. Flock up Pels!!!"
"&gt;Putting Zion together with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe is not good lmao.  This sub fuckin acts like those guys are just immovable lmao  The Pelicans clearly didn't trade for Bledsoe, he was salary along with picks, unfortunately he played way worse than anyone could imagine so he couldn't be moved at the deadline."
Putting Zion together with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe is not good lmao. 2 subpar shooters and non shooting center. Then you have BI who probably wants to be the main guy instead of the robin.
And as I said with all Lakers hypothetical trades. FOR WHAT ASSETS? The extent of the movable Laker assets right now hovers somewhere between acquiring second round picks and Eric Bledsoe.
"Jrue fucking Holiday man  One game he's like Eric Bledsoe, and tonight he's like MJ"
Suns can’t win if booker plays like Eric bledsoe
I like this trade idea a lot.  Sacramento gets some defensive toughness and a versatile scorer.  NO gets the shooter it originally drafted and gives Zion and Ingram space to drive to basketball.  Det gets two top 10 picks to develop and another pick to add to its collection. But sadly they get Eric Bledsoe
yeah but then we'd have eric bledsoe on our team. how would we get rid of him
Why would Detroit do this? They have the #1 pick and can get Cade or Suggs. No need to trade for Eric fucking Bledsoe
"He has no playoff success as the best player on a playoff team. The next year, he choked in the 2nd round and got outplayed by George Hill and Eric Bledsoe, shot like 38% FG while being the ""best player"" on the Celtics"

"We also had Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic, and Isaiah Thomas on the same roster. Probably the greatest backcourt in NBA history"
"On behalf of Pels fans, I would like to say that we *fully appreciate* how painfully ineffective Eric Bledsoe is."
*Pelicans  We'll offer you one Eric Bledsoe.
"LeBron missed 1/3 of the season that year. Give him a full year with the current versions of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams and he's gonna make the playoffs."
i’ll raise you Steven Adams AND Eric Bledsoe. take it or leave it
"That's gotta be a two-way street. From my perspective, Zion seems like he wants to win more than the team does. There isn't really alignment on goals. Otherwise, it's hard to understand how they thought taking a team that didn't make the playoffs, removing Jrue Holiday/Derrick Favors and adding Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams was going to be a winning formula.  The team has more assets to use to build a better team but they seemed relatively content being a subpar team this year. Zion from his side seems pretty intent on winning. This is a guy who came back to play for Duke after a knee injury when he could have easily sat out and still been the #1 pick in the draft. Obviously he's far from a perfect player, but I'm not sure you could realistically ask more from him this past year."
I'm not trying to say Booker is as good as Kobe was or that he ever will be. But Booker never got to play with Shaq. It wasn't *just* Kobe doing all that.  Booker's best teammate before last year was probably Eric Bledsoe or a rookie DeAndre Ayton.
Me or Eric Bledsoe
"Uhhhh part of the fan base remembers that season fondly, but that shit set off some miserable years.   OP is right, the Suns were miserable. If your team thinks fucking Eric Bledsoe is a savior and acts accordingly, you’re deep in the water.   I will not entertain any “it really wasn’t all that bad” nonsense. It was a grim decade."
Lonzo Ball for Simmons.. Sign and trade. They take Eric Bledsoe and first round draft pic so he is off our books
"Pelicans, as long as you get a little bit more health than theyve been handed recently, and dont start Eric Bledsoe 71 games, I cant think of an easier job than getting a very talented team to the playoffs and looking like a genius (relative to Genry and SVG) for doing so"
"Yeah, because Zion isn't being used as a PG and is surrounded by fucking eric bledsoe and steven adams lmao   Use your brains."
"The Pelicans didnt have draft picks until 2019, so the same except maybe wed have different young guys on the bench that Eric Bledsoe absurdly starts over?"
"If Eric Bledsoe can get traded, so can Ben Simmons."
"This pretty much adds to what you say.   Two highest scorers on Devin Booker's teams (Besides Booker himself).  2016 - Eric Bledsoe (20.4 PPG and only played 31 games). Brandon Knight (19.6 PPG and only played 52 games).  2017 - Eric Bledsoe (21.1 PPG) and TJ Warren (14.4 PPG)  2018 - TJ Warren (19.6 PPG) and Josh Jackson (13.1 PPG).  2019 - TJ Warren (18 PPG) and Kelly Oubre (16.9 PPG).  2020 - Kelly Oubre (18.7 PPG) and Deandre Ayton (18.2 PPG)  Needless to say, Booker hasn't had a lot of offensive help besides Eric Bledsoe and TJ Warren. And if these guys are your primary scorers, I wouldn't like your chances of succeeding as much as I love TJ."
"Not without a replacement. Particularly since their first is unprotected to NOP next season. Fortunately, the Pelicans can offer one Eric Bledsoe for Kuzma and Gasol. I don’t even care if we give up some seconds."
Suns legend Eric Bledsoe died for this.  He doesn't want to be here.
"the only thing that keeps me outta the bucks sub for the most part is shitting on Bledsoe STILL.  it's like some kind of weird stalker-ex shit where they juss bring him up constantly like he's the worst to don the uniform 🙄  All eric did was put his best foot forward &amp; try to win as far as we know, defensive stud, can't hate anyone putting their all in anything."
Glad to hear that Eric Bledsoe redeemed himself by being traded
"Joe ""Eric Bledsoe"" Harris"
"I've also called Eric Bledsoe ""Jrue Bledsoe"" a couple times too. Jrue Bledsoe just rolls off the tongue."
Shit! I meant Eric Bledsoe! I corrected it.  Really? McQueen is somebody's middle name?
Jrue was so shit until 5 mins left of the 4th.   Big fucking shots to help the Bucks.   Eric Bledsoe could never
"I can't believe the Bucks were able to overcome Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holliday and Middleton combining for 14-49 (no, that's not a typo, they missed 35 shots).  On top of that, 2 of the worst inbounds plays I've ever seen to end regulation. Brook goes full JR Smith mode (even looks around wondering what happened LMAO), Giannis hits the side of the arena on the final play, my goodness.  But they were able to come up with plays when it mattered. Brook had some clutch rebounds/blocks, Jrue/Khris hit a couple big shots late in the game/OT.  Happy for the Bucks. They've been my team for the past ~3 years, but I jumped ship this year for the Suns. Hopefully cp3 can come back and they can meet in the finals; I'd love to see Suns vs Bucks for the chip."
Jrue holiday narrowly escaped an entire summer of Eric bledsoe memes
"Jrue Holiday played like Eric Bledsoe in the first 3 quarters  And then like Terance ""The Fucking"" Mann in the 4th"
Imagine doing what the Bucks did to get Jrue and for him to be Eric Bledsoe in game 7.
Jrue holiday is doing his best to keep the spirit of Eric bledsoe alive
HE IS NOT ERIC BLEDSOE BLESS
Bucks really traded the entire future of their franchise for Eric Bledsoe with dreads
Well Eric Bledsoe sucked worse than Holiday last playoffs so.....
"Well, he did replace Eric Bledsoe, so..."
Jrue Holiday somehow outdoing Eric Bledsoe must be some kind of sick joke by the Basketball Gods
Jrue Holiday has miraculously turned into Eric Bledsoe. Bledsoe has left a curse on this Bucks team.
"Fuck Jrue Holiday. I know, I know, he's a great guy and I'm just frustrated right now, but why is it always us? WHY?   Bucks had Bledsoe who was a HUUUUUUUGE FUCKING NET NEGATIVE the past 2 seasons.  They gave up their future for Holiday. AND HE IS JUST ANOTHER ERIC FUCKING BLEDSOE RIGHT NOW.   Cursed. The Bucks are cursed."
"If I squint, I can almost see Eric Bledsoe out there with a solid 2-17."
Jrue is not that guy. Eric Bledsoe is better.
Eric Bledsoe could be doing this for free
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday"
BRING BACK ERIC BLEDSOE
The Bucks didn't spend all that money on Holiday just for him to do his best Eric Bledsoe impression.
Traded Eric Bledsoe just to get him back in game 7 wtf is this
Basically the Heat's Eric Bledsoe.
The ghost of eric bledsoe haunts this bucks team.
Eric Bledsoe somewhere smiling
Jrue has been attacked by the Eric Bledsoe virus
Did Eric Bledsoe and Holiday swap bodies like Freaky Friday?
Eric Bledsoe sends his regards
Eric Bledsoe living on in Jrue 🥲
Eric Bledsoe is seething right now.
Jrue “literally Eric Bledsoe” Holiday
Get Eric Bledsoe out of there
"Eric Bledsoe: all defensive first team in 2018/19 btw  You just don't pay a career 53% TS guard that amount of money (for comparison, Bledsoe is 55.5% career TS)"
Eric Bledsoe sends his regards.
Well tbf all he had to do was not be Eric Bledsoe
Gave up all those draft picks for Eric Bledsoe in Jrue Holiday’s body.
Eric Bledsoe would never
Eric Bledsoe looking ass.
Jrue “Eric Bledsoe” “Not Even Ben Simmons” Holiday
Jrue Holiday forgot they traded Eric Bledsoe for him so now he's playing like him
Eric bledsoe is back
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday"
"for the low low price of 3 first round picks and a max contract, you too can acquire eric Bledsoe"
Is that Eric fucking Bledsoe out there? Jrue's performance today is some of the worst I've ever fucking seen
Eric Bledsoe would never hit the side of the backboard
When did Eric Bledsoe took over Jrue's body???
Jrue holiday playing worse than Eric Bledsoe and didn’t cost 3 FRP
Lmfaooooo Jrue really is just Eric Bledsoe in disguise
I thought the Bucks traded Eric Bledsoe.
Might as well bring back Eric Bledsoe if you’re scraping the back board from the corner
Jrue slowly turning into Eric Bledsoe rn
Jrue holiday is playing like Eric Bledsoe
Jrue Holiday is just a more expensive Eric Bledsoe. I’m not seeing a difference
Jrue Holiday 🤝 Eric Bledsoe
Holiday is shittier than Eric Bledsoe
When did the Bucks get rid of Jrue Holiday and bring back Eric Bledsoe?
Jrue Holiday has exposed himself as Eric Bledsoe 2.0 all series and I don’t want to hear any bullshit about how it’s somehow all on Bud that he can’t hit a shot.
I see no difference between Jrue Holiday and Eric Bledsoe. We mortgaged a whole lot for the same shitty performance come on man
Jrue “Eric Bledsoe” Holiday
Yeah Bledsoe was horrific this year. Jrue was an upgrade for simply not being Eric Bledsoe. The worse from Jrue would be amplified times 15 with bledsoe
He's turned into Eric Bledsoe like 70% of the time these playoffs. The Bledsoe curse is still there.
Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe who do you trust with a shot down the stretch to win the game down 1?
Yall slept on Eric Bledsoe tbh
Eric Bledsoe is the many faced god
Jrue Holiday with the ultimate homage to Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe smiling out there somewhere
He just Eric Bledsoe with HOF defense
Drew Bledsoe &gt; Jrue Bledsoe &gt; Eric Holiday
"Inconsistent as fuck team  Sometimes they run out Gary Payton, Kobe, and Shaq and other times its Eric Bledsoe and Dion Waiters"
Pat Connaughton is getting abused on defense.  Khris Middleton is doing his fan favorite houdini act  Jrue Holiday has become Eric Bledsoe.  Brook Lopez has reverted back into Brook Lopez after looking like prime Kareem in against the Hawks.  It's a damn shame.
"Jrue ""Eric Bledsoe"" Holiday and Khris ""That's Not the Celtics"" Middleton rear their ugly heads."
Maybe the Bucks could trade Jrue for Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe has been absolutely terrible this game
Bucks really traded for Holiday and gave him the bag just for him to turn into Eric Bledsoe.
Bucks gave up all those draft picks and a max extension for Jrue just for him to look like Eric Bledsoe out there
Wonder who Eric Bledsoe is cheering for this series
They’ve done both of those things with Eric Bledsoe and Giannis in 2019 lol you don’t need CP3 to just be that level
Eric Bledsoe  George Hill  2020 1st (via IND)  2024 right to swap  2025 1st unprotected  2026 right to swap  2027 1st unprotected  $169M extension
Not sure if I'm seeing Jrue Holiday or Eric Bledsoe out there
**Hot take**: Eric Bledsoe = Eric Bledsoe 2.0
He isn’t taking bad shots. He’s just shooting like Eric Bledsoe
everyone remember. the bucks gave jrue a 4-year 160 million dollar extension just to be eric bledsoe 2.0 in the playoffs lmaoo.
Khris “Batman” Middleton and Jrue “poor man’s Eric Bledsoe” Holiday carrying the Suns’ defense
"*Jrue Holiday rips off his mask at halftime*  IT WAS ME ALL ALONG EVERYBODY! I NEVER GOT TRADED TO NEW ORLEANS, ERIC BLEDSOE IS BACK BOYS!"
5 first round picks and 140 million dollar extension and you can get yourself eric Bledsoe 2.0.
Holliday is just Eric Bledsoe with extra steps
~~Eric Bledsoe~~ Jrue Holiday and Brick Middleton combining for 5/20 and it aint even halftime  I'd be pissed too
Jrue just eric bledsoe with HOF clamps
My Pelicans traded Eric Bledsoe for Eric Bledsoe and somehow got 2 firsts out of it!
I thought the Bucks traded Eric Bledsoe but I still see a PG charging into the paint and not being able to finish a thing near the rim
The Bucks traded Eric Bledsoe and gave up assets to get Eric Bledsoe
Why do I keep seeing Eric Bledsoe when I look at Teague lmao
"Eric Bledsoe was one of the worst defenders on our team last year, and our team sucked on defense last year. If last year is any indication of what is in his future, then he'll be out of the league before too soon."
"Eric Bledsoe is not a legitimate starting point guard in the NBA.  He isnt a defensive specialist and doesnt have the mental makeup to be a leader, be clutch or be a playoff performer."
I loved Eric Bledsoe when he was a sun and I respect what he did wanting to leave still he is one of my favorite players and it will probably not change
"Eric Bledsoe should be hogtied, dragged into the street, tarred, feathered, run out of town, and forced to repay the great, great citizens of New Orleans for the emotional damages they endured watching THIS bum on a nightly basis, and he should be EMBARRASSED for the pitiful display and lack of effort he trotted out with every game for the Pelicans."
You’re right if we had Eric Bledsoe we’d have a real package
"The bucks traded eric bledsoe and picks for jrue holiday. The blazers have cj, nurk, roco, etc which i’d say are more valuable than eric bledsoe"
"nah man, cj, nurkic, roco and a plethora of 1st round picks and recent draft picks couldn't possibly compete with eric bledsoe."
Last summer the Bucks got Jrue Holiday and the best player they gave up was Eric Bledsoe.
&gt;Mook really redeemed his value this season imo. One of the Clippers strengths is that they can go small and run 5-out spacing and he was a key piece in dismantling Utah in the playoffs.   Oh I agree but that type of strategy is redundant when you have KAT on your team lol.  &gt;I was originally on the idea of a Mook/Rubio trade but I actually think the Clippers would decline that now. A big piece of why I was originally for it was I felt that Ibaka could cover the spacing concerns but it looks like he may have some durability issues moving forward.   I think so too and being on a team with PG and Kawhi seems to have reined in some of his bad personality habits tbh.  &gt;My gag-worthy idea of LAC getting playmakers is swapping PatBev for Eric Bledsoe and signing Elfrid Payton to a vet min - bargain bin baby!  Bledsoe would probably work better for the LAC tbh. He's not the shooter Bev is but he's a much better defender and I think overall as a scorer he's a lot better. The issue is he crumbles in the playoffs.

"&gt;I can like and do whatever I want on my account. I’m not hurting nobody. I’m not harming nobody,  Try saying that to Earl Watson who was fired because of an Eric Bledsoe tweet"
"Eric Bledsoe. Given Griffin's prior moves, it makes sense for him to trade back from 10 for more picks while also dump Bledsoe's contract if there's not some veteran they can use those pieces for. Plus NAW presumably becomes the starter if Bledsoe is gone."
Eric Bledsoe was known for shooting a lot of bricks for the Bucks (especially in the playoffs). Jrue Holiday was traded for to replace Bledsoe and Jrue is also shooting bricks
"I don't think you get Chris Paul for Eric Bledsoe, George Hill and a single first round protected pick. Bledsoe is on a long, expensive contract and I don't think F.O's saw him as a positive asset; I don't know what the contracts were like for Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio but it looks like Thunder managed to get more picks out of them, whereas Pelicans are going to have to pay to offload Bledsoe.  The Harden trade changes the landscape of the East - Bucks got lucky with injuries to get through that round, but with that big three a four year window is much more appealing than a shorter one."
It's great knowing that Eric Bledsoe is sitting on his ass somewhere in Margaritaville watching the Suns and the Bucks in the finals.
bigger problem is Bucks traded away like 47 draft picks for a better Eric Bledsoe
"No, it hasn't. Book's solid at times on ball but usually when he's playing easy matchups for him.  He's terrible off ball, doesn't put in the effort consistently enough on ball (like a lotta offensive star guards in the NBA) and is overall a mediocre defender who gets hunted for a reason.  Credit to him for this game, but Jrue Holiday has turned into Eric Bledsoe half the time these playoffs, so I doubt it's all Book. Matchup tracking data is shaky anyways."
He has to be way more aggressive   This is like Eric Bledsoe 2.0
He obviously told Jrue holiday to play like Eric Bledsoe
Jrue “Eric Bledsoe” Holiday
I always thought Eric Bledsoe was a great football name.  Dude chose the wrong sport
"~~*""I do want to be there.""*~~  *""I am there!""* @Jrue_Holiday  -Eric Bledsoe"
3-12 is literally some Eric Bledsoe shit.
Eric Bledsoe has all the voodoo dolls out for Jrue Holiday. So far it’s been working.
Jrue looking like a bigger Eric Bledsoe rn  J'Eric 🤣
Someone needs to rip off jrue's mask scooby doo style and show that it's eric bledsoe the whole time
I wonder how depressed Eric Bledsoe is right now
"For a guy who's supposed to play like a ""not Eric Bledsoe and hustle"" kind of player, Jrue Bledsoe is really fucking passive."
Bucks really gave up 3 first round picks and a 4 year 160 M dollar contract to Eric Bledsoe 2.0
Fucked up that no one is giving Eric Bledsoe credit for building two winning cultures.
how bummed is eric bledsoe watching this
He cared about the atmosphere of the team...so he chose to keep Eric Bledsoe around? Weren't Pelicans fans saying he was playing like he didn't want to be there?
Eric Bledsoe
"Yeah was thinking about Brandon Ingram with this, word was it was the young Lakers whom SVG didnt always have the best relationship with. But BI just had absolutely no idea what he was doing as a help defender kept making the same mistakes and did exactly the type of things that would piss off SVG the most. Type of things SVG probably yelled at him for a million times and made his whipping boy, all that shit will screw up a relationship. By the time they started simplifying things it was probably too late.   I also think it was pretty obvious Eric Bledsoe came into last season deciding he wasnt gonna give a shit and when the veteran ""all NBA defender"" you bring in is doing that the ability to get buy in elsewhere erodes. Dont think it was lost on others that Bledsoe point shaving wasnt treated to the same standards as when young guys made mistakes."
That’s what I don’t understand as well. There are plenty of all defense guys that are offensive liabilities that have been traded in the past. Eric Bledsoe just the first one to come to mind
Montae Ellis - Agent Zero - Brandon Knight - Eric Bledsoe - Josh Smith - Lamarcus Aldridge
Eric Bledsoe. . .
I really hate how the Lakers simply cannot use the cap space he will free up. So it's either re-sign him or go out there with Caruso as starting PG and hope the buy out brings something valuable like George Hill or Eric Bledsoe or get the pieces together and hope you can pull off a valuable sign-and-trade.
"Doesn't take a genius to say that 4 guys standing still on the perimeter while Giannis Khris or fucking Eric Bledsoe tries to iso vs the heat was a bad offensive game plan. Also the drop defense got absoultey torched vs the heat and the raptors the year before and yet he stuck with it the whole series. We're switching much more on defense now, and when we do use the drop Lopez has been playing closer to the foul line to take away the midrange.   Another valid criticism of Bud is that Giannis and Khris weren't getting enough minutes and he shouldn't have been going with a 10 deep lineup. Now he's only playing 7-8 guys and has no problem letting our stars get big minutes. He's adjusted to the Giannis wall by putting him into more PnR action and now there's less possessions where Giannis is at the 3 point line trying to iso against a wall of defenders."
I’ve been screaming fuck Eric Bledsoe since way back in 09 when he tried to bang Patrick Patterson’s mom.
"No matter what, we can all agree. Fuck Eric Bledsoe."
Also chose Eric Bledsoe as their guy to keep out of that group and kept him for another 2 full seasons before realizing that was a mistake
"He’s right, and this is the case with a good amount of teams that have capable scorers below their best player. Everyone knew that Jrue is more than a capable scorer but his superiority to Eric Bledsoe in terms of defense and playmaking were the major selling points for this new bucks team. But with Jrue (and Middleton) being forced to step into the lead offensively will keep them engaged going into the Finals where they’ll have no choice but to be"
*Eric Bledsoe in shambles*
Is eric bledsoe the new pat bev?
Fuck Eric Bledsoe. All my homies hate Eric  Bledsoe
Trade away Eric Bledsoe then go to the Finals
The Pelicans get miles turner and trade Eric Bledsoe for Jrue Holiday they in the finals!
Eric “regular season” Bledsoe
The finals will be a battle of the Pelicans point guards and none of them are Eric Bledsoe
Glad that he made up for playing like Eric Bledsoe in the nets series. Hopefully he remains aggressive from now on.
[https://in.nba.com/news/nba-finals-2021-phoenix-suns-torrey-craig-nba-champion-regardless-of-the-result-milwaukee-bucks/1wv52f44zv4xr1jhajnouwthm9](https://in.nba.com/news/nba-finals-2021-phoenix-suns-torrey-craig-nba-champion-regardless-of-the-result-milwaukee-bucks/1wv52f44zv4xr1jhajnouwthm9)  Congrats to Torrey Craig. Now I feel real bad for Eric Bledsoe.
"The question is, which team will Eric Bledsoe supports..?"
Torrey Craig the opposite of Eric Bledsoe
The only reason both of these teams are in the Finals is because they got rid of Eric Bledsoe. There I said it.
"Hell yeah, and fuck Eric Bledsoe"
"Jrue's had his own cold stretches, still better than Eric ""permafrost"" Bledsoe"
The Eric Bledsoe finals
Eric Bledsoe definitely doesn't win. He wanted out of Phoenix and was traded to the Bucks. He didn't play to up to par and was traded out to New Orleans. LOL
Eric Bledsoe punching air right now lmao.   Good luck Milwaukee; I hope it’s a good series!
"Like you guys had Mike James, Isaiah Canaan, Tyler Ullis, Shaquille Harrison, Elfrid Payton, Eric ""I don't want to be here"" Bledsoe through the years."
"Ok but someone in that organization is responsible for trading for Steven Adams and Eric fucking Bledsoe and it isn’t Stan, no one was gonna make that work, penguin or not"
"So you would rather the young Pels squad play the 30 year old Eric Bledsoe with no long term future for the Pels all because of 1% TS% vs the 2nd year, 2019 1st rd pick Alexander-Walker who showed improvement from the 1st season?  Weird"
And Eric Bledsoe at the 2? Woof.
Don't disrespect Eric Bledsoe.
So great to hear the players say this not too long after the Eric Bledsoe tweet
Evan Fournier has a worse career playoff TS% than eric bledsoe... dont think that move is all that exciting
"yes lol, I don’t feel particularly bad about giving up a late first to get JV back for Adams and *eric bledsoe*"
Why couldnt Kyrie do it against Eric Bledsoe in 2019?
I'd still rather have Eric Bledsoe than Stanley Johnson. You couldn't pay me in cap space to take back Johnson.
"https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2020/3/28/21198092/have-phoenix-suns-fans-made-peace-eric-bledsoe  Wound up trading the other two away in 2015. Bledsoe would miss most pf a year due to injury, would be shut down while doing well a couple of years later, tweet ""i dont wanna be here"" and be traded"
"Remember when the suns had 3 point guards and ended up with none of them ? https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2303992-best-trade-packages-for-phoenix-suns-to-fix-point-guard-logjam  Goran, eric bledsoe and isaiah thomas.  Goran even said he wanted to re-sign with phoenix"
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
Firing Eric Bledsoe into the sun definitely makes us better. Hands down.
Not Eric Bledsoe?
I liked Bledsoe. I was really excited when we first got him. But Jrue is leagues better than Eric. Jrue has become my favorite player since we picked him up. Everyone was saying we overpayed for him too. Clearly not
I would do Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Clarke probably.
"Letting Lonzo go was probably a mistake. It's gonna be difficult to find replacement level talent on Zion's timeline that wants to come to NOLA. But honestly I'm excited for this season, the roster looks less clumsy and I won't have to watch eric bledsoe dribble the air out of the basketball for 30 mins a night. I think NAW and Hayes should both get big minutes. Also we DESPERATELY need to give Josh Hart his bag. That dude's huge for us"
Eric Bledsoe
"Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee)  How is that great?"
"You gotta offer him big money for him to turn down big money. It seemed like they were pretty willing to watch him leave. As for requesting a trade, that doesn't mean you have to make a bad one. Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee) are bad players and bad picks."
"Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee)  They got some bad picks and two bad players/contracts."
"No, because they would have kept Eric Bledsoe."
This sounds like us and Eric Bledsoe lol
"Brandon Ingram being a ball hog shot chucker, and Eric Bledsoe still being a good defender"
"I know we aren't big winners, but this dude literally says we lost the #10 pick (Zaire Williams) and then mentions that we lost two firsts...  Like we didn't fucking draft Trey Murphy!   Nope, just...lost that draft pick. Gone, nothing to show for it but a guy who shot 50/40/90 in college last year, who we probably would have drafted at #10 anyway. He's also got Fred Vinson coaching, the guy who made Lonzo into a good shooter. But yeah. OK man.   We added fucking shooters, which is what we needed, because Steven Adams and the wisp of Eric Bledsoe reaaaaalllllly didn't help with the spacing.   We've also still got a good bit of picks/swaps, one of which we get from an old ass Laker team 3-4 years from now. That might be in the middle of a rebuild, and I know too well that AD, while an incredible player, doesn't have the mentality, or structural integrity to be a the guy that elevates his teammates and leads them to deep playoff runs.  We got a really young ass core as it is, we can sacrifice some picks. Jaxson, NAW, and Zion all going into year 3. Kira going into year 2, and now Trey Murphy. I like all of them.   Though, unless Willie Green works a miracle, we are gonna fucking suuuuuuuck on D. Gonna drop like 130 a game though, so, at least should be fun. C+ so far."
Id pray wed be able to convince him to play for a year On a minimum then try to s&amp;t him for eric bledsoe
"Bro are you being serious? CJ had much higher value at the beginning of his big deal. Do you even remember what Philly gave away to get Buckets? Roco and Dario Saric! Jrue was flipped for Eric Bledsoe. You can be a blind Neil Oshay supporter if you want, but a better GM would of made better moves. Enjoy the next ten years of first rounds knockouts you putts."
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
He blew it in one of the biggest moments of his career so far when you do that people find out what your made of and don't want you anymore on a bloated contract.  The same shit happened to Eric Bledsoe.
Imagine if Eric Bledsoe “bet on himself” in 2019 instead of taking the extension in-season from the Bucks.  He would have screwed himself out of so much money.
"The best offer at the deadline was lauri Markkanen who was on an expiring and not someone we would resign. So we’d be sitting here right now with exactly nothing right now.   Also, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to force someone to play here for that amount of money and basically waste half a season. Trust me we’ve tried (eric Gordon, eric Bledsoe, AD’s last year) if a guy doesn’t want to be here it’s best to move on."
Whatever we just suffered through with Eric Bledsoe.
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Yes, but... They could have extended him at the start of the season. They could have made better moves than Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. They fucked up with JJ. They fucked up with Van Gundy. They didn't get value for Jrue. They should have made the playoffs.   If any of that had gone better they probay could have kept him. Even if he wasn't in their long term plans, they had a chance to buy low and sell high, but they passed.   When Zion walks, those mistakes are gonna hurt a lot more."
I mean...I know everyone one like to shit on Eric Bledsoe but he definitely took a huge step back tbis season
I know you didn't just call Eric bledsoe a superstar
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valančiūnas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
"The Raptors had three elite interior defenders in Gasol, Siakam, and Ibaka and left 24% 3PT shooter Eric Bledsoe and 22% 3PT shooter Nikola Mirotic open all series. Meanwhile, FVV couldn’t miss.  If you’re going to criticize Giannis’ playoff run this past season when in his *worst series* he averaged 32/13/4 I can only assume you’re a hater."
He was able to go off that much because he couldn't get walled out due to the role players actually being able to shoot instead of Eric Bledsoe  Also those Pelicans teams were really bad lmao
Watched the Pelicans all year long my guy lol. Why y’all continue to attribute all the problems to last year’s teams to Lonzo when Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams are in your starting line-up will never make sense to me. Graham is a worse Lonzo in every category except free throw percentage and pnr. But you got it lol. Y’all be easy.
I dont wanna be here- Eric Bledsoe
"No one is saying you guys didn’t get better, just switching your coach and replacing adams and Bledsoe with JV gets you a playoff spot in my eyes. It’s just acting like Turning Lonzo and a first which makes you unable of  using your other first therefore affecting trading abilities to get fucking graham who’s a back up pg on a none eastern conference team is such a head scratcher. It makes no sense to be scared of that Lonzo contract, his skill set makes him super tradeable if it all falls apart. Good defense, good playmaking, good three point shooting, good size, it’s a skill set that every single team in the league would want and he’s young and always works hard and gets better, comparing to Eric Gordon is so disingenuous."
Ball isn’t a point guard. He didn’t play point for the Pels last season. Graham is a massive upgrade over Eric Bledsoe. JV is an upgrade over Adams.   The Pels viewed Lonzo as a kinda wing. He’s a off-ball guy. I think they are right in thinking this. If you wanna talk about replacing ball I think Nickeil Alexander-Walker is more the replacement in mind for the team.
First employed by Eric Bledsoe.
"This is a chicken/egg thing.  Is LA attractive to free agents because it spends and then the free agents make the team better and then LA becomes a destination?  Or is it that LA attracts free agents which earns the team money and then allows it to spend on free agents?  Its been like 50 years since Dr. Buss moved the team here, so it doesn't matter which one it is.  But it always annoys me when these other markets cheap out on free agents, don't pay their own guys to stay competitive, or refuse to overpay for a marquee name in the rare instances where they would come to your team and THEN cry about how the Lakers or Heat are getting everyone.  PJ Tucker was an important piece to the Bucks' championship, they should have handed him a blank check and said ""write a number"" and paid it to stay good.  OKC traded Harden (while he wasn't the MVP he was now, if you know you're a small market then you overpay for potential) to save a little cash and look where that's gotten them.  Tillman Fritata cheaped out on Ariza to save some cash which pissed off Harden and was probably one reason why their coach, GM, and star player left.  There are loads of other examples over the years, and it usually has to do with money.  If a team doesn't spend, then I don't feel sorry for them when they can't get free agents.  You gotta commit to making your team attractive.  If its simply about the city and the weather, then Dallas and Houston would get more free agents than they would, Clippers would be rolling in players just like the Lakers, and the Knicks would be a perennial power house instead of being ditched by Durant who said the Knicks name is garbage and didn't give them a meeting.  I mean, look at what's going on in New Orleans right now.  A bunch of guys let go, almost a brand new roster, trying to remake the team with Bucks draft picks and scraps to surround your generational talent?  If they didn't have someone who's better than Lonzo already committed, then they should have signed him.  If they weren't going to rebuild, why the hell did they get Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?  You can't blame the Lakers and big markets for taking away free agents when you sign clearly bad ones to try and compete for the 9th seed, that's not our fault."
Yeah Blake was a top-10 ish player in the league until the last couple years. Eric Bledsoe peaked as a top-10 ish *point guard*
"Eric ""I Dont wanna be here"" Bledsoe"
Then they decided to be idiots and bring on Eric Bledsoe and Isaiah Thomas and had too many point guards and wound up getting rid of Dragic and I was depressed about it since I lived in AZ at the time and watched a lot of Suns games (including his epic 23-point 4th quarter explosion against the Spurs)
"Giannis duckies up his ankle in game 3 against the heat last year.  Where’s all the “if Giannis were healthy” the number 1 seeded bucks would have won the title?  Or, Eric Bledsoe had Covid and lost almost 20 pounds right before entering the bubble and playing like shit.  But there are no excuses for that, why? Because it’s part of the damn game and the heat outplayed the bucks and should be given credit for it.  The bucks have always been a team that people don’t trust and thus anything they earn they don’t deserve. Once they lost to the raptors 2 seasons ago the narrative against Giannis and the team has been obvious.  Look at the finals this year, 17 of 21 experts picked the suns to beat the bucks, most everyone said that suns had a better roster.  After it was all said and done, everyone now says “it was obvious the bucks had the better team yada yada yada”.  Unless you are a large market team,  you will never get respect in this league"
Eric Bledsoe is available for trade
Who would you rather have? Ben Simmons or Eric Bledsoe?
"At least Demps had a good plan with Jrue, Eric Gordon, Tyreke, Ryan Anderson and AD. They just all got injuries that in most cases hampered their careers and those 5 barely got to play together because at least one of em was always hurt. Griff’s plans are just flat out mediocre to begin with. Everybody and they momma could see that Adams and Bledsoe wasn’t the answers as soon as we acquired them. And if you look at the roster he’s built so far this year it doesn’t make much sense either"
Kevin Love. Eric Bledsoe. There aren’t many terrible contracts rn.
Eric bledsoe but with a nice height
6'9 Eric Bledsoe on offense
"Man you really buy into the “team targeting player” nonsense that’s built up by agents to increase their contract offers.  They had the cap space to sign Dinwiddie for way more than the wizards if they wanted to. You guys are also way overvaluing Lonzo. He’s a 3&amp;D player who thinks he’s Jason Kidd.  All said, currently they added Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte Graham, Tomas Satiransky and Garrett Temple while losing Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams.  May not be remarkable improvement but hard to say they’re not better. Adding JV and shedding Bledsoe is huge."
"I can already see the: ""Lakers have strong interest in Eric Bledsoe, a member of Klutch Sports Agency."""
Eric Bledsoe.
Do you think Devonte Graham is a worse player than Eric Bledsoe?
Last year's pairing with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe was mind boggling.
Giannis and Bud get you a top 3 seed no matter what lol. An Eric Bledsoe and Wesley Mathews backcourt was the best team in the league on pace to break records.
We'll offer you Eric Bledsoe and the Lakers 1st round pic next year. And that only MIGHT be worth it for us.
"Eric Bledsoe, Grayson Allen, Tyus Jones UTA 22, LAL 22, MEM 22 and GSW 24. Call it in :P"
The keys already were in Zion/BI's hands.  Lonzo didn't playmake for us that much last season. Neither did Eric Bledsoe lol.
That’ll never happen. Ppl still think we took Eric Bledsoe in that trade because we actually wanted him
"Our roster was certainly embarrassing. Tony Snell, thon maker, Jabari Parker, Jason terry, Eric Bledsoe. I like them all a lot as a bucks fan but none of them were great basketball players. And all of them coached by Joe Prunty."
Eric bledsoe is a bum
"1. Khris Middleton kills the Celtics constantly   2. Eric Bledsoe….yikes   3. For all that went right for Rozier, Morris, Horford, Tatum etc for this playoff run and getting to game 7 of the conference finals, it didn’t replicate the next season with a healthy Kyrie and Hayward back in the lineup"
"BTW, a key part of the Bucks' recent finals run was the first victim of the Process - Jrue Holiday was shipped out of town for the Nerlens Noel pick.  Note that he was on-sold by New Orleans to the Bucks for a decent pile of picks, plus the ghost of Eric Bledsoe ..."
"You're really trying to tell me dirk, kg, duncan were in their primes during 2013-2014?   Also bosh split time mostly playing center for the heat usually anyways   The position during that stretch was pretty weak statically and these guys had name value sans Tim Duncan in the playoffs mostly.   &gt; Steph and dray? Nothing. At least love managed to win 40 games with the worst roster I've ever seen since the 2006 Lakers.  The warriors are begging klay to comeback and love is a shit leader and the cavs has drafted pretty good but love hasnt held up on his end and barely even tries out there anymore. Also thats cool love lead a team to 40 wins the same year iirc the suns were above .500 with brandon knight and eric bledsoe but love even with talent probably leads you at best a 7th seed"
Considering most every player you mentions is a SG not a PG I don’t really agree with what you are trying to say. If the question is would I rather him play with any of those guys over Eric Bledsoe the answer is 200% yes
Eric Bledsoe
"The Hawks had issues blowing games late before McMillan too, and now look great. I think vet presence could help this team *a lot*.  Zion + BI can bring you 50ppg together but Eric Bledsoe/Lonzo would combine for either 0pts or 10pts."
"John wall, ty lawson, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Eric bledsoe."
"We were very close to being a playoff team last year, despite the record. Team just threw away a million late 4th leads stupidly because Eric Bledsoe is straight trash. It's impossible to tell how much better we got by moving on from that dude being a bum and SVG giving him all the minutes."
He has a career playoff ts% lower than Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe 2020 selection was worse pat was deserving
"Ayton and the Suns got ate up because no one in the league can guard Giannis IN SPACE one on one. That’s the big difference from this year and previous years. The Raptors and Heat were comfortable leaving Eric Bledsoe and helping on any Giannis drive. Additionally, this Finals Connaughton and Portis shooting the lights out were swing factors in the closing games.    Shooting percentage isn’t exactly equivalent to spacing. No matter how similar their percentages are Jrue Holiday and Eric Bledsoe will never be guarded the same. Middleton could be 1-13 but I don’t think any good defense would want to leave him open from 3."
"Lowry/Zion/BI/Jonas are a really nice fit, IMO. That's a lot of guys Lowry can get the ball to---but who also can go out and also create for themselves and others.  We also have some young playmakers who'd soak up knowledge from a vet PG.  These were kids who got LOTS of advice from Nicolo Melli and Eric Bledsoe last season. Kyle Lowry would be a great vet to ask questions too instead lol."
Tbf mini-Lebron *was* Eric Bledsoe so it depends on how you feel about him
"Eric Bledsoe is a weird one for me. It doesn't seem like they want to keep him, but we haven't heard anything about moving him beyond one person reporting he's not coming to Memphis."
"That's when you send the guy home, a la Suns Eric Bledsoe."
3 trades.  Lakers trade Schroder in each scenario.  Nuggets trade: Will Barton and PJ Rozier. Why- Nuggets get a sidekick pg to Murray.  Bulls trade: Thaddeus Young and Al Farouq Aminu. Why: Bring in a pg for that Bulls team.  Grizzlies trade: Eric Bledsoe and Jontay Porter. Why: provide Ja with another ball handler
Reminds me of Eric Bledsoe tweeting “I don’t wanna be here anymore” after a rough skid with the Suns and said he was tlaking about the hair salon he was at lmao
"thank you!!!!!  he was stuck behind Eric Bledsoe, isaiah thomas, and Kira Lewis Jr.   how is anybody supposed to get any opportunity with those guys soaking up all the minutes?   not to mention Zion and Ingram hogging the ball from Lonzo all game. 33 shot attempts and only 8 assists? i’m not a mathematician, but thats like 1 in 4, Lonzo would be way better   stan van is obviously just a hater. pels should get somebody at 17 to build around Lonzo and then buy a 2nd rounder to secure Gelo"
"&gt; Trading Jrue Holiday while team is trying to win now while taking back Eric Bledsoe  this was not the situation at all, but ok."
"""Jrue Holiday is only a slight upgrade over Eric Bledsoe, LOL when Giannis leaves next year and you don't have your picks."""
"Pat Bev, Eric Bledsoe"
did you miss eric bledsoe being traded?
Bruh did you just call Eric Bledsoe the best player on the Pels? I mean you gotta be trolling right?
"Right, Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe-level moves only 💯 💪🏼 🔥"
Felton with Drakes phone number   Melbourne Michael Carter Williams  Bertans with ten fingers  Eric Dreadsoe (can be used for both Bledsoe and Holiday)
"You can…https://twitter.com/ericpincus/status/1418340159318224902?s=21  “teams CAN S&amp;T more than one player together to aggregate salary. Example: New Orleans sent Zylan Cheatham (S&amp;T, Josh Gray (S&amp;T), Kenrich Williams (S&amp;T), Darius Miller (under contract at the time) to OKC for Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe”"
I swear if eric bledsoe plays well next season I will eat a brick of dirt. He was horrific
Lonzo Ball really isn't that much different from Eric Bledsoe.
"Grizz probably have a player they like in the draft. Also, they are clearly trying to build up vet role players around their young core. Adams is a better PnR player than Valanciunas, which probably helps Morant’s game. Eric Bledsoe is still a solid pg IMO. They also have the potential to be a great defensive team."
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
Eric Bledsoe will be bought out by the grizzlies and will sign with the lakers.
the absence of eric bledsoe is the equivalent of a star
You do see good players with confidence issues though. Ben Simmons is probably the most obvious one. Eric Bledsoe on the Bucks was a great regular season player who just absolutely imploded during the playoffs because he had confidence issues. I'm sure there are others but those were the two that immediately came to mind.
It’s debateable if the 2019 Raptors even beat the 2021 Bucks much less smoke them lol  Jrue Holiday is a night and day upgrade over Eric Bledsoe
Go back 3 years and swap Eric Bledsoe
"[Eric Bledsoe, who New Orleans included in a trade package, is not expected to stay in Memphis, league sources tell  @YahooSports](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1419769446499971074?s=21)"
"He was the problem - when you sign a deal like he did you expect him to start shooting 3s and play better defense.  He did neither.  He was the problem.  That's why the Raptors won without him, he was the problem.  Derozan is like Eric Bledsoe - you get rid of him and you win !"
Eric Bledsoe was literally the worst starting guard in the league last season. Pels desperately needed to get rid of him and his ridiculous salary. Jonas is an upgrade from Adams.
"Eric Gordon is probably the only ex Pel it worked out less with than Eric Bledsoe, but I think you meant the latter Eric in this context."
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
I’m assuming as a pelicans fan you’ve seen plenty of Lonzo. It looked like it could work but tbh anywhere Eric Bledsoe is it ain’t gonna work. Going to the bulls I’d say lonzo is in a way better situation. Now the pelicans can hopefully tie down Zion and get him serious help.
"Honestly, the only real dumb move the Pels tried was the supposedly 4/88M contract they offered THJ. I love him, but the price we paid to him is the ceiling of a fair deal. Other than that, Graham and Sato are OK as PG replacements (on this line, we have some 2nds hanging around if y'all want to trade Sato), Hart is on a good contract, Valanciunas is miles better than Adams and getting rid of Eric 'IDGAF' Bledsoe is a good thing."
"What ""increasingly bad Jrue trade""? The Pelicans still retain two unprotected firsts and two pick swaps from that trade, and just turned Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams into Jonas Valaciunas.  All for *one season* of Jrue Holiday – after Holiday asked for a trade specifically to a contender (so Griffin more or less had to trade Jrue, and only to a relatively small number of teams).  Under the circumstances, that trade was, and remains awesome for the Pelicans."
"You're saying ""Griffin got played"" about an awesome trade that has overjoyed every Pelicans fan. The Pels dumped both Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams for Jonas Valanciunas, who is better than either and cheaper than both. The Pels also traded down in the draft – but ended up picking a guy at 17 (Trey Murphy) who should have gone in the top five.  So, in other words, of the three established players and two rookies exchanged in that trade, the Pelicans got the best player (Valanciunas) and also the best rookie (Murphy) – both on cheaper contracts.  If that's ""getting played,"" sign me up for more."
Congrats on getting someone who managed to be better than Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. Quite the achievement.
"Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams were clear attempts at trying to win now. Going after Kyle Lowry was another win now move. Griffin clearly wants this team in the playoffs, which is fine, but these types of moves are not going to get the team closer to a championship ceiling. He’s playing checkers, not chess."
Isn’t Paul’s whole negotiating strategy “max contract or nothing”?  I remember him trying this with 0 time All-Star Eric Bledsoe and it didn’t work
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"And JR, and looking back now also Ben Simmons, and Eric Bledsoe. Noel may have gotten shafted by Paul but that doesn't invalidate all the guys he has gotten paid, whether they deserved their contract or not."
"Honestly even tho I get it bc sure we’ve made some mistakes, the wildest part of this actually being a convo is last year was legit zion and BI’s first year playing together  Also s/o national media for shitting on us for not making the play in/playoffs while also claiming Eric Bledsoe is a good nba player. Was by far one of our worst players overall"
"Eric Bledsoe a role player makes 18 million dollars a year, Gary Trent jr just got paid as well l. I can make a list of role players by Klutch that got paid ad well. Lonzo a role player is also making 20m a year now lol"
Can somebody ask Eric Bledsoe to confirm
Eric Bledsoe has talked openly about how he gets crippling anxiety in big games
"I wish the Pacers would trade some front court talent for Kings PG talent. I feel like any of the Kings guards could potentially be an upgrade for the Pacers. The Kings remind of the Suns team that had Goran Dragic, Eric Bledsoe and Isaiah Thomas. It’s just too many dudes back there."
Eric Bledsoe was pretty frustrating to watch on offense. He’d take low iq shots and often would feign contact on drives to the rim. He wouldn’t get the call and just kinda toss the ball towards the rim.
"eric bledsoe. he's literally so stiff it's not even funny. no layup package, no dribble package, and for some reason he has no sense of balance whatsoever . he was the **complete** opposite of what we saw from jrue. not to mention his shooting form is so stiff too it's just like zions but zions at least good at other things when he struggles with shooting"
"zion: ""hey, griff. i think we need spacing?"" griff: ""how about steven adams and eric bledsoe?""  zion: ""we disagree."""
Damn that means murray is better than players like Zion and Lavine😲. Players like Lou Will and Eric Bledsoe are too cause apparently playoff stats are the only things that matter
"&gt; Memphis who have log jams at the guard position, they even practically gave away Grayson Allen.  Because of course someone like Grayson Allen is worth a lotto pick. Trades are possible but wasting your top assets for someone like Eric Bledsoe is just dumb.   &gt; Nope. Kuminga is extremely raw, Wiseman had one of the if not the worst rookie season ever for someone playing the minutes he was and Wiggins is extremely overrated.  If you actually watched around the NBA you’d know Kuminga is not as raw as advertised. He has already shown great IQ. Needs refinement but this isn’t some full time project. Apparently you’re not patient with young players so I pray for Scottie Barnes cuz you’ll be calling him a bust after 1 month. Bigs normally suck year 1. That’s just how it goes. Now this big was thrown into the fire for a team with a difficult scheme trying to make the playoffs and he didn’t have a training camp. He’ll be fine but yeah he is raw, it will take 1 to 2 seasons but he’ll be a good to great player. Wiggins is underrated not overrated. He played nothing like his Minny years, he was efficient and a great defender. Is he worth 30 mil? No. But he is worth 20-24."
"Mo Williams, Eric Bledsoe, Caron Butler, Chris Bosh, Joakim Noah."

Eric Bledsoe
"This is just a ridiculous argument. I've watched every minute of Clippers basketball so far this season. If I tell you that Eric Bledsoe has actually been performing really well, are you going to assume that I must be correct because I've watched him play or are you going to assume that I must be completely biased because one look at Eric Bledsoe's stats tells you a completely different story?"
Eric bledsoe so bad mang
I admit I clowned on Watson when he got fired after losing by 40 three games in a row to start the season and started the whole Eric Bledsoe saga. My perception of him did a 180 in the last few hours
"damn who knew Eric Bledsoe was speaking out against racism, what a hero"
"I’m not sure fully but in addition to that, Sarver apparently told Watson he needed to fire Rich Paul because of the Eric Bledsoe extension or something with that and Watson said no because Klutch was his agency when he signed on initially as an interim then when he got promoted to head coach klutch did the paperwork. So he refused to fire klutch, so apparently Sarver fired him for that as well"
"Eric Bledsoe: ""I don't wanna be here"""
"I’m comparing the MVPs team to Hardens. The Bucks team was much better as a roster.   The Rockets had 0 depth, CP3 who playing with those numbers was literally worse then Eric Bledsoe.   And Gordon’s shooting splits were literally bad for his position.   That Rockets team without Harden finish lottery. That Bucks team without Giannis make the playoffs"
"2020 Giannis is soooo underrated, he was scoring at almost the same rate as 2019 Harden, while playing DPOY defence and diming up the team, and on pace for high 60s wins, and did all of this with an Eric Bledsoe wes Matthews back court. I guess it wasn't a full season which hurts but he was insane."
"""i don't wanna be here""......in the barbershop Lmao Eric bledsoe really tried to cover that up with this sorry excuse hahaa"
this up there with the funniest player lies i don’t want to be here no more I was at the hair salon Eric Bledsoe lie
"My man, Eric Bledsoe is not some amazing point guard. He's a great defender and is good at attacking the basket, but is a below average playmaker for his position which is what you seem most concerned with.  Also, Lavine has had a combination of Cam Payne, Kris Dunn, Coby White, and Ryan Arcidiacano as the PG during his time in Chicago. None of those guys are great (or even good) ""floor general"" point guards either.  Having those below average PGs did not hurt Lavine and Booker's early development. TBH, it doesn't seem like you know what you're talking about....  And Chicago and Phoenix resolved their PG situation later down the line after their first developmental options didn't work out. That's great. We can do the exact same thing if KPJ doesn't work out. Trying out the other options first though DID NOT hurt Booker and Lavine's development. Just like trying to develop KPJ will not hurt Green's development.  Bottom line is that it's too early to give up on a promising young player in KPJ. He is not going to hurt Green's development."
I would pull an Eric Bledsoe “I was at the barbershop” but actually true for the most mundane situations all the time lol. Like “people change” when some retail worker who was nice to me a week ago wasn’t nice to me today or “nothing will ever be the same” when I boil pasta for slightly too long. It sounds so fun lmao
The cover up is always much worse.  Could've just said he fat fingered it on Twitter and people would've dismissed it.  Now that he's saying it's a hack (total BS) it gives off Eric Bledsoe vibes.
"Clippers aren't, it's Paul George 1v7 (5 opponents plus Reggie Jackson and Eric Bledsoe)"
"I did, but Kyrie still averaged like 30 against Jrue, he was nothing in that series. His offensive struggles didn't help either.  I love him but he was basically a worse Eric Bledsoe, who is already pretty bad"
"$19.4M cap figure, $3.9M guaranteed [per Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/eric-bledsoe-6900/)  the team that trades for him could clear $15.5M of salary off of their book just like that."
"hey brad, we hear you need a playmaker. we have just the man for you, 1st team all-defense point guard Eric Bledsoe. all we want is Marcus Smart, and you'll get to solve your locker room issues too. two birds with one stone, right? give me a call"
"&gt;The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to trade Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, their 10th and 40th picks in the 2021 NBA Draft and the Lakers 2022 first round pick (top-10 protected) to the Grizzlies for Jonas Valanciunas and Memphis' 17th and 51st picks in the 2021 NBA Draft.  From an article about the trade. Grizz flipped Bledsoe to the Clippers after"
"Lemm represent to you 11 years vet, Eric Bledsoe."
"23.5 from downtown isn't great - I'm not saying he'll bust by any means, his physical gifts are there and his feel for the game is above average at the least. The Eric Bledsoe comps are definitely seeming a little more real every game, but Bledsoe at his prime was a beast even if he was never a top-tier player. If that's his worst comp that's not a bad floor."
Can I interest you in Eric Bledsoe?
&gt; nobody expected bledsoe to just give up  He wasn't our first Eric Gordon.
"Well, the JV move was a good trade.  He’s able to somewhat space the floor and it’s an upgrade over Adams.  The problem I have is letting go of Lonzo and trading Jrue for Eric Bledsoe…"
"I’m so sorry. I wouldn’t wish Eric Bledsoe on my worst enemy, but I guess someone had to have him"
Those are Eric Bledsoe numbers
That’s an Eric Bledsoe stat line if I ever saw one.
Marcus Smart for Eric Bledsoe?
Eric Bledsoe since the opener:  10/40 on field goals  2/16 on 3 pointers  18 turnovers to just 17 assists
"I advocate for a tanking team to put together an all goofball team and see how they do.  My contribution to the starting lineup is Kelly Oubre, Andre Drummond, and Eric Bledsoe."
eric bledsoe.
Never seen a worse nba player than Eric Bledsoe holy shit
"eric bledsoe, attrocious player. i was in right side in history as always when he was preferred over malcom brogdon lmao"
Eric Bledsoe gonna be benched sooner rather than later
"also + Pat Bev, - Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe is so bad
"not even a clippers hater, watching eric bledsoe participate in basketball activities makes me angry"
bro you got Eric Bledsoe on ur team pipe down
A lot of Celtics ones have already been said so I'm jsut gonna mention Rozier calling Eric Bledsoe Drew Bledsoe that prompts Drew Bledsoe to attempt a playoff game then destroying Eric Bledsoe the whole series
"1. Harden trade, nuff said. (I’d like to see the alternate universe where it’s OKC and ORL built around picks and JJ Redick who would’ve been great on those OKC teams, and the cascading effect on ORL/HOU/Lob City LAC without Redick)  2. Rescinding the Tyson Chandler trade - I put the Harden trade first as a hat-tip to consensus, but this one kills me worse.  3. Jeff Green over Joakim Noah. I’m not a fan of Noah really but he would have been a great C for those OKC teams and it prevents the Perk trade.  4. Draft misses - Byron Mullens, Cole Aldrich, Cam Payne, Mitch McGary, Josh Heustis, TFerg (over Anunoby ugh), trading Eric Bledsoe instead of just keeping him, Perry Jones  5. Promising Giannis to bring him over immediately instead of asking to stash him a year, and then taking him over Adams and Gobert over Roberson  6. Re-signing Kevin Martin instead of letting him walk, and moving on sooner from Jeremy Lamb and PJIII  7. The Perk trade"
Not a contender this year but the clippers will give you one expiring Eric Bledsoe and a couple second-round picks for him
Eric Bledsoe.
"Read my comment again. Sexton fits well next to Rubio and plays well/better next to Rubio versus SexLand. Sexton plays and looks BETTER with Rubio versus Sexton with Garland. Not Garland and Rubio.  I think Garland's potential is overhyped and overrated. This seems like the same hype people had for Kyrie but Kyrie was a better rookie. I don't think any Garland led team will ever make it deep in the playoffs.  I could say the same about build around Garland. Garland looks worse in our offense than Ricky Rubio who has been traded or let walk by his last four teams. Our other promising young players look much better next to Rubio than Garland but that's ignored.  Unless Garland makes a giant leap this season, I don't foresee him being our PG of the future. He'll be an Eric Bledsoe, Goran Dragic(with a better start to their career) type who could be a part of a championship team but not be the reason they ever got there."
The Clippers are literally what every logical person thought they'd be this year: a one man show. I don't understand anyone who is surprised they aren't as good without Kawhi and especially with Eric fucking Bledsoe as their starting SG.
He’s not but neither is Reggie Jackson yet u had no problem making that comparison. The point I’m making is neither team has a real dependable pg. You literally bitch and complain about team construction and then try to hype up Eric Bledsoe. You wanna swap Seth curry for bledsoe so you can have a “true pg”? You’re gassing up random clippers scrubs to make it seem like embiid is doing some hard carry job. Just give it a rest and accept you got called out on some bs.
"As a biased Thunder fan, the difference is guys like Reggie Jackson have a whole career to show they aren’t a star. Eric Bledsoe was bad all of last year. Luke Kennard was getting DNPs last year. These guys have career history that does not match up with last years playoffs"
"Eric Bledsoe, since shooting 10/16 in the opener, has shot 8/32 in the next four games.  He brings a lot to the defense but offensively he's been terrible.  He's gotta get benched after this game."
Oh wow fans want their rebuilding team to play the guys on rookie contracts more than Eric Fucking Bledsoe?
"Eric Bledsoe might be the rare exception, but he goes through peaks and valleys performance wise"
"As you mentioned, Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum may be gone and if that's the case then they're kind of fucked (more with the Batum thing - I don't think there's another bargain-bin wing available that can replace his production).   I'd love to see Rubio on the team but he's slightly overpaid enough to the point where it's hard for the Clippers to salary match unless the Wolves want Luke Kennard or something (maybe there's a 3-team trade somewhere).  I still kind of think they should go with a budget playmaker. If they can't retain Reggie Jackson, I literally think they should go for a PatBev/Eric Bledsoe swap and sign Elfrid Payton to a vet min. The issue with both of those guys though is that it kills their 5-out spacing when they go small (but hell they might already lose that if Reggie and Batum walk)."
Same lol like people don’t understand he had Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams spacing the floor and still destroyed everyone on insane efficiency. His athleticism and skill are nuts.
"Yes, mcdonough set yall up to tank by trading several pieces for picks including dragic, Isaiah Thomas, eric Bledsoe. Alienating young players, the Morris twins...  You can't say we didn't tank we were just bad, that is tanking. The suns depleted theie roster, added draft assets, and hired player development coaches in Igor and Watson. The only thing yall didn't have was financial flexibility because mcidiot sunk money into brandon knight and Tyson chandler trying to win after that 2014 playoff birth.  Again, be glad Sarver woke up and cleaned house."
"Maple Jordan( Andrew Wiggins)  Cp3-6 Weeks  Pandemic P, Pg13%  Fidget Spinner/Beyblade (Siakam)  Russell Westbrick   Demar Defrozen   Stephanie Curry (Steph)  Keisha Durant, Snake (Kd)  LeGm, LeMickey (Bron)  Drew Bledsoe (Eric Bledsoe)  Saboner (Sabonis)  All that comes to mind atm   Donkey (Draymond)  Pfizer P (Porzingis)"

Eric Bledsoe
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."

"Eric Bledsoe is a negative asset, those picks are all 25-30 and if it made Giannis re sign anything was worth it"
The Bucks were able to get a guy like Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe. There are deals to be made if the GM wasn't such a hack.
The Heat are trying to win now and they need shooting. Why would they want to trade a proven elite shooter that fits their culture and has a good personality for a chance that they hit on a draft pick plus getting someone like Eric Bledsoe who can't shoot and has 2 years and $40 million remaining on his contract?
"He should’ve known we couldn’t do the Bucks scheme with a washed Eric Bledsoe who was one of the worst defenders in the league, Steven Adams who moves like a snail and blocks under 1 shot per game, and forwards who are still learning on defense. And that scheme only works for the Bucks because they have a 6’11 DPOY at PF, a C who is a great shot blocker, and all defense level guards and wings.  And BI has the length to be a great defender, or maybe I should’ve used the word good. I think if he actually put effort into defense consistently he could get to around Mikal Bridges levels in his prime."
"He would’ve quickly become a starter the season before CP3 arrived, but yeah maybe he needed someone like Granger to learn the game. That team would’ve been: Baron Davis / Bledsoe / Mo Williams Eric Gordon / Rasual Butler (RIP) PG / Ryan Gomes Blake Griffin / Craig Smith Kaman / DJ"
Eric Bledsoe is just a hard foul
"I disagree. I think Giannis is mostly protected from his shortcomings. We always talked about everyone else when the Bucks lose (Middleton, Bud, in the past, Eric Bledsoe).  Giannis is just a likeable dude so people fine it hard to hate on him."
"I've asked like 5 bucks fans for a link to this and they always ignore me. So do you have a link to bucks players saying he was the worst? Here are some quotes I found searching.     Eric Bledsoe:    “I’m shocked man, I mean, J Kidd was a No. 1 mentor to me since I’ve been here. To see he got fired … it’s crazy. Yeah, I am kind of shocked by it. I am. I thought he did a great job. But you know, it’s a business. You can’t control it.”     Henson:  ""I don't think anyone saw it coming,” said Henson. “It hurts because this is the longest I've ever had a coach. I hope the best for him.""      Maker:   “I didn’t know what to make of it. It’s tough. I hear a lot of people saying, ‘It’s the business.’ But … a crazy business.”  Giannis:  He’s a big part of my success in the league"" ""I love him as a person. I care about him as a person.”   Yeah man sounds like they despised him"
"Every fanbase trying to conjure up some trade wherein they end up with Lillard is my favourite part of this offseason, and the offseason hasn't even fully started yet. The funny thing is that obviously almost everyone, if not everyone is gonna be wrong. ""Eric Bledsoe + 2021frp for Lillard"""
"May I offer you an Eric Bledsoe for Kuzma, Gasol, and a first so you guys don't have Schroeder holding you guys hostage? Schroeder's going to get overpaid just to get him off the Lakers."
"Everyone keeps flaming the Steven Adams move without looking at the fact that he’s actually a useable player. It’s the contract extension and giving up a pick to get him that made it a bad move, he’s not a bad player.   Eric Bledsoe is the one that’s actually worthless on the court."
"Fan vote is for the starters. The coaches and media aren't picking him for reserves either. I've never seen an article talking about how CJ McCollum was an all star snub.   You're correct , it is my opinion at the end of the day. Do you really think late career Kobe was a top 10 defender when he's making those teams?  I really don't think Marcus Smart , Klay Thompson, and Eric Bledsoe are top 10 defenders either. As well, you're discounting that all defence is a regular season award. That raptors team was built for the highest levels of playoff defence which is almost a completely different game. E.g. DPOY Gobert is not holding up in that series."
"Bledsoe is owed $22M between this season and the next. He is a serviceable backup point guard at this point in his career. Eric Gordon is owed $38M between this season and the next. Considering he hasn't been healthy for two seasons and is a shooting guard who has put up poor shooting numbers in these two seasons, I'd say he is also a bench player at this point. Looks like a win for HOU if they get this deal."
Pretty difficult for Zion to develop when he plays most of his minutes with Eric Bledsoe and Steven adams. Reminds me a lot of giannis when the bucks always played a slow center and a questionable point guard.
Neither team necessarily wins but the pels clearly like Jonas and STRONGLY dislike Eric Bledsoe. I think both teams benefit and move the direction they want to move. NOLA gets the best player but they didn’t get him for free.
Jeff Teague and Eric Bledsoe scraping for the vet minimum now.
Guys that can actually defend  If Zion can average 27 points playing next to Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe then spacing shouldn’t be their priority over actually being able to defend properly
As long as Eric bledsoe doesn’t come to my Sixers I don’t care
"Both teams got better, NO for getting rid of Eric Bledsoe. Memphis for not having Eric Bledsoe."
"""Eric Bledsoe has been traded to the OKC Thunder along with 2 first round picks"""
Helps to have Giannis and Middleton instead of Ben Simmons but yea  I do applaud the Jrue Holiday move. Despite public perception at first I thought it was a great upgrade from Eric Bledsoe and I was proven right
"He's not our problem anymore... You can free yourself from the Eric Bledsoe nightmares now, friend."
If I'm Eric Bledsoe im embarrassed as fuck a team dropped down in draft to trade me
"Again. This is Eric Bledsoe. Same guy who’s calling card is him saying “I don’t want to be here”. Like, he’s the poster boy for this. I’m the confused nick young gif rn."
"but wait, how will this work with zion?  i got a feeling that new orleans are looking to trade jonas valancinus.  quite possibly for a two-way shooting guard, because that's what the need.     i also see memphis trading eric bledsoe for danny green, since the 76ers are one of the teams ""eyeing"" eric bledsoe."
"""I'm coming home... to Milwaukee!!!!""  --- Eric Bledsoe"
Eric Bledsoe
Grizzlies legend Eric Bledsoe
"Eric Gordon went super public, begged the team to not match an RFA offer sheet, and then wouldn't rehab injuries properly. Bledsoe was just apathetic a lot. I'd deal with Bledsoe for 10 years before I'd deal with Gordon for 5."
"Wow, NOLA actually got rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams! And they just had to trade the 10th and a potential mid to late Lakers FRP? Also, they got Jonas and the the 17 FRP? What the fuck lol"
Eric Bledsoe goodbye tour
"Feels like a weird trade for the Grizzlies. I am super not a fan of Eric Bledsoe, so for a team that presumably wants to make the playoffs again, this feels counterproductive."
Also not having Eric Bledsoe is an upgrade
"I don't think Bledsoe is a drama queen, actually. He just gets unmotivated. Eric Gordon was a drama queen. Anthony Davis was a drama queen. When Eric Bledsoe had a good game, he was locked in and played like the Bledsoe we expected. That doesn't scream ""drama queen""."
I too thought ‘how bad can Eric Bledsoe be?’  I don’t wish this evil on anyone but I’m glad he’s gone
Grizzlies lost the trade the moment they got Eric Bledsoe
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"DAMN lmao, they had to get rid of Eric Bledsoe that badly? 💀"
You forgot the point god Eric Bledsoe
Maybe hire a coach who won’t play Eric Bledsoe 30 minutes per game?  That seems like a good start
"&gt;can someone explain the reasoning why they let holiday go?  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, 2 first round picks, and 2 pick swaps.  There's your answer. It's the same reason the Thunder traded Paul George even though he's really good."
The fact that this team was designed for Zion to share the floor with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams is a sin against basketball.
"Because I'm someone who has watched what it takes to build a championship team, and that is not a team that is paying a Max to each of Simmons and Harris.  Seriously, look at what it cost Milwaukee to get rid of Eric Bledsoe.  Then consider what Philly wants - a floor general and shooting - is also what a bunch of other teams want.  Or run it back and watch Embiid decline his extension.  That works too."
Eric bledsoe and steven adams with Zion....What a shitty gm...looks like sabatoge !!!
"It sounds like you’d be swapping liabilities? I’d need more context on that. But in general, I wouldn’t want CJ McCollum. He isn’t worth $100 mil over the next 3 years, especially the last 2.   NBA teams will do whatever they want, but I would be surprised if teams give up assets to get him. I believe it’s significantly more likely that teams either swap negatives (i.e. KP or Simmons for CJ) or it’s CJ + picks for an upgrade (i.e. Eric Bledsoe + picks for Holiday).   Doesn’t mean it won’t happen. As I said, NBA teams do whatever they want. But I personally wouldn’t be interested in giving up trade chips to bring in CJ. At that point just try and go all in for Dame."
Eric Bledsoe and Jaxon Hayes or something like that.
Worth it to get Eric Bledsoe the fuck out
Idk I was told repeatedly for the last few months that when his shot isn’t dropping he’s absolute trash and basically worse than Eric Bledsoe with one arm   All he got was a measly NBA title smdh man
Eric bledsoe.
"&gt;Ben is likely going to be tiers better than anyone drafted at that spot.   We are having separate conversations then cz mine is the 4th pick has more value than Ben Simmons right now. Do you disagree with that?  Edit: here is the Kyrie no4 pick stuff i was talking about  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/03/kyrie-irving-lebron-james-cavaliers-suns-trade-talks   ""In mid-June, shortly before Griffin left, team and league sources confirm, the Cavs explored a three-way deal with Phoenix and Indiana that would have shipped Irving and Frye to the Suns and brought Eric Bledsoe and Paul George to Cleveland. The Suns resisted, unwilling to part with their No. 4 pick, which they planned to use to draft Josh Jackson."""
"The only ""stat"" he provided was a hyperbole on the 25% on layups, and he quite literally said jrue holiday is not a reliable shooter. If jrue holiday was not a reliable shooter, like eric bledsoe then they never would have had made it out the ECF because that allows defenses to just  clog the paint and make life harder for Middleton and Giannis. But because jrue holiday is a reliable shooter when open, they cannot. Hence me saying that jrue holiday is a reliable shooter. If he said jrue holiday wasnt a reliable &amp; consistent scorer than id agree because he wasnt finishing a lot of good looks that he normally does in the regular season"
"Dont let social media make you think jrue holiday was a bum lol. Eric Bledsoe would miss wide open corner 3s but holiday makes them consistently enough that teams have to respect it, and always have a man on him"
"He basically is Eric Bledsoe, if Eric Bledsoe was possessed by the ghost of Gary Payton"
People really compared him to Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe is pretty jacked for his size.
Have a think about how much it cost Milwaukee to get rid of Eric Bledsoe.  And - if you want to win a championship - neither Ben Simmons nor Eric Bledsoe can be on your team.
Eric Bledsoe is a thicc muscular boi
"The Bucks were absolutely not ""on track"" to win it all last season, that team had serious problems with depth, Eric Bledsoe, and coaching. Before the end of the normal regular season, the Bucks went on a huge losing skid, and never recovered.     The Lakers, on the other hand, were 24-3 at one point, and had the #1 seed all but locked up before the bubble. They were on a mission and cruised to the Finals."
Pelicans could have had Myles Turner and George Hill on cheaper deals around Zion and consciously chose Steven Adam’s and Eric Bledsoe on worse contracts and shooting
"I'd probably swap out Evan Turner for Avery Bradley for this squad.  Edit:   Or Eric Bledsoe, to be fair."
Well that should hopefully end that nonsense. The Kings should focus on a Bagley and Buddy Hield for Kristaps Porzingis trade or that same package for Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams.
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
Eric Bledsoe.... Tier 1
They have Eric Bledsoe!!!
"Ersan ""Eric Bledsoe"" Ilyasova"
Lol imagine replacing Eric Bledsoe with him
Looool the Bucks would have never won a Championship if they had to lean on Bledsoe at all  Source: I watched a lot of Eric Bledsoe this year
Eric Bledsoe was apart of a championship winning team! Come get him!
Remember when they voted Eric Bledsoe all defense and left Jrue off completely.  Good times
Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for Tobias Harris and a future second
"Pelicans fan first, but I was rooting for the Bucks because of Jrue. As much as people praise his defense and all-around game, he’s honestly even better as a person. Happy the trade worked out! Now who wants to trade for Eric Bledsoe and/or Steven Adams? Preferably for a bunch of future firsts. If you trade a ton of draft capital for a Pelicans player chances are you’ll end up winning the championship. Worked the last two seasons!"
"The opposite of this is teams like the Cavs when lebron was young, the pelicans with AD, etc who simply didn't want to spend the money or couldn't acquire good enough talent to give them chances to win. But in this situation, the bucks were 100% amazing in their ability to build a team from nothing to champion. Taking a chance on a raw athlete who didn't start playing basketball till he was 12, trade Brandon Jennings for a 2nd rounder who was in the g league and the pistons thought wasn't good enough, sit back and let them develop, make smart moves like signing Brook Lopez, drafting donte divencenzo, signing pat connaughton, trading for pj tucker, going all in and trading away 3 frp and Eric bledsoe for jrue holiday. They did it well and did it right, something alot of owners aren't willing to dig into to get that chip"
"Eric Bledsoe, Jaxson Hayes, Kira Lewis Jr. and three first-round picks for Ben Simmons. Wasn't sure about Kira Lewis Jr. but needed to make salaries work.  Pelicans manage to offload Bledsoe, and gain an all-star PG. They also sink further into roster construction hell and lose assets needed to build a team around Zion.  76ers get rid of Simmons but also receive a downgrade at the PG position, their new back-up C for when Embiid misses 20 games is an even greater downgrade than before, and either have to spend the picks to find a favourable trade from Bledsoe, or spend a year with a worse PG than the one they just traded away."
"Evolutions would be more like    Eric Bledsoe -&gt; Andre Iguodala -&gt; LeBron James         The way you have been commenting is like    Typhlosion -&gt; Infernape -&gt; Blaziken         In short, your evolutions aren't evolutions."
Eric Bledsoe is probably jelly rn
"Off topic, but has anyone checked in on Eric Bledsoe? Mans might be down bad today"
Show some faith in the franchise guy and try to acquire some higher end talent. Easier said than done of course but this is essentially what Milwaukee did. Giannis wasn’t necessarily proven on the big stage going into this season but Milwaukee recognized that the talent+mindset was there and that they’d slip back into mediocrity if they sat on their hands for too long and pushed Giannis to want out through complacency.    Milwaukee also had a handful of picks and traceable salary to maneuver that other teams don’t necessarily have. Portland has one or two enticing players to trade and some salary but not many picks. NOLA I think has picks but they also have to figure out how to appease Zion with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams taking up so much money and garnering reputations as bad contracts.
"If it's a team built through draft Then why did they trade all those picks for holiday?..... Look I'm happy for him but this he didn't join a super team to win the ring is a bullshit argument...... He has had Eric Bledsoe,  Malcom Brigdon, Khris Middleton now Jrue Holiday...these are all good players in their own right..... I do not like the comparisons though coz Lebron had no one of this Caliber on the Cavs team when he left for Miami.... and he was facing Boston celtics with 4 HOF and Giannis has been shut down completely in post season which Did not happen to KD and Lebron.....I get that he played well but he did not go through Nets at full strength.....I completely hate this false argument that bucks did it in some real way....the Bucks have moved so many pieces to cover up Giannis weakness"
When I'm sad I just remember that Eric Bledsoe didn't get a ring and I'm okay again
Jrue Holiday is much better than Eric Bledsoe
"Who did they attract? They went out and traded for Jrue, if that's who you're talking about.  https://www.nba.com/news/pelicans-acquire-steven-adams-eric-bledsoe-in-4-team-trade-jrue-holiday-to-milwaukee"
"He deserved some slander, but nowhere near as much as he got.  If Eric Bledsoe wasn't cursed to forget how to play basketball the moment he gets into the playoffs, Middleton doesn't have one of his cold stretches, and the rest of the guys like Mirotic could hit a shot, ""the wall"" would have led to a lot of high assist/triple double games for Giannis, and potentially Bucks wins.  But they didn't make those shots, and we didn't win.  At least half the time people shit on Bud, it's for games where the guys we expect to shoot when they're open, got plenty of open shots, and just bricked them.  Just as he would have been shat on if we lost tonight despite Jrue going ice cold, Middleton not really finding it until late, Pat looking god awful after being relatively clutch the rest of the series, and the entire team giving up turnovers as if they were trying to do it."
someone wanna check in on eric bledsoe rn?
We gotta get rid of Eric Bledsoe it seems like....Joel you know what to do.
Lonzo? Zion? Nah its clearly gonna be Eric Bledsoe
Ensure Giannis passes to Eric Bledsoe to shoot threes
"Everyone is talking about Giannis, and rightly so, but give the bucks some credit as well. They realized they have an uphill battle as a small market, and learned from their mistakes. They saw what worked and did things like replacing Eric Bledsoe with PJ tucker. They put a team around Giannis and that paid dividends. Incredible job by the Bucks at building a championship caliber team"
Where is eric bledsoe
All I learned from this series was that Eric Bledsoe is the greatest guard in the history of New Orleans
"Look if it was eric bledsoe playing instead of jrue, these guys woulda been a first round exit"
This will forever be known as the Eric Bledsoe series.
Jrue had 1 game where he remembered he's not Eric Bledsoe
1.	Dennis Schroeder 2.	Ben Simmons 3.	Eric Bledsoe 4.	Facu Compazzo 5.	Pat Beverly
All this will lead to is Lonzo leaving and Eric Bledsoe being the starting PG.
"&gt;So it’s insane to judge a guy based off the high pressure moments of the biggest stages in college but it isn’t to fair to say that same guy might not be ready to contribute in the highest pressure moments of the next level in the nba?  It absolutely is insane, especially when factoring in its a 6 game sample size, and when said player still produced and contributed well at what he needed to do in the “biggest stage” (16ppg on 42% from 3 on 7.5 3PA)   &gt;They have a young core. I don’t understand why you need to add another uncertain young guy into the mix especially when all it sounds like you’re looking for is shooting.  They have a young core that consist of 2 people, those are Zion and Ingram. Everyone else is replaceable and their roles can be moved around. You add another young guy to the mix because this is a player whose skillset perfectly blends with what they need as a team and it’s a player who you are getting on a bargain of a contract because they will be on a rookie deal.   Shooters rise, and shooters get paid.  &gt;Tatum, wasn’t suppose to be in that role for one and guys like him who perform in the playoffs like that are the exception not the rule. I wouldn’t expect Cade, Mobley or Green to have that kind of run in their rookie years if they made the playoffs much less Kispert.  Whether Tatum was suppose to be in that role isn’t the point, the point is as a rookie he contributed to winning basketball even before the post season. It’s something other rookies have done and it’s something teams and draft analysts expect Kispert to be able to do from day 1.   &gt;NAW averaged 11 a game last year in 22 mins of play. He can create his own as well why isn’t he a starter?   He’s not an efficient player, he’s not a good 3pt shooter, he’s not a lead playmaker, and he’s an average defender. Also Lonzo and Bledsoe literally started over him   That being said I think he CAN start and be a pressure reliever, secondary creator and 3rd scoring option. Like I have said before POSITION LESS BASKETBALL. These dudes can co-exist.   &gt;Kira Lewis was a rookie who’s younger than Kispert you can’t write him off as ever been a starting guard in this league that fast. That’s what they drafted him for.  I’m not going to ignore a prospect that fits a clear role and position of need because of Kira Lewis Jr and NAW. Honestly I don’t even know why you keep mentioning them when Kispert is a wing and those 2 are guards.   &gt;Duncan Robinson was just a name. Not necessarily talking about him, there will be more shooters who are available who we know can fill it up. Go after Eric Gordon. Houston is looking to move on anyway  33 year old injury prone Eric Gordon who is making 40 million over the next 2 years and has shot 32% from 3 the last 2 years? You’re kinda proving my point about how hard it is to get actual shooters with the players you’re naming."
Also shipping Eric Bledsoe. Literally the worst player in the league. A net negative in both ends of the floor.
&gt;No one gives a fuck what Eric Bledsoe thinks though  You dont think being one of the only vets in the locker room can have a huge impact on overall attitude? I bet you a lot of Pelicans players gives a fuck about what Eric Bledsoe thinks.
"No one gives a fuck what Eric Bledsoe thinks though. Same with Hayes and anyone else not named Zion and to a lesser extent Ingram. You cater to your stars, not Eric Bledsoe. Everyone else on that roster should be expendable if they don’t like being coached or have a problem with being called out for their mistakes"
Eric Bledsoe vibes
"The only real hit the roster took was replacing Jrue Holiday with Eric Bledsoe but that's a **big** hit.  Reddick became trash overnight and Favors moved on.  Other than that the roster wasn't too much of an improvement or downgrade, since the young players did improve somewhat but I wouldnt go on to say ""much improved"""
"I'm citing the article and interview with him that I remember reading from 2 years ago.  ""The nerves usually kick in when Bledsoe arrives at the arena, and he often tries to manage them by playing with his kids before games. They don't care how he plays; to them, he's just their dad. Sometimes, Bledsoe brings his son, Ethan, out to the court to warm up with him.  The butterflies reappear when he is in the Bucks' layup line 10 minutes before tipoff. During the national anthem, Bledsoe meditates. He is usually the first person to break from the line of his teammates -- usually several seconds before the final notes of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" are sung.  He takes a big, centering breath before the public-address announcer booms, ""A 6-foot guard from Kentucky -- Eric Bledsoe.""  ""I am nervous all the way through the national anthem and the first play,"" Bledsoe said. ""Once I get up and down the court a few times, it fades.""  But Sunday, there still seemed to be butterflies on his first 3-point attempt. They started to melt away when he made free throws late in the first quarter, but he never quite found a rhythm. He finished with 6 points, 2 rebounds and 4 assists in 25 minutes. He was more effective on defense, as Rozier scored just 4 points in 23 plays with Bledsoe as the primary defender, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information data."""
THIS!!!     You can visibly see Bam Adebayo's confidence get shattered in a bazillion pieces in the first 5 minutes of the game.      Also the fact that Giannis is playing off the ball so well and the Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe have made this a much more threatening team than last year.
"It’s fashionable to credit Bud, but honestly the impact of NOT playing Eric Bledsoe cannot be overstated. Dude is just a momentum killer. Holiday trade is looking justified so far"
"As a pels fan, we would be mavs level with jrue instead of 1/10 negative defender eric bledsoe"
Suns. Also heat had it kind of easy last year with Indiana and Eric Bledsoe.
Lillard looking like Eric Bledsoe on offense these last few possessions
He might be better than Eric Bledsoe
"are people really surprised? lol. people have been saying losing eric bledsoe was addition by subtraction, but to get an all nba calliber player on top of that is night and day."
"You want him doing both, of course. Best change was always going to be getting rid of Eric Bledsoe, net negative and lol spacing when combined with Giannis. Adding Jrue who's a borderline top 10 PG at worst, really a top 10 PG every single season, was just icing on the cake. And now you have to deal with a historically elite Big 3. As a Cavs fan, I can really relate to you in Milwaukee. Realistically, you're an injury to the Nets away from a championship."
Heat legend Eric Bledsoe
Jrue Holiday truly is what Eric Bledsoe thought he was.  Good on the Bucks for getting rid of him. Now if only the Pelicans could
We had Raptors agent Eric Bledsoe on our team back then
That’s definitely not Eric Bledsoe
Eric Bledsoe tricked y'all man
Jrue Holiday changes everything    Not Eric Bledsoe changes even more
"The big man has to communicate to the defender that a screen is coming.   The defender then has to anticipate where the screen is going to be and try to get their feet above the big man’s feet and fight around the screen (idk if that makes sense).   Players with longer wingspans can use their length to recover quicker to the ball handler. Overall, it’s about communication, instinct, quickness, and effort to recover.   LeBron, Ben Simmons, Kawhi, and Eric Bledsoe (the version that wants to defend) are all great at not getting screened too hard when engaged"
"If the Warriors want current assets, we have one Eric Bledsoe to offer them."
Top 5 Suns of all time:  5. Boris Diaw  4. Penny Hardaway  3. Dan Majerle  2. Eric Bledsoe  1. Cameron Payne
"&gt; he got gentleman swept by the same team Embiid just took to 7 games in the previous round(context matters)  So, after I showed you how Embiid was clearly worse against the Raptors than Giannis, your response still includes ""**Embiid** took them to 7.""  Not the Sixers, Embiid. Yep, that sub-20 PPG on sub-40% shooting for a big man first option is what took the Raptors to seven games, because apparently basketball is no longer a team sport, and reality no longer matters.  Not like, you know, one team might have had Jimmy Butler as their ""third star"" that year, while the other team had to try to rely on Eric ""literally forgets how to play basketball the moment the regular season ends"" Bledsoe.  Nope, clearly the difference in the length of the series against Toronto must have been Joel Embiid doing so much better than Giannis (even though, again, I already showed he definitely wasn't even close.)"
"I mean, have fun building a wall around Giannis while Luka drops 40. The Heat's wall worked because the Buck's offense was largely Giannis or pray, with some Middleton. They had fucking eric bledsoe as their starter, like, what the is that supposed to accomplish?  Luka Jokic, while exciting and would probably be a perennial top 4 in the West, doesn't answer the defensive half as well as Giannis Luka. Embiid Luka would be great too, but I prefer the fit between Giannis Luka."
Jrue is such a difference maker. If Eric Bledsoe was still on this team you know that shit was being buried for a game winning three pointer for us to lose
Much smaller sample size to go off of. Evan somehow is getting beaten out by Eric Bledsoe in career postseason ts%
No that's Eric Bledsoe
I think you mean Eric Bledsoe. Drew Bledsoe was a quarterback in the NFL.
"Imagine having no spacing or guards who can shoot, seeing ERIC FUCKING BLEDSOE and being like ""he's our glue"""
The night and day difference between how much he helped y'all made me *really* realized how much of a negative Eric Bledsoe was for y'all last year. Jrue made SO many winning plays for y'all all game but especially in clutch. Not really a hot take but I don't think the game even goes to OT without him.
Zero chance they win this with Eric Bledsoe instead. Lol
ERIC BLEDSOE WOULD NEVER
What they did after drafting him was even worse. Stephen Adams and Eric Bledsoe playing along Zion is painful to watch.
"Jimmy and Bam are both better than last season, our defense is finally turning the corner into a cohesive unit and all of our shooters are hot at the perfect time.  The Bucks as a playoff team are significantly, significantly better than last year. Turning Eric Bledsoe into Jrue Holiday cannot be overstated. P.J. Tucker gives them lineup versatility.   Bucks starting five &gt; Heat starting five. Bucks sacrifice bench depth for that. They have to hope Forbes, Connaughton, Portis can give them decent minutes. If they don't, that's where the Heat win this series.  Bucks in 7."
LOL are you not forgetting Eric Bledsoe folding like a deck chair mentally in the playoffs? He is NOT a good vet lmao
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion’s? Fit is one thing, but he’s playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"I mean Zion is the better player. He didn't play much last year, but he proved it this year. What he did was unreal for a guy in his sophomore season, but the Pelicans can't put a team together worth shit. The fact that they went out and got Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe this year is atrocious from a team building aspect. You just have to hope the picks they got along with Bledsoe for Jrue pan out to some worth.  All the respect to Ja though. Zion and Ja are both future superstars in this league."
"I mean you’d think with all their talent they’d be able to scrape up something but nope.  Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball as a young core  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, (formerly) JJ Reddick As your vets. A lot of talent on paper."
#NOTMYLVP   Eric Bledsoe will always be my LVP
"Yeah I hope so, I know for a fact that jure is miles better than Eric Bledsoe but I'm not gonna lie I'm super nervous about the heat."
This list needs more Eric Bledsoe but I like the execution.
I can’t believe Eric Bledsoe didn’t qualify for this list
"OP, how does Eric Bledsoe compare with these 8?"
"Last year they had Jrue Holiday, 2019-20 JJ Redick, and Derrick Favors  This year they had Eric Bledsoe, 2020-21 JJ Redick, and Steven Adams"
Why isn’t Eric Bledsoe on this list?
eric bledsoe and lebron
Eric Bledsoe robbed smh smh smh
I thought for sure Eric Bledsoe was gonna show up in the dishonorable mentions somewhere
Eric Bledsoe has left the chat
If Schroder comes into a game playing like Eric Bledsoe again they won't be beating any good teams.
"Eric bledsoe sucks because he doesn't care anymore but was a positive contributor at one point. Drummond hasn't really learned how to fit with a contending team yet (though i still think he has value, esp. on a minimum)"
Well you'd say the same thing about eric bledsoe if you were playing him lol so this proves they are in fact two peas in a pod
Eric Bledsoe used to be really good
Eric Bledsoe has been an effective positive player in the past even if he isn’t that right now. Drummond has  always been the poster child for empty stats
Eric Bledsoe ? Lmao
Disrespectful to Eric Bledsoe.
Can someone **PLEASE** do a remake [of this Bootum classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhY8tt8bcw) but replace Lowry with Dejounte Murray after tonights performance? 5/20 is downright brutal. I feel for DeRozan but woof gotta be the most well-known poor performer in the playoffs amongst stars alongside Eric Bledsoe.
"Nah it's more that half your team is entirely unprepared for the playoffs.   You've got a great roster until Ben and Tobias forget how to play. Then it's just Embiid tiring himself out as he tries to average 35-40 a night and anchor the defence all on his own.  Seeding doesn't matter. With Ben and Tobias, all you guys need is Eric Bledsoe to complete the holy trinity of current playoff chokers."
Eric Bledsoe with an ego
"He’s not putting up Wilt like numbers, check Harden/Giannis per 100 possessions, those are Wilt numbers first of all.  Giannis carried an all time great defence with Wesley Mathews and Eric Bledsoe in the backcourt.  Jokic is not breaking as many team records and individual as Giannis did on both ends of the floor. I don’t think you understand how ridiculous that season was."
"Elfrid Payton, liangelo ball, Eric Bledsoe, Andre Drummond and Jeff Teague"
Lmao says the person with an Eric Bledsoe flair
eric bledsoe was clearly the 3rd
To be fair one of these teams employs Eric Bledsoe….
"I think Miami is going to find out the hard way that Jrue Holiday isn’t Eric Bledsoe lol.  It’ll be a tough, fun series."
I can’t stress enough how big of an upgrade Jrue Holiday is from Eric Bledsoe.
He just needs to pull an Eric bledsoe and make it known officially
eric “the choker” bledsoe  dope wrestling nickname
Now that they replaced Eric the choker Bledsoe with Jrue Holiday they got nothing to feat
Eric Bledsoe
"It's almost hard to say Eric Bledsoe because most nights he is so bad it seems like he's on the other team, but it is undoubtedly Eric Bledsoe. I think we'd of made the playoffs if he just wasn't on our team this year. No trade necessary, just cut him. Best quote of the year after blowing a game winning intentional foul on d situation ""I just wasn't paying attention""."
Sorry to the Pelicans for having Eric Bledsoe on your team. How does he look that bad considering the players on the floor tonight...
Congrats to Eric Bledsoe on this impressive record setting performance
"Cause he is. It's not just height. It's weight, wingspan and frame. Eric Bledsoe is shorter than Curry, have you ever heard anyone call him little? The same with Donovan Mitchell. Those guys have a bigger frame and wingspan. Mitchell walks around like 215-220 as a 6ft guard with a near 7 ft wingspan and wears size 17 shoes."
"Everyone does that though, they just get more hate for it and it looks worse because they're bigger and stronger than most players, which they shouldn't be punished for. If Trae or Booker charge into someone they aren't gonna go flying the same way they would if LeBron or Giannis does.   Also people exaggerate how often it happens, they'll see them bulldoze someone once or twice a game and then go ""LeBron commits offensive fouls on EVERY drive, he would just be Eric Bledsoe with a growth spurt if they actually called them"", while ignoring the 10 times he got slapped on the arms while going for a layup."
We traded 3 first rounds picks and an extra 20 million per year for Eric Bledsoe but 2 inches taller
"Eric Bledsoe has the real Jrue Holiday tied up in an abandoned warehouse somewhere, doesn’t he"
Jrue Holiday straight up giving Eric Bledsoe vibes
"Imagine getting eliminated by the same team in the first round three years straight.  Giannis star help? Middleton who is all right but streaky and injured Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe and Brook Lopez? Man, you must not watch Bucks much."
"Yeah I’m sure Carlisle comes in and teaches Eric Bledsoe how to shoot a jumpshot. Ersan Illyasova how to play defense. And Robin Lopez to be a quality playoff rotation big for the first time in his career.  We’re talking about coaches here, not miracle workers"
"Eric bledsoe, Ersan Ilyasova, and Robin Lopez.  That team wasn’t shit, they just covered up a lot of deficiencies in the regular season."
You named Eric Bledsoe and Alex Caruso bruh
Doc “Eric Bledsoe” Rivers: I don’t wanna be here
"It wasn't a mistake at all. Dude is a bonehead. Ran this idiotic set with Steven Adams getting the ball at the top of the key every possession for the first 20 games or so. Refused to play the young guards and when he did, never allowed them to play through a few mistakes while allowing Eric bledsoe to make countless mistakes"
It's more difficult when you have guys like Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton next to you than when you have a guy like LeBron next to you.
Oh! Oh! Do Eric Bledsoe and a Pelicans pick next Presti!
Only his shooting. Anyone that’s comparing him to Eric Bledsoe doesn’t know what the fuck they’re talking about.
"Pelicans are stuck picks or not they are stuck zion is reportedly unhappy there gm dosent seem to know what he's doing not going to sign a top 8 free agent you don't know what your going to get back for Lonzo and yeah I know Lonzo is still on the team but him and Zion dosent really fit together Zion needs scorers and defenders so you don't know you got players like Eric bledsoe and Steven Adams that are just there and under contract they are literally just there Steven Adams LITERALLY SITS OUT EVERY GAME I tuned in on okc has picks they are literally trading young ""ok"" players because they know they can get 5 Better players at that position so yeah"
"In the meanwhile, the New Orleans Pelicans have Eric Bledsoe."
i bet he is about to get another one for taking on eric bledsoe. pls
Not have squandered the talent of the last two generational talents they had. Or employ Eric Bledsoe.
"But make the package bad enough for the kings to still suck  Zion, Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for DeAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy Hield  Also like 3 picks to ruin any chance of building a team around him"
Trash! They need to trade him for a defensive stopper like Eric Bledsoe!
"Man the bucks point guard with bad shot selection, bricked 3s, and dumb turnovers. Are we sure that's not Eric Bledsoe? Lol"
From someone who’s had both of these “Eric Bledsoe’s”—- you’re wrong. The real Eric Bledsoe fucking sucks.
Fred pulls the mask off Jrue Holiday to reveal: Eric Bledsoe!
Jrue Holiday doing his absolute best Eric Bledsoe impression tonight
Jrue is Eric Bledsoe if he bought the +4 stat boosts in 2k
Bucks really traded Eric Bledsoe for an Eric Bledsoe who can sometimes pass and takes way too many 3's that he's not good enough to take
Jrue really turned into eric bledsoe this series for no reason at all
"this team had every opportunity to have miles turner and george hill and a TON more room instead of steven adams and eric bledsoe and they screwed the pooch. he seems like a great dude, i don't blame him for frustration"
"Do the Pelicans really strike you as a team that's on the verge of making a big leap? Really? They very well could lose Lonzo and Hart this summer in free agency, they're stuck with Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams on awful contracts and they just fired their coach after one year. Their last star player very publicly forced his way out of town, and their GM has been very vocally criticized by JJ Redick as a liar who is not to be trusted. Zion has to be looking at this like ""what exactly is the plan?""   Zion has only been there for two years, that's true, but the Pelicans have a really awful track record that goes back many years before he even arrived there. I don't at all see what has happened since he got there which would disavow him of that terrible reputation the team has had."
and also the difference between *an actual 3rd star* in Jrue and the least efficient high minute rotation guard in the NBA Eric Bledsoe
A guy who comes in the league dominating everyone who you put in front of them probably doesn’t care that in three or four years his team may draft a couple developmental projects and get rid of Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams and Stan Van Grundy
"That doesn't make it a good trade for the franchise though. They got Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe back, who also don't fit the timeline.   They may have screwed up Zions first 4-5 years in the league. That is also not good for the future of the franchise."
no he doesn’t want to play with eric bledsoe or have Lonzo Ball be his third option
"&gt;I mean Adams is better than any of those players?   I think that's highly debatable, but it's not even a question when you compare what those guys cost. Would you rather have a 1st round pick, George Hill and Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard for $5 or $3 million, respectively, or would you rather just have Steven Adams on a 3 year deal for $65 million? That's a no-brainer.   &gt; What can you get for 10mil?   Did you not see the part above in the OP's post that said:   * ""The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.""   Wasting that kind of money is *always* bad, which is why it's now being reported that the Pels are looking to dump him. Don't be surprised if it costs them more picks to do so.   &gt; Nobody is coming to the pels unless you overpay.   Wrong, the Pels could have easily traded for Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, both of whom were on expiring contracts (so they wouldn't now need to be salary dumped), and both of whom were eventually bought out. The Pels probably could have got a couple second round picks or possibly even a first to take either of those guys on. That would have been far better than paying what they did for Steven Adams."
lol you act like Harden faced the same GSW team every year.   Harden has had some pretty good teams and again has yet to succeed. Giannis had what Khris Middleton (who disappears) and Eric Bledsoe? Yeah he’s had some great teams and definitely in a spot to dominate especially with Bud as their head coach.
"According to NBA voters, Eric Bledsoe was a better defender than Jrue Holiday the last two years. This year, they swap teams, and what do you know? Jrue is firsy team and Bled is nowhere in sight"
"Small market team checking in here, we lived through that shit from 1990 onwards. Thanks god we got Giannis and he didn’t try to force himself off the team in 2017, we never would have signed Jrue (probably the biggest free agent I can remember getting). Before then our free agents were like Eric Bledsoe (lol), Ersan Ilyasova (like 8 times)..."
Yes. And that’s why the Pelicans need to change Eric Bledsoe first.
One of the major reasons listed for firing SVG was that the front office wanted younger players like NAW and Kira Lewis Jr to play over Bledsoe who was terrible but SVG stuck with diet Eric.   This season was supposed to be about development and chemistry building but we wasted a lot of minutes watching Bledsoe wear a jersey and run around clanking shots
"Truly hoping this is just some noise from Zion’s camp to make the front office proactive this off-season. We need Bledsoe gone ASAP, and never sign an “Eric” ever again   I mean fuck, the saints were absolute shit until we lucked our way into Sean Payton and Drew Brees. Why can’t we have hope the same shit happens for the Pelicans?"
"Yeah there’s a lot of little things combined tbh, but Bledsoe being diet Eric instead of diet jrue and SVG insisting on playing him so many mins regardless of how bad he was are some of the biggest ones imo."
Ah. Eric Bledsoe. Believe me; it’s a blessing once he leaves.
&gt; Eric Bledsoe.  lol nuff said
"the FO already looks bad, about to be on the 3rd coach in three seasons, JJ Redick shit on Griffin after his trade which soured some of the players and some of the moves made by the FO just weren’t good. Zion wants to compete, that’s not happening playing with Eric Bledsoe &amp; a bunch of young guys. The assets the FO has stashed should be enough to put together a competing team, Zion’s putting them in a tough spot here to make something happen."
Choosing to employ eric bledsoe certainly doesnt help that goal
"&gt; The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.  Why the fuck did they give Adams that extension then lmao"
"Everyone is dogging on Zion's family here, but does anyone disagree with them?  Who here thinks Zion has the right pieces around him to content for a title?  Do you guys expect these generation type players to just suck it up and be happy when teams get players like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams?  How much time should Zion be required to play on a crappy team before he voices displeasure with the situation?"
not with Eric Bledsoe on the roster
"When things were “going right” for the Bucks, Eric Bledsoe still was trash LOL"
It's because Eric Bledsoe sucks and doesn't play with any passion when things aren't going right
"Here's my hot take: He's tall Eric Bledsoe in the playoffs. Both play, or played, well enough in the regular season to show offensive flashes and have reputations as good defenders. Offensively neither have reputations for shooting, but can finish at the rim, and have decent handles.   Only non-comparisons are that Simmons is a better defender and passer, but both completely disappear on offense in the playoffs and you can't win a championship if your second, or third, guy can't score."
"&gt; Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams  Still mystified why they made these trades in the first place. Or hired SVG. David Griffin is a trash tier executive"
"&gt; The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.  In what world did they think both of those players on this Pelicans roster would make them better? I could at least see Steven Adams but then you gave him a 2 year extension instead of seeing how it would fit first. And Eric Bledsoe... how does he fit into anything for the Pels?  Awful roster construction; it's a good thing they have picks but it's not a Get Out of Jail free card unless they know how to use them right."
"As they should man. LeBron drug far more inferior players to the Finals at 22 man, no way he’s not making the Finals with Malcolm Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe, Jrue Bledsoe &amp; Khris Middleton next to him. Look at what Trae Young is doing rn, Giannis has no excuses &amp; when he loses this series he should get demoted to as the 15th best player in the league."
"Ben for Eric Gordon,  Ben for John Wall,  Ben for Kemba,  3 Way - Ben to Bulls, Kemba to Sixers - Vuc to Celtics,  Ben for Love,  Ben for Pat Bev and Kennard,  The saddest trade ever = Ben for KP,  Ben for CJ,  Ben for KCP and Kuzma,  Ben for Derrick White,  Ben for Bledsoe,  Ben for Buddy,  Ben for Shia (saves sixers a lot of money as the Thunder have massive trade exceptions and the Thunder would get a premier tank commander)"
