"To be fair, it's an organization that helped build a legacy on great drafting.  It's not the most profitable franchise and it's not a guarantee that the fanbase will maintain any sort of interest in a tanking team.  Most fans aren't championship-or-bust minded.  There's something to be said for staying competitive and trying to pull a Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Kawhi, Devin Booker or Michael Porter Jr. around the middle of the first round."
"Great content. Jerome is certainly a bust, and whoever it was that drafted him over Michael Porter Jr should be ashamed."

"I just want to remind people on Michael Porter Jr and his first 3 seasons:  S1: he was out the entire season S2: he rarely played for the first 3 months. Then he started coming off the bench regularly but was benched after every bad defensive play. He got to start in the bubble but after they got down 3-1 against the Jazz he came off the bench. He complained openly about playing time and Michael Malone was pretty clear about how many mistakes he made. His talent was clear but the fans wanted Malone fired for not playing him enough and not incorporating him. S3: he came out ok, then he missed 2 weeks. He still made terrible defensive plays and had a longer leash but it was still a major problem. Now, after actually listening to his coach and playing good defense and working inside the offense he’s shooting 60/55/80 and averaging 20pts over the last 5 weeks. He made the turn and his growing pains seem like a thing of the past.  Basically trust good coaches. These young players need time to develop especially ones like Wiseman and MPJ on teams that have established styles and want to win."
"DeAndre' Bembry on who’s more responsible: Him or Denver's Michael Porter Jr. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a band-aid. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Bembry said."
Michael Porter Jr had a good game too.
Lmao didn’t Michael Porter Jr say the coronavirus was for population control
"Once I read Michael Porter Jr, it clicked but when someone tells me MPJ on the Nuggets I can't figure it out. Some of us are casual fans who can't watch every team play and spelling out the names adds 5 seconds."
Michael Porter Jr
Michael porter jr
michael porter jr hopefully
In another words 10 years from now Michael Porter Jr will drive from Denver to Dallas to beat him up for hooking up with his wife
"I'll maintain the 2018 draft is gonna be like the second coming of 03. Multiple big name stars (add Michael Porter Jr. to the list above) with a couple more huge names coming in the following drafts.

"FUN FACT: Losing this game gave the Nuggets the 14th pick in the 2018 draft which turned out to be ... Michael Porter Jr, blessing in disguise."
"I got downvoted to hell for suggesting to deal Jamal Murray post haste, and had to hear why even Michael Porter Jr. wasn’t worth trading for James Harden since he’s so young and it would disrupt team chemistry. James Harden!"

John Collins or Michael Porter Jr.
"I’m not saying that at all. I’m honestly baffled that’s the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn’t fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn’t make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn’t inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team’s *results* would vary from the one he’d hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let’s use your Luka example. Let’s say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren’t hitting the shots that the first team was?"
Michael Porter Jr.
"A young rising player, maybe a player such as Mitchell Robinson or other young goons, I’m a raps fan and Kyle is my fav player and he’s got some left in the tank but he’s gonna decline from here, the best reasonable offer for the raps would be like Michael porter jr or another young guy"

Michael Porter Jr. is a certified Mavericks Killer. Nuggets Fans got em selves a real stud ⛰️  Luka with a solid 21/5/12 tonight on ok-ish shooting.

No one passed on KPJ because of his back. I think you're referring to Michael Porter Jr from Denver. KPJ was passed on because he has serious attitude issues.
Oh and also im an idiot. I thought it was Michael Porter Jr. That’s why i was more surprised
"It depends on the head coach.  Sometimes the coach will name a captain or co-captains, sometimes he'll appoint them.  Sometimes he won't do either.   I remember when Michael Jordan and Bill Cartwright were co-captains under Phil Jackson.  Sometimes the captain is the best player on the team, other times it's the veteran who is past his prime but acts like a coach on the floor.  Otto Porter Jr. and Thaddeus Young were co-captains under Boylen but apparently there aren't any designated captains under Donovan."
"Emerging big 3?  Production per 75 possessions when all three are on the floor...  Nikola Jokic: 27.3 PTS, 13.1 AST, 12.1 REB, 69.8 TS%  Jamal Murray: 21.6 PTS, 7.3 AST, 60.3 TS%  Michael Porter Jr.: 16.5 PTS, 11.0 REB, 60.5 TS%"
"This makes me incredibly unpopular in Denver but Michael Porter Jr. He rushes his threes constantly. He fumbles the ball a lot. And he says a lot of really stupid shit. Tell you what, Brooklyn. Well trade MPJ for KD. That seems fair, right? 😂"
What are you trying to convince yourself of? Of course it matters; AD and Lebron ran train on him in the playoffs. Even more so when he is flanked by bastions like Murray and Michael “the mind” Porter Jr.

Michael Porter Jr....
Michael Porter Jr needed to cut to the basket on this play. I can't believe all three stayed behind the arc and only down by 2!  I guess it's just the way the modern game is played. Everyone thinks they are Curry and wants to play hero ball instead of going for the highest percentage game tying layup.

"This is one of the dumbest teams i've ever seen in my life. That's at least partially on coaching, so i'll file that as Exhibit Z in my huge ass folder of ''why Mike Malone needs to be fired as soon as fucking possible''. Michael Porter Jr. is what happens when you set the sliders to zero on intelligence when you're creating a player. Guy is as dumb as shit.  I also wouldn't be sad to see the back of a bunch of these idiots. 4 on 1 break and the end result was a prayer of a shot from a guy who shoots threes like Ben Simmons."

"That's why I get so annoyed when people keep parroting ""He was the #1 player in high school!"" for young players like Michael Porter Jr when they get don't get free rein. Yes, he's good and has potential, but he still has a lot to learn about the NBA game. Players have described the gap before as if college ball was algebra, NBA was calculus."
Michael Porter Jr for the West
"Steph, Klay and Draymond could be playing together under Steve Kerr in Bumf\*\*kville, Montana and they still would get top tier free agents if they had the cap space. Clippers on the other hand only needed to show half as much competence to get their two stars. But even if they didn't make those moves, I'd wager that they make the playoffs this season with an all-star SGA leading the team. You have to actively try to suck to be as bad as some of these franchises. Forget Doncic, the Kings could've drafted one of Trae Young, Shai Gilgeous Alexander or Michael Porter Jr. at 2nd and they still would've most likely been a play-in team this year."
We got Michael Porter Jr. because we lost that game lol. The butterfly effect if we had won that game
Randle is gonna run away with it but major shoutout to Jerami Grant and Michael Porter Jr
"Keep in mind, none of the 3 are main options on the Nuggets and Gordon wasn't the main option on the Magic, Vucevic was.  Until he got injured, Jamal Murray was averaging 21.2 pts, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists.   Aaron Gordon is averaging 12.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.3 assists while playing easily the best defense on that entire Nuggets team.   Michael Porter Jr. is currently averaging 19.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.1 assists and will be an All Star next season or the season after, especially if he continues this pace."
"3 of their 4 other starters. Jamal Murray (before he got injured this year, obviously), Michael Porter Jr., and the trade deadline pickup Aaron Gordon."
"Randle is not the Most Improved player. He averaged 20 PPG his last two    seasons. He's at 24 PPG this season. People just slept on him. He's    already been a proven scorer. Michael Porter Jr., on the other hand, has    gone from 9 PPG to 19 PPG, and has been a 25+ guy since Murray got    hurt. He's the real MIP. Continuing with the Nuggets connection, Jerami    Grant went from 12 PPG as a reserve on Denver to 22 PPG as the offensive    focus on Detroit. Hell, Jokic also boosted his offensive numbers by    about 7 PPG. Last year, it wasn't always clear if Murray or Jokic was    the better player, as Jokic would sometimes refuse to attempt to score    while Murray was dropping 40 or 50."
"To say talent is as genetic as height... yeah and no. Talent can be inherent, but it's not like there aren't players who were completely average, worked really hard and got very good. To say talent is as genetic as the size you're born into is wack. Sure, there **are** players who are born talented, but there's also the players who are just workhorses who pushed themselves to be incredible. Michael Porter Jr is a great example of the combination.  &gt;and stats this year show he can guard anyone in iso better than **anyone else his size**  Alright, well, again: who's his size? Bol Bol, Tingis Pingis, Ibaka, JaVale, Embiid. I mentioned Boban and Tacko, but they're even **larger**.  It's a no-brainer he's guarding iso better than anyone his size. He's built like a 747 and the best player to be a DPOY candidate (Embiid) has missed too many games to win an end-of-season award. I mean shit, even in wingspan, his only competition is Drummond (by sheer ape indice), Mo Bamba and Whiteside.   I'm not trying to discredit Rudy. I don't know why Jazz fans insist on ""well actually""-ing everything. **I know Rudy Gobert is a highly intelligent and efficient defender.** I'm aware that he does more than camp the paint. I just think that when you shift the competition down to that 6'11 to 6'9 forward size, the players that Bam and Ben (the #2 and #3 in the DPOY race) are outperforming are of much higher quality than the players that Rudy (who is 7'1 with a 7'9 wingspan) are outplaying."

You’re required to wear masks, and who knows what’ll happen when this vaccine comes out. You might have to have the vaccine in order to travel. That’d be crazy.”  Lol"
What did Michael Porter Jr ever do?
I find it weird how players can turn it on like that when family is in attendance.  Tim Hardaway jr scored a career high the other night with his dad in the audience and I saw a game a while back where Michael Porter Jr went off while his dad was in attendance.  It makes it seem like they're not really trying during other games.
"You obviously just want to ignore my comment now. But where in the world are you getting that Steph is the first player in history to lead the league in scoring and efficiency?  This year he’s 19th in TS% among qualified players. Of the guys ahead of him, Joe Ingles, Gobert, Allen, Holmes, Bridges and Harris are all respectably high volume. And both Porter Jr and Durant are very high volume scorers. How is Steph under any reasonable qualifications leading the league in efficiency? And both Zion and Jokic are less than 1% behind Steph.  And Steph is in no way the first person to do this. It’s also not even certain he will end the year as 1st and 19th. But anyway, Durant led the league in scoring in 2013-14 and was 7th in TS%. And 2011-12 he led the league in scoring and was 13th in TS%. Shaq in 99-00 led the league in scoring and was 12th in TS%. Michael Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times and finished as high as 6th in TS%, with several other finishes in the top 15.  Steph’s volume and efficiency is absolutely incredible, but I don’t know where you’re getting these apparently fake stats from."
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."

"No see what you casuals aren't seeing is that Gobert clearly forced a timid and scared, cowardly even some would say, Michael Porter Jr. to take the dunk instead of the easy layup. Since you don't watch Utah, you'll never understand Rudy's defensive value on this play."

"Empeejay, aka Michael ""Showtime"" Porter Jr, is looking like a boss."
Paul George  Tyrese Halliburton  Michael porter jr Damian lillard  Kyrie Irving
"I think the most underrated player depends on how you get your sports news and updates.   Zion seems to be flying under the radar this year despite being a Top 10 scorer, similarly to Zach Lavine and Kyrie Irving.  I also don't hear much about Mitchell, Fox, or Sexton.   Marcus Morris, Bryn Forbes, and Michael Porter Jr. have all been lights out from three this year."
"I mean he’s as good as any of em but Trea and Luka, SGA  Michael Porter jr, Collin Sexton and Ayton are all pretty similar. Ayton is just more defensive focused then the rest"
Yes Jokic and Michael Porter Jr are going to beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis
yeah it's definitely clinched but give some props to Michael Porter Jr. He's basically averaging 25ppg now for the last couple months. He turned it up a notch and is now often the team's leading scorer
Michael porter jr
"Michael Porter Jr is in no way a defensive liability anymore. Watch some games, its insane how sure youre of that when you havent paid attention to him for 8 months, you dont even question yourself, just repeating the same thing, coming across ignorant.   And yes its ENTIRELY plausible for him to go from a liability to a decent/ average defender in the span of 8 months. Since the guy you know, literally had 0 pro level experience since highschool when he played the Lakers. Dont you understand that thats quite a big deal? MPJ was never going to stay a bad defender, the dude is very physically gifted.   Youre simply talking out of your ass, MPJ isnt being hidden. Youre talking like youre the one watching games. MPJ is an average/slightly above average defender at the moment."
Michael Porter Jr. and Jontay Porter??  MPJ would start over Marcus Morris in your lineup

Kevin Porter Jr and Michael Porter Jr and Gary Trent Jr

"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You’re committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of “super stars.” Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there’s not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell’s career.   Basically, I don’t really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he’ll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there’s others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"

"Is referring to Michael Porter Jr. as MPJ cringey as well? It’s initials, who cares"
This is one of the hardest teams to try and reconstruct because they weren’t superstars but they fit really well  Chauncey Billups- Kyle Lowry  Rip Hamilton- Joe Ingles  Tayshaun Prince- Talen Horton-Tucker   Rasheed Wallace- Michael Porter Jr.   Ben Wallace- Clint Capela   The team that I built isn’t as good on defense but is better offensively
"I have to admit, I can see it being considered top 4 all time in a decade, depending on how the guys develop, but there's a ton of talent. Besides Luka probably being a future MVP, this draft could overcome other top-heavy ones with it's depth. I think Ayton, Bagley, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Mikal &amp; Miles Bridges, Michael Porter Jordan, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Timelord, Gary Trent Jr., Shake Milton are the notable ones."

"Here's my unpopular nickname related opinion: I think Michael Porter Jr should be called ""MiPoJu"" instead of MPJ, and Talen Horton Tucker ""TaHoTu"" instead of THT, and so on. It's a good compromise between just the initials (which can be tough to surmise who is being referenced) vs typing /saying their entire name (my theory keeps it at 3 syllables and only adds 3 more letters)  I actually don't think this, I know it's corny but it makes me laugh to call MPJ mipoju"
"I don't know, maybe just have Michael Porter Jr. run around and get open, and catch and shoot when Jokic finds him. Honestly it's pretty good offense still"
"Uhhh let's see. You said Tobias should've made the all-star game but Murray is averaging more PPG than him on higher efficiency. Michael Porter Jr currently has the 11th highest TS% in the entire NBA this season. Will Barton and Danny Green is also arguable. Danny is the better 3pt shooter and team defender, but Barton is the better man defender, and also handles the ball and can create his own shot."
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing.

"It's also arguably a detriment to the east in the long term, despite it making it easier to make the playoffs  In the west you can be a really good team and miss the playoffs, therefore keeping you in the lottery and picking higher than a much worse team (or teams) that makes the playoffs in the other conference  There have been multiple instances of this resulting in good teams drafting better players than their much worse opponents in the other conference. The Suns got TJ Warren and Devin Booker, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell (and then traded) and Michael Porter Jr, the Lakers ended up moving up for 4th in 2020. These teams are able to accumulate talent and win while keeping their pick higher  Meanwhile, teams like the Magic, haven't really won much at all, don't have a great roster, and their players 2nd contracts are ending or have ended. Yet, they still haven't had a high lottery pick since like 2017  Not to mention that by making it easier to make the playoffs with poorer rosters, it makes it more likely that ownership or management will settle or retain rosters that in the long term won't ever get out of the dreaded middle  All of this is likely why it has taken so long for the east to finally catch back up to the west, but even then the west is still deeper likely in part due to this higher level of play needed to compete."

"Honestly, the biggest reason is because we've just not really played together yet. Michael Porter Jr and JaMychal Green haven't even played together, and they're both big components. We started like 1-4 while JaMychal was out, and we climbed to 5-5 when he started playing. Murray got hurt, so he's having his weak games, even though he started the season off really well (exception of his first game). MPJ has been gone for a long time too, and he was cooking.    Just give the Nuggets some time to figure out the roster and actually play together and we'll be climbing up the rankings."
He looks nothing like Michael Porter Jr hmmm . Different dads ?
doesn’t he do that with michael porter jr? porter michael williams or some shit. although i guess he’s just mixing his name with MCW
Michael Porter Jr?

Fun one."

Hope for a speedy recovery. But fools like Michael Porter Jr. should see this and be aware that this virus is serious.
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
Title windows in the NBA stay open 2-3 years usually(and not even that long always). 2 years is not a short period of time at all in the NBA. IF you arent willing to take the risks that come with that and willing to re-tool after every couple seasons in today's NBA then you just arent serious about wanting to win a title.   Michael Porter Jr being untouchable in Harden discussions(if he was) is just code word for we are fine with the status quo of being a good to very good team who isnt serious about trying to reach the highest level.
"&gt; This all comes back to are you serious about wanting to win a title or not. Or are you cool with just being a good small market team who won’t part with guys like Michael Porter Jr and then whine about how the league is so unfair to small market teams and they can never win?  Harden is 32 years old and has far from proven that he can be a winner in the playoffs. That's part of the problem. His game is superb for the regular season, but in the post season where defenses clamp down and you can't be a perimeter defender and nap on every possession, he gets exposed.   Nobody knows right now how good MPjr can become, but I'd rather have him than 2 years of Harden jacking up shots and driving Murray and Jokic insane."
Yeah it’s definitely what happened and it’s absurd to me. Nothing more small market teams love doing than whining about how they are small markets and it’s so unfair then when there’s a chance to get an mvp caliber player for 2 years Michael Porter Jr is untouchable   All of this really shows how many teams in the nba truly aren’t serious about wanting to win a title. Part of that requires understanding there are no 5-10 year title windows in the nba it’s 2-3 years then you re tool. If you aren’t willing to acknowledge the inherent risk in that to pursue a title it just is code word for you aren’t really serious and are just content where you are being a perennial 52-30 2nd round and out team
"&gt; Harden is a player the fans love a lot more than GMs. There's no way you give up someone like Michael Porter, Jaylen Brown, etc. for him. I'm willing to bet there's at least partial relief in Philly that they're keeping Simmons.  This all comes back to are you serious about wanting to win a title or not. Or are you cool with just being a good small market team who won’t part with guys like Michael Porter Jr and then whine about how the league is so unfair to small market teams and they can never win? I’m not referring to you specifically I’m talking about these teams. Because not being willing to trade any of these guys for harden is code word for you aren’t serious about wanting to win a title. Title windows don’t last 5-10 years in the nba they last 2-3 and you retool and regroup. If you aren’t willing to live with the fact you’ll only get a 2-3 year title window again it just means you aren’t serious   About the harden choker thing this all comes back to expectations and price. Harden gets held to superstar expectation: if you hold Jaylen MPJ Simmons etc to those expectations at any point in their career you’ll be far more critical of them. And then finally it’s about price you aren’t giving up the price associated with a superstar. You are giving up basically one more pick and a better expiring than the Jrue holiday price. So when that’s the price it doesn’t matter if harden underperforms vs GSW relative to top 3 superstars. You aren’t giving up close to that kind of value here   Which if an owner just wants a good team and doesn’t want to take risks ok. But this is what being serious about wanting to win a title means it means taking a level of risk to get a substantially better player than any of those guys you mentioned will ever be. None of those teams are in great title positions right now they are all just in the tier of always being good to very good"
I don’t see it even Michael Porter Jr is a better comparsion to KD than Ingram is
"Ben Simmons with less picks would have been a great package, he’s a proven star and #1 pick  A trade for CJ, who Imo is better than oladipo to pair James Harden with Lillard  A trade for Anthony Edwards, to team James Harden with KAT and DLO. Minnesota is desperate to win something, and there’s no guarantee any of those draft picks are a #1 pick and Anthony Edwards has looked good  James Wiseman maybe, with Wiggins or Oubre or Draymond. Gives Curry help and Harden might fit well in the Warriors offense  Clippers for Paul George  Nuggets maybe for Harris, Michael Porter JR, some other players  Bucks for Middleton and some picks  They’re other trades they could have pursued Celtics Jaylen Brown, Raptors Siakam,   It’s not 2K and I’m not a GM and I don’t know of any of these salaries match but they’re ideas. Oladipo is a great player but I think the players I listed above are better and Oladipo has been dealing with a lot of injury issues the past few seasons"
nobody else in the NBA was willing to beat this offer for James Harden of just offering a bunch of future unprotected picks? Like you really couldnt have stepped in with Michael Porter Jr and some unprotected firsts of your own fi you were Denver?
Michael Porter Jr. can’t run a team. He’s also somewhat of a liability. That’s a good trade only for the Nuggets.
Pretty sure Michael Porter Jr. and Seth Curry are actually sick.
Michael porter jr and bunch of firsts?
michael porter jr
"They lost Jerami Grant and replaced him with Michael Porter Jr. who has played bad defense other than his rebounding and missed over half the games. Millsap is 1 year older which doesn't help his defense. Barton is shooting much worse. Craig walked and they didn't really replace him. They lost Plumlee who is a good backup center despite the crap he got for his contract. Also they're only 5-6. That's really not that bad.  They're definitely a worse team than last year but they should still be expected to be in the playoffs, just hoping for home court."
Remember what he [said](https://sports.yahoo.com/denver-nuggets-michael-porter-jr-pushes-wild-coronavirus-covid19-conspiracy-anti-vaccination-033113715.html) about Covid? Maybe thats why they wouldnt say it. Because he looks like an idiot now.

The surgery he underwent had a 2 year window for full recovery which has passed. A normal person not in peak condition has a re-injury risk of 10%.  And even if he was re-injured he could have the exact same procedure and fully recover again. MPJ has a Durant/Dirk ceiling offensively and will likely be a 20+ PPG scorer while on a cheap rookie deal over the next few years so I trust the Nuggets won’t trade him for Siakam. I like Siakam as a player but he’ll no.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/15/17362958/michael-porter-jr-nba-draft-stock-pick-back-injury-surgery  https://youtu.be/FLBXwsqGX5M

"Because he wants out and because Michael Porter Jr could be very good? Some picks would probably be needed as well. Hardens championship window in Houston has passed, and this is as good of a return as they'll get IMO."
The trade he’s actually thinking will happen is Michael Porter Jr. going to Houston as a 3-team deal for Harden to go to that 3rd team

Michael Porter Jr will become that player
"&gt; But I won’t think **the government trying to murder a % of the world's popultion is not top tier insanity.**  I didn't say ""the government trying to murder people"" is not ""top tier insanity"". I'm referring to the **people** THINKING the government's doing that are not as bad as anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers (although of course there's an overlap there).   Of course ""covid was made to lessen the population"" is a batshit evil thing to do... BIG IF TRUE. ""IF"" being the operative word.  But why the fuck are we going to be talking about that as if there's any substantial proof for that idiotic theory?   And that was my point. Any conspiracy nut can brainstorm and speculate about the idea that the government created covid to lessen the population. Will that somehow change and eventually make it actually true? No, it won't. You can spend 24/7 thinking about it, writing long posts in forums, it won't suddenly become true.  Now compare that to someone says this shit:  &gt;[""I mean you’re required to wear masks, and who knows what’ll happen when this vaccine comes out. You might have to have the vaccine in order to travel."" Like, that’d be crazy. I’ve never been vaccinated in my life, I’ve never had any shots or anything like that so... it could get crazy, but it’s definitely an agenda behind everything that’s going on right now.](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/7/28/21346152/michael-porter-jr-has-more-to-say-on-coronavirus-denver-nuggets)   Come on, man.  An anti-vaxxer is more crazy and dangerous than someone **thinking** there's some evil bullshit behind the pandemic. You can think the latter all you want, it won't suddenly become true. Being an anti-vaxxer has actual risks. That was my point. Does that clarify it for you?   &gt; why should he get mocked for contract tracing  My TLDR is saying he got mocked by people in that post because of his controversial statement. That covid is overblown. That there's a bigger agenda.   Top comments weren't mocking him for the possibility of breaking protocol or not. That long comment you copy/pasted is irrelevant. Your last paragraph is irrelevant. Whatever he was doing that got him placed under the health protocol isn't relevant. That's not why he was being mocked. Stop talking about being infallible or being ""lucky"" someone hasn't broken protocol.   He could've quit playing basketball to be a healthcare worker and got put under isolation for possible exposure, and he will still get mocked as much (if not more) if he still says ""covid is overblown, there's a bigger agenda"". You get the point?  Seriously, [go back through the thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kod9tl/charania_denvers_michael_porter_jr_is_missing/). Sure there are people there who might have misunderstood MPJ thinking he believes covid is a hoax and I support correcting [the people who misunderstood the ""population control"" bit](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hzpjsm/michael_porter_jr_believes_the_coronavirus_is/fzkfiog/), but see how a lot of the comments are sarcastic covid conspiracies which is a mockery of his ""bigger agenda/overblown"" statement.  You see people here continuously mock Lebron about his statement throwing Morey under the bus regarding china, whatever the actual topic of the reddit post about him is. You shouldn't be surprised MPJ was getting mocked about his covid statement when he got placed under nba's covid safety protocol.    &gt;The final question posed to Porter, 22, stated: “Bro speak on this coronavirus being (overblown) to scare people into being controlled, (I know) you know about all that.”  &gt;That’s facts,"" Porter, who previously in the Q&amp;A responded to a question regarding the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, began in response   Seriously. What an entitled moron."
"It's insane in a such a loaded 2018 draft class with Luka, Ayton, Trae, Jaren Jackson, Collin Sexton, SGA, Michael Porter Jr, etc., the Kings ended up with Marvin Bagley. He looks terrible. He's getting bullied by Draymond when he's playing offense and bullied by Steph and Wiseman when he's playing defense. He has no feel for the game, no touch, doesn't make decisions quickly. He honestly doesn't do anything well. Is this just the injuries or is he just not learning?"

**94 LaMelo Ball**  **149 Michael Porter Jr**  **211 Cam Reddish**  &amp;#x200B;  did u pick these randomly lmao? this might actually be the worst post iv seen in this sub.
"these are players who are better than Bagley in 2018 draf's top 15:   ayton,  doncic  young  wendell carter jr  sexton  mikal bridges  SGA  michael porter jr"
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
"Also SGA and JJJ looking like studs, could be potential future all stars. When you’re the 2nd pick and two future MVP candidates and two more future all stars are drafted after you...   Also Mikal Bridges is looking really good. I’ll ignore Mitchell Robinson because everyone whiffed on him the first time, but there look to be a half dozen MVP level to really good starter quality players drafted after him. Little early to tell with Michael Porter Jr. but his ceiling is higher, and Donte Divencinzo is good too."
"Kevin porter has a kid with Woman and names his kid Kevin porter jr.    Then they divorce and woman has a kid with Michael porter, and name their kid Michael porter jr.  MPJ and KPJ would be half brothers with different dads but the same mom and both be juniors  unless you're asking something else"
"Don't be mean to Houston, they're getting Michael Porter JR, remember? Probably with a combination of 4 FRP's and 4 pick swaps. Siakam is headed to Denver."
"I don’t know, but that Denver “Big 3” isn’t winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokić is a very overrated player. I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokić. It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
Michael porter jr has started 15 games total
"Michael Porter Jr’s brother Jontay Porter is in the Grizzlies, even though I guess he’s just a Porter and not a Porter Jr."
"The choice would have had to include trading Michael Porter Jr so that Grant could become a principle shooter along with Murray and Jokic, and even then it may not have been enough."
Michael Porter Jr
Michael Porter Jr. thinks COVID is preventing any electrical infetterence.
"My bet: Toronto, for Siakam and fillers + bounty of 1st round picks.   My hope: Denver, for Michael Porter Jr"
"Obviously we all love Jokic but it's a little basic to say he's my fav; maybe Michael Porter Jr., if he can be the X-factor to get us over the hump. He's got a beautiful game, although you have to separate his on-court play from his wacky off-court beliefs.   Nene was always my favorite growing up, but with the Nuggets finally back to playing at that high level, I'm sure I'll have another current favorite soon (if we can have a healthy season smh)."
"&gt; Who's the greatest player of all time?  Michael, LeBron, KAJ, and Kevin Porter Jr. is also rising up."
You’re gonna be so upset when Kevin Porter Jr. literally turns into Michael Jordan
"All time is kobe, but my favorite current is giannas. I love his mentality and dedication. His style of play is generationally fun to watch.   Ben simmons, Don't hate me  but in my opinion  might finish his career as the most diverse defender the game has ever seen. He's one of 2 only all star guards to win all nba and defensive team in one season the past 5 years.   Michael porter Jr. Laid back and he dated my celebrity crush growing up in Maddison Pettis lol."
"He did, I remember his teammates got him to eat bacon he loved it. Unsure if he stuck with it or not but his injury history has been pretty clear since then - not saying correlation equals causation but its interesting nonetheless  [2018 bacon story](https://theathletic.com/1670282/2020/03/13/it-was-just-so-good-michael-porter-jr-never-ate-meat-until-its-bacon?source=user-shared-article)"
**MICHAEL PORTER JR**
Who is the worst player whom if they were a FA today would get a max. It might be Michael Porter Jr
"Absolutely. It fueled the team the next season, while humbling them in the process. We also drafted 14th the next year because of it, snagging Michael Porter Jr.   A common theme for this Nuggets era is that they ""don't skip steps"". Losing this game was another one of those steps.  Boy was I pissed at the time though lol"
I don't think anyone is more set up for it than Michael Porter Jr right now.  He's going to average close to 25 PPG on a contending team while Murray is out. It's his award to lose and I really don't see any other young player that has a chance to put up similar numbers in a similar situation.
"Man he's so frickin' talented, like a thinner and taller Michael Porter Jr. Quicker handles too."
"Teams I got: Bucks, Lakers, Pacers, Heat, Thunder, Nuggets, Raptors.  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (4th) SG: Tyler Herro (5th) SF: Michael Porter jr (3rd) PF: Giannis (1st) C: Anthony Davis (2nd) 6th: Gary Trent Jr (6th) 7th: Poku (7th)  Hopefully I did this right, the decision between Lebron/Giannis/Jokic was tough but I ended up taking Giannis, I understand if you think the other two were better options."
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
"Timberwolves, Suns, Spurs, Knicks, Nuggets, Hawks, Pistons.  PG: Chris Paul (2nd)  SG: Hamidu Diallo (5th)   SF: Michael Porter Jr (3rd)  PF: Danilo Gallinari (6th)  C: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  6th: Derrick Rose (4th)  7th: Doug McDermott (7th)"
"Jamal Murray will miss most of the season with his ACL injury, and will probably need some time to knock off the rust when he does return. Michael Porter Jr. is an excellent player, but if he’s still a liability on defense, the Nuggs won’t win the title."
Michael Porter Jr.
"Starters:  steph (superstar)  klay (all-star)  og anunoby  giannis (superstar)  deandre ayton (all-star)  Bench: fred vanvleet, seth curry, caris levert, michael porter jr, aaron gordon, chris boucher, brook lopez   Good combination of offense, defense, play-making, and fit imo"
michael porter jr ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
The Suns offense was basically “give the ball to whoever Michael Porter Jr is guarding” and it was like the rosebud money cheat code in the Sims.
"Michael Porter, Jr. in the conference semi-finals vs the Suns:  - 110.9 ORTG, 127 DRTG (-16.2 Net) 🔥  - 38/38/70 shooting (51.3% TS) 💪  - 0.3 blocks per game 😤  - 1.0 AST/TO ratio 🤯  Somebody max this man 😈"
I've been watching the Clippers rise and fall and fall and rise  for 30 years. So it is factual untill they win a title.   After Marques Johnson sprained his  neck bang nto Benoit Benjamin's tummy I had to laugh. Or when the Clippers didn't consider drafting Kobe because he was 17 ( search YouTube) or most recently Michael Porter Jr says Clips Dr says he will never play again so they passed on him.   It's a trend with the Clips   Im a fan of the entire NBA.   Again win a chip then you can talk shit.   Deez
Michael Porter Jr Jr
"&gt;Here’s the story. The vegetarian story.    &gt;Porter Jr. had been a vegetarian his entire life. But one day during last season he found himself at the popular Denver breakfast spot, Snooze.     &gt;“I ordered some food,” said Porter Jr. in an interview with Altitude Sports, “and they brought out some bacon.”.   &gt;He tried it.     &gt;“There was no going back,” he said, smiling wide. “It was just so good.”.   &gt;His stomach didn’t hurt after his maiden voyage as a meat-eater. So, he gave eating chicken wings a go, and, he said laughing, “it was downhill from there.”.   &gt;For purposes of adding quality weight – he’s put on 14-15 pounds in the last year – chicken and fish were introduced as regulars into his diet by the Nuggets sports performance staff. And, as he gets set to begin his first on-court season with the Nuggets, he’ll need the extra bulk.

"Honestly, I have no rationale for this but I feel like Malone is the kind of guy who doesn't actually care if he's called Mike or Michael but found out that it really bugged Michael Porter Jr to be called ""Mike"" so Malone went out and did this as some kind of way to back up MPJ."
According to most betting sites  MIP Top 5 next season is  SGA  Zion  Michael Porter Jr  Kevin Porter Jr  Zach Lavine
"Michael Porter Jr. With Jamal Murray out for most (all?) of the regular season, MPJ has a chance to fill some big shoes. If he continues to develop and breaks out to an All-Star or near-All-Star level, then he'd be in the MIP mix."
Michael Porter Jr
"West teams only go to Toronto once, same with some East teams as well. If the team says “Michael Porter Jr. is out due to health and safety protocols” solely for the Toronto game it would be obvious, but if a player wanted to keep it under wraps I don’t think it would be too hard to just say it’s load management or day-to-day soreness"
"Where did he say that?  He first tweeted in response to the Floyd murder video ""that is Murder"" then he later encouraged people to pray for Floyd's family as well as the officers saying what they did was evil and for people to pray to change what is in their hearts (evil).  [https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/29/michael-porter-jr-george-floyd-tweets/](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/29/michael-porter-jr-george-floyd-tweets/)  Plenty to criticize MPJ over without making him out to be a typical Fox News host.     Boston is a trash town of racists."

"That's not the issue with switching situations, trying to compare them makes no sense because they play very different roles in different positions. Paul George has recently had a strong number 1 player on his team first with Westbrook now with Kawhi. Paul fits perfectly as a number two scoring option that can potentially carry as a leading scorer but has a couple of bad years in the playoffs that have unfairly offset his clutch years as a Pacer.  Dame is the first option on a very efficient pick and roll offense that has had issues of extremely terrible defenses over the years. McCollum has grown as a scorer but the lack of defensive abilities in their position as well as a lack of available defensive big men highlights their weaknesses. The Blazers have also dealt with a ton of injures in the past few years and despite they have always over performed in the regular season because of Dame's ability to run the offense. As a Blazer fan Dame has tremendously improved his ability as an offensive player over the years and nothing showed that more than Game 5 vs the Nuggets. The problem is Dame is a terrible defender and because of his offensive load he can be lazy, the Blazers have no guards that can be called defensively good and have never had good wing players. Aminu was never a good shooter and Gary Trent Jr. and Norman Powell are too small to guard played like Lebron and Michael Porter Jr. Our only defensive minded big man have been Covington and Nurkic. That is a ticking time bomb in the playoffs and that lack of defensive gets abused in the playoffs. Dame has gotten better at getting out of double teams but he still can't find teammates that can create plays with other players. He is not a good off-ball player so his role is diluted and his defense is magnified with McCollum."
"For a recent player, Michael Porter Jr. Dude will go 0/5 from three, you get mad at him, then the next game he goes 6/8 from three, 14/18 overall."
Guess I’m not the only one crazy enough to see Michael Porter Jr.’s potential…  wild.
"i mean, Fultz and Thybulle were the only two who shot over 30% from 3 in conference play and UW without Fultz lost multiple games by 20 or more  Fultz was at 24/5.5/5.5 in conference play   plus there’s never been a better PnR player at the college level i’ve ever seen. that was the foundation of his game because he could hit that pull-up from the elbow like Kyrie, but his jumper had so much lift he was like a taller donovan mitchell who could also use that screen to launch a 3  he was a better passer than Lonzo (the stats agree) and Fox was his only contemporary imo. Fultz at the u18 FIBA america’s tourney was the MVP of a team with Trae Young, Jarrett Allen, and Michael Porter Jr.   honestly, i don’t know what you could want in a point guard if Fultz didn’t have it"
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
"Michael Porter Jr could be. His shooting is nice, but everything else not nearly as much."
"With a Michael Porter Jr jump and other teams coasting, yeah."
Michael Porter Jr? Paul Millsap?
"Simmons has shown he is pretty unlikely to improve much/at all. Porter Jr is still developing and has room to grow his game. Porter Jr can be successful in more potential line-ups, whereas Simmons has to be with a specific group. I take Michael Porter Jr for sure."
Michael Porter Jr.

Michael Porter Jr. He can shoot but so can the rest of the league. He could have taken over in the playoffs but didn't do shit.  For people saying Doncic they should know that the level of skill in Euro ball is miles ahead of the NBA. The NBA is miles ahead in talent. He was mvp in Europe and has shown that the talent in the NBA doesn't mean shit to him.

"Michael Porter Jr, he’s a nice player don’t get me wrong but other than shooting and some rebounding I don’t know why some have him top 5 for under 25 y/o"
"his ESPN high school scouting report  &gt;Bagley has emerged as the best high school prospect in the game. At 6'11 with multi-dimensional skills and blessed elite athletic ability he impacts the game on both ends of the floor. His soft shooting touch, scoring instincts and ball handing ability make him unique at his size.   [he was the top rated player in his class, ahead of Michael Porter Jr, DeAndre Ayton, etc](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings/_/class/2017/order/true)"
The more that I think about it…Michael Porter Jr  He’s done very little and barely been able to stay on the court for the amount of hype that he gets as some kind of future superstar that’s gonna be transcendent.

Also really liked MPJ despite his back problems, I wanted the Mavs to take him at 5 and was really surprised to see him fall that low."

Michael Porter Jr can be an MVP level player. The efficiency is insane . I dont think this is even that much of a hot take anymore.
"Even if that's true, they're getting uncomfortable because you're bringing it up... out of nowhere... with no good reason... and looking like a dumbass while doing it.

"&gt; It’s about the best prospect at the draft by the majority consensus, going into the draft on that draft night.   Nah man this is your problem. Where can I go to lookup the majority consensus best player available on draft night for picks 2-15 or whatever? Nowhere. Its impossible. It doesn't exist. You can have people posting their picks and getting a lot of likes, but there is no way to know that. People just use hindsight and pretend like it was obvious on draft night.    So a lot of people are reading your post and thinking ""no shit you can do this for every team"" and you probably can. My knicks could have Donovan Mitchell and Michael porter Jr. Who was the best player available according to majority for those picks? DSJ and MPJ? Idk."
This question seems inspired by Michael Porter Jr and I don't think you have to worry about his getting the 10 assists needed for a triple double.

Michael Porter Jr is not that special and doesn't deserve his max contract
Serious question:  What is going on with Michael Porter Jr?    I know it's only been four games but this is not the player we saw at the end of last season or even the player we saw in preseason.
"I watched him play in high school against my younger bro's team. He seemed alright like he could probably play D1, but I didn't think he had anywhere near NBA talent. I was surprised he even got drafted.  For comparison: l also got to see Kevin Porter Jr and Michael Porter Jr both play in HS and could tell they both were for sure going to the league."
LeBron watched highlights of Keldon Johnson big body slamming Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr into oblivion the other night and was like... Nah fam I'm good.
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Jamal Murray  Michael Porter Jr  OG Anunoby  DeAndre Ayton
PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: OG Anunoby  SF: Michael Porter Jr.  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Deandre Ayton  Alternate (probably better) lineup is putting MPJ at the 4 and having Mikal Bridges play the 3.
"The draft order of Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai GA, Miles Bridges ... Michael Porter Jr. was a trajedy."
MVP: Jokic  ROTY: Scottie Barnes  6MOTY: Cam Reddish  DPOTY: Giannis  MIP: Michael Porter Jr   Jazz will never make it out the second round with this group/short of adding a third superstar. I guess that’s my bold prediction
"&gt; Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Austin Rivers is a better SG than CJ McCollum?  &gt; 18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further.  18-19 was also a year where Dame carried a series that, frankly, the Blazers *should* have won...and then the Blazers won a series that, frankly, Dame didn't carry.  And then they ran into a buzzsaw.  Hardly a case of Dame being let down by his roster.  And this is the limitation of only looking at   &gt; how we lost to better teams.  Because *of course* the conclusion of that assessment is that Dame is let down by his teams.  That's the only conclusion that *could* be reached from this sample other than ""Dame and the Blazers both deserved to lose every time they lost.""  Which is very unlikely and also a shitty-feeling conclusion to reach."
Just have a feeling Michael Porter Jr can potentially ruin a very good thing in Denver
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
Don’t forget michael Porter jr.
"You think Jarrett Allen is a 20 million dollar per year player?   You think Markkanen is worth 17?   That doesn't touch the terrible numbers Love and Rubio are on right now for a crap team.  Cedi Osman's on a bad contract.   Okoro doesn't look great, and there's debate about his long-term role. Took him over Haliburton.   It's year 3 for Windler, and he's unable to stay on the court (and has shown pretty much nothing), a guy they took over Nic Claxton, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole, and Keldon Johnson.   They don't seem to want to extend Sexton, a guy they took over SGA, Michael Porter, and Mikal Bridges.   And somehow, they're spending all of this money on big guys when they also have Evan Mobley, the guy you're actually trying to build around."

"yeah it's a stupidly good deal. mikal bridges gonna make 20 a year when he is 23. duarte is gonna be on his rookie deal hitting his ""prime"" who you rather pay? i dont think i'd be that surpricing if he at least competes with mikal. he is just making quarter of what he pulls. michael porter jr gonna be on 207 over 5 years... i'd take duarte over that really."
Michael Porter Jr has a good shot  Ja Morant as well
"The lakers pick package was the 4th pick, 2 first picks, and 1 pick swap. The sixers would offer 2 first picks and 4 pick swaps. Yes the lakers pick package is better, but unprotected picks and unprotected pick swaps that are very far down the line have a lot of value because of their potential to be high lottery picks. Think about what the nets gave up for harden- the most valuable part of that package was the picks far away in the future. So again, lakers with the better picks package, but the inclusion of unprotected picks and pick swaps 4+ years in the future helps the sixers offer a lot.  And again, I believe if you judge based on 2019 value: 2021 simmons, maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe &gt; 2019 ingram, lonzo, hart. Easily better tbh.  &gt; multiple teams would swoop in to beat that offer if lillard does become available for trade.  Is this possible? Absolutely. But when you narrow down the potential suitors, it's not clear that anyone would beat the sixers offer.  Warriors: IMO they would be favorites to trade for lillard. But they would have to give up most of their future assets, and owner Joe Lacob has gone on record multiple times that the warriors don't want to give up their future. So it's not clear that they would go all in.  Nuggets: they had a good package, but after giving Michael Porter jr the max, the poison pill clause kicks in, so he's basically impossible to trade this season. Murray + picks does not beat sixers offer.  Celtics: would have to include jaylen to beat the sixers offer. Seems unlikely that they would do that.  Knicks: would have to give up RJ, a haul of picks, and quite possibly quickley and more. I do not believe the knicks would give up their whole future for a duo of dame/randle.  If I'm forgetting anyone let me know. But I think it's quite possible the sixers would end up with the best package."

"James Harden is a savant,  If you don't like his style, you're a sucker  Kyrie gave a real effort on defense last year and it made him a better overall player  Michael Porter Jr was an overpayment and Nuggets fans are going to turn on him before the end of the season  I said it here 2-3 years ago (under a diff acct) that Dame would want out of portland by 2022, if the Blazers didn't materially improve in 2 years. They haven't but his focus on loyalty has hamstrung him to staying with a team that can't win. He'll be forgotten like many other great players who couldn't overcome the 2nd round  KAT and Beal are two high scoring, low impact players and I'm tired of pretending they are not. They can be the best players on a bad team night in-night out but can't contribute to winning. Fight me.     One more: LeBron is pulling an anti-jordan to make a case for his greatness. He's going around getting rings for other players like some odd-sort of Anti-Thanos because in 20 years there will be 60 players that all got a ring from LeBron just carrying them to the finals. And that will be a great argument against Jordan. It's like an RPG where you can do AOE damage or single target damage. LeBron is the AOE of championship rings."
"I don't think it's unfair to Kyrie, since I feel this should be the standard for all teams/players.  So rather I think it's unfair for other players ""getting away"" with it rather than one player catching consequences (and he still gets half his salary, cry him a river).  But the only part I \*do\* think is unfair to Kyrie is that no one is clowning Bradley Beal or Michael Porter Jr for their similarly idiot stances.  I guess Kyrie's extra special since when mandates rolled around Bazemore and Wiggins went along with it (and that's kind of the point, push holdouts to get it)."
"Michael Porter Jr was maxed due to potential. MPJ's last 30 games last season was superstar level (no, I didn't say all-star).   Ayton has shown almost no star potential. He is a great starter/borderline all-star type of player. His development curve has been incremental at best. There have no jump in his development. His defense is average for a C; it is a huge leap to say he has anchored any defense."

"Anyone who thinks the Suns fucked up here needs to look at the John Collins situation. Same exact thing. JC wanted a max, Hawks didn't blink, media hyped up a mid-season trade, that didn't happen, then they hyped up the possibility of an offseason deal with another team, that didn't happen, then he got a contract that was fair value for both him and the team. The only consequence of note was a way better cap sheet for the Hawks.  In order for someone to pull him away with a max there needs to be a team with a max slot that's willing to throw down on Ayton. He's really good, but he's not a max player, and I think front offices know that. Not to mention that that extent of cap space is almost extinct nowadays. (And IMO Michael Porter Jr. wasn't worth a full max either - rare mistake by the Nuggets FO)"
Michael Porter Jr. looks like the high school bully in a 2005 coming of age comedy
“Future Fox News commentator Michael Porter Jr.”
"Michael Porter Jr: He always camps waay out in the sea port. Would rather live there despite being ""big"" enough to be ""inside"" the city."
"OG’s creation is primarily summed up by baseline drives. He’s not much of a ball handler based off of last season, all his 3s come from the catch and shoot, he doesn’t take many mid rangers, etc. He does these things more than Mikal but he still doesn’t do them that much. He’s primarily an off ball player. I’ve seen a fuck ton of raps games as a local Canadian, and all the stats back this stuff up too.  OG is not at all the most versatile defender. That would go to bam, or Draymond, or giannis. And yes defence is a slight edge. This is how you can tell you have home team bias. Bridges is nothing short of an all defensive caliber wing. He was the best defender on the suns (who were a great defensive team btw) until the playoffs when Ayton took his game to another level. I also don’t see how he got at all worse defensively in the playoffs. He was the primary defender against Michael Porter Jr who struggled immensely. He played Paul George well, PG just had an absurd series cause he’s a borderline top ten player. Against the bucks too more often than not he did a great job on Middleton. Middleton was stupidly inconsistent. And again off ball defence, one of the most important areas of defence, is an edge Mikal has.   Being younger has 0 affect  on who’s better.  At the moment they’re both functionally elite 3 and D players. Neither stand out in any other area and both are on the same level as shooters and defenders. To act like there’s some big gap is complete nonsense."

Worst: I thought Lukas ceiling was a better passing Gallinari  Best: I thought Michael Porter Jr was gonna be a star and was stunned he dropped past the top 6.
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
I Was at game tonight and POKU is not afraid to shoot and made a few really nice passes. He looks like a goofy kid but it was fun to watch . I was enjoying watch players from Denver listen and react to Michael Porter Jr. He seems to be a leader and I was kind of suprised to see Jokic not talking to anyone or high fiving guys. Porter looked like a leader to me
Michael Porter Jr
For the third time I know suns fans are dumb but MPJ hurt his back in game one.   https://arizonasports.com/story/2681372/michael-porter-jr-tweaked-back-nuggets-game-1-loss-suns/?show=comments  Honestly you’re even dumber than the average suns fan. I keep repeating the exact same things to you and you aren’t even smart enough to change your argument. I already told you Jamal was injured this entire year and then continue to use that as a argument. I already told you MPj was hurt and you continue to argue. Like honestly what kinda idiot continues to argue against facts after repeatedly being disproven.  “One could argue that this years playoff teams had more preparation than any team previously” BRAIN DEAD TAKE.   Have a good day you aren’t smart enough live to even engage in conversation with.  I’m not gonna waste my time telling your dumb ass the same thing over and over.

"...that's what a max contract is.  The largest contract possible, including kickers to make it even bigger if he hits certain milestones.  That is literally the definition of a max contract.  You are talking about a SUPERmax contract, which is what Luka got.  You think you are right and literally every reporter is wrong?  Sweet christ, dude.  MPJ signed a maximum extension.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-porter-jr-nuggets-agree-to-five-year-designated-max-extension-guaranteed-for-145-3m-per-reports/#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future.-,Michael%20Porter%20Jr.,team%20during%20the%20upcoming%20campaign.  How are you gonna read articles from SI, CBS, ESPN, Woj, literally the Nuggets and MPJ themselves talking about the fact that is a maximum extension and then say ""No he didn't.""  The level of confidence, when you are shown clear sources proving you wrong, is literally astounding.  Max contracts are different for different players depending on certain milestones.  SGA also signed a max extension that is the same contract MPJ signed. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31945995/shai-gilgeous-alexander-agrees-5-year-172-million-maximum-rookie-contract-extension-oklahoma-city-thunder"
Because he did sign a max....  https://www.si.com/nba/2021/09/27/michael-porter-jr-contract-agrees-max-five-year-extension-nuggets  He signed the biggest contract possible which includes the super-max kicker if he were to make an all-nba team this year.  Same max extension that SGA signed.  Whatcha talking about?
"It’s hard to copy Denver. They’ve been one of the best drafting teams in the league. Getting Jokic in the second round is obvious, but they’ve also hit on a ton of mid to late first round picks.   ### All their first round picks were great in 2016  -	Jamal Murray (#7 Pick) -	Juan Hernangomez (#15) -	Malik Beasley (#19)  ### They got a solid player in 2017, despite not having a first round pick.  -	Monte Morris (#51)  ### Michael Porter Jr was obviously a steal in 2018  -	Michael Porter Jr (#14)  ### No Pick in 2019  ### Both their picks in 2020 seem to have potential   -	Zeke Nnaji (#22) -	RJ Hampton (#24)  ### Bones Hyland has played super well in pre-season  -	Bones Hyland (#26)"
"The peers he is talking about are likely other rookies who got max extensions. That list also includes guys like John Collins, Bam, Fox, and Michael porter Jr.    I think aytons agent has every right to say ""every rookie who plays like an above average starter gets a max extension. So why not my guy?"""

"Draymond is a great player, but I feel like he's a ""multiplier"" star, where he's bad as a first option, okay as a second option, and good as a first option. Draymond is at his best with a full fledged second star.   I haven't watched Jordan Poole in the preseason this year, and I'll definitely pay attention once the season starts. Even then, it sounds like he falls into the fringe all star players that all the teams I've mentioned have as well (Tobias Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Reggie Jackson, hell maybe even THJ).   What I'm trying to say is that all the issues you've resolved (depth, competent role players with solid BBIQ) that the teams above have also ""resolved."" The Warriors may at the top of the ""West Morass"" group and be 4th seed, but I still think it's hard to confidently say they'll knock any of the top 3 down."

"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
I’m always curious if teams place a greater emphasis on having a sports psychologist to help. I still think he has all the talent in the world to have been KD but he never seemed to be able to assert his talent and would be disappear in games if things didn’t align perfectly for him. I feared Michael Porter Jr would follow suit but I’m so glad MPJ is beasting

"I’ll say it, Michael Porter Jr."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"I recognize your position, but I see it a little differently.  LeBron inserts himself into the political and social conversation in our country.  He did that with his voting rights organization.  He did that with his related statements.  He's made a decision to try to influence other people.  It is absurd to automatically think that because a guy is good at hoops, he's also smart.  Rarely is that the case -- people are typically lucky if they get brains and brawn, rarely do they get both.  But LeBron is different.  He is clearly a smart guy who wants to be known for more than basketball.  So while I do not expect anyone to listen to Michael Porter Jr., I do expect them to listen to LeBron and be influenced by him.  Like Charles Barkley said, they're basketball players, not role models.  Except for Lebron, who clearly crossed over into role model territory and then dropped the ball with vaccines."
"Michael Jordan, Michael Redd, Michael (Mike Miller), Michael Porter Jr., Michael Finley, Michael Cooper, Michael (Mike) Conley, Mike Bibby.  Maybe we're short on size, but even so I am not taking Michael Olowokandi.  We're just going to play 5-out and shoot the hell out of the ball."
"Michael Porter Jr. hurt himself in his first game at Mizzou, didn’t play most if any of the rest of the regular season and still came back for a game in the tournament even though they weren’t likely to make a deep run or anything. I really respected that."
"Michael Porter Jr. hurt himself in his first game at Mizzou, didn’t play most if any of the rest of the regular season and still came back for a game in the tournament even though they weren’t likely to make a deep run or anything. I really respected that."
I wouldn’t say they built their defense to make up for him when their guards aren’t switchable and Michael Porter Jr. is a walking sieve. They should be last in defensive efficiency if that’s true
"Meanwhile Michael Porter Jr. has done, well, if not everything, a lot of the things Michael Malone has asked from him to become the player the Nuggets need to contend.  Gotta think real hard about how you got here if you're making MPJ look mature"
1 year ago 2018 Draft pick Michael Porter Jr was still technically a rookie
Michael Porter Jr is a shoe in this year
"Sure, but average annual value is a disengenuous way to represent a 5 year deal in a league that constantly adjusts it's salary cap.   He's not in the same tier as Luka, Trae Young, and Michael Porter Jr? He brought his team to the finals. Those guys all got the type of money he's looking for without the runaround from their orgs. Many teams would be happy to give Ayton what he wants, it's a bad call on the Suns part especially after Ayton watched CP3 get paid."
"alright you pedantic fuck, michael porter jr is incomparable to anyone in the league, happy now?"
The hidden benefit of the Nuggets extension for Michael Porter Jr.
"For real if Michael Porter Jr is getting that max rookie contract no reason why Ayton, a key piece for the suns going to THE FKN FINALS, shouldnt get a comparable deal.   I am offended for Ayton"
is Ayton more valuable than Michael Porter Jr. is the real question
"&gt;NBA GM Survey - Which team has the most promising young core?  &gt;Atlanta Hawks - 50% &gt;Houston Rockets - 10% &gt;Boston Celtics - 7% &gt;Memphis Grizzlies - 7% &gt;New Orleans Pelicans - 7% &gt;Phoenix Suns - 7%  The Nuggets have an MVP, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon and their average age is 26.5. They probably only didn’t make the Finals last year because Jamal Murray was out."
"[[Wojnarowski] Ayton, a key part of the Suns’ run to the 2021 NBA Finals, has no intention of accepting a deal less than the comparable max contracts that several of his 2018 NBA Draft classmates signed, including Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Michael Porter Jr.](https://www.twitter.com/wojespn/status/1445389465153904644)"

"Michael Porter Jr said something about not feeling comfortable taking the vaccine, and I saw some guy comment “He's always going to be one of those ‘what if?’ guys”.  First of all, what a weird thing to comment about a guy that’s 23 and entering only his 3rd season. Second, how did you come up with that basketball related conclusion based on something that has nothing to do with his abilities on the court?"
"I’m like Kevin Porter Jr?  Michael Porter Jr. oh no, Otto Porter Jr"
My brain totally shortcutted this to Michael Porter Jr of the Nuggets when I read this and was very confused for a minute.
Still feels like yesterday when Luka and Trae  were never going to be a top 2 pick.  People agreed with Ayton but said Sacramento was going to screw it up picking Bagley.  Ayton was a big with small ball being the offense for most NBA teams and Bagley wasn't great at Duke.   I liked Trae and Michael Porter Jr. as the two players in that draft. As a Bulls fan fuck Wendell Carter and I even said it at the time.
"""That's what they want you to think"" - Michael Porter Jr."
Michael Porter Jr is the other one I thought of
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"
"Also Jokic. The Nuggets don't exactly know what led to their WCF appearance in 2020 but its the closest they've gotten to the Finals in like forever.   They probably locking him in cause they think he has something special that the team needs to really stand out.  Also he *is kinda young so...*  (His RAPM stats according to craftednba are noteworthy!.   He's actually one of the best offensive players you can ask for ,except for his passing which is dogshit, but he has Jokic who can make the passing based the decisions for him. He kinda needs to work on his use of his gravity for creation I mean he has a fuckton of gravity shooting 45% from 3 and being a good rim finisher too! Also his abiltiy to draw freethrows could be worked on as he is a rim threat and should regularly be going to the line like Karl Malone!)[https://craftednba.com/players/michael-porter-jr.]    But all in all I think this guy could improve his game by not being a dumbass Facebook sheep!"
"I saw NBA Star Michael Porter Jr. at a grocery store once. He kept trying to steal chewing gum from the shelf near the cash register. Security kept asking him to leave but he kept saying “do you know who I am? I’m NBA star and .” I told him I’d tell everybody how he was acting but he said “Go ahead nobody will even believe you when you say Michael Porter Jr. was stealing chewing gum from Kroger’s and harassing minimum wage workers. Don’t cross the blue line!” I was like “ what? Why isn’t this clown wearing a mask?” And then he punched a baby and ran out and I think he said “Nobody will believe any of you!!” But I don’t know, like I said he was running out."
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"Bingo.  This guy didn’t form his opinion on the basis of the last year or two, or him having covid, this was his opinion long before.  Here are his comments from 2020:  ""being used obviously for a bigger agenda... for population control in just terms of being able to control the masses of people. I mean, because of the virus the whole world is being controlled."" He added, ""you're required to wear masks... and who knows what will happen when this vaccine comes out? You might have to have the vaccine in order to travel. Like, that would be crazy.""

"I'm a 5'7"" 190 pound fat ass borderline obese dude with bad eye sight and prostatitis who probably runs a 5.5 40 If I trained.  After the first Jab my arm stung for for half a day the following day and it cleared by that night  After the second jab I had body aches and headache that night and the following day but even that cleared the following by lunch time.   My guess is Michael Porter Jr. Is far healthier me. Stop being a little bitch and get the shot  so that 10 year old Timmy over there who has asthma and can't get the shot due to his age doesn't get covid."
"Porter being anti-vaxx has nothing to do with what he learned from getting Covid twice. He was anti-vaxx in July 2020, and he claims he's never had a vaccine in his life.  [From July 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/now/denver-nuggets-michael-porter-jr-pushes-wild-coronavirus-covid19-conspiracy-anti-vaccination-033113715.html):  &gt; “Personally, I think that the coronavirus is being used obviously for a bigger agenda,” Porter said. “It’s being used for population control in just terms of being able to control the masses of people. &gt;  &gt; “Because of this virus, the whole world is being controlled. You’re required to wear masks, and who knows what’ll happen when this vaccine comes out. You might have to have the vaccine in order to travel. That’d be crazy.”  It's irresponsible to print his nonsense without doing any reporting about what he's saying."
"This is a compelling argument. With evidence such as  &gt;you literally paid him $205 million dollars and that is just straight up ridiculous for Michael Porter Jr.  and   &gt;Let me say it again:      $205 MILLION dollars      For      Michael…..Porter……Jr…..  You must be a high level lawyer, because nobody could argue with this flawless logic."
You’re still paying Michael Porter Jr $34 million dollars if he is trash. Say goodbye to your cap space
Michael Porter Jr.  Probably I like the way he hits those contested shots.
"&gt;That’s the thing is he isn’t even those “all natural” hippy type anti vax people  He definitely is. He was raised raw vegan because his mom ""did the research"" and found out how tErRibLE meat is for you.

"[Another fun stat from Andy Bailey](https://twitter.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1442615190348918784)  &gt;Denver scored 120.2 PTS per 100 possessions when Michael Porter Jr. was on the floor in 2020-21.  &gt;Among those who appeared in 30+ gms &amp; played 20+ MIN/gm, Kevin Durant (121.7), Kawhi Leonard (121.4) &amp; Nikola Jokic (120.2) were the only players who matched or exceeded MPJ's ORtg."
"I'll repost what I commented to someone else.  He hasn't missed a game to a back injury as a pro after sitting out his first season. According to surgeons, the re-herniation rate is 10-12% over a 10-year span for the procedure he had. And, if he did have a re-herniation he would get the same procedure again and would not affect his return to basketball. There have been 61 NBA players who have had the same surgery. I think his prospects look pretty good to have a long and healthy career.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/15/17362958/michael-porter-jr-nba-draft-stock-pick-back-injury-surgery"
"Line item number 1: ""For your consideration, you, Michael Porter Jr. agree, unambiguously to be vaccinated prior to the first day of the month of October, year 2021. Failure to comply will leave you in default of this contract.""   I mean that's not true, but if I was going to give someone 207 million dollars, that would be my first stipulation. Good luck Nuggets."

"But if they did trade down with Dallas, they still might had a chance at Bagley at the 5, or most likely would've ended up with Jaren Jackson Jr or Michael Porter Jr. I know the Kings FO is trash, but if they knew how much Dallas wanted Luka, they could've bluffed and gotten more than what the Hawks got. Vlade somehow picked the worst timeline possible."
"I totally agree. Even if he ends up being just okay, they’ll have a few years to make the decision for his extension. I think that, similar to Michael Porter Jr, he may just need more reps at a high level to develop. He essentially went from high school to the NBA. And even if he washes out, it’s not like they’re tied to him long term."

"Ok.   Michael ""I don't feel like anyone can guard me"" Porter Jr.  https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/07/michael-porter-jr-nuggets-suns-defenders/"
"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/07/michael-porter-jr-nuggets-suns-defenders/  Admittedly the full quote isn't as bad, but he did literally say ""I don't think anybody can guard me"" when asked about the Suns defending him.  The full quote makes it obvious it's just that he is confident in his game, it wasn't a shot at the Suns specifically.  It's more like ""when I'm locked in, I don't think anyone in the league can guard me.""  Honestly that is pretty much a normal attitude for a great scorer in the NBA.  Though given how poorly he shot the ball in the series, I can see why people might clown it a bit."
"Michael "" No one on the Suns can guard me"" Porter Jr."
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"

"So yeah the Nuggets had time to practice without Murray, but he is still a star (almost) player and the Nuggets are clearly a diminished team without him.  Players are not interchangeable parts.  Michael Porter Jr was tasked with taking more shots and creating shots on his own and while he did better than expected, the Nuggets were not able to replicate Murray's shotmaking.  The original post that the Suns have faced playoff opposition with injured stars in every series is still completely valid.  Not that it diminishes their accomplishment and Chris Paul was pretty banged up during the Laker series."
"The first thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Luka Doncic.  The second thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Trae Young.  The third thing wrong with Marvin Bagley III is that he isn't Shay Gilgeous-Alexander.  I could continue with Michal Bridges, Michael Porter Jr., Colin Sexton but you get the picture.   He turned out (largely but perhaps not only) because of injuries to be a lesser player than some of his 2018-Draft contemporaries."
You don't disrespect Michael Porter Jr like that!
Easy. It's the Dim Reaper. Michael Porter Jr. Mr antivax himself
"Formatting iasues haha. Some of those opinions i have at the first look are crazy. But when it is looked deeper, all of them  after this season look realistic - Houston showed they have good team potential. Kenyon is good, Tate is good Khyri Thomas can be x factor, Kevin Porter Jr will surely be elite, every one forgots about Eric Gordon, it only takes Kevin Porter Jr improvments in consistency and drafting right guy (Mobley) to turn the things up. Their struggles comes from inexpirience and from the fact Wood is not True defensive anchor ( why i wish  they draft Mobley). About Ntilikina he shot 47% from the three while being good defender-he can be shorter shooting guard, because of insane wingspan but Thibs is afraid or what ever. Gobert there is no need to explain yes he was in the paint but it is not center role to run and contest corner three pointers in drop schemes, it should be wing roles. About Mikal Bridges, he had in the regular season pull up midranges and it looked okay-his ball handling improvments are real and i am sure suns will work on his pull up shot to become a threat so opponent  will have harder time to guard him. Toronto has high draft pick, their development is nice, they arent bad team but injuries and no home court ruined them. While Lowry is year older, there is always a possibility someone of the raptors bench mob players has a break out. And honestly about break outs, i expect Og Anunoby break out, while Chris Boucher, even though not so young can still get some weight and become even better defender. Michael Porter JR had a hard time in the playoffs(was guarded by only consistent defender on the Portland trail blazers, Covington, and also good suns wing defense) but Michael Porter Jr in the regular season was hitting  pretty wild shots without hesitation, and has shown he can be good pull up shooter. He will work on quickness and counter moves and it will make him into next Kd. Poetl showed improvments in pnr defense. He is ok on switch but struggles come in the moment when he need to choose coverage - he gets stuck. It will change though. Dejounte gaining weight and strenght will also help because spurs pnr defense is  affected by  Dejounte struggles at fighting trough screens. ."
"Mikal Bridges can develop all three levels of scoring - spot up, pull up and at the rim, in a really short time : my opinion it will happen in next two seasons. And another: Poetl will become better at defending in space and become dpoy level impact defender (already elite rim protector, but struggle in defending space aka pnr) And another one: Ntilikina is nba  level player and he should play as shooting guard #FREENTILIKINA Michael Porter Junior will be next Kevin Durant Houston will be contenders(i hope they draft Mobley) nex season, Kenyon Martin Jr will be in the race for Most improved player and Khyri Thomas is nba level player his defense is insane. Utah need better defenders to be the true contenders- Gobert cant hold whole defense on his own and Utah failure is not his fault Raptors will be back stronger than ever and B mis season be title favorites"
"Coached Michael Porter Jr. at Nathan Hale, the top ranked high school in the nation. I watched them beat Marvin Bagley’s Sierra Canyon."
Michael porter jr is a jrpg character
"I don’t think many of these have a ton of predictive value for Michael Porter Jr  I also dislike using 2nd year stats. Guys who miss year 1 with an injury tend not to have the same type of developmental curves.  Just look at Simmons, Embiid and Blake Griffin. Their curves are all way flatter than any of the listed wings.  That said, he’s young, still kinda raw and very good. Just don’t think ascribing the improvement of others to him is particularly useful."
Lol! We’ll give you Michael Porter Jr but we just absolutely can’t give up Monte Morris
"Yeah he was injured this past season but he’s definitely solid and has great potential.  Right now he’s on the tier below luka and trae.. Ayton may be on their tier now but below those three it’s a toss up between SGA, JJJ, &amp; Michael Porter Jr.    Honestly 2018 was a nice class with Huerter, mikal bridges, miles bridges, and several other solid players later in round 1 &amp; even 2"
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they’d take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
Id stay put and take as many swings as you can.   All stars get drafted late every year. For the next couple of years y’all can take shots on injury guys like Michael Porter Jr. You can go after the raw athletic guys like Kawhi and PG13. You can go after the awkward but skilled European guys like Jokic. You just have to hit once or twice. All of those guys were outside the top 10 I believe.

"PG - Jamal Murray  SG - Mikal Bridges  SF - Michael Porter Jr  PF - Jae Crowder  C - Ben Simmons  If he's gonna be shit at shooting even free throws, small-ball 5 it is for Ben."
Also have you not heard of Michael porter Jr? Remember his 22 point first quarter in game 6… wouldn’t trade him for Simmons lol
"Michael porter jr. For Simmons. Simmons plays defense, Porter jr. does not"
Y’all took miles bridges over michael porter jr 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Miles is the definition of a bum.
and AD and Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley and Will Barton and a Michael Porter Jr and CP3 in round 1… who am I missing?
PG: Jamal Murray (2016)  SG: Devin Booker (2015)  SF: Michael Porter Jr (2018)  PF: Jayson Tatum (2017)  C: Joel Embiid (2014)
Cavs first rounders  2020 - Halliburton  2019 - Garland  2018 - Michael Porter Jr  2017 - no pick  2016 - no pick
I know this isn’t r/nfl but Cole Beasley is one of the stupidest people in sports and I watch Michael Porter Jr.
michael porter jr
"He also drafted Jerome Robinson over Michael Porter jr, so he’s not always right"
I don't even know what Ben's trade value is at this point regardless of his contract.    Like Ben for Michael Porter Jr at this point would get a laugh from Denver.
Having already had this type of back surgery several times at his age is more than concerning for Michael Porter Jr.
"It's sad that the nuggets got destroyed by injuries. I mean even with Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr out, they still have Barton and Gordon who are good players. If they were fully healthy, they're contenders."
I’ve been telling people that Lauri can legitimately be our Michael Porter Jr.
"Grant wanted a bigger role with more usage. Nuggets wanted that role for MPJ so Jerami found a team that would give him what he wanted. Denver offered to match the deal but he said no.  Nuggets mismanaged that whole affair.  &gt; Jerami Grant on leaving Nuggets: “My growth as a player is extremely important to me” &gt; In their sales pitch, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant to help develop him as a player, a source said. It didn’t matter. After Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., **the best the Nuggets could offer him was a fourth option in a budding offense**. They believed that was compelling enough, in addition to the opportunity to play for a title contender."
"I mean maybe my grandma was an asshole, families are complicated so that could be a valid thing to say if you have the appropriate closeness.   But in this situation we’re talking about Michael Porter JR someone who we all have a parasocial relationship to, so your example here is a bit different.   Still yeah you can say what you don’t like about someone and still wish them all the best. Don’t take things so personally not all our qualities are positives and we’re all growing. Addressing things helps us grow faster."
"no, it's literally the same max as shai's for the first 4 years (unless shai gets all-nba selections this year).  5th year is partially guaranteed which is just a prearranged buy-out.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/shai-gilgeous-alexander-26977/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/denver-nuggets/michael-porter-jr-26980/  shai has the contractual language that says it could be a baby-supermax like luka's, but currently they both just have the basic 25% rookie max extension for their draft class."
Michael “Joel Embiid” Porter Jr
They could tank for 14 and draft Adrian Griffin Jr. Who's like Michael Porter Jr. In the sense he's a top 5 talent with just constant unrelenting injuries.
"They have Jokic and Murray, as good a duo as you could ask for.....and paired them with Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon......"
"Kudos to Michael Porter Jr., he played just over a 100 games, averaged 14/6/1 and got $150 million guaranteed.    Nuggets obviously really dumb but respect the player lol"
"I looked into a few like Michael Porter Jr. and Tomas Satoransky. It looks like MPJ didn't really suffer any kind of a decline but Tomas Satoransky did.  In the future, I'm probably going to see if there are any more NBA players who have seen this type of decline, and embiid is definitely on that list (once more data becomes available)"
Michael Porter Jr.   Can’t get much more underwhelming than a season ending injury for an injury prone player. He was at the top of many draft boards along with Doncic and Ayton prior to his 1 year at Missouri.
"&gt; no, a backcourt of Campazzo and Rivers is not a good team  You forgot Markus Howard, aka Michael Porter Jr Jr."
"You must have gone into the thread after a loss or after a bad play by Bol. He's actually a fan favorite.  If I had to pick polarizing players, I would say it's Michael Porter Jr. and Will Barton. Lately, Facu has become polarizing as well."
Michael Porter Jr extension was a disaster the day it was signed
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"I thought it was to early for Michael Porter Jr getting the max, especially how he was playing early season. Idk if he's guaranteed all that, hope he recovers but if this injury could possibly affect his future it's cool he got his payday."
"Somewhere in Florida, Michael Porter Jr.'s lumbar vertebrae begin to twitch.."
"i hope harden, doncic, paul george, phoenix and brooklyn never win a ring, Curry never gets out of the West again, Nuggets realise they wasted all their money on Michael Porter Jr for nothing, Kyrie gets waived, Daryl Morey destroys the 6ers by not trading simmons, and finally Boston stay mediocre"
"And why do we use them? I get calling him Larry Nance Jr because Sr is relevant to us, but I don't care about Michael Porter so I'll call his son Michael Porter."
fuck michael porter jr
"Michael Porter Jr is a fuck face McGee. He did nothing to me, but I don’t like him &amp; whenever he loses I chortle with rapturous glee"
yea because michael porter Jr and kawhi are in the same tier of a player
Michael Porter McGrady Jr.   I’m so sorry Nuggets fans.
"It’s almost like the nuggets look like a completely different team without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji. Who could have predicted this?"
Too much positional overlap with Tobias Harris? Grant played with Michael Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic and was an absolute stud. I’m sure he could coexist with another great shooter and another great center
&gt; Even without Jokic that's a good win.      They were also missing Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. Not what I'd call a good win but they ended up taking care of business.
High- Mo Williams 52 points Low- Michael Porter Jr. Playoff career high 28 points I know he’s young and only played 2 seasons but the way he shoots I thought he could get an efficient 30 especially with Jamal Murray out last year
Neg MRI is good news! Here’s a link about his back when he was drafted. Explains everything well.  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2018/6/15/17362958/michael-porter-jr-nba-draft-stock-pick-back-injury-surgery
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard: .277 ws/48 3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.   I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt; Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.   Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.   As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts per hundred when he checks in, that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.   &gt; Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.   I don't know what your point is here with the whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team. Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.   &gt; And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.   3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.   I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.   Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.   The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.   If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.   [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
"I appreciate the super passive aggressive and condescending post so I hope you like mine in response.  &gt; The Blazers suck bro lol who cares  I dunno the media, the gamethreads here when it happened, players reacting to it, Lillard saying it was unexpectable to lose to a team missing so many important guys. I mean sure man whatever you want to say, I guess they do suck--at least compared to how the Nuggets played that series.  But then again they had more wins last year than New York, Atlanta, Miami, Boston, LA, same amount as the Mavs. They found a way to suck all the way to that point, and Lillard found a way to suck to All-NBA second team.   Also, Jokic got exploited by the Blazers on defense in that series?   Sheesh how did a team who was fully healthy, with the league's 3rd leading scorer, with the 20th best scorer in the league next to him, and just for kicks another 17ppg scorer, lose to the Nuggets if it was going to be so easy to expose the cornerstone of their defense?  I mean the Nuggets were missing their two starting guards and their best guard defender, how did Portland lose when those All-NBA level scorers were being guarded by two 5'9"" rookies, one of which who hadn't played all year, Austin Rivers who just got signed by the team and doesn't know the defensive concepts, Monte Morris who is not known for his defense, and a two-way contract player you've likely never heard of named Shaq Harrison.  I mean jeez you'd expect that to just be a free bucket every time down the floor, especially when there's this center that you have pointed out got EXPLOITED!!! all series!   I mean if the Nuggets have all these terrible defenders (who also can't score) because they're missing two starters, and their most important player keeps getting exploited on defense, how could they even possible keep up with the kind of scoring pace Portland must have been on?   Someone on the Nuggets must have had a really special performance to pull out a win like that I guess!  Anyway I'd kill to get some examples of that from you because I've watched the whole series multiple times. I do not think that Jokic got exploited whatsoever on defense, besides what teams try to get switch wise on every center in the league from Zubac to Gobert to Bam, or what happens when your guards are rookies who can stay in front of anyone and give up free lanes to the basket forcing 2v1s.   As far as the Suns go I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. That Jokic didn't guard the Suns guards that well? No kidding! Imagine a 7fter who can run around and guard CP3 all the time. It doesn't exist. Giannis gets killed by him, AD gets killed by him, Bam gets killed by him, that's why they force those switches onto bigs.  That's like me saying to you that Jimmy Butler is a terrible defender because Embiid kept exploiting him. Couldn't stop Embiid. Got torched by him, it was obvious to anyone watch.   It's like yeah man, this is a game of advantages. You work to find the best advantage you can, like getting a 7ft center on a wing player, or getting the switch as a PG vs. a center.   Your ""it was obvious to anyone watching"" comment is even more ironic be because when Jokic has the highest defensive splits on the team that series. He was without question the Nuggets best defender.  It would have been super obvious to anyone watching what was happening there. Not only was Jokic not the one getting exploited/exposed on defense by the Suns guards. It was Michael Porter Jr. who got switched onto quite literally 90% of the possessions he was in the game. That's what the press conferences were about when defensive questions were asked to Malone. That's why reporters asked CP3 if they were singling him out because they knew it was a weakness.   Additionally if you were watching the game you'd have realized that we had absolutely horrific point of attack defense. Again, another thing you can either watch or hear Michael Malone talk about in the pressers.   Monte Morris, Austin Rivers, and Facu Campazzo could not stay in front of the Suns guards for the life of them. CP3 and Booker were blowing by them like there was no defender there, when they weren't switching onto MPJ, and making the big have to step up and deal with the penetration while also somehow trying to play the lob threat to Ayton. Whether it was Jokic, or McGee, or Green, all of them kept getting put in 2v1 situations in the midrange/key because the guard defense was so spectacularly bad.   If it's too much trouble to watch that and see that indeed the sky is blue, the stats also back that up as one of the worst perimeter defensive performance of all time. No hyperbole."
He is carrying Denver right now.   At least last season he had half of it with Murray and Michael Porter Jr looked really good.
Michael Porter jr
I'll say it Michael porter Jr🤷‍♂️
Surprise nobody even mentioned Michael porter jr
"My personal head canon is that Malone doesn't actually care either way but overheard that it bothers Michael Porter Jr to go by ""Mike"" so Malone made  that point about his name being ""Michael"" to take the public image hit on behalf of MPJ.  I actually met Malone at a brewery last year after he got back from the bubble, super nice guy. He was there with his buddies and I don't recall any of them referring to him as ""Michael"" but I was just calling him ""coach"" the whole time anyway."
He’s having a better season than Michael Porter Jr
Just say you’re dumb next time and move on. Hope everything works out with Michael Porter Jr.’s back though ♾

"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"

The fact that y’all got Michael Porter Jr was just crazy good luck. So much upside with that kid.
shouldn’t Curry be working out with Otto porter jr not Michael porter jr?

"Patrick Williams, Michael Porter Jr, and this one may be controversial but if Coby White goes to a place where he can be a first option and primary ball handler he can be VERY good. once his develops his playmaking and consistency shooting the ball he could be a Trae Young type player"
Michael Porter Jr I think could become a top 5 or top 10 player in the league in the next few years myself  LaMelo Ball most definitely for LaMelo

Michael Porter Jr   Been saying since before the draft he will end up a superstar before its all said and done. Really hope to see him stay healthy and see what jumps he can make this year
"Michael Porter Jr, Kevin Porter Jr"
"This is a tricky question.  All the NBA players are very good at the basketball thing. A guy like Luke Garza was the player of the year in college and a late-second-round pick whose only pro potential is overseas. But, very few can be superstars in the way you described.  There's the added layer of there being a lot of ""stats guys"" on bad teams. Putting up points on the Cavs or Magic or Kings is a lot different than being a superstar. I don't even think SGA is a good example. You can't have a young player on a team that is taught that losing and franchise turnover is good and then expect them to be more than a stats guy.  So, I suppose I will go with four options:  Jamal Murray - Is very close. So close that ""Could Denver have made the Finals if Murray was healthy?"" is a fairly legit argument. Being the second-best player on a Finals team means the player in question is really, really good.  Michael Porter Jr. - Nowhere near as close as Murray and much more unlikely to reach star level. But, if ability/health/work ethic ever comes together? Watch out.  Jaylen Brown - Will he ever be the best team on a Finals contender? Not sure. I do think he can be the second-best player on a Finals teams. Before you scoff at that, the second-best player for the most-recent Finals teams were Olympians.  Cade Cunningham - Don't want to hear top draft picks? Welp, don't give a fuck. The guy has never played a second of NBA ball and I think he will be the best #1 pick since LeBron. Will be a perennial all-star and will win a title sooner than LeBron, Giannis, KD, etc. That is delusional and far-fetched for many. But, I think he's that damn good. And, like MJ during his title spree and Duncan during the Spurs stretch, he has the chance for a run of greatness where the more established stars are aging out and where younger players aren't as developed."
"Michael Porter Jr. Dude plays crazy in the first half and always slows down for some reason. If he can create more shots and play more consistent d, he’ll help joker get a trophy."

"Mike Conley, MJ, Michael Cooper, Michael Finley, Michael Porter Jr"
Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  &amp;#x200B;  lmao
"I have the exact opposite opinion of Michael Porter Jr. He's a huge defensive liability - it's a combination of bad defensive IQ, limited effort, and unimpressive lateral quickness. On offense he's an impressive shooter and has good athleticism, but his handles need to improve if he's going to be more than a Harrison Barnes / Rudy Gay type. He's also bad at reading the defense and very bad at passing, although that can be improved."
"1. LeBron‘s championship window is closed.  2. Harden, Luka, and Trae will be completely fine with the new rule changes, but Embiid and Butler will have worse seasons than they did in 2021 as a result of them.  3. Jayson Tatum is not a fringe top-10 player. He’s not clearly ahead of any of Booker, Beal, Trae, and Mitchell. Those 5 are close to interchangeable. His defensive edge is not great enough to clear him from the other 4, who are significantly better playmakers.  4. The Blazers organization has failed to surround Damian Lillard with sufficient talent, but he should also be held accountable for their postseason woes. He is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and his playmaking is a significant notch below that of other elite point guards (Steph, Luka, Harden, Trae, CP3). He can be an excellent second option, but can’t be the centerpiece of a championship team.  5. Julius Randle’s 2021 season was an anomaly, and it will have been his peak.  6. Michael Porter Jr. is not a max-extension worthy player yet. He is a lights-out shooter, but his IQ lapses and inability to become an elite defender (injury limitations) will be a problem for him and the Nuggets in the future.  7. Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson are the two most overrated players in NBA history.  8. Kevin Garnett at his peak was better than Tim Duncan at his peak.  9. Stephen Curry is the best offensive player ever.  10. The Suns will win the 2022 NBA Championship."
"&gt;2) Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  i wouldn't say this is unpopular but a very bold take. murray was so good in the bubble run, and porter has had injury issues as well so it's hard to say how it will shake out but it'll be great basketball"
"1. The Utah Jazz were a fluke last year, and won't finish higher than a 5th seed this season. 2. Westbrook will not be the starting point guard for the Lakers by the midway point of the season (possibly starting at the 2, with Malik Monk starting at the 1 to provide spacing). 3. The Nets won't get a ring with their big 3.   As a side note, I disagree with your Michael Porter Jr. assessment. I think his lack of ballhandling and distributing ability cap his potential. His defense is also lacking at times, and he is very streaky. I just don't see him being more than a sub allstar volume scorer unless he's handed the keys to the offense fulltime and given a chance to grow into that role. I don't see that happening with Murray and Jokic.   I think he gets traded within the next couple of years to provide the pieces the Nuggets need to build around Murray and Jokic."
"&gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  Oh wow this is an extremely hot take. 2022-23 I can somewhat see due to MPJs limitless potential but right now he's not at that level yet.  I can agree he's better in the regular season but Murray's offensive IQ, shotmaking, chemistry with Jokic means he's much better in the playoffs. And I'm not just talking about the bubble, talking about 18/19 as well   Edit - my unpopular opinion is that Kyrie Irving will NEVER be a first option on a successful playoff team due to mediocre passing and non-existent defence plus polarising personality"
"&gt;Zion and Brandon Ingram will not work out as a duo. Ingram is good but his lack of defense is too much to overcome.  is Ingram a bad defender? he was legit really good at it as a Laker?  &gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  What has MPJ done to prove that he's better than Murray right now?  &gt;The Bulls have turned themselves into the next Pacers. They have a bunch of good players but no great players. They’re not going to win a playoff series with this core.  That's just common sense, THe bulls aren't a top 4 team in the east by any measure  &gt;NBA’s G-League Ignite is a waste of money. The G-League system as a minor league makes a lot of sense. However, competing with the NCAA is looking a gift horse in the mouth.  How is it a waste of money? if they can get better talent, then more people will want to watch those games."
There are different types of steals. Michael porter jr &amp; kuminga are different than Jokic &amp; draymond. Similiar to rodgers &amp; Brady. Very few said joker draymond &amp; Tom were steals at the time of the draft but they ended up being all time steals

Hooper = Michael Porter Jr.  Basketball player = Nikola Jokic
Michael Porter Jr was like that. Fell due to major health concerns but was previously considered one of the highest ceiling guys in his class. The Nuggets took a swing and it has paid off extremely well so far.
I'd assume Michael Porter JR. Could fill it up if he was the #1 option on a team. The guy just seems like a bucket whenever I watch.
Didn't Michael Porter Jr. come back from a back injury from before the draft?
" I've literally not heard one person say they think Kyrie is done and the Nets shouldnt extend him. Not one. I assume other players with multiple surgeries on a body part are also washed right? Michael Porter, Jr, Joel Embiid??  The fact that every single one of your comments is getting downvoted may suggested that this is not the default position you think it is..."
"I was comparing Saddiq to his contemporaries not trying to criticize him.  I was thinking of players versatility like Kelly Oubre, Michael Porter Jr, Jason  Tatum. Jaylen Brown, Cameron Johnson,  Kawhi Leonard,  Paul George,  John Collins etc."
Michael Porter Jr…no bias.
"2024 way too early Roster  PG - Morant, Lamelo Ball, Steph Curry/Trae Young  Wings - Ingram, B. Mitchell, Lavine, Tatum, Brown  Post - Williamson, Isiah Stewart, Michael Porter Jr/AD, John Collins  Note I'm only going with players who have played in a NBA game."
I think Michael porter jr has the best shot in terms of improved role. Shai and Zion they were already so good so idk.
"I don't have an issue with him being traded, but GMs should be more creative than stockpiling picks that are likely to be bad and not result in players who are going to contribute to winning over the next 3-4 years of Zion's career, which are most crucial for the organization.  Jrue was on a reasonable contract, a known monster two-way player, a consummate professional, and known as a great locker room guy.  They should've tried to trade him for a player like Michael Porter Jr., Brogdon/Turner package, Herro/Robinson - something better than just a bunch of late round picks."
I’ve been here trying to figure out when they got Kevin or Michael Porter Jr and completely forgot about Otto
is this the game when Reggie Miller was like “Michael Porter Jr. has done absolutely NOTHING tonight”  found [it](https://youtu.be/ukpWdAM_l0A)
Shai Gilgeous Alexander / Jamal Murray / Jerami Grant / Michael Porter Jr / Clint Capela
DeAaron Fox SGA Mikal Bridges Michael Porter Jr  DeAndre Ayton
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."
High on Zach Lavine. Feel he got lot of criticism for not being on a winning team like Booker on my own Suns but hopefully the Bulls get a 3rd/4th seed and he has his own good playoff games worth remembering like Bookers 47 point game or 40 point triple double  Low on Michael Porter JR. I rate him but I really felt the takes of him being better than Murray were egregious and he hasnt really created his own shots off the dribble.  He was getting hunted by CP3 on defense everytime whenever we played the Nuggets and I really really dont get the KD comparisons. A fine third option once Murray is back though
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
"I mean averaging 18.6 PPG on 13.3 shots is really efficient. Powell has also shot 40.5% from 3 on 4.7 3PA and 61.6 TS% over the last 3 years (41.1% on 6 3PA last year). He draws more free throws than Robinson too because he can put the ball on the floor and go to the hoop. Powell is a three level scorer that is also a great on-ball defender.   Like I agree that Robinson has a very defined role that he is very elite in, but I feel like a lot of people are disregarding how useful versatile, effective players are. A player that can hit shots created for him by his teammates and also create his own at a decent rate is for good teams. People say LeBron and shooters is ideal roster construction, but if LeBron is the only driving threat on a team, or only big time shot maker, or only inside threat, then that team is probably dogshit. Both types of players are very valuable if you want a good team.  [Look at the other players that averaged 18+ on 60+ TS% in 2020-21](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/2021-nba-players-with-more-than-18-ppg-and-higher-than-60-ts). There are 19 players and only 3 are non-allstars: Norm, SGA, and Michael Porter Jr. The other two are considered max money candidates (I am not suggesting Norm deserves a max). If the Blazers didn't pay him that much, another team would have. [Even looking at his Portland stats (17 PPG and 57 TS%)](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/2021-nba-players-with-more-than-17-ppg-and-higher-than-57-ts), there are only 26 players."
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
No but you were close - that's Michael Porter Jr.
"Oh, so now we're moving the goal post from ""throwing the game"" to ""quitting on the team in the last game"".  Is it that hard to fathom that the dude just sucked. He thought he was better than he actually is. I don't see anyone accusing Michael Porter Jr for ""quitting on the team"" when he bricks 4 shots in the last 2 mins.  And yea, stars leaving in FA. With the team getting no assets in return, sucks. I agree. LaMarcus Aldridge fcked over Portland. KD fcked over OKC. Lebron has literally made a career out of cannibalizing every team he's been on. This is just the reality of modern NBA.  Celtics fans playing the victim card is hilarious. Do you guys not remember the whole reason why Kyrie was available in the first place? He was a locker room cancer in Cleveland. Have you guys not been following the shitshow in Brooklyn this season?  This isn't some Kyrie only hates Boston situation. This is just Kyrie being Kyrie lol."
This is why I have the salary cap.  There are zero other ways in which Trae Young and Michael Porter Jr would be getting the same extension.
"&gt; MPJ can shoot offball. Thats literally it.  Through his age-22 season, Klay Thompson shot 40.6% from three on 5.4 attempts/game.   Through his age-22 season, Michael Porter Jr shot 43.9% on from three 4.6 attempts/game.   He might never be as good as a guy like Klay wound up becoming but it's 2021, you pay for shooting. MPJ is also an unbelievably good finisher around the rim, shot 84% from 0-3 feet last season, so let's not pretend like he's a Duncan Robinson style specialist, he's got legit game."
"That's fair. I personally don't think Chris Paul or Jrue Holiday raise the ceiling for the Clippers as much as Paul George does (we saw the carry job he did against the Jazz and Suns after Leonard went down). Not only did Jrue get a huge extension and Chris Paul is in line for one as well but, SGA is extension eligible this summer so he's gonna start making even more money than George now.   Also it's not as simple as you're putting it. Teams with high level assets get those leveraged in most trades they try to discuss. It's why in Lowry deals you saw Masai (rumored) asking for Simmons and Maxey and/or Thybulle from the 76ers, Herro and Precious from Miami, but only THT and Danny Green from the Lakers.   Im sure the Nuggets have been going through something similar with Michael Porter Jr.. Opposing teams know what assets you have and they're not going to let you be stingy lol"
"Not only is Brandon Roy coaching high school ball.... He was the high school coach of Michael Porter Jr. When I found that out, I've always been high on the kid. It's crazy that he slipped in the draft to Denver the way he did, they got an absolute steal with him."
Any chance you're thinking of Michael Porter Jr.? Or is Otto Porter Jr. anti-vax too?
"What I think most folks don’t completely understand yet is the importance of what the team does after drafting such guys.  The Lakers and their batch of young guys in the last few years are an excellent example.  The following guys were all on the Lakers roster: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball  The Lakers, when they had them, weren’t really about player development. So these guys faltered and were considered bench/role players at best. Now they’re all bonafide starters in the league.  The Spurs spent years developing Kawhi into the beast he is. Raptors have slowly but surely developed the non-lottery likes of OG, VanVleet, Siakam. Denver got an injured Michael Porter Jr falling to them, and, that’s a multiple time All-Star in the making.  Some teams are just better at player development than others. So yea, Jokic’s amazing in Denver, but had he been drafted by the Kings or Detroit, maybe he’d never have reached this point.  All this to say, the Kings suck, and should be relocated to Seattle. Thanks for reading."

"Hb this cuz you’re deep in my comments and feel free to call me crazy. Michael porter jr. any shot? 6’11”, shoots the 3. Can actually play 1-5 due to his size. Isn’t necessarily a playmaker and elite defender but he has the attributes in my opinion"

"Michael Porter Jr....  Am I being trolled? The dude is a horrible playmaker, and hasn’t shown the ability to even be a ball handler  You out here making no sense   DeMar as a secondary ball handler and 3rd option scorer would excel, saying otherwise of an All-Star whose won playoff series as the best player on his team is wild.   We can go through every team if you want to, the only area Jrue beats DeMar for sure is defense. DeMar is also one of the best volume finishers at the basket(0-3ft)"
"I’m sure the 76ers could have thought that when they traded Mikal Bridges.. we don’t need a rookie rn, let’s trade down and get a future first for another deal, a win now guy  Or the nuggets may have thought to not draft Michael Porter Jr... or the clippers could have not got Shai at #11, I guess you don’t need that.   I’d take shai over naw and that’s essentially what this trade down could do"

"OKC Thunder is a perfect example! And they are a way smaller market than Kansas City. The people of Oklahoma City had no idea they would enjoy an NBA team really, until Katrina hit N.O. and the Hornets needed a place to play while N.O. was rebuilt. It was a smash success.   Growing up watching KU dominate our local area and conference for so many years gave me a passion for the sport. Now that I am older and can watch all the guys I grew up watching at KU play in the league, I have become a pretty big NBA fan. I believe with what we have shown by hosting the Big 12 (R.I.P. soon) and NCAA Tournament rounds that we have the interest in basketball as a sport already built in and have show we have the capability to host NBA events. It's all about the Benjamin's...and something tells me that it would blow up. Imagine the people that would go to games just to watch their favorite local college stars in the league. We have 3 major universities that are supported in our city. Imagine a new KC team with Mizz star Michael Porter Jr on the squad. Or maybe reunite KU teammates, starter for Charlotte Devonte Graham and G-League monster Frank Mason ( Still don't understand why he doesn't play in the regular league!)? I can't think of anyone good from K State cause they suck and Mizz got lucky they had MPJ one year... ANYWAYS...You see the picture unfolding? It's the perfect recipe for success for the NBA and Kansas City. I honestly have no idea what goes into making that happen, but I feel like it would be a foolish to ignore the potential it could bring to my city."
"Yes J3 and JV are good players, as was Brandon Clarke last season, and I hope he turns it around this season, but the point being made is that, as it’d be true of Christian wood and Michael? porter jr(I hope I didn’t get my porter jrs mixed up again).   All that to say tha to thd guy’s point, yes a rookie guard can successfully take the reins of a team in the nba."
"i dont think ive seen any reasonable non troll say the bucks would have gotten crushed. The bucks are a fucking good team. The suns are a different story, and while they deserved their berth in the finals too, we cant really just ignore the fact that every team they faced this playoffs, including the bucks, had a major injury on their squad.  If bucks had donte divincenzo, its possible that bucks sweep or win in 5, never mind lebron, ad, murray, kawhi, and the plethora of smaller injuries like kcp, schroder, caruso, michael porter jr., pj dozier, serge ibaka, ivica zubac all playing a factor. Suns were the best west team this year because they beat everyone else in the battle of healthiness this year. But its magnitudes easier for most fans to accept bucks as champions because they have proven their quality of team over a longer period of time"
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it’s looking like he’s well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let’s see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I’d say it’s the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He’s averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he’s not super-efficient, his numbers don’t contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he’s fun and it’s good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren’t great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don’t hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year’s trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that’s it. He can’t pass the ball at a high level and he’s a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."

"Why in the hell isn't Michael Porter Jr being mentioned in this thread? This is exactly why he's having zero effect on the Sun's right now. He has no handle and can't make his own space. Whereas in the regular season or against bum Portland defense, he's got the extra 6 six inches to get the shot up and off."
"Both sides know the Nuggets lack floor spacing with where they are at right now and it's what's driving all this. Overloading the strong side, shading help towards Jokic, funneling drives certain directions, Nuggets just make it easier for all that with their injuries and the guys left to put around Jokic. Gotta set up the threat of Aaron Gordon as a cutter with how you horizontally distribute players. That and the Suns are going to prioritize rotating to the corner or the weak side pass which they know Jokic can obviously throw, you have to be able to find ways to align Michael Porter Jr where he's kind of ""splitting the difference per se"" between Jokic and the guys in the corner/lining up on the weak side. Make MPJ too close to Jokic its too easy to double Jokic and rotate back on MPJ, put him too far from Jokic doesnt do anything to help the spacing. All this and just running a few off ball simple flare screens on the weak side would help alot. Might be time to bring out the Jokic/MPJ pick and roll a few times ala Jokic/Murray even if it wont work the same with Jokic on ball."

Huh im talking about the game where Dame went 1-10 why are you talking about this game?  Jokic was mediocre too that game with only 16 points. Yes 1-10 shooting by Dame standards is a bad game. Stop being delusional. Still overall he is having an amazing series but he did have one bad game like it or not. Not sure whats to dispute here.  Also in that game Michael Porter Jr literally only scored 3 points but yes ignore that. Of course Blazers players are all bums and Nuggets have the best supporting cast in the league.

"He hasn't missed a game to a back injury as a pro after sitting out his first season. According to surgeons, the re-herniation rate is 10-12% over a 10-year span for the procedure he had. And, if he did have a re-herniation he would get the same procedure again and would not affect his return to basketball. There have been 61 NBA players who have had the same surgery. I think his prospects look pretty good to have a long and healthy career.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/15/17362958/michael-porter-jr-nba-draft-stock-pick-back-injury-surgery"

Devin Booker   Caruso has his number.    Mike Conley   Playoff Conley!! Best player on the Jazz right now.   Michael Porter Jr.   Kind of showing how limited he is when he isn't shooting at a super high level.   Ben Simmons   He's gonna be the reason they don't make it to the finals.
"- Devin Booker - needs to get sooo much better - Mike Conley - Elite point guard - Michael Porter Jr. - Solid - Ben Simmons - Very good, a jumpshot away from delivering the Sixers a Championship, but should've traded him for Harden"
Michael Porter Jr. what??!! Haha
"Kyle Kuzma seemed to have been playing more poised sometime this season. He was playing similar to how Michael Porter Jr. was playing, cutting and catch and shoot. But that didn’t last very long."
"I'm in a dynasty league. I traded Michael Porter Jr for Porzingis last year. So, it's going great."
"Michael Porter Jr kept bitching about wanting more shots and being the main option, now he’s the second option and he’s getting exposed 😂"
"First of all, perimeter defense isn't important to the point that it automatically makes someone a top 30 player. Secondly, he's clearly not even the best perimeter defender on his team (Thybulle). Offensively, he is a terrible floor spacer and is simply average to below average in the half court offense. He's pretty much a Draymond who traded interior defense for perimeter defense and touch around the rim. 30-40 seems like an appropriate spot for him.  On a side note, Ayton, Porzingis and Lonzo should not be on this list. Capela, Fox, Harris, Vučević, Michael Porter Jr and Randle are all contenders for those final spots."
"Michael Porter Jr, most likely"
Yea Jamal Murray and Michael Porter jr lmao
"Michael Porter Jr 3 foul wrong call (3 points)  Lillard jump ball, wrong call (2 points)  Porter Jr foul on Nurkic, wrong call (2 points)  Difference between a double digit lead"
I never realized how happy it makes me to see Michael Porter Jr get abused defensively
"Yeah, and hopefully teams like NOLA and Charlotte can make that leap and qualify for the playoffs soon so we can see LaMelo and Zion in these environments. I don't think either are talkers really, but who knows how they are when you put them on the big stage.   Also shoutout to Ayton and Michael Porter Jr. Both dudes have been balling out with the Suns and Nuggets this year and don't get much recognition because Luka and Trae are the stars of their class, but those guys are gonna be stars too."
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
I remember the Mavs announcers claiming Michael Porter Jr would have been the pick if Luka was gone.  Smart front office if that was the case

Michael “KD” Porter Jr
Has Michael Porter jr. never watched a blazers game? Dude is giving lillard 3 feet
The covid vaccine is the only shot Michael Porter Jr won’t take

i know who melo is and i don't know who michael porter jr is. debate settled.
Guys help me settle a debate... I think current Michael Porter Jr is better than Prime Melo with Denver.  Tell me why I'm wrong...
"Man has every right to be called by his full name bUUUUUUUUUUUUt Mike Malone flows so much better than Michael Malone. He is going against the grain. Michael Malone is an uncomfortable mouthful.  Jordan, Porter Jr don't have to constantly correct people. They just flow as Michaels."
"This whole time before reading your comment, I somehow thought everyone was talking about Michael Porter Jr because of the last name. So at least for me, he's not even established enough for a last name basis."
"Felt like Jokic was gonna carve them up regardless, but I am terrified of Michael Porter Jr. going forward. Great game."
"I’ll say it, Michael Porter Jr was not a clutch shooter tonight."
"Yep that's the thing though ""kinda"". It all depends on if Michael Porter Jr. goes to an even higher level. Like he needs to be averaging 25ppg for them to have a chance imo."
Michael Porter Jr. is going to put himself on the map in these playoffs. He will be the next big superstar.
I think you mean Michael Porter Jr and Kevin Porter Jr
That’s hype for PG but holy smokes that really puts into perspective Michael Porter Jr.’s insane 64.6% eFG!!!
Replace Marcus and markef with Michael porter jr and jontay porter
14 Michael Porter Jr
Marcus Morris. Michael Porter Jr. Facundo Campazzo. Bruce Brown. Shake Milton.
Equivalent would be like it michael porter Jr became an mvp
"Michael Porter Jr. I mean Murray is a beast but in a short term, like 3 month period, points are the easiest thing to make up on a team.  I've seen it a million times in basketball.  You know what's hard to make up?  Like a defensive anchor, or rebounding and playmaking.  Nuggets didn't really lose much else besides point production.  I just think Murray is a little overrated (young too) because he has a rare ability to go nuclear"
"Yep. Should really never pick a player if they've ever had an injury. Very stupid thinking from Philly, we should let Michael Porter Jr fall to 14 in every draft! Genius. I wish we had Aaron Gordon or Dante Exum now!"
"Leaning hard on Michael Porter Jr.   I think he's in the right situation to make it happen; Jokic will still be there, but with Murray out for a good portion of the year, I think the team is going to lean on him a lot more.  If he really is the gifted offensive player the league expects him to be, I think next year's situation is perfect for him."
"5'10"" MPJ or Michael Porter Jr Jr"
"I wish the NBA would start listing player heights to the quarter inch.  It's weird seeing players like Kevin Durant and Michael Porter Jr being listed at the same height when one guy definitely looks taller because he is 6'10.25"" and the other is 6'9.5""."
Michael Porter Jr has equal scoring the last few weeks.  Campazzo passes as well as Jokic.  Aaron Gordon was 18 ppg on the Magic.  Tons of bench talent.   The Warriors have been just as good as the nugs when Wiseman or Oubre sit.
CJ would cook Michael Porter jr bro and I’m a huge fan of his.

"Honestly, in a playoff environment I think there's a possible argument that Denver still have the 3rd best player on the court with Michael Porter Jr. A 6ft10 shooter who can almost get to his spot at will is far harder to game-plan against for a series than CJ, in my opinion."
Jokic is for sure MVP but you cant just not mention michael porter jr at all
"you gettin shit for this but   &gt;Lonzo Ball, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, Michael Porter Jr, Nikola Jokic  this would definitely be a REALLY good starting lineup  nets are gonna be favorites as long as the big 3 is intact tho"
Jokic has Michael Porter Jr who has been shooting 50/50/90 since Murray went down. Yeah no thanks
KD is the great value version of Michael Porter Jr.
Giannis is 1st among those with at least 200 FGA. 1st overall is actually Michael Porter Jr. at .837 (Giannis is .834) with 184 FGA.
