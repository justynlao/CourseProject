Something like Leonard + one of Iggy/Olynyk + one of Precious/KZ for Aldridge + Luka Samanic and maybe a pick should work (please).
"Samanic is cover for tampering. Luka would love it in San Antonio....uh, Samanic. He’s in Austin."
Apparently Luka Samanic = freezer burnt value brand vanilla ice cream
Spurs fans: Pop can we have Luka  Pop: we have Luka at home  Luka Samanic at home:
Luka playing like Luka Samanic
pretty sure hes talking about luka samanic
He means Luka Samanic
Luka Samanic. Everyone else is a future role player.
we picked luka samanic over this dude. talk about almost blowing it
"Much of it comes down to the person they draft, finding guys with the work ethic and motor to take development and improve themselves. We'll see how Luka Samanic pans out but he is an outlier. Supremely gifted but questions about his maturity, motor, and development. Spurs fans bye and large are impatient with him and the front office. He may well be a ""bust"" but given time, he could grow into a very good player.  Lonnie to a lesser extent because he has produced and had some nice games recently but he is a freakish athlete and has a silky smooth stroke - but his lack of aggression and BBIQ hold him back to this point. Kid is still young and could be a monster."
"But I don't want to see Luka Samanic go, he could be good..."
Spurs can offer Trey Lyles and Luka Samanic
"I'll give you LaMarcus Aldridge, Luka Samanic, and a 2nd for him if you want lmao"
"Bill Worrell is way better than Mike Breen. I mean, where else but a Houston Rockets home game are you going to hear a man mistake DeMar DeRozan for Luka Samanic?"
"I have a 30 team dynasty league in fantasy basketball and here are some of the guys I have: Luka Samanic, Deividas Sirvydis, Karim Mane"
"He kinda has no choice atm. There is no gleague Luka Samanic, Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Keita Bapes Diop are all playing like shit and Derrick White is out but of course he has shown that he can be useful."
"Lonnie Walker IV, Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, DeMar DeRozan (on expiring not sure if we’re bring him back next season), Luka Samanic (could take a risk on not protecting him not like he’s on teams’ radars), maybe mills?"
"Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, DeMar DeRozan, Luka Samanic"
Nah Luka Samanic.  Drew Eubanks has shown he can contribute NBA minutes.
Luka ... Samanic
What is Samanic good at? I never seen him play and I never even knew what he does well coming into the league except that his first name is Luka
"Spurs have another Luka to fill that Luka void in the lineup...   Bagley would fill the PF rotation for LMA, maybe we can throw in Lyles?   Lyles and Samanic for Bagley."
Time to bully Luka Samanic into three straight MVPs lul
Dudes not even better than Luka Samanic let alone Doncic
The spurs need to trade Luka Samanic for Marvin Bagley so I can die of laughter at the kings
"Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Aldridge and some picks"
I thought this was a post about Luka Samanic at first.
Imagine if we drafted Brandon Clarke at 19 instead of Luka Samanic
"PG: Doncic, SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, SF: Bojan Bogdanovic, PF: Vucevic, C: Jokic  Bench: Dragic, Pokusevski, Mirotic, Zubac, Bjelica, Boban, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic, Luka Samanic...  2 All NBA players and 3 stars (Vucevic was an all star) in starting lineup. Crazy stacked bench.   This team would crush everyone except USA, and it would be on even levels with USA considering they have MVP and a Luka ""2 All NBA First teams in first 3 seasons in the league"" Doncic."
Does Luka Samanic not exist?
I should also really avoid referring to Samanic as just “Luka” when there is a far more famous and talented Luka that dominates discussion on here lmao
"Well, we were chasing playoffs spot, and I'd rather have Rudy Gay than Luka Samanic during crunch time.  What's the deal with Samanic btw? It seems everyone there are obsessed with the guy."
im talking about samanic luka from the spurs
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
"Luka is alright, but klove , samanic, and valacunias are handsome"
"Second half of the season been tough for y'all. From an outsiders perspective seems like ya need Derrick fully healthy and able to carry a bit more of the scoring load, hopefully draft a versatile 4 in the draft if possible. I think Vassell looks good, just needs more confidence.   What do you think about Luka Samanic? Feels like he's asked to spot up a lot from what I've seen which I'm not sure is his best skillset. You see him develop much this season? Spurs are in a weird spot right now especially with DeMar's free agency, I'll be on the lookout for what happens with y'all this off-season. Unfortunately feel like you're an easy bounce in the play in but maybe Pop proves me wrong."
luka samanic
"We recently been without Keldon Johnson (recently came back last game), Derrick White, Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell. All were getting decent to big mins. Luka Samanic has stepped up and contribute as of late which is nice to see. Can't wait to get the whole squad back and healthy."
"Many casual Spurs fans and even supposedly well informed ones believe that if you suck enough, a generational talent will fall out of the sky for you without acknowledging it takes a number of pieces to fall into place. What if someone with a little better record jumps you in the lottery and you end up 4th? What happens if the premiere available player doesn't fit your organization or doesn't want to be there?   What if you have a solid stable of young talent (maybe not that one elite difference maker yet) but you have to put them in positions to fail for a whole season or two and let them get their head kicked in with no quality veterans to guide them?   Some of my fellow Spurs fans are spoiled, entitled and impatient. Its magnified on platforms like social media because they've talked shit for so long, they don't know how to take the rest of the league throwing back schadenfreude over recent struggles. If you are intentionally sucking, there's no let down (until lottery then draft night, possibly). Its like the kids losing at a video game and saying ""eh, I wasn't trying, this game is stupid anyway"". They just don't want to emotionally invest in a mediocre team.   And yet, here we are and even down multiple key players, right in the middle of it and trending upwards. This COVID outbreak got Luka Samanic on the court and he's been great, starting to live up to the hype (granted, small sample size) If at the end of the day we miss the playoffs once in 24 years and that year being the shortened COVID shitshow of 2020, hell yes, I'll take it.   Lastly, we aren't losing the Spurs. This city adores them and fills the arena whether they are good or not. They are one of the best run organizations in all of professional sports and have managed to stay relevant for 2 decades. They aren't going anywhere. That said, tanking is not in their DNA. Even if Pop retires, the team will be taken over by one of his disciples and the front office is constructed a very specific way with an ingrained philosophy."
"We're fun to watch this year, and I wish we had another national TV game to showcase it. Dejounte's finally developing into the player a lot of us knew he could be, Demar's work as a distributor is incredible to watch, Keldon is aggression incarnate, and our bench lineup is either the best or one of the best currently playing.   Lotta young, exciting guys who are starting to show their potential (our other 2019 draft pick Luka Samanic is finally starting to look NBA-ready) with a solid vet presence to complement it well. I can't wait to see how the rest of this year pans out for the team."
"he's finally getting minutes but Luka Samanic was looking like a human victory cigar for a minute there. now he actually looks like a monster defender as a 6'10"" guy who can actually play and guards 3s. switched super well onto Kyrie and other guards.   great shooter, has a lot of potential on ball. sky high potential as a two way player to me but until this COVID hit took out 5 of our best players, he didn't get on the floor in any meaningful minutes whatsoever. most of our sub hated him and thought he looked like he was bad and didn't care, soi think a lot of people thought he'd be lucky to be a human victory cigar. lol"
LUKA SAMANIC
trey lyes is our leading top scorer and luka samanic holding down an all star  wtf is this team lmao
Luka Samanic with 14/7/1/1/1 and +26. I think we know who the best Luka is in the league now
The San Antonio Spurs are undefeated on back to back games when Luka Samanic plays.
Luka Samanic.
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
"we could get some spot guard minutes out of Becky and may e will hardy can set some screens. besides that, it looks like our 6'11"" PF ""The Real Luka"" Samanic playing the 3. lol"
"pretty damn good. the teams been awesome so far. I wanted to tank for one of these future superstars in this draft but since that's not happening, I'm all in on the playoffs now lmao everyone looks so damn good, Im not mad about anyone. even our inexperienced guys like Luka Samanic and Tre Jones were dominating in the Gubble and just got called up presumably to cover for our guys that got the Rona so we'll see how they do in real games now."
Luka Samanic. He's playing fairly well in the G-League right now but is VERY raw in general.
"For all the fans doubting Luka Samanic, this should be all the evidence you need"
Are we agreeing to write Luka Samanic off as deadweight at this point?
Luka Samanic and Bol Bol
Luka samanic 🥵
"Well Atlanta’s young as well so we could send some young players. Probably Lonnie and a protected first? If they want a backup big, we have Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, and Luka Samanic (it would hurt to lose Lonnie &amp; Samanic)  If they want veterans for a playoff push, I could see adding expirings from Atlanta and giving Rudy Gay over for added offense and shooting. Idk if they’d WANT Aldridge, but he certainly is available in any capacity.  I’d nix any deal involving DeRozan, Mills, or our other young players, though, and just try and sign him in the offseason.   If Atlanta wants to make a playoff push and need backup shooting, I could see a way we incorporate Rudy Gay to the trade and get expiring back as well. God forbid we"
Luka Samanic maybe
facts Luka Samanic level seems right
Luka Samanic SG  ??
I doubt that Luka Samanic will be star to lead team to championships. I believe Doncic is able to do that
"well, I have loved basically all of our young guys. DeJounte looks like he can legitimately be the second best player on a contender to me. Keldon is a human bull and great. Lonnies shot reminds awesome but him and DJ finally learning to finish has been amazing. Luka Samanic has shown excellent perimeter defense, strong rebounding, good shooting, good finishing, and solid driving. this dudes gonna be fucking awesome some day.  as for things that make me angry, not trading Rudy Gay even though his value peaked. not getting anything last year when LMA started bombing hells threes and I was begging for them to get something for him. all of our young guys get too passive sometimes and I just want them to just take the fuck over when they're hot, but they just stop trying to score and it infuriates me.  Iin the future, at this point, I want them to make the playoffs and hopefully take a game or two off someone good. no point tanking now since we only improved with the Gorgui signing. I'd like to see DeMar signed and traded the more I think about it. if that's not possible, then I guess you just keep him since he'd s great leader, but anything over 30 million is just gonna be....tough, for me. I struggle to believe they couldn't have gotten something really good from a team that could use him like the Bulls, since only so many teams were willing to be sellers."
The Spurs might be about to do it again.  Dejounte Murray - 29th in 2016  Derrick White - 29th in 2017  Lonnie Walker - 18th in 2018  Luka Samanic - 19th in 2019  Keldon Johnson - 29th in 2019  Devin Vassell - 11th in 2020  All of which are really solid pieces. We're just lacking that franchise cornerstone at the moment so I hope one of these guys completely breaks out.
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."
well luka samanic is probably one of the best defenders name luka
"*shrug* I don't see the point in wasting everyone's time with LMA and DeMar and Rudy and Patty, then. Let's just see more Vassell and Tre Jones and Luka Samanic.  The fans are mostly convinced this is a playoff team, and pretty much every national analyst is like ""Haha, no."""
"&gt;Rudy Gay, Dejounte Murray, Luka Samanic  lol  why the fuck would the spurs do this??"
Luka samanic
"In part because they aren't trying to win. Most of the time, a project player taken outside the lottery gets almost no NBA minutes.  Look at Luka Samanic for my team. We're post-all star in year 2, and he has 153 NBA minutes   Poku has more than twice that in 1/3 of the possible games he could have played. Similar draft slot, similarly unready for the NBA."
We can trade you Luka (samanic) and Tre (jones) for AD. Just don’t read anything in the brackets
Hoping for a Luka Samanic breakout game.
Put Luka Samanic out there for man defense off the bench baby
"Thanks for the perspective.  I have an appreciation for these franchises that are perpetually suffering like Detroit and Chicago and Minnesota.  And I am happy for clubs like Phoenix and their success.  It has been difficult to watch my Spurs through this transition.  It's been four years and we still aren't out of the woods.  Lots of potential and a solid group of coaches and a good infrastructure, but injuries and limits on potential can still happen.  And growth can be slow.  While I love seeing DeMar ball out he may leave soon.  Dejounte took a large leap this season but is still a ways away from leading the team.  Lonnie Walker and Keldon Johnson and Luka Samanic all have high ceilings but aren't there yet.  Like any of the teams I've listed above we have lots of potential but need to put the pieces together.  For the past three years we struggled to get enough offensive points to even compete.  We struggled with one of the worst defensive ratings in the league while shooting the least amount of threes per game.  It was hard to see Coach Pop's vision at times because of how we were losing.  Our players didn't seem to have the drive to win.  This attitude is different this year.  Whether we make the playoffs this year or not, the first half of this season our players have wanted to win and that has been the biggest difference.  So when I see the T-Wolves giving up in the second quarter not only do I feel compassion for those players but also those fans.  I think what I've learned from all this is basketball isn't all about stats.  Chemistry and balance and morale matter so much and can sink a team or propel them to greatness.  And congrats to how well your Nuggets are playing and the young talent you've got.  I've enjoyed watching them this season."
"Brother, you cannot refer to Luka Samanic as just Luka in a non Spurs subreddit."
"Luka Samanic, current Knicks G League legend lmao all the athletic tools in the world, lot of moments showing off impressive skills, but he had such a shit attitude and lackadaisical vibe on the court, we released him. one of the most egregious examples of quitting on a play I've ever seen led to his official release.   https://youtu.be/oEzmD5EeMxo  like, fucking look at it lmao holy shit it's worse every time I see it. if he had Keldons spirit and effort he runs down Cole and spikes that bitch off the backboard but he just quit straight up."
"i really wanted to sign him after we let go of Luka Samanic. pretty annoyed we didn't get him, knowing if he played well he'd get more run than he will for the Lakers. we've made Keira Bates Diop into a reclamation project, I don't see any reason Sekou can't be a decent NBA player with some good coaching."
Jericho Sims and Luka Samanic are locks but Quentin Grimes and Miles McBride are uncertain? lmao uhhhhh
"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."
"Yeah I get it, the greater Houston area is absolutely enormous. It's just something I can't relate to, because in San Antonio, it's way smaller of a city and all the focus is on one team.   I can make small talk with almost anyone about the Spurs anywhere I go. I've met someone who was in the elderly age range tell me about how she saw Luka Samanic at HEB, or a family friends wife, whose in her late 40s, talk to me about Patty Mills like its nothing."
I would argue he is third. In second place is obviously Luka Doncic behind Spurs legend Luka Samanic.
Here’s a trade I hope the Spurs make for Ben Simmons: Brynn Forbes + Luka Samanic for Ben Simmons + 1st round pick.
"If giving in to this absurd request nets the sixers Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic and a late first I'd say fuck it, Simmons you are done in the NBA if you're done with the sixers, go play handball."
The disrespect for Luka Samanic   /s
"I think that everyone loves Boban. So it makes sense that Luka wants to feed him the ball to help him make more money.  I think they’ll eventually buy out dragic because dragic doesn’t want to play there. It’s not like Simmons where he has 4 years on his deal. It’s expiring. They’ll try to trade him, and either someone else will buy him out, or Toronto will buy him out. Then he will maybe sign with y’all or really chase the chip.  I was surprised that coaches didn’t blitz Luka more during the olympics. Force the other dragic to beat them. They had some other good shooters, but I feel that it wouldn’t be a big deal.  Keldon will be another year bigger, stronger, smarter, and confident. I hope he’s worked on his defense tho. If he can be a decent defender then he’ll be amazing this year.  Primo seems to be a legit pick. I think everyone was worried at first, but apparently primo had a really great combine and that helped his stock a lot. Primo sacrificed for his team at Alabama, and that probably hurt his stock some. But primos shot is pure. That seemed to immediately translate in summer league. Primo also didn’t look totally lost on D, but that’s against summer league players. Pop prob won’t play him for at least 2 years unless he’s averaging 30 in the g league or something crazy. So really next year we will see how he does. The story I heard from an agent interview that primo noticeably improved from the end of the college season. Hopefully primo continues to improve his pg skills and learns the spurs offense. In that same interview primos agent said that primos bones showed they might still grow, so he could get taller. If primo gets to be 6’8 even then he’s an amazing pick. We want to “tank” this year, so maybe primo gets some run with us in garbage time. I hope we go back to our 2014 offense with demar and Aldridge gone, but Dejounte may have picked up some bad habits from derozan.  My hope is that all the young guys take a leap with demar and Aldridge gone and they finally stop being afraid to miss or make a mistake. Pop will still hold them accountable, but they will be able to do whatever they want offensively. I think that this will help Lonnie and white the most. They always seemed to be afraid of upsetting demar, or were in awe of demar. They just gave the ball to demar at the end of games and ran away. I hate that offense. Too easy to read and defend. Demar was not that great at hitting those “Jordan/hero ball” shots. I’d have rather he drove in the lane and kicked it out for a 3. Lonnie is actually really good at that and hopefully he can find his finishing too. He lives up to his sky Walker nick name. For whatever reason he just doesn’t have that killer instinct to finish at the rim/ destroy people. Keldon and Dejounte have a little too much of that and I worry that they’ll be dominating the ball and taking shots from Lonnie/white/ vassell. We have so many players that might take a leap. Samanic, our Luka, has the size, handles, confidence, and shot. He just needs to get minutes to see if it translates all the way. He’s my sleeper for you to watch that many ppl haven’t seen play. This year, especially if we trade Thad young, samanic will get some good pt. And I’d like to trade Thad for a pick, but we do need a reliable 4. The fit next to the non-shooting Poeltl will be tough tho.  Which hidden gems should I watch for on the mavs?"
"Luka Samanic, or as my wife calls him, ""The Sandwich."" I really hope I'm wrong, but I don't see him developing into a good player for the Spurs. I feel like he might be a bust of a 1st rounder."
Luka Samanic. This dude's rookie extension can be given as early as this coming offseason and yet we still don't know what kind of player he is on an NBA floor cause he never plays
"yes?! we just took out demar, rudy, patty and added mcdermott and figurately derrick white (since he was missing last season and he is our best and most complete player) and luka samanic and add tre jones too. and add the fact that all these young guys are finally free to play instead of always rely on the vets that mostly ballhogged and after covid hit us were pretty bad (patty and rudy). also consider that our defense was extremely atrocious with demar since he was our 4 and he has no size and also he's a bad defender. and also add the fact that all these young guys gained another year of improvement and were devasted after the grizzlies game and i think they have a sense of revenge as they expressed in the interviews. they all have a nice relationship between them and i think a united team is the most important thing in competeting. and also before we got badly hit by covid, we are in the playoff range and performed well in the half of the season.  we fixed our biggest problem of last season that was spacing in the starting five and we got doug mcdermott that is one of the best active shooters in the league (i think he is 9th). he also adds size, thing we need, even tho keldon johnson grew over two inches, he said in an interview during the olympics. not saying doug is better than demar, but surely he is such a better fit and also let the other players such as dejounte and derrick and even keldon do their work, something that rarely happened when rudy, patty, demar were out there, same goes with the bench  so i'm not saying we will go out there winning tf out, but just that we are not as bad as the media and most of the fans think."
"On the surface, the Spurs would be all over this trade but they are going to have to solve problems with roster spots and cutting Saric, who would be a salary match for Thad, would be difficult because he has 2 years left on his deal. As it is, we are going to have to cut 3, with Aminu and Hutchinson being pretty much goners unless we can use them in a trade as salary filler.   Drew Eubanks is the most expendable, but is super cheap and is a great locker room guy. If we take back Smith and Saric (and cannot offload anyone else) we're going to have to probably cut Saric AND Eubanks.   With Collins out and Luka Samanic being very unproven, all this leaves us thin in the front court behind Jak and Jock Lansdale.   At the end of the day, its a fair trade both ways but it leaves the Spurs with problems to solve with roster construction. Not that you don't do it, but it would be tricky."
"I have faith in our 4 spot players and am very curious to see Luka Samanic get more minutes.  He could be a net plus player, shoots like Lauri but could play better defense if all fit together.  And if Collins returns there will be lots of overlap at the big guy who shoots volume threes position.  Good luck to him in . . . Cleveland."
Luka Samanic
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
"we ain't tanking. we just parted away with our three vets in rudy, demar, patty that sadly where damaging more than helping us, stats speak. with damaging i just mean they were kinda ballhoggin. we have added doug that would substite demar, luka samanic will substite rudy, tre jones will substite patty mills. all our young guys gained another year of improvements. we get derrick white back, arguably our best player and definitely our most complete and experienced one. we get guys like collins and landale that can be solid pickups. so we gain ton of shooting, easily our biggest problem last year. and this to exclude thaddeus youngn who i think we will deal before the season starts for picks and maybe a young guy. and we still have pop.  i mean, i doubt we will be much worse as everyone predicts. let's see."
He meant The GOAT Luka Samanic
Cant wait for the debates..  *Are we sure Doncic is the best Luka?*  *Yeah fam.. Garza be ballin*  *Nah nah.. Im talkin bout Samanic*
"Ben needs to come to San Antonio where we loaded up on shooters   If Zach Collins ever makes it on the court we’d be able to roll out Zach, Jacob, Luka Samanic and Ben at the same time - tallest rotation ever?"
"Luka Samanic. Probably a bit of a reach, but the kid has an amazing array of physical tools and is in the environment likely most conducive to him reaching his ceiling. Will he? Not sure, still a long way to go.   The Spurs have a handful of guys that have the ability, its just a matter of being able to fully realize it. Every single season since David Robinson was a rookie, it was ""playoffs or bust"" until this season. The 1997 shit show that got us Tim Duncan was an accident and while they may have leaned into the tank once David was hurt, it wasn't planned. Last season, even ranked as a 9-11 seed, with Demar and LMA, they were gunning for the playoffs.   It will be interesting to see how things play out without those vets being the focal point and getting the bulk of the touches and minutes."
luka samanic waiting to turn 22 to join this battle as well sir
"There's a strong contingent of Spurs fans that believe that the only way to compete is to either completely blow out the bottom and tank hard or to stockpile assets and pick off a disgruntled superstar at some point - and this tends to be a general trend in the NBA with major free agent signings becoming a secondary method to waiting until a Leonard, AD, Harden, now Dame (maybe) wants out.   It can be argued that you don't need to sign a star nor poach an unhappy one with the success of players like Giannis, Jokic, Butler, Leonard, etc as lower picks in the draft.   Further, no one believes in the 'ensemble' cast method at all and you would have a hard time convincing anyone that the 2014 Spurs were that sort of team (like that) with Tim Duncan at the head, even though he was much older and not as critical as in previous title runs. Thus, you really have to go back to the 04 Pistons and that's 18 years ago.   People are impatient. Why wait for Keldon Johnson to evolve when Ben Simmons is on the trading block? Why hope talented guys like Lonnie Walker and Luka Samanic develop when you can have a ready made star? Christ, people, we've been out of the playoffs TWO years now, this is reaching crisis level.   From my point of view, being an older fan who has enjoyed 5 championships, I'm not so desperate to roll the dice on a high risk proposition. Additionally, I get attached to high character/good people and boxing them up and shipping them out for other players is not what I want to see. Perhaps I see more value in a guy like Dejounte because I've seen him grow up as a Spur and he's certainly a passionate, hard worker that wears his heart on his sleeve - so maybe I over rate him and continue to believe he and Lonnie and Luka and Keldon, and the rest can come together and be something special together when it might not happen. My personal take is that its a risk I am willing to accept rather than shoot for the moon with a flawed star that someone else is actively trying to trade.   TL:DR - I think and hope that the Spurs plan is to develop their current young players and hope that they can have enough talent that they grow into winners rather than remaking the roster with a huge move. People like change, want new, exciting, and fresh and I think there is a bit of a civil war in the Spurs fandom currently but we'll see. Spurs FO us more or less bulletproof and can do WTF they want. If it doesn't work out, well, so be it."
Why is Luka Samanic Injured
Luka Samanic?
KPJ   Luka samanic  Dejounte
"I'm very high on Luka Samanic while many general fans don't know who he is and alot of Spurs fans have written him off as a bust. I think he's got youth, athleticism, and an impressive tool set to be a very good NBA player but in typical Spurs fashion, they are bringing him along slowly. I expect this will be a big year for him."
"Oh, why not?  Spurs. A few sneaky solid signings, Big Body takes a huge step forward, Lonnie Walker plays well, Derrick White stays healthy, and Jock fits in well. Luka Samanic MIP.   Ok, I don't really believe it but seeing Pop go out guns blazing with a bunch of kids and spare parts would be pretty epic."
"&gt; should be planning to tank.  We should have planned to tank last year, and we still couldn't pick a direction.   We could have gotten assets for at least Patty and Rudy at the deadline, and we let them walk for nothing.    We kept throwing spaghetti at the wall, trying to stick in the play-in...and for what? We barely played our 1st round pick, we didn't play our 2nd round pick, we didn't play our 2019 1st pick (Luka Samanic) and instead played the old guys.  Which, fine, we're trying to win nothing for no reason...  But then we played Lonnie Walker a ton, and he was one of the worst players in the NBA last season.   So I don't get it. Either try to be good, or try to be bad. Use your rotations to signal one or the other. Make moves at the deadline to either get better and make the playoffs, or get worse and improve your draft position.   We straddled the middle and wound up with Josh fucking Primo."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"i mean, we only had luka samanic and jakob poeltl at 4/5 and we again drafted guards so yeah, we needed them like bread."
"11-19 range. The typical player picked in that range is a role player. We’ve picked Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell, Luka Samanic, and now Josh Primo. We have no idea what the latter four will be. Lonnie is a pretty typical player for someone drafted 18."
"It depends on demar, but if he walks, The Spurs were all ready a 10 seed and had a losing record, I struggle to see how swapping demar/Rudy gay/Patty mills for Doug McDermott/Luka Samanic/and Tre Jones or josh primo doesn’t make this team quite a bit worse. And Derrick white, who just cannot stay healthy gets hurt again, this is probably a bottom 5 team"
No mention of Spurs Luka? What's your opinion on Samanic?
"No, but they also need to fill out a roster somehow.  The current forward rotation is Keldon Johnson, Luka Samanic, and...that’s it."
Do they they completely shit the bed last draft with taking luka samanic at 18 a guy that was projected to go late 2nd round
"That was an odd draft pick but there's no way he would've been drafted in the second round. He might have been available at 19 but it's possible Indiana was looking at picking him too. A lot of mock drafts and information going around is not true when it comes to the draft. I mean look at Ziaire, how many people thought he's the guy Memphis moved up to pick?  It's a risky pick but apparently he did super well at the combine. Luka Samanic did super well at the combine too though so it could definitely blow up in the spurs face."
"This is a list of literally all our bigs: Luka Samanic, Jakob Poeltl, Drew Eubanks  Favors is a good backup 5 and while I like Eubanks, he'll never be more than a third stringer. We're clearly in rebuild mode after drafting an 18 year old with the 12th pick so we should be trying to get as many picks as we can"
Disrespecting Luka Samanic
If they also pick up Luka Samanic they'd have a real big three.
you arent wrong we're going to end up taking Sengun even though we pretty much took a guy in a similar spot with Luka Samanic
How different is he really than like Luka Samanic?
"Umm, yes but no. If he wants a long term deal then hell no, we have Luka Samanic developing in the back and he looks pretty good in limited stretches but he can be essentially Lauri that plays defense so Lauri would be a hard pass unless he's just a bridge guy"
We have Luka Samanic who is younger markaanen with more upside IMO. I think most spurs fans would be unhappy if we signed him
"Honestly we do need a bridge starter for Luka Samanic, so if we can get Bagley I trust our staff to get something decent out of him"
The lack of Devin Vasell/Luka Samanic here is infuriating

"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
"Man, we have Jakob Poeltl, Luka Samanic, Drew Eubanks next season, I think it's fair to say we are weak at PF/C as much as I freaking love my Spurs."
"Why not on Markkanen and Collins but on Portis? I mean, yeah we need a center too, but Jakob can easily still start for us and a bench big is easy to get. We also have Luka Samanic that plays PF and he's gonna develop and get minutes too. I would prolly still go Lauri Markkanen but if the Bulls wants ton of asset for him, well, Portis doesn't seem bad now that you made me think."
"Here are the Spurs 1st round picks in the past 5 years:  2016 - Dejounte Murray (29th)  2017 - Derrick White (29th)   2018 - Lonnie Walker (18th)   2019 - Luka Samanic (19th)  2019 - Keldon Johnson (29th)   2020 - Devin Vassell (11th)   All these guys listed above look like they can be legit rotation pieces at the minimum. Also, considering they’ve only had one pick in the lottery, they’ve drafted incredibly well relative to their position. I’d probably go Raptors, Spurs, Heat, Nuggets, &amp; Hornets in that order."
"Luka Samanic is starting rn, is he better then Ingles?"
Luka ... Samanic  (/s)
Luka ... Samanic  (/s)
"It's going to be even more awkward when she looks up ""Luka"" on BBRef, gets confused, and then goes around telling everyone you named your son after Luka Samanic."
There is also Luka Samanic on the spurs.
"No depth, are you kidding? 😬  Bogdan and Bojan scored 30+ in this season  Vucevic also many times  5-6 players who can score 30 + and no depth?  Jokic- Vucevic- Bojan- Bogdan- Dragic  Bench: Nurkic, Avdija, Saric, Zubac, Bjelica, Pokusevski, Bobi Marjanovic, Luka Samanic etc"
Idk man… Thaddeus Young and Luka Samanic are both damn good playmakers
"Spurs did not see too much in him either, they had the also the 19th pick that year and used it on Luka Samanic, who did not even make the Croatian national team for these Olympics."
"And it you're Luka Samanic, your first 2 years"
"yeah, makes no sense for us to pick a guard, we have ton of them but most important our frontcourt needs ton of help, we only have jakbo poeltl and luka samanic."
That's the Spurs sub with Luka Samanic
"Late but the way the roster was constructed last season they DESPERATELY need a stretch 4! Early on Pop decided to glue Trey Lyles to the bench which left Lamarcus, Eubanks and a young player named Luka Samanic who was never going to get decent minutes.   So Lamarcus gets bought out,Luka spends a lot of time in the G league, and Lyles is riding the bench. They signed Gorgui Dieng to mitigate our lack of depth but it was still a glaring hole on our roster.  So now that the Spurs have a lot of cap space to work with I can see why some feel John Collins may be that piece the Spurs need. He spaces the floor and can put up some good numbers and he’s still really young. Add in their semi high draft pick I can see a guy like Kai Jones (hopefully) falling to the Spurs, however another glaring issue for the Spurs is their atrocious 3pt shooting so they just may opt for a pure shooter in the draft"
"What if OP meant Samanic and wrote down ""Luka""? Who knows. We'll probably never know."
"His name is Luka Samanic, you're welcome."
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
How do you see lauri's fit being different than luka samanic?
"Do you have a Croatian source for why Luka Samanic isn't playing? The only thing I found said injury but I can't tell if its a new injury, his old injury, or if its BS and he just left because he wasn't going to get enough minutes."
That's what happens when you don't have Luka Samanic
LUKA!!   ^samanic...
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
"Trade away Demar not Dejounte. Keep the young coreof Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell and Luka Samanic.  Then have Chip Engelland work with Ben on that shot."
"I don't think so. Prior to the all-star break and covid destroying our season we were as high as 4th in the West and had a top 10 defense. On top of that Dallas is a mess right now, Houston is bad for the next 2 to 3 years, and OKC has potential but no guarantees.  Going forward:  Dejounte at 24 is an all-defense level guard who can give you 15/8/6. Keldon Johnson is 21 and going to average 15/10 next year. Jak is 25 and is a top 5 defensive center at the worst. Derrick White is 27 and is a very good two-way guard who gives you 15/5/5.  We also have a 22 year old Lonnie Walker 6th man, a 21 year old Devin Vassell who is already a good 3&amp;D wing, and a 21 year old Luka Samanic.  That by itself is a good foundation of youth that has one or two all-star level talents (DJ and Keldon) and 3 or 4 very good role players. We also have 50 million in cap space (assuming Derozan and Gay walk), the GOAT coach, and a lottery pick in a deep draft.  If even one top 25 player came in a trade or FA we'd be looking at a guaranteed playoff seed (above the play-in cut off)."
"Look at everyone picked around him tho. Darius Bazley, Nassir Little, Luka Samanic, Goga bitadze, Dylan Windler.  They all sound like fake names lol."
"Luka ^^^Samanic, Trey Burke, and Ja Rule"
Same thing happened to Luka Samanic.
Can you do one on Markele Fultz too.    And another on Luka Samanic in 8 months.
"Trae Waynes, Luka Samanic, and Ja Rule? Me too."
*Luka Samanic has entered the chat*
I remember thinking Luka Samanic would be the steal of the draft because he was a European I didn’t hear much about before and the Spurs picked him.
"We don’t play rookies we usually let them play and develop through the g league their first season and let them get rotational minutes after that.   Pretty much the only outliers to that is Kawhi becoming a starter halfway through his rookie year, Devin Vassell getting backup minutes his rookie year, and Luka Samanic not cracking the rotation after his rookie year. Other than that since like 2015 it’s been the same thing G league year one, rotation year 2"
Obviously a very different situation but this is basically how spurs fans talked about Luka Samanic and he just got waived
"Hey, if you're on the fringe of the roster and you turn the ball over then you better get back to contest the fast break. Luka Samanic learned that the hard way."
"I remember one of their commentators called DeMar ""Luka Samanic"" lmao"
Luka Doncic   Luca Vildoza   Luke-a Kennard  Luka Samanic   Luka Garza  &amp;#x200B;  Coach: Luke-a Walton
Luka Samanic
"[His scouting report is pretty impressive](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Luka-Samanic-98706/). Its not like the kid didnt have potential, its just that mentally he didnt gravitate towards using his physical tools to be a good NBA player.   This is the type of player that you dream finding in that draft slot, full of potential but just needs a couple tweaks to his game. The mental issue of wanting to be an NBA player seems to be lacking though. We've seen it with Larry Sanders more recently, and plenty of other players who have taken the NBA for granted."
"Well, Luka Samanic is available now if anyone wants to build around him!!!"
Luka Samanic?
Luka Samanic pls
"2016. All the big 3 still on board with Leonard AND LMA and couldn't get to the conference finals for the showdown with GSW. I'm sure other Spurs fans will have plenty of more recent beefs over not starting the rebuild earlier, not getting something for LMA, drafting Luka Samanic or Josh Primo, but that's the one for me."
"No. Chad Ford put it well on his podcast last week so I'll summarize. I would highly recommend if you're looking for draft coverage. As far as podcasts go, I'd say he's on par with Givony &amp; Schmitz.  1. The Euro league teams have no incentive to develop players so they can declare for the draft unless those players are advanced enough that they can help them win immediately. Considering there's a rise in competition and everything else that comes with playing professionally, unless said youth prospect left for Europe for at least 2 or more years, spent time getting little minutes and earning more faith from coaching, it's just not to their benefit.  So you can the difference in the amount of minutes and role an Alperin Sengun got as compared to Luka Samanic for example. Or even, Doncic Vs Killian Hayes. And why comparatively of the two, even the coverage was about flashes of brilliance for Hayes &amp; Samanic versus actual current production for Doncic and Sengun.  2. Not when they can go to Australia, the Overtime league, the G league or universities chasing one and dones.   This year should be extremely interesting for prospects. With all the available options. So if you listen to the podcast pasted below, you'd hear the breakdown on each interesting international prospect and why they chose either of all the available options.  https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BCHsH1UfpxoEYSXOCubc6?si=RDB19CMuScmFa_4O70LBaA&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1"
dejountae murray &gt; damion jones (yuck)  derrick white &gt; josh hart (not bad but w.e)   lonnie &gt; kevin huerter (not bad but w.e indifferent btwn the 2 of them)   luka samanic &gt;thybulle (not bad but not a good pick imo)  keldeon johnson &gt; kevin porter (i wouldnt mind kevin tbh)  devin &gt; hali (i wouldnt mind hali)  bonus   primo &gt; chris duarte (no too old :P)
"I wouldn’t mind this, but my only concern is that should probably get a PF on that trade. Aside from him I can only see McDermott and Luka Samanic.  But with the whole “was Keldon or DeMar our PF last year?” thing and with Keldon still on the team, we can probably get away with it"
Luka samanic would like a word
