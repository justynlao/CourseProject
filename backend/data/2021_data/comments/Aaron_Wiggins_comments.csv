There is a NCAA player named Aaron Wiggins. Apparently he's pretty good. might want to hold on to the Wiggins jersey a little longer
"You're core of Murray, Kat and Wiggins - because you won't trade him for dlo if ypu already have that lead guard makes you the magic of the west. Congrats on getting destroyed in the first round and not having Edwards but Aaron Nesmith or so."

"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"I really wanna see Randle make an all star appearance. I was a big fan of the very hyped 2014 Draft where the 5 biggest names were Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Embiid, Aaron Gordon, and Julius Randle and outside of Embiid all of those guys have underwhelmed to some extent for what we thought they would be. Randle is playing like the guy I thought the Lakers drafted in 2014 and I hope he keeps it up"
"Wiggins, Towns, Brandon Rush, Lavine, Dieng, Cole Aldrich, Nikola Pekovic, Garnett, Aaron Brooks, Tyus Jones, Mitchell ""The Creek Freak"" Creek.  I started paying attention to the nba duringTowns' rookie year. Rubio was out there missing open layups."
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"

"Recently it was Wiggins.  Currently, Ben seems like the obvious one. I kinda wanna see what Kuzma would be like if he were a main focus. Aaron Gordon is someone I can see being in this category but I'm not actually invested enough in him to actually wonder if he should be somewhere else or not if that makes any sense"
"Or, even if his handles don't improve, he could be doing what Aaron Gordon is doing for the Nuggets. Off-ball movement for an easy dunk, that doesn't require handle to do, just a desire to make a play. Wiggins has such amazing athleticism, there's no legit reason he so frequently disappears. That dude should be causing chaos for defenses all game long without even having to take a dribble. Cut -&gt; dunk, Catch -&gt; shoot, defend using all the tools at your disposal... he could be so damn good."
"He is a ""December baby"", for many things that have a cutoff at Dec 31 these people are going to be among the youngest. For some things it is great (NBA Draft) but for other things it is not so great (school).   Giannis is also a December baby, he is just 2 months older than Andrew Wiggins and 3 months older than Jabari Parker, both selected in the 2014 draft. Only 9 months older than Aaron Gordon who was the youngest in 2014."
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
"What does that even mean bruh. Aaron gordon had crazy hype and physique too, just because he didn't reach it doesn't mean he isn't a good role player. Same with jr smith   Forget all that off court shit. Wiggins is a good role player"
"It’s not any fault of ur teams lol look at Aaron Gordon leaving Orlando or Christian wood leaving the pistons. Sometimes teams have better situations and utility for players, and tbh, I don’t think anyone would argue the wolves are even above average in putting their people in a position to succeed. Wiggins was and to this day, not even close to his potential, that’s his own fault, but he’s decently better with the warriors for real reasons"
"Did you not read my post? I said he isnt a great anchor and there so many reasons why.  But your center does not need to be your anchor.   And while he is not a great (for so many reasons that would even mess with the best defensive centers outside embiid and gobert) anchor, he is a good shot blocker and he is good at making people miss at the rim.  He is also way better at switching than almost every starting center, but we never switched until now.  He is better at defending the perimeter than most centers.  Kat was in Thibs system for 2.2 seasons not 3. and the part of the third season Jimmy was literally sabotaging our games like harden did at the beginning of the year lol.  Our starters for were Jeff teague, ( one of the worst pg defenders in the league, watch the pacers series vs kyrie) Jimmy (elite, seriously nuts lol but he missed almost 30 games that season), Wiggins (below average and at the time many people considered him one of the worst defenders in the league, seriously go look at posts from 2016-2017.) Taj (who was a great defender for the bulls was average at best for the wolves.  He offered near 0 rim protection which is what the wolves need in a 4.he was significantly better at offense for us) and then KAT.  Then dont forget our bench who also played tons of minutes with KAT.  It was Jamal Crawford, Bjelica, Tyus Jones, Shabazz muhommad, aaron brooks, marcus georges-hunt.  They were all bad to awful defenders.  Most of them are out of the league.  Jamal crawford was literally the worst in the league lol.  You cant have a good defense with that many players being terrible.  They also had gorgui tho who was a good defender they just never shared the floor that season.  and this was the best cast of defensive players he has ever players with.  The Jazz team now is so much better defensively than this.  Ya harden is a bad matchup for gobert because he cant make up for his perimeter players not good enough defense.  Same thing with Jamal. Thats the whole point, not sure how you missed it, but he can make up for it by switching onto them, but he is not good enough at that (neither is towns obviously).  KAT has the same defensive FG% at the rim as nerlens noel, porzingis and is better than Bam even.  So he definitely effects shots at the rim.  Those player are all considered good to great defenders.  Kat is a solid defender. He is good not great though and once he finally gets to play a system for a long period of time and that fits his skillsuit he will thrive.  Especially if/when we have a strong vet anchor at the 4.  Thibs is a good defensive coach for some players.  He knows 1 way to play tho (well he did when he was a twolves coach, maybe he has been diff for the knicks).  And if you want to win a championship you need to be able to play multiple types of defenses or atleast be able to change your defensive game plan to fit your star players and thibs didnt want to do that.  This is in my opinion is why thibs has never won a championship as a head coach and he never will (unless he changes)."
"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"&gt; Also, if the Minny picks conveys this year, the Dubs should be charged with robbery as a result of this trade.  Injuries to Russell and KAT have drastically changed the perspective people have regarding this trade. Here is the [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ezw6ph/wojnarowski_golden_state_has_agreed_to_trade/)from when it happened.  In the end, I truly believe there is no way to view the trade as a robbery because:  1) Wiggins clearly wasn't able to be maximized by the Wolves organization  2) The theoretical benefit of keeping KAT happy cannot be measured (he wanted to play with D-Lo)  3) At worst the pick conveys this year at 4th overall (or in theory next years draft at #1 overall). Although lottery picks are always valuable, it's really the 1 or 2 pick that usually provide immediate value. Recent #4 picks have been Patrick Williams, Hunter, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Dragan, **Kristnaps**, Aaron Gordon, Zeller, Waiters, Tristan, Wesley Johnson. Obviously different organizations can be better at drafting but that's 11 drafts in a row where the #4 pick (outside Porzingis) hasn't produced all-star level talent.  4) On top of all that, the Wolves do not need more young, developing talent. If the pick conveys this year at 4 (in what is supposed to be a strong draft) we miss out on that asset but with KAT on the team we should be trying to compete for a playoff spot.  Looking back at the thread, many people predicted a Wiggins renaissance. Clearly the Warriors saw that potential and I'm assuming our front office did as well. But it was definitely the right move for the Wolves to make, even looking at it now."
Bruh Aaron Wiggins island is where it's at now.
"Iunno man. Hield just got a $20+ million per year contract and I think Wiggins is better than him. Aaron Gordon is on the end of a $76 million over 4 years contract and his best season was 17/8/3. Jerami Grant, who is a year older than Wiggins just got a $20 million per year contract and his best year was 14/5/1. And people are acting like it's a steal with him averaging 22.5/5/3 this year and those numbers Wiggins could definitely hit as a first option.   Wiggins is almost certainly gonna get a second max or a near max, in my opinion, unless he takes a cut to stay with the Warriors."
Wiseman is out for the season and Oubre is hurt. Looney is solid when he’s healthy. Draymond is amazing on defense but outside of him and Curry you have a bunch of role players. Wiggins is a decent 2 way player. Aaron Gordon averaging 10 ppg only furthers my point.
"Lol bro Aaron Gordon has averaged 10/5/2 with the nuggets in 20 games with everyone injured  I’ve watched a couple of their games lately and campazzo has a bigger impact  Draymond is probably still a top 5 defender plus he’s a great passer, Wiggins is pretty good this season, oubre is mediocre, wiseman is the #2 overall pick, looney, and yeah the rest are role players   Warriors aren’t as elite as they used to be but they still probably got a better they still have more talent imo then a grizzlies or wizards outside of Curry, aren’t the warriors like top 5 in spending this season?"
"If player has a talent he will develop everywhere. What players Wolves failed to develop? Wiggins? He was given all the opportunities here, and he is not better in GS now. Culver? He is a bust. Towns ended up being a bad player? I don’t think so. Edwards and McDaniels have shown huge progress this season. Naz Reid is a completely different player after 2 years, and he was undrafted.  Another question - who did Detroit, Magic, Cavs or Rockets really developed over last years? May be Hezonja? Mo Bamba? Aaron Gordon was expected to be a better player, though he is very good. Even Oladipo was not that great there, he became all star in Indiana later. Detroit were consistently selecting mediocre players in lottery - Stanley Johnson, KCP, others. Who they did actually develop so you can say - WOW, this player is really great? Rockets did not have high picks for a while. Cavs got couple in a row and their young players look good, though not good enough (may be yet) to say that the development matters.   You are just biased because Boston really nailed down their top picks with Tatum and Brown as well as their development and roles. However, there is nothing wrong with being drafted by Timberwolves. In addition, our new GM hired a lot of development coaches and all of recent rookies have shown a progress besides Culver."
"Have you forgotten about Wiggins? Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, then Baze. That top 3 is honestly pretty solid, and Oubre has had some awesome games this year. He's a fine role player.   Assuming MPJ is the second best, who is the Nuggets 3rd best player right now? Aaron Gordon who is a very solid player, similar to Wiggins, maybe? After that though? It's a pretty fucking steep drop off. Like, Will Barton is good but not any better or worse than Oubre or Bazemore. They just bring different skills. He's a worse defender but he can handle the ball and pass a bit. Monte Morris is good, but again, just a role player like those dudes. The rosters are not as different as you make out without Jamal Murray."
Aaron Gordon is NOT a better defender than Wiggins lmao. That would be a good take for 1.5 years ago maybe.  Wiggins is the better player all around imo. The only edge Gordon really has is playmaking.
"Aaron Gordon is a way, way better defender and fits better as a role player on a good team though.  Wiggins is maybe more talented overall, but if you're looking for a complimentary role player you definitely prefer Gordon.  I think the Nuggets are much better off with Gordon than they would be with Wiggins."
I don't think Aaron Gordan is better than Wiggins.
"Aaron Gordon ain't better than Wiggins, a decently efficient 18 ppg scorer with good defense."
"Plenty? Wiggins, Dlo, ibaka/Gasol, jerami grant, Aaron Gordon, vooch, d Rose, cp3, DeRozan prob will if he does"
"They picked Noel, Embiid, and Jah in 3 straight drafts. Only one of those guys lived up to their potential. Imagine how much worse they’d be if they had drafted Aaron Gordon instead of Embiid just because they thought they didn’t need another centre  Wiseman could very easily be like Jah or Noel, and even if you’re talking “win now”, the team was better when Wiseman was injured. Green does not add much to a lineup that already has Steph, Klay, and Wiggins   As for Cleveland, Allen is what he is. He’s a good centre, but not an elite centre. There’s no way they’d pass on a good big man if they thought he was better than Green just because Allen is there"
"I thought the same thing! They should have traded for vooch and aaron Gordon Could’ve traded wiseman, min 1st, wiggins, oubre and extra picks"
You’re joking right? Draymond and wiggins &gt; mpjr and aaron gordon
"I think we would want him since he fills that SF/PF spot well  Two starters for Wiggins and the pick is tough, I was hoping more Domas+Lamb+Aaron or something   McConnell and McDermott are FAs and Oshae can't be traded for a while since signing a new deal"
"2014 was a weird draft class. Wiggins 1st, Jabari Parker 2nd.    Embiid at 3rd, Aaron Gordon 4th and Marcus Smart 6th were the only top ten picks that weren't total busts imo. Remember Dante Exum and Nic Stauskas? Yeah me neither but they sound kind of familiar. Elfrid Payton, to whom I've frequently heard Knicks fans refer as the devil himself, rounds it off at number 10.    Zach Lavine went 13th, and Jokic didnt get taken until the 2nd round. Crazy huh?    CBS sports ranks it as the 5th worst draft class of the last two decades: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/"
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"

Jokics second best player was a guy in his second year.   Wiggins put up very similiar numbers this year with way better defence. Rivers wasnt even picked for a team. Campazzo is a rookie and Neither of these guys probably even get a look in at the warriors.   aaron gordan was good defensively but doesnt compare as a 3rd option compared to wiggins or draymond.
Notable snubs from notable snubs being Myles Turner and Aaron Gordon sounds about right. I'd add Wiggins to that group.
"Not necessarily true. A lot of people were warning about Wiggins bust potential. For example this guy had Wiggins and Jabari #7 and #8, behind guys like Embiid (obviously), Smart, Aaron Gordon, Nurkic, Capela, etc.  https://deanondraft.com/2014/06/26/mega-board/"
"I remember how hyped all those guys were, especially Wiggins and Parker at 1 and 2, I remember both Wiggins and Parker had sick ass mixtapes with the most epic sounding beats that year.   I was a freshman in high school that year and Aaron Gordon was a senior at my school and was like the 4th-6th ranked player in the class. The harrison twins were ranked either just above or below him and my school traveled to the houston area and played them in a game that was on ESPN.  Embiid, Randle, and Wiggins are definitely doing the best out of the top picks from that year but i have faith my guy AG can add to his offensive game this summer and the nuggets would be strong contenders to be at the top of the west along with my warriors hopefully."
"it's not, Andrew Wiggins played in the 2015 FIBA Americas, and was infamously benched in a crucial game against Venezuela in crunchtime in favor of Aaron Doornekamp, who commited a loose ball foul that gave VEN the FT's that cost Canada the game.  It was literally Wiggins' last appearance on the Sr team until this summer lol"
"We eventually have to start thinking about drafting rookies, you know.  I’m probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion but this is quite inevitable, the Warriors are bout to pay the repeater tax and our owner Joe Lacob can’t be spending some infinite amount of luxury tax to sign or trade for veterans, especially those that make 8 figures for their salary. Steph, Klay, Dray and Wiggins combined to make about $140 million next year, which is more than all but 3 teams’ entire payroll this year.   I mean, how many players are realistically difference makers that are worth the 7th and/or the 14th pick, especially at around $9 million which Killian Hayes at Aaron Nesmith, players drafted at #7 and #14 last year, combined to make?   Barring significant trades and injuries, #7 is as high as we’re going to picking in the next couple of years. And unless a really good role player is available for the right price, I just can’t see how trading for a vet helps them. And realistically the best chance at that kind of deal is with a Kelly Oubre sign-and-trade and even that is very unlikely.   TL;DR: It’s really hard to get good value out of trading these picks unless they’re packaged with Wiseman or Wiggins, given the rookie salaries of these draftees. And if they’re going to trade Wiseman and/or Wiggins, they’d have to get a lot. I mean, a lot."
"Aaron Wiggins ig, bunch of dudes I don’t recognize there."
Giving up on Aaron wiggins this quickly?
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
"&gt;Jokic just got Aaron Gordon this year and Gary Harris has been washed the last 3 years. Talent wise they are similiar but lets not act like KAT didnt play with some solid players. Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.   He had Paul Millsap who was very good until last year and the perfect partner for him in the frontcourt and Gary was good 2 years ago and okay 1 year ago certainly not bad players.  &gt;Wiggins may not hae lived up to his #1 hype but lets not act like he is a scrub. Wiggins is better than Gordon, Barton, and Harris.  HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM PLAY IN MINNESOTA? BAD DEFENCE,NO REBOUNDING,DIDN'T PASS,SCORED 20 PPG ON 54% TS. THERE IS A REASON ONLY KAT IS ON THE ROSTER STILL FROM THOSE TEAMS"

Aaron Wiggins our 55th pick has been looking like our best player out there this draft class looks so good top to bottom rn
"Aaron Wiggins is Andrew Wiggins' son.  Man, where does the time go."
"3 of the top 5 picks, what? Everybody watch out when Wiggins, Aaron Gordon and Dante exam team up. 2014 draft class coming!   Also, you said Bron at ‘36 and Russ at ‘32 isn’t old. But somehow Paul Pierce 32, KG 33, Ray Allen 34 and rondo 23 is old"
"Pascal Siakam is a proven top 3 player on a championship team and someone that led the 2019-2020 Raptors to a top 3 record in the entire league, while making it to the allstar team and allnba. What the hell has Wiggins done? And I say that as someone who has always rooted for Andrew.            They are different levels of players. If Pascal was playing next to Steph and Dray, there is no way they wouldn’t have made the playoffs. I’m sure Pascal would have benefited a lot from having Curry take off the offensive pressure (so he doesn’t have to be the \#1 option) and play with Draymond instead of Aaron fucking Baynes.            The fit with Pascal is incredible. He puts a lot of pressure on the rim so teams can’t go small against Warriors. He is a great passer that helps their motion offense. He is a great defender with size."
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"I guess if you squint hard enough, Aaron Wiggins turns into Andrew Wiggins"
Lets fucking go aaron wiggins
I want aaron wiggins to get drafted but wouldn’t mind if we picked him up if he doesn’t
Star: bouknight Bust: Mobley Steal: aaron wiggins
If you don’t like Brogdons inconsistency then wait til you see Andrew Wiggins play regularly. That dude is so overrated and I’d take Brogdon over him all day. If they take Aaron off our hands and throw in Wiggins with Wiseman and that 7 pick I could live with that
Damn. We’re at that point where we’d rather have Aaron Gordon over Wiggins. I’m not disagreeing its just that …. my heart kinda hurts seeing that man
And when you look at that draft it was pretty spotty that high:  1. Wiggins  2. Jabari Parker  3. Embiid  4. Aaron Gordon  5. Exum  6. Marcus Smart  7. Julius Randle  8. Stauskas  9. Vonleh  10. Elfrid Payton  Obviously Embiid is the best choice but I don't fault anybody for not wanting to gamble on him. After that Randle and Smart are the only other two guys really worth a damn and it took Randle awhile. Maybe Gordon with a full training camp and season with Denver. But the rest of it is pretty fucking yikes.  So ending up with Kevin Love and a title was a pretty good return.
I used to be jealous of Aaron Wiggins
"Harris, Grant, Wiggins,   pretty huge gap,  Barnes, Gordon.  Aaron Gordon is in like his 7th year and is still all potential. I’m sick of that dude"
"Interestingly, Jerami Grant will be getting paid less than Aaron Gordon. I'd say Harris, Barnes, Wiggins, Grant, and Gordon."
Wiggins  has no more impact in his career then Aaron Gordon. You can easily argue Aaron has had more impact.
"Him, Sidney Crosby, Andrew Luck, and Bryce Harper were all hailed as the wonder kids future GOATs. And he's the only one to stay healthy and maximize his potential.   Sidney Crosby also did a fantastic job living up to his hype as the next one but obviously the concussions sucked. Bryce is fine. But he didn't meet his expectations to the likes of LeBron and Sidney Crosby.   But like I think Lebron's the first athlete who kinda controlled his career and his legacy. Shouts out to the Big O for introducing free agency. Like often we are left wondering what a players career could have been had he been surrounded by talent. How good could Andrew Luck have been had he had better O-line protection. How good could Aaron Rodgers have been had the Packers drafted WRs in the first round instead say a QB. How good could John Elway have been had he had a run game all his career.   LeBron was like ""oh you are not going to get good players in the primes and just get big names past their prime.....alright bet"" and then went out and pulled in Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Then came back and forced the Cavs to correctly trade for Kevin Love even with Andrew Wiggins going to Minnesota.   Lakers and Heat are the only teams who actually set up LeBron to succeed. Cavs didn't do it till LeBron forced them to.   And then dude had a inner circle coming into the league who he lifted to great lengths.   Granted Klutch Sports Group fucked over a bunch of players and I hope Nerlens Noel gets at least $40-50 mil in compensation."
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
"&gt; the same people said the same things about Embiid in the 2014 draft. He had massive injury concerns, required surgery immediately, and many saw him as a big risk as a big man who’s body couldn’t hold up in the NBA  TBH I see Embiid still as an injury concern on a team nowadays (just like in 2014 draft) but even knowing that, I would have picked him #1.  The important missing context here, is that neither Wiggins, Jabari, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle or LaVine in that draft were on the same level of KD to even have that kind of conversation. Wiggins was viewed at the time for the potential to be a good 2-way player, but I don't remember people talking about him as a super all-star like KD"
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
Who the fuck is Aaron Wiggins
"Yes, Aaron Wiggins. Best A.Wiggins in the NBA"
Aaron Gordon is being payed 19 million next year.  Wiggins will be making 33 million.
"I'm more glad that all our rookies looked good tonight, I will riot if Aaron ""best A.Wiggins"" Wiggins will not get opportunity to play in regular season.   Also, where are clips of Poku's blocks?"
"Ok but Kuzma actually did spend four years in college and graduated with a degree. It's part of the reason he looked like he could hang with Ingram and Lonzo his first few years in the league - he was significantly older than them.  Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, and a few months younger than Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, they were one-and-doners and he did four years at Utah."
"According to the NBA.com's 2015 GM Survey, 44% of GMs predicted that Jahlil Okafor will be the 2016 Rookie of the Year followed by KAT (34%) and Emmanuel Mudiay (13%).

Who the hell is Aaron Wiggins lol
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."
"so far he’s proven to be purely a product of his environment, and is just a unique player mold      in 19-20 he had rookie-justifiable shooting #s, because okc’s 3 guard lineup set him up and he got lucky from deep      in 20-21 his shooting dropped but he got more counting stats as he became a regular starter      so far this season his shooting has dropped again and his counting stats have dropped.      theoretically: Baze should be an awesome transition player as a finisher or handler, a guy who can shoot modestly from deep and attack close outs. he should overwhelm smaller players with wingspan and size and overwhelm larger players with speed and ball handling and burst      in actuality: every Baze dribble is a mistake, and half of his 3’s have absolutely no prayer. he also is not a good finisher and sometimes is tentative about attempting to finish through contact, so basically on offense he doesn’t do anything useful now. on defense he is still often lost when brought into space.   some positives are that he seems to be a genuinely good rebounder, and is a great out-of-area shot blocker and in general is solid on defense in a simpler assignment.      OKC already has a backlog of players not getting minutes (Tre Mann, Aaron Wiggins, Théo Maledon, to a lesser extent JRE) with a ton of picks coming in down the road. unfortunately they will be forced to start punting super early on more developmental picks"
"I remember the hype behind a potential D’Lo for Aaron Gordon or Robert Covington trade.   Back then a lot of people wanted the Warriors to take Covington instead of Wiggins lol, in hindsight that sounds disgustingly bad considering the Warriors were going to be over the cap either way."
Can we take a moment to be happy for Aaron Wiggins who was +8 despite the L tonight
"Thunder fans, how is Aaron Wiggins? Didn’t realize he gets 26 minutes"
Wiggins  Randle  Aaron Gordon  Jabari Parker   One of these is not like the other
Why Aaron Wiggins over Theo Maledon?
"lol, okc fan is joking about aaron wiggins"
laughing at aaron rodgers too. And bradley beal. and andrew wiggins.
"His draft class kinda sucked. Imagine looking at a top 5 draft that included Dante Exum, Aaron Gordon, and Jabari Parker…  Wiggins was hyped up because he was sooo much better than those dudes (excluding Joel)."
