"Kris dunn, backup point guard"
"*laughs, then cries in Will Avery, Ndudi Ebi, Jonny Flynn, Derrick Williams, Kris Dunn, and Jarrett Culver*  The only legitimate success in player development this team has pulled off with its own drafted players is probably Rasho Nesterovic and that was with years of McHale teaching him post moves."
"TWolves got KAT at #1 and Wiggins at #1 (via trade) in back-to-back years, then Kris Dunn at #5 the following year, Anthony Edwards at #1 5 years after KAT."
TJ lookin like how i use kris dunn in my 2k myleague
"True. Idk maybe they could find a way to get Kris Dunn in that package too, but with Dame,CJ and Gary Trent being ahead in the pecking order you have to wonder how much run he would get"
Kris Dunn is supposed to be in that mix but he’s injured.  Coming into this season he was supposed to be our best defender and hasn’t played a minute.
"Kris Dunn doesn’t exist, he’s apart of our imagination"
just wait til Kris Dunn comes back
"Conveniently cutting off at 2019.   If you go to years prior you could see he got Smart, Rozier, Brown, Tatum, and Rob Williams In consecutive years.   Also Nesmith, Pritchard and Langford have all played less than 40 games. Those guys make up half of the 6 picks you mentioned and you’re acting as if they’re already wastes.   And they traded 2 of the other picks (Thybulle, Bane) so Ainge didn’t actually make those selections. They were made for the purposes of the trades (clearing cap for Kemba first, and opening a 5.2 million dollar trade exception 2nd).   Last point I’ll make is any other GM in 2016 and 2017 ends up with Kris Dunn and Markelle Fultz. Ainge drafted two all stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and ended up with a future pick he used on Langford who, again, the jury is still out on."
"they also drafted jaylen brown over kris dunn smh. ainge a fucken hack, still havent recovered from that one. celtics dunn fucked up."
Yeah this isn’t bad I like Kris Dunn for either list also tbh completely incompetent on offense but boy do the bulls miss him on defense
Kris Dunn would be the next coming of John Wall
"If you paid any sort of attention you’d know that the Hawks have been ravaged by injuries this season more than any team not named Portland. I know this is hard for you to accept but when the players that the front office spent $30+ million for in the offseason combine to play a total of half the games combined its going to affect their record. Bogdonavic hasn’t played. Gallo has missed half the season. Deandre Hunter, by far their best perimeter defender and a 17 ppg scorer, has missed half the season (this would be the equivalent of the Suns losing Mikal Bridges). Kris Dunn, one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, missed most of the season.  I gotta say this is both funny and weird coming from a Suns fan. You’d think a fan of Devon Booker, a player who’s finally making his first playoff appearance, would be *more* understanding after hearing years of “Booker is an empty stats player”.  Think about it this way. This year will be Booker’s first season in the playoffs. Do you think every season prior to this year he was an empty stats, non impactful player? Or does he finally has a half decent team around him? Honestly think about it. Which one of those scenarios is more likely to be true."
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
I really wanted to see my boy Kris Dunn shine
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn’t fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the “we’ve gotta make the playoffs!” mentality, and you’ve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"
Boston was also panned for drafting Jaylen Brown over Kris Dunn at the time. Hindsight is 2020.
"He also drafted Kris Dunn over Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Jakob Poeltl and Sabonis (though he was taken 11th so he would've been a bit of a reach)"
"Zach Lavine, Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn was hardly ""our entire future"". And it wouldn't have been one year if we hadn't signed Wiggins to the max."
"MVP candidate is probably a stretch, but I think its underrated how little help he's had.  His point guards before this year had been Kris Dunn and rookie Coby White. Their lottery bigs had been injured and inconsistent, neither of whom rely supplied Lavine with a reliable PnR partner. Otto Porter barely played. He was on a roster with hardly any spacing, facilitating, or secondary scoring, and people dismissed him as an empty stats chucker.  What else could he have done??  It seems like has become a better playmaker, but I think the team improving across the board has really opened up the game for him. No one scores at that volume and that efficiently in a vacuum"
"Kris Dunn, Kevin Durant and Kobe?"
Shit I would’ve taken him before that draft lmao. I loved Kris Dunn coming outta Providence
"Kris Dunn had John Wall comps, anybody would have taken that. Ainge took Jaylen."
"Definitely the Kings. Edwards is ROTY candidate, Lavine is an All-Star level player, KAT is an All-NBA level player, Gorgui Dieng/Kris Dunn/Markkanen/Culver/Okogie all are or look like they can be role players. By contrast, three of the Kings' picks aren't even in the league anymore, and McLemore was out too until the Rockets revitalized him."
"Mo Bamba, Kris Dunn, Markelle Fultz"
Dude put Bev over Jrue Holiday and Kris Dunn
Kris Dunn low-key locks down every guard on the perimeter. Too bad he's always at the hospital
And Kris Dunn... weird trade to look back on.
Thats my Kris Dunn role.
How the hell is Kris Dunn on this but Draymond isn’t?
Considering we took Kris Dunn right before Buddy Hield and Wesley Johnson right before DeMarcus Cousins idk man
Kris Dunn is just team codename for money laundering
"Your team has a lot of secret mythical players, isn't the imaginary, made collection of data that we've christened Kris Dunn supposed to be on the roster now?"
Chandler Parsons Kris Dunn confirmed
It would be nice to play Kris Dunn against the one guy who could beat us tonight.
"Some dude got caught on the phone by his wife talking to Kristen and made up the name Kris Dunn to avoid the heat.  It's gotten way out of control at this point, but even if he's fictional he still has a more justified roster spot than Bruno Fernando."
Kris Dunn. Is he even a real person?
"Defense is their biggest issue easily. And having both BI and Zion does not make this an easy problem to solve   Keep Adams. It wasn’t a great move but he’s there and he’s decent.  Some guys I’d try to get in a trade or in the offseason: Kris Dunn, Ariza, Crowder, Klebler, DFS, Sterling Brown, Nwaba, Portis  Basically getting defensive and/or shooting power on this team. BI/Zion should be able to handle the scoring majority and if they can’t, BI needs to go because having both of them in the front court makes being even an above average defensive team a tough thing to imagine"
"Suggs would bust, boi. That guy gives me a strong Kris dunn vibe."
"That’s because Kris Dunn came back from injury and played three games and had negative win shares in those, therefore the 61 games he had missed are actually counting as less win shares missed. Had Kris Dunn stayed out we would be second, and if he actually continued to get minutes I’m sure he would be positive in winshares but he’s not because other Atlanta players have gotten healthy"
Kris Dunn?
"You should fucking thank us trash ass team for drafting a trash ass player like Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray, else your ass would have been in the same dumpster tier as ours."
How come Kris Dunn isn’t a good defensive PG?                                         I remember wanting Minny to draft Murray and being shocked Thibs picked Dunn because he was exactly like Rubio.
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
"If he was traded there, they would definitely figure it out. Kris Dunn and Trae had ""beef"" but they're on the same team now and they said it was all for the love of ""competing"". Jimmy probably loves anybody who is looking to kill as well."
Depth doesn’t matter that much in playoffs. Atlanta having guys like kris dunn be able to play 10 min a night is not a difference maker.
"Posted the following yesterday. Markus Howard was at +10 MHP but he's now at +7 MHP in 105 minutes (2.4 MHP per 36). Yikes. I don't have the numbers to back it up but I think he's gotta have one of the lowest positive MHP per 36 in the league.  --------------------------  Even fuckin Keljin Blevins has +5 Marvel Hero Points.  To follow up, I looked at players with the lowest PER. The player with the worst PER is Anžejs Pasečņiks, who played 6 minutes with the Wizards and missed one 3, got one rebound, one assist, and gave up 5 turnovers for a whopping -4 Marvel Hero Points.  However, 6 minutes is almost nothing. Theo Pinson has played 33 minutes this season and accumulated -3 Marvel Hero Points, aka MHP (4 TRB, 2 PTS, 1 TO, 8 missed FG). Terrance Ferguson played 49 minutes and has -4 MHP (2 PTS, 1 TRB, 2 AST, 1 STL, 4 TO, 6 missed FG). Kris Dunn, who's almost been invisible for the Hawks in 42 minutes, has exactly 0 MHP.  Then there's Markus Howard. He has 10 MHP, but he's played 101 minutes for the Nuggets (3.6 MHP per 36). He got 33 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, 9 turnovers, 39 missed shots, and a missed free throw.  And then there's Josh Hall of the OKC Thunder. He's played 205 minutes, but has only gotten 24 MHP (good for a 4.2 MHP per 36, less than half that of the worst qualified player). That's because while he's scored 44 points, 32 rebounds, 22 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, he's also had 18 turnovers, 41 missed FGs (12/53), and 15 missed FTs (18/33). Just goes to show how badly a player would have to play to get negative."
You must be thinking of Kris Dunn
I really wanna know why kris Dunn hasn’t played yet
Tatum and brown weren’t easy picks... Brown was projected at 7. Kris Dunn and Dragan Bender were expected to be picked at 3. The consensus number 1 pick in 2017 was Fultz. He took a bold risk and traded down to 3 and found the best player in the draft. Tatum wasn’t even considered the third best prospect. Josh Jackson was.
Didnt the Bulls have him and Kris Dunn out there once?
Is Kris Dunn available?
Is Kris Dunn okay
Kris Dunn crying in the corner rn
Kris Dunn pos
Kris Dunn is such a bum ass
Kris Dunn has big loser energy
Kris Dunn has some very weenie-boy tendencies
Kris Dunn does not handle getting blown out very well
lmao Kris Dunn always beefin😂
"Well that’s just simply not true.  Tatum was not consensus top 3, most had him at 4 or 5.   Brown was even lower than that (usually around 7-10).   Most mock drafts have us taking Kris Dunn and Jock Jackson those years, then add on TimeLord, Pritchard, and Grant Williams (even though he sucks as of now, he was great for us last playoffs and is a big reason we made it to the conference finals).  That’s definitely top five. Personally, I think it’s 2nd behind the Nuggets, but having them at 3-5 isn’t horrible or anything.  But yeah, you need to fact check that consensus part."
"I feel like mr triple ply charmin soft himself, kris dunn. surrounded by sixers and cant stop jawing. just waiting on the mods to whistle me lol"
Kris Dunn can’t win.
Kris Dunn stay the toughest KD in the league
Kris Dunn so salty here. Just take the L and move on my guy
isn't there a joke on the hawks sub that kris dunn is not a real person
Kris Dunn would always try start shit with the Hawks when we used to play the Bulls. I kinda love it
Kris Dunn should probably work on being better at basketball instead of getting mad at Mattise lmao 😬😬😬
Kris Dunn hella mad right now
"Kris dunn is on a minutes restriction too since he’s been out for a year now, and knight, Mays and Bruno would all be in the g-league if it wasn’t for covid"
Also people underrate how much Danny Ainge reached for those picks.   The average GM walks out of those drafts with Kris Dunn / Dragan Bender and Markelle Fultz.
"Don't buy into that BS that the wolves can't develop players.  If Ants a star he'll be a star period  You think Jarrett culver has some hidden stardom in him? Kris Dunn? Okogie? Derrick Williams? Wes Johnson? Nah these guys suck plain and simple.    When the wolves hit on a player, they develop him.  Its just theres way more misses than hits"
The return of Kris Dunn😈
⚠️Trade offer⚠️  Hoxpital receives Lou Will  Atlanta Hox receives Kris Dunn
 Wont believe Kris Dunn is playing till I see it with my own eyes
Kris “Andre Roberson” Dunn
Correct. Kris Dunn does not exist.
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
Oh shit I was thinking of Kris Dunn lmao
"Kris ""Totally an active player, not a money-laundering scheme in a jersey"" Dunn"
"Deandre Hunter (our second leading scorer this season), Kris Dunn, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell."
"Collins was out for a while, gallo is just now getting back, we still haven’t seen kris Dunn,  hunter and reddish are also out. This team is just rarely healthy at the same time"
Shockingly Kris Dunn is out again
kris dunn was a safe pick and Murray was considered too short to be a 2 guard and not skilled enough to be point guard
"We just beat the heat without Trae Young or Capela.   Dont think Coach Nate has ever had our best wing, De'Andre Hunter play under him. Reddish is still out. Kris Dunn doesnt exist."
"We haven't had Hunter or Reddish for most of the season, Gallo and Collins have missed a lot of time. Both Trae and Bogi had to miss a couple of games and both have had to come back while not completely recovered yet, and who knows with Trae and Clint this time around.  Plus at this point we're convinced Kris Dunn is a made up name used in a money laundering scheme"
Kris Dunn don't exist dude
"Nahh. He’s super raw. I’d say he’s got the highest chance to bust out of Top 5.  But based off potential, I have him 3rd.  Cunningham, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, Suggs  I honestly don’t rate Suggs. Gives me Kris dunn vibes."
.... Are you being serious by comparing Kris dunn to draymond?
when is kris dunn all-nba lol
Bud sorry to break it to you but Kris Dunn is not going to be a reason you make noise in the playoffs.    You have a lot more to figure out before someone like Kris Dunn is taking you over the top.
"Lmao when Kris fucking Dunn is a ""key player"""
I'm pretty sure we've had at least 2-3 key players out due to injury for the entire season. we signed Kris Dunn to be our lock down defender and he still hasn't played a game lmao
Lol he really brought up Kris Dunn as a reason they lost
The Hawks really managed to hit on every signing they made this offseason (except Kris Dunn who may or may not actually exist?). Their rotation when Trae is off the floor is actually good now. So used to the offense being completely inept when he’s not the focus of it
"I don't actually think that's true, he even gave kris dunn a good amount of minutes his rookie season, until he obviously showed he was awful at the game of basketball. He's giving quickley minutes now and played other rooks in chicago if they produced"
"I think we are.  We are still missing Hunter who looked like Kawhi lite (efficient 17ppg with elite defense), Reddish and Gallinari.  Also allegedly Kris Dunn, if he ever plays for us.  With everyone healthy we can be the 4th best team in the East and make the second round.   I don't see us having a chance against the top 3 though, maybe if we're super lucky and they are injured."
Nah he was still a shit coach. The defense was designed to give up open corner 3's and the offense was just Butler in isolation. Props to him for being able to actually make it work in New York though.  Also some extra's for how bad a GM he was: he picked Kris Dunn over Murray and he offered Shabazz Muhammad 4y/40m.
Defense doesn't matter that much for point guards. Kris Kris Dunn is one of the elite point guard defenders and got rewarded with 5 million a year.
Could have Kris Dunn coming off bench for a defensive PG if he ever comes back
"I mean the wolves have drafted pretty well in the lottery though since kat has been there. Their only real lottery misses since kat got there has been kris Dunn and cam johnson. And the year before kat they got Lavine. The t wolves have done a fairly decent job drafting, it’s just the fact that no one really wants to sign with them.   I mean, they had jimmy and it resulted in a playoff berth but we know that jimmy specifically wanted out because he didn’t like how one of Wiggins/KAT handled themselves/competed everyday."
Gotta draft guess worth keeping first. Not like Kris Dunn and Derrick Williams are seeing the league on fire with other teams...
Or my number one imaginary friend Kris Dunn.
Naw you know Simmons is getting taken #1. I really like Kris Dunn
"Is calling Kris Dunn a megastar part of your unpopular opinion?   /s  Seriously though, this has been really hard for Mavs fans. People say “JJ” and I can’t always tell who they mean. We have Mavs legend JJ Barea who retired in the offseason, we had Justin Jackson who we traded in the offseason for James Johnson, who we then traded for JJ Redick recently. It’s just an never ending stream of JJs"
Kris Dunn and Shaq Harrison.   Shaq somehow can’t find footing with any team.   Smart decision on Dunn in retrospect.
People were expecting us to draft Kris Dunn in 2016 and Josh Jackson in 2017. Imagine if we'd actually done that... yikes.
Whos Kris Dunn
"There has been an ongoing investigation, but at this time no, we do not believe Kris Dunn actually exists. Could be for tax purposes"
He was a beast in the tournament. Kris Dunn too was like that
I really thought Kris Dunn was going to be an all-star at some point. I also thought the Celtics we're absolute morons for taking Jaylen Brown over him which goes to show what I know.
Kris Dunn
"And John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kris Dunn"
I refuse to believe that Kris Dunn is a real person
Kris Dunn (0.0)  Stephen Curry (30.4)  LeBron James (25.4)  Jaren Jackson Jr (0.0)  Ban Adebayo (19.0)  74.8... you can keep the change.
a polo and jeans is the only uniform we've seen kris dunn in this season
I guess Kris Dunn wants to show that he's always been that guy
Like taking Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray when you already have Rubio?
Kris Dunn
Kris Dunn
Is Kris Dunn dead?
"You're not looking at WHO we've been missing. De'Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Kris Dunn have not played in months except for two games Hunter came back for. Those are our three best perimeter defenders. When we had Hunter and Reddish both healthy and playing we were a top ten defense. Since then we were like 22nd or something the last time I checked. You made the point that you hide a poor defender by surrounding him with good defenders. Well, we have done that. They've just been injured for months lmao."
Lol word if missing TT means you don't have the full roster i may as well say the Hawks have gone the entire year without the full roster since Kris Dunn hasnt played for us yet (ignoring all of our other actual and more impactful injuries of which there have been plenty)
Kris Dunn is not real.
Maybe he means the invisible man Kris Dunn?
"Okay, but are you really thinking Derrick Williams wouldve been something if he was drafted by like the Heat? No, the Heat wouldve been smart enough to not draft Derrick Williams.  What about wes Johnson? Kris Dunn? These are high lotto picks who were selected despite having very little in the way of actual talent"
"He's been out all season but you can't forget about Kris Dunn, before his injury, he had a case for best perimeter defender in the league."
"Culver will be tossed in the heap of busts we've picked who never amount to anything even on another team.  Derrick Williams, wes Johnson, Shabazz Muhammad, Kris Dunn , and now Jarrett culver"
Kris Dunn
"I've wondered if Kris Dunn could have turned into a Jrue type player had he ended up with a team like the Raptors or Spurs, or really with anyone other than Jim Boylen.  I was pretty confused why he choose the Hawks of all places this offseason to try and rehab his value tbh."
"It's awesome that Bogi has found a groove because the Hawks really need it with Collins and Hunter out. I know when they fired LP they had the second most games missed due to injury on an NBA team this year. I don't know how much that changed since. They looked like they were getting healthy, but Hunter's knee is bothering him again and Collins sprained his ankle. Reddish is going to be out at least two more weeks and at this point I'm not sure Kris Dunn is a real person. It would be really cool as a Hawks fan to get to see this team at full strength."
"The combined people out from both teams would make a playoff team.  Trae Young, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williams, John Collins, Danillo Gallinari, Cameron Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Josh Hart, Kris Dunn."
I see you've been in the Hawks subreddit my friend. The entity known as Kris Dunn has never existed.
"The evidence overwhelmingly points to the fact that, no - Kris Dunn is not actually real. Science proves this fact."
also is kris dunn even real lmfao what's the injury keeping him out for the year
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
"Sure, but he also could’ve ended up with Fultz and Kris Dunn."
*Kris Dunn has entered the chat.*
"Think about it this way.  Ben Simmons was a consensus #1 pick.  The likelihood that any of those picks ends up being #1, let alone #1 in a year where there's a clear frontrunner, is pretty low.  Yeah, you could get lucky like the Celtics did and pull off multiple top 3 picks, but that trade looks way better in hindsight and could have easily been 3 top 10-15 picks.   I'm not saying it was a bad decision necessarily, but it is true that the likelihood of any of those picks being better than Ben Simmons as a prospect is low. That doesn't even count savvy/lucky drafting on the Celtics part.  Tatum could have easily been Fultz or Lonzo (or Josh Jackson), and the next two picks after Jaylen Brown was Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn.  Just saying, 4 picks and 4 swaps isn't a guarantee of anything."
"A good young known player is always way better than unknown draft picks.  Everyone gets drunk on the idea of picks but man looking back drafting is still such a shit show.  And now the tanking odds are worst than ever.    Here are some of the top five picks from the last 5 years. 2016, 4th Pick - Dragon Bender, 5th Pick Kris Dunn  2017 1st Pick - Fultz, 4th Pick Josh Jackson  2018 2nd Pick Marvin Bagley    those are just the strait busts.  Luka is prob the only guy that would be definitively taken before Ben."
Kris Dunn is probably the best defender I’ve seen on Trae. Now I’m not even sure he exists anymore.
"Hawks 1) Trae 2) Collins 3) Capella 4) Hunter 5) Gallo 6) Bogi 7) Huerter 8) Snell 9) Reddish 10) Hill  Not listen due to not playing - Lou Will, Kris Dunn"
"What a disaster your drafting has been recently. Carter out the door, Markinaen soon to follow and Coby White not exactly lighting the world on fire. Kris Dunn was a swing and a miss as well."
Hawks have missed half their rotation for most of the season too.   With Hunter and Kris Dunn playing soon don't be surprised if they make a push for the 4/5 seed
"How you gonna throw in ""passing on Lamelo"" as if Edwards isnt a good pick rn, Culver is a bad pick but we were trading up for Garland who is good rn, Kris Dunn was the best PG behind Simmons in 2016 and a lock to go top 5.      Most of this is just hindsight."
"Thats not true.  Its just that what they do is often stupid.  Passing on Lamelo, trading up and drafting Jarrett Culver when at least the next 7 guys taken after him are much better, taking Kris Dunn with Buddy Hield and Jamal Murray on the board.  Just a few examples  These are things are not bad luck, they're just decisions made by people who are not smart"
"People act like the Hawks have been healthy. The second best player in the team has been out now for some time in Hunter - Reddish is our, Bogi was out for an while, Rondo has missed significant time , Gallinari was out a while, and OO our rookie didn’t get to start the season because of injuries. I’m pretty sure the Hawks have yet to play a game at full strength and that’s not even counting Kris Dunn who has yet to play."
"I mean its pretty strong evidence that the horrible drafting is the main problem.  Draft Flynn and Rubio, Curry goes right after  Draft Wes Johnson, Demarcus Cousins goes right after  Draft Kris Dunn, Jamal Murray goes right after   Trade up and draft Jarrett Culver, the next 7 guys who go after him are easily better   When the Wolves hit on a pick, they nail it.  Kevin Love, Lavine, KAT.  All 3 players developed just fine on the Wolves.  But theres just waaayyy too many shitty picks mixed in between.  Like not even players who underachieve,  just straight up bad players with these high lottery picks.  And thats why they can't ever build around their all star talent  Would a guy like Greg popovich have gotten more out of , say, Derrick Williams than the wolves did? Sure, but youre still just putting lipstick on a pig"
"The wolves problem has far and away been in IDENTIFYING talent, not in failing to develop it.    Who left Minnesota and really blew up? Zach Lavine is probably the best example you can give, but he was putting up 18 ppg on great efficiency during the 2016/17 season (his third in the league) with MN before he tore his ACL and was traded for Jimmy Butler.    The problem with the Wolves is talent identification, they take players in the lottery who simply are not particularly good.  What did Derrick Williams do after his couple seasons in MN? What did Wes Johnson do? What about Johnny Flynn?  Rashad McCants? Shabazz Muhammad? Kris Dunn? And soon you'll be able to add Jarrett Culver to that list.    Ita stuff like passing on Lamelo that keeps the wolves franchise down, its really that simple"
What the hell happened to the bulls defense this year. I’m not buying it’s not just no Kris Dunn. The scheme change is supposed to help not hurt then
We trade JC for Taurean Prince (who we traded last season for the corpse of allen crabbe) the 25th pick and a low second rounder and we somehow also have to give up Kris Dunn? Absolutely not. I'd rather let him walk than make sure a terrible trade.
"The Hawks only wing defenders are all out.  Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Kris Dunn. Not as sever as the Raps, but still not full strength."
Reminder that Thibs picked Kris Dunn instead of this guy
"Everything bad always stems from Glen. Pretty sure they were gonna offer Kris Dunn/Lauri plus Wiggins instead of Zach and maybe we get to keep Lauri who knows but either way we would've been so much better off if Thibs was able to ship Wiggins ass out for Butler.   Thibs as a GM was bad for sure but he had some redeeming qualities because he did get Taj, DRose, and some decent vets on the team. I didn't like trading Ricky but I think he straight up didn't like Ricky and vice versa and I fucking hate watching Jeff Teague play basketball but by far Thibs worst moves as a GM were draft picks."
"Because it's Tjarks and he's a hack.  I think it was 2 years ago when he wrote the season preview for y'all, and about 80% of the preview was on Kris Dunn. 20% was on Lavine and 0 was on Markannen - like I don't think he mentioned him at all."
Sounds like Kris Dunn lmao
I’m from Rhode Island so Kris Dunn. Born in CT and played at Providence lol hope that counts
"He already has one. We got Trae Young, Lou Will, Tony Snell, Nathan Knight, and the ghost of Kris Dunn. We're loaded!"
Kris Dunn
And Cam Reddish and Kris Dunn
"true, Kris Dunn is on our team"
Can we get a solid 2 minutes of Kris Dunn hacking Ben Simmons and fouling out? He'd be an ATL hero.
"Between Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, Bruno Fernando, and Kris Dunn, the Hawks have 24 chances to hack Ben Simmons."
Or Hawks legend Kris Dunn.
"It’s unreal, they’re also missing Kris Dunn who probably would’ve been playing valuable plug and play minutes if he was 100%"
"but Kris Dunn has the same initials as Kevin Durant. The team that signs him can tweet ""KD has decided to take his talents to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" to get a few more twitter followers."
"we were so high on Kris Dunn and rightly so, but damn people wanted him over Zach?"
Why does Kris Dunn get no minutes. Injured?
So does Kris Dunn just suck now or is he hurt?  Just noticed he was on the hawks.
"and with the fifth overall pick in the 2016 draft, the minnesota timberwolves select kris dunn"
"I have a feeling Cam will actually play.   This is just me reading between the lines.  But when Schlenk was on sports radio yesterday *cough and lied about hunters injury cough* he was asked about both players injuries and was quick to defer to how Cam was extremely close to coming back before he talked about Hunter.  In retrospect, I can see why.   I also don’t know if this is comparable to the Kris Dunn situation.  Our guard situation is way better than our wing situation right now.  We need a quality player at SF more than we need one at PG.   I really think we’ll see Cam on the court guarding Tobias Harris on Friday."
"I was about to say this. I don't understand how half the comments include Draymond when he's a great passer, has high offensive BBIQ, and shot respectably in his prime. There has to be a better option for point guard, though point guards being strong on defense and bad at offense are hard to come by. Might I suggest Kris Dunn?"
Kris Dunn boutta earn his contract
"Done, I’m going to bid on Kris Dunn jersey on eBay"
"True, I think Okongwu won’t be a huge factor until Capela leaves, unfortunately. I think the Hawks really could use a healthy Kris Dunn, I assume he picks up his option and remains healthy next season"
I love you Hubie but I doubt Kris Dunn helps the Hawks this series.
"Well Team B has Kris Dunn who is basically the second coming of Gary Payton, who would be the best player on the court so team b."
"Tough look for u/lardbiscuits “Atlanta still sucks because Capela was never good in the first place. He's a glorified Nerlens Noel who was lucky to get fed lobs by Harden his whole career.  Gallo is old and they signed him to a three year deal. Not only is he going to be playing out of position (Capela, Collins and Gallo is a terrible 5-4-3 in today's NBA defensively), but he's going to decline before that deal is up.  They're about to hand a bag to the most overrated player in the NBA in Bogdan. The dude is a bad defender and borderline starter. He literally averages 14 points a game.  Kris Dunn literally can't score the ball.  They're going to stunt any hope they had of developing Cam and are still going to give up 130 points a game.”"
"Hmm.... As a straight man... I'm gonna say Nerlens Noel or Kris Dunn, even though he hasn't played"
Is it too hard to even read until the second reply from the twitter-op?   It’s because Kris Dunn has a negative ws and therefore somehow affects the games lost ws negatively by playing games. Before that Hawks were 2nd. Just go back in his posts and search for the peak in ws lost for the Hawks compared to the other teams in the league  Edit: Also you didn’t simply ask a question lol. You asked a rhetorical question and followed it by a wall of text to answer it with your own opinion.
"This narrative has got to stop   Traded a big chunk of their future?   They moved down 9 spots in the draft to get Butler while giving up LaVine (an all star now but Butler was also an all star then and now) and Kris Dunn, who is just a decent bench defender. Nothing else. They didn’t give up jack that hurt their future"
I thought Kris Dunn was gonna be so good he might be my biggest draft miss ever. I also thought Justice Winslow was gonna be a star. Def my two biggest misses
Holy shit is that Kris 'Kasper the Ghost' Dunn?
Holy shit is that Kris Dunn??
Finally Kris Dunn checks in
It’s Kris Dunn time
"Aye if y’all lose the series just send kawhi to us. We’ll give you tony snell and kris dunn, one is a great defender and the other is the best 3pt shooter in the league."
Kris Dunn with his perpetual knee and injury
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
Bruv idk why Lou gets so much burn when an elite defender and decent playmaker at most Kris Dunn rots on the bench. He could've scratched a few points from D-Rose.
Timberwolves: 2014: Glenn Robinson #40  2014: Markel Brown #44  2014: Alessandro Gentile #53  2015: Rakeem Christmas #36  2016: Kris Dunn #5 (19 or 20th best in his class)  2018: Josh Okogie #20  2018: Keita Bates-Drop #48  Traded on draft night excluded.   That’s worse. Happy?
"Kris Dunn (rightfully) got a lot of credit for what he did for the Bulls defense last year, truth is I think Shaq is an even better defender (unfortunately probably an even worse offensive player)"
Kris Dunn catching strays in the Jeremy Lin thread 😂
"Big irony here being he'd almost certainly still be on the Hawks if he hadn't requested a trade because he didn't want to be on a tanker, Hawks have functionally no true backup PG with Kris Dunn being a hologram invented by the NBA to gaslight Hawks fans"
Fam Kris Dunn would've saved at least 4 of those bench points
Just realized this is the kris dunn - tom thibodeau revenge series. big news for us wolves fans
Bruh how does this NOT go to Kris Dunn... Hawks fans still aren’t sure of his existence
Well our backup PG just got ruled out for the season and Kris Dunn might be entirely fictional so he doesn't really have a choice in regards to Trae.
Who else is super glad Thibs took Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray?   Even after he said he actually wanted to come play [here!!?](https://dunkingwithwolves.com/2016/06/21/jamal-murray-wants-to-play-for-the-timberwolves/amp/)
"Josh Jackson, Kris Dunn, Dennis Smith Jr  Maybe not superstars but I thought they’d all be at least all star level"
Dude's looked like Kris Dunn out there this season lmao
"Its nice to not fuck up a pick.  We get things right every now and then,  but the misses are absolutely crippling and lead to this failing to build around the stars that we are known for (looking at you, wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Shabazz Muhammad, Kris Dunn, Jarrett culver).   Flynn gets a pass, he failed due to injury"
Kris Dunn.
Damn Kris Dunn really got that good huh?
"Why do you hate us? We gave you a lockdown defender, the real KD - Kris Dunn."
Kris Dunn?
Kris Dunn with better marketing
So ... Reggie Bullock?  We could do a smaller portion of the MLE on Kris Dunn
It's kinda true though at least for non bigs. Who gets the glory Kris Dunn or Trae Young?
Kris Dunn in shambles
"Kris Dunn's last Bulls season was a great example of this. One of the best defenders in the game, but I think was dead last in open 3pt % above a certain number of attempts.   So teams would just clog the paint to prevent Zach LaVine drives when Kris Dunn was on the floor."
KD is Kris Dunn
kris dunn / terry rozier
"The Hawks paid Kris Dunn $4,767,000 this year to score 11 points (reg and postseason) -&gt; $433,363.64 per point"
"1. Cade - less athletic Grant Hill  2. Mobley - more defensive minded Chris Bosh   3. Green - 75% of Bradley Beal, better defender   4. Suggs - Tall, athletic Lowry with less ass   5. Kuminga - Very athletic Harrison Barnes   6. Barnes - Diet Draymond Green   7. Moody - TJ Warren with better defense   8. Keon - Shanon Brown with a better jumper  9. Sengun - Sabonis lite  10. Mitchell - offensively competent Kris Dunn   11. Bouknight - Nickiel Alexander-Walker   12. Kispert - Doug McDermott  13. Giddey - Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball"
"Sign and trade Collins for literally anything, he's a negative asset with a large contract  Draft BPA  Honestly I'm confident with Bogdan running the 2nd unit PG so I don't think we really need a solid backup point guard (30 min to Trae, 30 minutes to Bogdan, 25 minutes to Reddish, 25 to Huerter, 25 to Gallinari, 25-30 for Hunter, 30 for Capela, 15-20 for Okongwu, and around 30-40 minutes for backups like Kris Dunn and Brandon Goodwin, some min contract vets like Solomon Hill and Tony Snell, and our draft pick."
There's no way Lou Williams and Kris Dunn play worse than that.
All this and we haven’t even put in Kris Dunn yet 😎
Hawks should play the real KD against Middleton aka Kris Dunn
"For some reason I thought that was Kris Dunn, and then I realized that Mirotic is way to tall for that to have been Kris Dunn. Lol."
"Yea.  If we swap him out for Brogdon we’re an 8 seed.  Simmons won rookie of the year, is a three time all star, runner up in DPOY and this sub acts like he’s Kris Dunn.  Simmons has carried our team without Embiid multiple times throughout the years.  They’re just a bad fit together.  But trading him for a player that’s leagues worse to address fit issues would be fucking stupid."
"&gt;Kris Dunn you have to ask Bull fans. Good defender and okay playmaker but 0 offensive game.  He dominated Summer League before getting lost in the rotation.  [ In the league, he did none of this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mZm9ywqB-_0)"
"I think they got a little switch happy at times. There was a Dunn/Galinari PnR that they switched at one point and I was like ""can't we at least go under a Kris Dunn PnR and let Lopez rest a little bit?""  The Hawks were isolating on him at the top of the key nonstop, and I was worried he was gonna get super worn down from spending so much energy on both ends.  The Bucks do very little pre-switching. Like, if it's clear that they are going to try to get a switch onto Lopez and you've got somebody else on that side of the court (usually stretching towards the corner), let Lopez switch onto that match-up and camp in the corner a little.   Edit: https://youtu.be/AQr54Toq5eA?t=05m30s this video does a better job of explaining the concept. Not saying you want Lopez running side to side of the court like Curry was at times there, but there are situations where I feel like Lopez could just stay on one side of the court near the corner"
"How good is Culver and what ever happened to SL, Kris Dunn?"
Late to the party but Ron Artest was an all star player with all nba/HOF talent who had violent outbursts.  Beverly is a PJ Tucker/Bruce Bowen/Tony Allen/Kris Dunn type who has one or two near average offensive skills with extremely tenacious and hard nosed defense.
"Nah, he's a really good defender lol. Booker shot 38% in the Clippers series, and the majority of that was off the back of Beverly's defense. Gary Harris straight up isn't better than him, and Kris Dunn is hard to rate atm."
"According to stats, Kris Dunn was the best perimeter defender in the NBA last year and it wasn’t even close. But he doesn’t get minutes because hes very bad on offense"
"No, you’re actually wrong to be honest. I’m not sure why this post got so many upvotes?   You were correct regarding the Suns and the Bucks but how could you overlook the Hawks roster?  You said that no *PLAYER* on the suns, bucks, or hawks has ever won a ring….how bout you look closer…the reason you’re wrong is because Kris Dunn, who is listed on the Hawks roster, actually isn’t a PLAYER *because he doesn’t exist.* Seriously, I’m not trolling or anything. Ask my colleagues at r/AtlantaHawks  They’ve got receipts and legitimate proof as to Dunn’s lack of existence. Seriously, we’ve been researching it since the beginning of the season"
Kris Dunn was a top 5 pick by the wolves. That team has drafted so many busts my god
Lou Will is so bad they actually brought out Kris Dunn
"Bucks with the starters, Hawks with... Kris Dunn?"
This is a bad take especially since the only other pg we have is kris Dunn
Our only other PGs are Skylar Mays and Kris Dunn
Alternative is Kris Dunn. Somehow Lou is better
"Cam, OO, and... Kris Dunn are the only Hawks in the positive right now — their defense is definitely showing up. Bogdan at -13 despite getting 13 points and potentially saving the game with a clutch three is kinda nuts, but the Bucks offense has been on FIRE. Portis, Lopez, Middleton, and Holiday all above 13 points rn... crazy."
"Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Thanasis all on the floor for Milwaukee while Atlanta has Solomon Hill, Okongwu, Kris Dunn, and Cam Reddish to close the quarter (while already down 15)  These are the best playoffs ever, I love when the conference finals feel like a preseason game!"
"When Kris Dunn is getting playoff minutes for you, you have issues"
"Yikes, Kris Dunn. Just yikes. Get him out of there."
Kris Dunn is so damn bad
Kris Dunn playing how he did on the Bulls
I don't know how Kris Dunn forgot how to play basketball all of sudden
Kris Dunn getting minutes in game 5 of a conference finals series lmao I’m weak
Kris Dunn is a huge offensive liability
"how the hell was Kris Dunn a top 5 pick, this dude blows"
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"Yes  Because Minnesota went second star chasing in the draft  instead of acquiring legit nba talent because they thought  guys like Jarrett Culver and Kris Dunn would be the mystical second star. The one time they smartly made a move (Jimmy)  they won .     New Orleans  dicked around with AD ,acquired Boogie ,then we know what happened .They also think using draft picks on guys like Kira Lewis,NAW and whatever they draft this year is better than using those assets to acquire actual NBA players …which is why Zion is grumbling now apparently .  Dallas is trying to acquire talent , they just have bad timing with this years FA class    The clock is ticking in Memphis ."
Kris Dunn
"Kris Dunn isn't real, don't be silly."
Dunn Kris that other guy we leave him in the supply closet.
"Still hoping Giannis can come back later this series, just like Trae.  I wanna see the leagues best go at each other not Kris Dunn vs Thanasis."
"""Who is another guard on the Hawks?"" was too funny.   I think you can hear him say Dunn, so he probably meant Kris Dunn."
"Hes like the Lochness Monster, some say Kris Dunn exists, but no one has hard proof that he is real"
And Kris Dunn 😈😈😈
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
"he’s a complete 0 offensively, they might as well put me out there at least it is possible for me to make a jump shot, and he’s obviously good defensively but tbh he fouls a lot, and the other bench guards (lou and bogi) are plenty good enough defensively to keep them in the lineup for their playmaking (lou) and shooting (bogi). there’s no reason to go 5 guards deep in a playoff game and kris dunn is our 5th best guard."
Jordan Nwora  Kris Dunn  Abdel Nader  DeMarcus Cousins  Vote for your finals mvp
i really thought Kris Dunn was going to be special when he was drafted   totally didn't know he was on the hawks
Damn I didn’t know Kris Dunn was on the hawks
bro kris dunn is still alive? holy shit
Kris Dunn trash ass disrespectful for shooting a 3.
Kris Dunn is a Skyhawk
Oh fuck we got Kris Dunn taking 3s out here
Kris Dunn...
kris dunn finals mvp
Kris Dunn is so incompetent lol
"Kris, Dunn, Capela, and Solo but everyone else? Not bad"
Man Kris Dunn really fell off
yeah he did and kris dunn got second quarter mins
Y’all gonna fuck around and make us put Kris Dunn back in
"This is fun. Hawks are a likable group. Also, I missed Kris Dunn minutes? How did he look in his 5 minutes?"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Kris Dunn definitely did not stay ready
Kris Dunn almost led the league in steals last year with us
"i was super high on kris dunn a couple years ago, didn't pan out"
I completely forgot Kris Dunn exists.
Ok I can see why Kris Dunn doesn’t get a lot of minutes
kris dunn…..
You’re losing to Kris Dunn
I’m really watching Kris Dunn and Cam Reddish in the ecf
Holy shot is that Kris Dunn? Didn’t know he was on the Hawks
Tuning into the game late wtf kris dunn still plays basketball ???
Yo is that Kris Dunn?
I enjoy Kris Dunn on defense.  I do not enjoy Kris Dunn on offense.
KRIS DUNN ON A BASKETBALL COURT THIS IS NOT A DRILL
"Hawks fans, does Kris Dunn get any minutes?"
&gt; Dunn is not even a real player  Bro.... Kris Dunn.
Kris Dunn.  Point guard for the Atlanta Hawks.
By god is that... IT IS! ITS KRIS DUNN.
"Kris Dunn dunked so hard he did the same thing, also took a chunk of the Bulls court with him"
Kris Dunn? No that's starting Small Forward for the New Orleans Pelicans.
"kris dunn, tony snell, and cam reddish had zero minutes tonight. a big lineup of both OO and capela could also be a thought.  their are options, even if it’s for just a few minutes so that someone shooting 3/16 isn’t playing 36 minutes"
"But super shallow with Play makers. Lou Will is operating as the primary back up PG, and he is at best a below average play maker. Plus Bogi is hurt too, another primary ball handler behind Trae.    If Trae can't go that leave 1 legged Bogi who is ice cold, Lou, and Kris Dunn."
Kris Dunn would’ve helped there
Defensive legend Kris Dunn. I’ll never forget the game he played for us lol
Kris Dunn still alive?
Kris Dunn should play more
"Lead was 40 when the starters came out, now its only 35. Clearly we need to start Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn next game, its the only way to win this series"
Will the real Kris Dunn please stand up
Kris Dunn is 27 already? wth Beal is 27 and was drafted 4 years before him
Kris Dunn is healthy?
Had no idea Kris Dunn was on the Hawks lol
Kris Dunn you played about 12 minutes all season. You contest that dunk
"Lavine. Dude’s had Coby White, Tomas Satoransky  and Kris Dunn as his point guards since he got to Chicago. Ball and Derozan are huge playmaking upgrades. Plus add the attention Vuc and Derozan will take away from him. He averaged 27 PPG on like 63% TS. That efficiency is about to go up even further."
"Off the top of my head, Dante Exum, Markelle Fultz, Justise Winslow, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina"
I was very high on kris Dunn. Thought he could be next d wade type.
G: Jonny Flynn G: Kris Dunn F: Wes Johnson F: Jarrett Culver C: Derrick Williams
"I’m pretty happy about the route they took. The only players I felt strong about keeping were both Jays, Smart, and Rob. Anyone else I was happy with moving. I do genuinely think Nesmith and Pritchard are worth developing so i am good with that decision. I am very happy with getting kris dunn and richardson. I think Kanter is only solid because of his price. Horford I don’t know how I feel about yet. I think he was a decent exchange to offload kemba on, but I think he is still on an albatross for what he has left"
"Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, Chris Silva, Khris Middleton, Chris Boucher"
I've witnessed Kris Dunn take over a game. It's rare but it can happen
"PG - Ben Simmons  SG - Andre Roberson   SF - Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  PF - Jonathan Isaac  C - Bam Adebayo  Bench - Kris Dunn, Matisse Thybulle, Derrick Jones Jr, Michael Kidd-Gilchrest,  Nerlens Noel.   I'm not sure how this team would ever score, but I think they could win one defensive slugfest against a bad team where they just hold them to like 80 and get a bunch of transition buckets"
"It would be D-League players all the way down the line imo  If the peak Process Sixers can win 10 games in a season (and I think they're the mostly deliberately bad roster assembled in the last 20 years), you need something considerably worse.  Using players that I know played minutes last season:  Starters: Michael Carter-Williams, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Alen Smilagic, Cristiano Felicio  Bench: Kris Dunn, Hamidou Diallo Jarrett Culver, Henry Ellenson, Jahlil Okafor  Just an absolutely horrific group of players, where no one player is ever an actual threat to take over and win you a game. The defense here is almost competent and I think at some point, the stars align and they have one game against a really bad team that's stuck in their own heads and win like 72-69"
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
"We replaced Kemba with Dennis Schroeder and Kris Dunn, and Enes Kanter is our backup big. We have old ass Horford back. How exactly did we get “A LOT” better?"
"Well, plus they saved money, got Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, got rid of Thompson, aren't paying  Fournier 20m a year and now have a 17m TPE."
"If anything I’d want him to practice hard, I play basketball, I like when people take Practice serous because you get locked in, it does nothing but make you better. Part of the reason I was happy the hawks got kris dunn last year because I knew he’d make Trae work In practice"
" Legit question, how is kris Dunn doing? He was kinda bad with us."
"Perimeter defense, maybe. We also have Kris Dunn and Josh Richardson. But I’m guessing Al isn’t as good as he was when he was with us, and Timelord is still a little raw and often injured. So I don’t think we have the interior presence to be the top defense"
Is that Kris Dunn looking fly in the left corner?
"I love 3 guard line-ups with some defensive oomph. I hated hated HATED Boylen, but the ONE thing I liked about him was his Kris Dunn + Shaq Harrison + (3rd guard) blitz lineup. It was so fun watching Kris Dunn and Shaq Harrison go all out on defense and attack the ball like absolute attack dogs.  In a weird way it reminded me of Devin Hester on the Bears. Devin made it so the boring part of football (special teams) became THE most exciting part of every Bears game. Similarly, that lineup made the defensive end so exciting to watch.  Can't wait to see Alex Caruso being an absolute dog on defense. Let's bring Kris Dunn or Shaq Harrison back home to play alongside him."
it's summer league. Kris Dunn was a summer league god.
I have a mental block that prevents me from reading Kris Dunn/Kendrick Nunn correctly on the first attempt.
"Horford is an upgrade over Thompson in every single facet of the game except offensive rebounding and immediately adds playmaking to the offensive mix, which was by far the team's largest issue last year.    Losing Kemba and Fournier hurts scoring in theory, but in reality they both missed like half of all possible games anyway, and both were heavily restricted (Kemba's knee, or Fournier by COVID) in a major chunk of the games they actually did play.  Neither were significant or consistent contributors last year, so their departures are ultimately a wash.  Richardson and Schroder aren't great players, but should be able to provide reasonable approximations of the actual offensive production we got out of those two even if they don't match what we had originally hoped for out of Kemba/Evan.  Kanter is also a solid third center and change of pace option, significantly better than Kornet/Tacko.  Pritchard/Nesmith had to rush into the season without summer league or much in the way of camps.  This was particularly rough on Nesmith who hadn't seen game action in close to a full calendar year by the time the season started due to sitting out the back half of his sophomore year at Vandy.  He finished off the year orders of magnitude better than he started, and there is no real reason to suspect he won't carry that development into this year.  The team (outside of maybe Schroder) is vaccinated.  We were either the hardest hit or one of the hardest hit teams by COVID last year and, when you only have about 8 actual NBA quality players on the roster, having multiple inactives every single night really fucks with you in a number of ways.  Simply having more consistent availability, along with replacing the flotsam at the end of the roster with a few more NBA level guys, should help the team significantly.  Like you can only do so much when you have to play Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters non-garbage time minutes.  Kris Dunn might not be that good, but it's almost impossible to imagine that he would be worse as at that emergency PG spot than Carsen.  This roster makes a lot more sense than last year's.  There should be better role clarity, better depth, and better continuity between the starting lineup and bench.  Jayson is probably not going to miss half a month or play through lingering COVID deficiencies, and the same for Jaylen with his wrist/knee.  The starting lineup will probably play more than 110 minutes together over the entire season.  There is a ton of recency bias out there because the team was not very active in free agency and people think dramatic flurries of moves to be the only way a team can improve, but tbh last season was so disastrous that simply having players actually playing games should lead to some baseline improvement."
There were once threads debating whether Kris Dunn or Zach Lavine would be better
"Suggs seems to be playing with a harnessed poised.  Barnes being selected over him might have something to with this.  I don’t want to get to carried away, because a few years ago, Kris Dunn looked like a lock, but Suggs has been playing great."
If Kris Dunn has a job Nkiklitina can get one as well for the league minimum somewhere.
"Kris Dunn, the next D-Wade."
"Jimmer Fredette, Frank Ntilikina, Kris Dunn?"
"good value its just we already got smart, richardson, pritchard, hell were also trading for kris dunn for some reason and i was hoping to see madar come over from israel.   i just would rather see guys like madar and pritchard get minutes, letting these young guys develop and then potentially signing a big name (since the celtics seem to be really keen on cap space) we would have some role players for a potential run the season after next."
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford – Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson – Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn – Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
Celtics should just see if they can dump Kris Dunn in a sign and trade with the Lakers. Boom no hard cap.
I doubt Kris Dunn will even be in the league next season - that PO is just a trade chip.
"Ok this is kinda wrong.   - Danny traded Kanter and the 30th pick for two future seconds. 30th was Bane.  - Danny signed TT. He under performs.  - Brad becomes GM - Brad traded TT in exchange for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a future 2nd. The Celtics DID NOT use a pick to dump TT, they actually got a pick for him.  - Brad signed Kanter for the veteran minimum.   Still pretty dumb, but not what OP said it was."
He literally got Summer League MVP and was putting up almost a triple-double. Kris Dunn and Josh Jackson are some other top pick Summer League to regular NBA flops.
Are the odds for this up in Vegas yet. I could see Malik Monk. Jaren Jackson Jr. Zach Collins. Time Lord. Kris Dunn.
Kris Dunn has a great first game. Anthony Morrow looked like Steph in summer league
Kris Dunn
Kris Dunn is actually serviceable on defense and probably can make a career of it still. You’re probably right though after that though I don’t think Fultz has good odds after tearing his ACL earlier this year.
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
Could be absorbing Kris Dunn for free
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
Maybe I'll actually get to watch Kris Dunn play now

"For [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ozknex/kris_dunn_jump_shot_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to go viral so that I can at least try to help Kris Dunn fix his jump shot, duh...      Oh, you were being serious. Never mind, lol."
Imagine Luke and Kris Dunn. Another Luke- KD!
"This is [the trade](https://i.imgur.com/DTigGSZ.png) that will reportedly land us Delon Wright in exchange for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando and a 2023 SRP"
schroder is way better than kris dunn
"Schroeder to Boston would be such a disaster. Wouldn't you just rather keep Kris Dunn? Actually, you should have just traded Thompson for Delon Wright!  But even if you messed up on all that, wouldn't Elfrid Payton have gone there rather than be 3rd string in Phoenix?  Brad Stevens - bad start!"
"Too high or too low?  We were decimated by Covid last year and ended up as the 7th seed.  Now we lost Kemba and Fournier but still have the Jays.  Those two plus Rob Williams, Smart, Horford, and Kris Dunn doesn’t inspire much confidence but they’re still going to at least make the play in tournament."
Kris Dunn looked like a future MVP
"Which players are you talking about specifically? Because Thibs had D Rose, Butler, Taj, Lavine, Wiggins during his time there and none of those guys had a problem playing for him, still to this day clearly.  The only guys that didn't like to play for him are like KAT and Kris Dunn"
"We...used it tho, hell we use a TDE 3 times in the last year (Fournier trade, Kris Dunn trade, Josh Richardson trade), admittedly not super exciting moves"
"That’s fair but there are different levels in confidence after year 1. That and PWill has gained a lot of confidence for having diverse and two-way abilities. The problem most of that list has is that it does some things really well but cant beat fatal flaws. Coby just isn’t a good or smart playmaker right now, but he’s a scorer still. Lauri would be a better basketball player if he peaked at 6’ 5”. Kris Dunn basically the antithesis of Coby.   PWill showed defense and a good / growing 3 shot. That kind of 3 &amp; D wing can be a solid starter even if a backend starter on most teams. There is a chance he’s most akin to Dunn or OG for another team but I don’t really think he’s displayed flaws the same way that others have and I think there are clear reasons people feel both safe and excited by PWill.  Generally, I’d say the only player of the group that ever had this level of confidence was Lauri."
"To me, if we’re talking fandom and you want the simple reason, it’s that right there.   With a good deal of confidence I can tell you where we’d be right now with GarPax instead of AKME. Boylen or a similar old suit would still be the coach. Thad and Sato are potentially off the roster but were sold maybe at the last deadline for a fringe pick. We don’t have Vooch. LaVine would be expiring and would have been traded in the draft. And there’s a chance we just match whatever offer sheet Lauri has just because there’s no reason not to like LaVine.   We would have one or maybe two rookies from this class because of the LaVine trade, but we’d be entering a season without LaVine, without a top 100 player, with a new 7th drafted player to hopefully save the franchise as we suffer through another year like the first post Butler year with Lauri and Kris Dunn.   And there’s really no doubt that’s where we’d be with GarPax. Playing kick the can.   So compared to that, having a team that Lonzo wanted to join, with Vucevic, that LaVine wants to keep being a part of...   The reason people like DeRozan is because there’s upside. He’s an all-star. If it doesn’t work out, there’s almost no chance it goes the way for instance the Rondo/Wade Bulls went. And so it’s exciting to see what happens, and the ability to manipulate the ridiculously complex cap atmosphere of the NBA gives future confidence that they won’t be restricted from altering the salary book if necessary to bring in a truly necessary player."
Welp nvm I’m at work and caffeine deprived thought it was Kris Dunn that signed lmao not Kendrick Nunn. You right Nunn is good but not as good as Dunn I don’t think.
Same with steals for PG’s sometimes. Kris Dunn use to average like 2SPG w/ us but he was putting himself way out of position to swipe at it.
"I thought Nunn has been a borderline great to elite perimeter defend though? And Monk is an underrated defender per Charlotte fans too.   Pains me to say this as a Suns fan but Monk, Ellington and Melo give them pretty damn good shooters to surround the big 3.  Edit: nvm I need caffeine at work..thought it was Kris Dunn who signed not Kendrick Nunn 😂"
They obviously expect Steph to sign for the minimum and compete with Kris Dunn for minutes.
The whole time I was thinking it was Kris Dunn and only realized my stupidity because there's no way Dunn's making 38% of his 3 pointers lmao
I thought it was Kris Dunn so I was wonder where all the buzz was about  But wtf this is mad
They also aren't very valuble these days. Just look at Kris Dunn.
I don't think Kris Dunn would've helped that much.
This is like the Hawks signing Kris Dunn last year
"We had Kris Dunn, i get it."
"Lauri would probably be pretty good with literally anyone that can pass like Lamelo. Lauri played his best ball with Kris Dunn, who actually involve him in the offense. Lauri definitely needs to take responsibility for some of the things he lacks, but never having a decent playmaker to play alongside has definitely hurt his development."
Yeah I'm wondering if reason Celtics are delaying the TT 3 teamer is to absorb either Satoransky or Thad Young  Could send Kris Dunn back for a CHI reunion for example if they just wanted to cut 5 milly
"I saw a bunch of reports that the Kris Dunn trade wasn't happening anymore. It had to be completed before Midnight EST yesterday because it was the end of the NBA calendar year, and the Enes Kanter trade exception that Boston had would have expired with the NBA year.   Can anybody confirm is this happened or if the trade went through? I saw multiple people discussing this on Twitter last night but never seemed to get confirmation if it happened or not."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
"Yeah we honestly didn’t think we’d get even an unprotected 2nd for TT. We ended up with Kris Dunn, Fernando, and a 2nd. That’s a massive W."
"Speaking from experience with Kris Dunn, That’s a bad signing."
Kris Dunn is one of the worst offensive players I’ve seen
I mean we traded for JRich who I imagine could be a good 6th or 7th man and Kris Dunn who’ll make a defensive impact. Our bench based on those two moves alone will be 5 times better than last year’s.
"Not really, doesn't Thibs like athletic point guards that can get to the paint? D Rose, Jeff Teague, Kris Dunn."
lmfao imagine a tristan thompson for kris dunn trade escalates into a fox for jaylen trade
I’d rather move Thompson and a pick for a better player than fuckin Kris Dunn…  That salary can be used to eat a larger contract for now.
"&gt;How this will change the terms of the deal is unknown. Boston can fit the 2021-22 salaries of both Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando into the Kemba Walker TPE. That would create a $9.7M TPE for Tristan Thompson.  &gt;All three teams have engaged on expanding the deal too. Now, it's TBD!  [follow up](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1422046080510930944)"
"Man we had so many players like that on those teams  February 2019 Lauri, December 2017 Mirotic, pre-faceplant 2018 Kris Dunn and end of 2017-18 season Sean Killdraftpick"
Kris Dunn didn’t even get a chance to play lol
Fwiw he was better with the Hawks than Kris Dunn was. Meaning he's probably playable somewhere for sure.
"The Celtics don't have any cap space, I'm not sure what the OP was referring to. The salary cap is going to be $112 million. Even forgetting all the smaller stuff around the margins, here's what the top of Boston's cap sheet is looking like in broad strokes:  * Tatum - $28 million  * Horford - $27 million  * Brown - $26 million  * Smart - $14 million  * Richardson - $11 million  * Kris Dunn - $5 million  That's $111 million just for those guys, and that's not including the 7 other guys that are already under contract for next year. The Celtics are not clearing any cap space to go after free agents.   To answer the question the guy you replied to asked, about why they're shedding so much salary, I've been saying this for quite some time now and almost always get downvoted for it, but they're trying to stay below the luxury tax. That's all this is.   They're trying to stay below it now, and they're trying to stay below it in the future as well. It's why they didn't want to pay to keep Horford and Hayward when they got bigger offers than Boston wanted to pay, it's why they used their TPE on a guy who's contract expired when Tatum's extension kicked in, and it's why negotiations with that guy (Fournier) aren't going anywhere. It's why they swapped two years and $74 million of Kemba for two years and $41 million of Horford, losing a pick in the process. It's why they dumped TT, and it's why they got Richardson (cause he'll be a worse but cheaper alternative to Fournier).   Something to keep a close eye on this summer, in addition to these talks with Fournier, is the upcoming extension negotiations with Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. I wouldn't be surprised if those don't go well either and Boston ends up hoping they can get them back for cheap next summer. But again, look how well that worked for them with Horford, Hayward, and now Fournier, apparently.  Boston's ownership is notoriously resistant to paying the luxury tax. Boston fans never want to accept that, but it's true. [Boston has paid less in luxury tax in the last 10 years than other super cheap teams like the Bulls, Spurs and Rockets have.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cba/tax/) Boston's owners often say that ""they'll pay the tax for a contender"" but this cost cutting is very much affecting how good their team is, and if they're not careful they're going to fail to build a significant contender around Tatum and Brown before those guys hit free ageand in a few years. They need to be careful."
"Even then, there's still the ""collegiate curse"" question: For some reason, whenever the Celtics have at least one player on the team from Providence College, they always have a notably bad season. The level is there all the time: Marvin Barnes, Ernie D, Eric Murdock, Eric Williams, Rick Pitino, etc.   Adding Kris Dunn to that list...doesn't look like it'll end well."
Yeah man sometimes you just have to take the money. The only players that I remember off top that improved their draft position by coming to school were Buddy &amp; Kris Dunn  &amp; PJ Washington too
"Brad steven is yhe worst of gms new modern gms cant even re sign best player, literally on they squads whcih made it to their ECF of the celtics, literal was waiting right there celtics just making trade ecception and FOR WHAT IF NOT TO RE SIGNING THEIS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY, NOW I ALSO HEAR GET RID OF SEMI AS WELL AND FOR WHAT!! KRIS DUNN!!!!"
"Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jaylen Brown... Whata Chriss and Bender up to?"
Yall traded for Kris dunn and Josh Richardson. Seem like cheap replacements for Marcus smart if he's dealt maybe? I could see yall trading him and then re-signing him next year
We just got Kris Dunn and J-Rich. Add them to Marcus Smart and our offense is solved.
Let's go.  Brought Kris Dunn back to New England.
Yes! Kris Dunn. Idk who else I'd be talking about
"From what I have read, nope just the TPE. Nice move by the Celtics.  Maybe the change of scenery will benefit him and I would say pretty confidently that replacing any minutes of Grant Williams, Edwards, Ojeyele or Waters with Kosh Richardson should make Celtics fans feel good about this move.  Curious what the Fournier situation Play out to be.  The TPE will end up being Kris Dunn, Josh Richardson, Evan Forunier (maybe just a rental?). I think whether or not Forunier re sings goes a long way I’m determining how successful the use of that TPE was"
That may have Kris Dunn but they certainly aren’t done with Khris
They created a 11 million TPE in the Thompson deal earlier by absorbing Kris Dunn into Enes Kanters 5 million TPE
so we just calling Kris Dunn KD now
you sure about that?  Delon Wright was horrific for us this year  but i know little about kris dunn so i'll hold off saying i know for sure.
"Hey don’t look now, we’re getting Kris Dunn too! It’s like we’re assembling the Splash Brothers but for disappointment."
"not a horrible move, we have a logjam of centers so getting a pick and a guy who will be in the g league is fine. getting kris dunn just throws another young guard into our log jam of unproven guards vying for minutes, my guess here is dunn will be traded again soon, since this just reeks of salary dump."
The idea of Kris Dunn isn't though!  They don't need more ISO scoring. They just need him to defend his balls off and distribute which he can handle. He's a very good rebounder for his size too.
"I was super hyped for Kris Dunn. Big long guard with that can defend and run PnRs well. Also, he looked like he could be a decent shooter."
Kris Dunn is actual garbage though
"I think you're being bit hard on our guy. To be fair he put up almost 19/9 in his sophomore year and this year he put up 19/6 on 50/40 efficiency pre all-star break in the few games he played and even under Boylend he managed to improve his defence plus the best playmaker hes played with is Kris Dunn, so i really think that if Lauri played next to Trae Young he would be better offensively then John Collins.  In my humble opinion if Lauri finds himself in good system that fits him and BIG IF he manages to stay healthy the hole season there is a real possibility that he becomes the MIP."
Atlanta: Kris Dunn???? We thought you wanted Ryan Dunn... Fuck.
"Win/win. The Celts get to unload a useless piece of shit, and Kris Dunn gets to come home."
I had no idea kris dunn was a hawk
"Im very confused, Delon is better than Kris dunn."
"Know what, I agree. He probably goes around the Kris Dunn, Buddy Heild spot."
Don't forget Kris Dunn. I was so hyped for him smh.
"I agree, Kyrie &gt; Kris Dunn"
"I really wanted my Bulls to pick him up with the #7 pick as it was a pretty good situation for them even if he flamed out.  At the time, they had just come off the first year of the rebuild around LaVine (who was recovering from ACL surgery), rookie Lauri Markkanen, and Kris Dunn.  Drafting MPJ and redshirting the entire year (instead of Wendell Cart Jr) would have put more of the focus on Lauri in his second year while seeing what LaVine had left in the tank (hint: a lot) after knee surgery and being deliberately bad while developing the core pieces of your major trade for another season together and maybe netting a top 5 draft pick in the process.   But let's say they end up with #7 again anyway and draft Coby White again. Now you're heading in to that season with 2 lottery pick rookies, in Coby White and MPJ, hopefully some definitive answers on Dunn, LaVine, and Markkanen.   This also would have taken the pressure off Hoiberg to succeed, knowingly redshirting a lottery pick for a year, and perhaps spared us of 20 months of Jim Boylen."
I mean is Kris Dunn getting a huge contract right now?
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
IMO Gilbert Arenas is better than Kris Dunn
"&gt; Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse,  Yo he was a #1 pick, he was trash and in the level of all those other dudes you just mentioned. He was a big reason you guys sucked for a long time, theres a lot of draft busts that wander around the league for years because front offices want to take chances on them. Yall had one of the worst front offices that actually gave him contracts after that pick even."
"“I can name 15-20 PGs who are better defensively than Curry.”  Then why’d you have to bring in shooting guards?  Some of the people you named are legitimately terrible defenders.  Schroeder is a Celtic so now you’re gonna pretend he’s not one of the worst PG defenders in basketball?  Kyrie is terrible and you had some tired homer bullshit about him being “good when he’s locked in”.  I should stop responding now that it’s clear you’re a serious, serious Celtic homer.  But here are some more who aren’t better than Steph on defense, and I’m just kinda surprised at how random your list seemed to recruit bad defenders from strange places, even the bench.  Fox (dude…), Neto, Dinwiddie (seriously, what lol?), Jevon Carter (you don’t get to say a man who comes in for 12 mins a game and guards backups is an elite defender).  Then you have combo guards like Jrue, Caruso, Kris Dunn etc.  only Jrue can really be considered a point here.  Then you have people like Josh Hart, KCP and Marcus Smart who are absolutely not point guards.  You clearly exaggerated and your weird defensive appraisals here are all over the map and often wrong.  You couldn’t name 15-20 PGs who were better even when you got rookies and shooting guards."
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
"One of the worst high picks of the last 20 years? I’m not even a fan of bargs but holy overstatement   Assuming we consider the top 5 a high pick, darko, Morrison, josh Jackson, Anthony Bennett dragon bender, kris dunn, jahlil okafor Mari hezonja etc were all far worse, bargs was a solid player for quite a few years, just not ever first overall pick good"
Have I not been paying enough attention? Kris Dunn is the only name here that sounds remotely familiar.
"No chance he cracks rotation and we've got more guys than spots.  I'm just curious out of Kris Dunn and Jarrett Culver, do either or both of them stick around and figure things out with us."
"From what Hawks fans tell me, Kris Dunn doesn't even exist"
"What does trading for Carsen Edwards, Kris Dunn, and a second-round pick swap 5 years down the road mean to you? Because, to me, that’s not asset accumulation. Best I can think of is that it’s getting off of Juancho’s money for the season after this upcoming one, but if that’s the case, Boston is kinda getting the short end of the stick here. Maybe he plays for them though, I dunno"
Kris Dunn. Another fantastic Twolves draft on the move
kris dunn for juancho. one wolves legend for another
am I crazy I thought Kris Dunn was on the Lakers
Kris Dunn was playing 1-3 positions last year before getting injured. I hope he carves out a spot. Reminds me of the Tony Allen/Marcus Smarts potentially
Kris Dunn! Hopefully he resurrects his career. He was awesome at college.
Me but with Kris Dunn
I spit my water.. Kris Dunn I’m dead 💀
"To each their own, but personally I don't like Kris Dunn that much."
"My love of basketball started when my brother bought me NBA 2k7 for my birthday 14 years ago.   My favourite player was KG so I naturally became a Wolves fan.   Since that day, aside from glimmer of hopes (the hype around Rubio, KG coming back, 2018 playoffs, DRose 50 point game) times have been dark.   -KG got traded to the Celtics  -Al Jefferson looked like a stud only for the Wolves to bring in KLove  -Johnny Flynn say no more  -Wes Johnson, Derrick Williams, Jarrett Culver, Kris Dunn  -Flip Saunders passing away when things looked to be getting on track  -The Wiggins max deal   -So many coaches including the Thibs experience    The saving grace is that Towns is a monster. But I am concerned it will be an AD situation eventually."
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
1. Kris Dunn (im just assuming if it’s all defense then it’s no offense with some ballhandling) 2. kawhi? 3. Booker 4. Maybe Demar due to lack of 3s 5. Jokic? 6. Lavine bc he adjusted his game and became more perimeter oriented
Kris Dunn Kawhi  Booker Terrance Ross AD Giannis
"My issue with picking someone because they’re “nba ready” is that even those guys can still have the injury bug like Kris Dunn, so even those guys aren’t “nba ready”. Also a lot of times high lottery picks bust because of injuries just as much as other factors present in a “project”"
Kris Dunn was going to be the next big thing
"I thought both Kris Dunn and Jarrett Culver were the guys that would fix our defense, and both are barely in the NBA anymore."
"**Lauri Markkanen.**  We get an interesting forward who can shoot, but has his deficiencies (rebounding/defense).   We give him a new coach each year including the flame out of Jim Boylen and run such starting PGs in his time here as Kris Dunn or fucking *Walt Lemon Jr*.   We really never did anything to help him succeed. We first made him bulk up and try to play center, which hurt his mobility and fixed nothing. Hes a player if drafted to like the Spurs would be so much further developed"
Giving me Kris Dunn flashbacks
Which might work if Simmons were James Harden. He's not. He's a mediocre ball handler who can't shoot. This is like Kris Dunn trying to force his way out. Who would want this chump?
"Otto Porter Jr., Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr., Kris Dunn. You see a pattern there?"
"Kris Dunn, dude has been in the league for awhile and I don’t think I’ve ever seen him play a game"
"BULLSHIT. Hindsight is everything. If you believe that shit I got a fucking bridge in Brooklyn you can buy from me.    Look at the guys he drafted: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Keita Bates Diop, Josh Patton, the dude when given full control doesnt know shit."
Delon is like 3 tiers better than Bruno and Kris Dunn because he is a very average rotation level player who doesn’t have multiple massive holes in his game. Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando don’t get rotation minutes on like 27 out of 30 teams
"Jarrett Culver also has 1 year of TO on his contract, meaning he can be used in trades next offseason or declined to free up space. Kris Dunn is a UFA after this year no matter what."
"He drafted Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray, he fucking sucked dude."
They are Dunn with Kris
Kris Dunn could be a sneaky pickup for someone
Honestly thought Kris Dunn was gonna be the one who would be cut but I’m glad they kept him.
"You still would've had the Butler drama with KAT.  Thibs also drafted Justin Patton and Kris Dunn vs. one ""hit"" in Josh Okogie.  He also handed Wiggins and Dieng albatross contracts."
Kris Dunn and Tyus Jones for Kyrie
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
He would have gotten Kris Dunn's minutes and I'll take that to the grave with me.   Kris Dunn looked unplayable when we had him on the floor.
Honestly I’ve seen enough of culver in the preseason. Dude kinda looks lost out there and there’s literally 6 guys that can play 2-3 I’d rather have play. Keep the roster spot for Kris Dunn in case of a morant/Jones injury
"Forgive me oh wise pelicans fan.   Dude I’ve watched Jerian Grant, Cameron Payne, Kris Dunn and Tomas Satoranski point guard my team for the last 5 years. No matter how badly you guys want to piss in my Cheerios it’s not going to ruin the excitement to see a competent point guard lead this team.   Lonzo is 23, is fun as hell to watch, and has been improving rapidly as a player. I’m thrilled to have him aboard and have faith he will continuing to develop."
"Honestly, he was the most fun player to watch during that preseason game aside from LaVine. The hustle he puts into the game on both ends is fucking amazing. Defensively he's like Kris Dunn or Marcus Smart in that it's so engaging to watch the way he plays on that end of the floor.  I really feel like AKME did an exceptional job in managing to pick up a quality starting point guard AND a quality sixth man."
"&gt;Which rookie will be the best player in five years?   &gt;   &gt;Ben Simmons, Philadelphia – 70.0%    Kris Dunn, Minnesota – 20.0%   Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers – 6.7%   Joel Embiid, Philadelphia – 3.3%  Aged like milk"
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
"I thought Kris Dunn was gonna have a way better career than he has so far.  I was really hoping he'd develop into almost a Jason Williams level passer, but it's not like career has been terrible."
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
"In the Delon Wright trade to ATL.   Originally, ATL traded Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn to the Celtics. ATL received Tristian Thompson. It became a three team trade which resulted in TT getting moved for Delon Wright."
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"Dude, just draft the best center in the league at pick 41, make sure other teams ahead of you draft guys like Dragan Bender or Kris Dunn, and have multiple teams miss on MPJ.  Easy peasy"
"I was very, very high on Dante Exum, thought he'd end up being the best player in that draft. Also really liked Kris Dunn. Likened him to Gary Payton on more than one occasion."
Christian leattner. Spelled wrong. Penny. Big dog Robinson. Grant hill. If I’m being honest kris Dunn.
"Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Marquese Chriss, Goga Bitadze."
"Kris Dunn = Keith Murray  Bradley Beal = younger, thinner Charles S. Dutton"
He legitimately has that level of defensive talent.  His problem is he's kind of like Kris Dunn - he kills you on offense so hard sometimes that you just can't play him.
"Kris Dunn, goat Point Guard in sims."
"Thibs handling of the PG position was weird. Rubio, Butler, Taj Gibson - that's the start of a really nice defensive core.     For the coup de gras he drafts Kris Dunn and Josh Okogie - two of the very few perimeter guys in the league with less offensive punch than Rubio."
"&gt;They maxed wiggins, who was playing like shit, over Butler, who brought them to the playoffs.  Don't spout shit when you think you know shit and are just blatantly wrong.   [They traded for Jimmy in June of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2646262-jimmy-butler-traded-to-timberwolves-for-zach-lavine-kris-dunn-no-7-pick.amp.html)  [They agreed to max Wiggins in October of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2722896-andrew-wiggins-timberwolves-agree-to-5-year-148-million-contract-extension.amp.html)  [They offered Butler the max the next summer of 2018. They knew he was gonna turn it down cuz he could make more from us the following summer if he re-signed.] (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jimmy-butler-rejects-wolves-four-year-110-million-extension-offer-owner-says/amp/)  So. Look at the timeline. Wolves maxed Wiggins Oct. 11, 2017 and the season started October 17. Jimmy hadn't even played a SINGLE minute in a Wolves uniform when they maxed Wiggins, guy.  Get your facts straight."
"&gt;Dawg all the Black players in the NBA up until the late 2000s  What? Literally all of them? And you do know that Lebron falls under this massive umbrella, right?  Anyway you've named 1 active player who had it worse than Lebron growing up. Kris Dunn. I already mentioned Giannis. Guys like that these days are a minority, like I said. Feel free to disprove me any time."
"Lmaoooo man what? Dawg all the Black players in the NBA up until the late 2000s came from the projects and deeply disenfranchised areas. Hell even recently Kris Dunn had to shoot dice and play pick up basketball games for money just to get food for him and his brother. Was sleeping from couch to couch as early as age 7 all the way into his early teens. The thing is like I’ve stated many times on this sub, American fans consider Black American players like Kris Dunn, LeBron, Melo, Isiah Thomas etc. coming from disenfranchised areas as people who grew up like that because of terrible choices due to anti Black American racism, but on the flip side they’ll have a light heart for someone like Giannis because his oppression isn’t 5 miles away from him and they can feel sorry from a distance because they didn’t do that to them. It’s the same reason why Americans will support the Non American Non Black boxer over the Black American boxer."
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
They actually got a good defensive player back in that trade but waived him (Kris Dunn)
"Honestly, being good enough to be considered an All Star snub is a decent outcome for a 5th overall pick. There was a five-year span when the fifth picks were Thomas Robinson, Alex Len, Dante Exum, Mario Hezonja, and Kris Dunn.   I agree about Wagner though. He’s gonna go really high in re-drafts of a draft that will produce a ton of really good players."
Yessir. Kris Dunn and Bruno were also players who barely played for us so to turn those two players plus TT into a key rotational player was a steal for us.
"he was traded there for kris dunn and bruno fernando, atlanta flipped him for delon wright"
"We always find something to be positive about. Young players, the draft, that one player who shot well despite the loss.   The rosters that we got ourselves excited about makes me sad in hindsight.   Lauri is Dirk. Kris Dunn vs. Zach Lavine was a real discussion. I thought Wayne Selden Jr. and Jabari Parker could be real contributors.   We're a hopeful bunch."
Ha ha but remember how fucking cool Kris Dunn is 🤣
"Same Kris Dunn who they picked in the draft ahead of Buddy, Murray or Thon Maker just a year prior to that.   Top notch FO."
"The Bulls wanted to do Butler for Wiggins straight up but the T-Wolves said no so the Bulls eventually settled for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn, and a pick swap (7 for 16)"
Kris Dunn in NBA 2K type beat.
"Joe's Harris shot 47.4% from 3 that year. Closest player to that KAT has ever had is Beasley, who he's hardly played with yet.   Dinwiddie averaged 16 ppg on above average efficiency. Backup or not, still a legit NBA player. Not some scrub.   Allen and Davis both very strong rebounders and good presence at the rim on defense, as well as great lob threats. Davis had a 25% rebound %, which is nuts. Embiids highest for a season was 22%.   Levert, don't really need to jump into that. Good scorer.   My point here, being, Russell had good players to play with all at once that year. Towns, hasn't had that except that one year, and surprise! He made the playoffs.   Towns has maybe played with guys as good as the ones I've listed, but never at the same time. A lot of his career he's had to play with guys like Treveon Graham, Culver, Wiggins, Teague, Shabazz Mohammed, Kris Dunn, Jerryd Bayless, Anthony Tolliver, Juancho Hernangomez, and a bunch of other rookies, sophomores, or dudes who aren't in the league anymore."
"Timberwolves 1st round draft picks since KAT: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, Jarrett Culver (traded up), Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels.   We also traded 1sts for Adreian Payne and DLo.   It's pretty obvious why this team is successful and it has nothing to do with KAT."
"KAT 100% could be/could have been the guy.  Here's what we've done with every 1st round pick we've had since KAT.   Kris Dunn, traded away for Adreian Payne, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, traded up for Jarrett Culver, Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels, and traded away with Wiggins for DLo.   I could accept trading KAT away at this point as a ""we blew it"" move since we failed to put a team around him and it may be too late now.  But it wouldn't be a ""KAT's not that guy"" trade, imo."
I am starting to think drafting:  &amp;#x200B;  * OJ Mayo over Westbrook   * Rubio over Curry * Wesley Johnson over Paul George * Derek Williams over Kawhi * Shabazz Muhammad over Giannis * Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray * Jarret Culver over Tyler Herro      was a mistake...
"I mean what else are they gonna do?   They've sucked, got lucky in the draft by getting the 1st pick, and still can't put together a top 10 seeded team:  \#1 Ant Edwards, #6 Jarret Culver, #12 Dario Saric, #5 Kris Dunn, #13 Zach LaVine, KAT #1, traded for Wiggins #1, Rubio #5, Wesley Johnson #4, Derrick Williams #2, Kevin Love #5   Out of all their lottery picks ones that have ""hit"" are Ant Edwards (likely), Lavine who they traded for Jimmy, KAT, and Love who they traded. Wiggins and Saric are also decent NBA players but they traded those guys too."
only person that ever stopped trae was kris dunn. Simmons did ok
"The second half showed that if Vuc can get back on a consistent offensive rhythm, the sheer number of reliable scoring options will threaten any team. Spreading their defense and then having outside, midrange, and driving options is powerful.   Vuc really seems like the key to this team right now, if he can put it together, we’ll be unstoppable, but I also don’t see him rising to the defensive level needed to stop Embiid or Giannis. Finding a defensive big will be our next important roster move.   I was a serious Lonzo doubter, but he is everything we’ve ever needed in a PG for the last 5 years. Since the Kris Dunn days we have had a lot of trouble finding a playmaking PG and now we have a great two-way one, along with a roster that can take his feeds and convert."
"My man, Eric Bledsoe is not some amazing point guard. He's a great defender and is good at attacking the basket, but is a below average playmaker for his position which is what you seem most concerned with.  Also, Lavine has had a combination of Cam Payne, Kris Dunn, Coby White, and Ryan Arcidiacano as the PG during his time in Chicago. None of those guys are great (or even good) ""floor general"" point guards either.  Having those below average PGs did not hurt Lavine and Booker's early development. TBH, it doesn't seem like you know what you're talking about....  And Chicago and Phoenix resolved their PG situation later down the line after their first developmental options didn't work out. That's great. We can do the exact same thing if KPJ doesn't work out. Trying out the other options first though DID NOT hurt Booker and Lavine's development. Just like trying to develop KPJ will not hurt Green's development.  Bottom line is that it's too early to give up on a promising young player in KPJ. He is not going to hurt Green's development."
Dame was a 5th pick that year. Even if they had the exact same record and had the same 5th pick it doesn’t guarantee a superstar. The next 4 draftees at #5 are Alex Len 2013. Dante Exum 2014. Mario Henzonja 2015. Kris Dunn 2016. Plenty of other too picks are misses as well.   That’s assuming they never improve and are able to pick 5th every year. It’s more than losing games and getting high picks. Just gotta hit when you do. And pick up quality free agents.   Obviously they could’ve picked different players but the point stands that having high picks isn’t the problem as much as hitting the picks like they did with McCollum. Tanking doesn’t guarantee you anything.   I’d rather win 50 games and try to trade or get free agents to join me. That’s Portlands biggest issue. Warriors were a 50 win team then they picked up Iggy. Lakers MO is free agency. Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday. Raptors traded for Kawhi. Portland sucks at getting Dame help through other means.
Kris Dunn is actually fucking solid for a third string
maybe Kris Dunn is an option
Bulls Kris Dunn jersey
"For real a lot of these were easy. Tim Hardaway Tunior, Kris Dunn and Chandler Parsons are all pretty well known."
Lamelo isn’t trying to fit into his role. Lamelo plays and acts like he always has as the best player on the court. Lonzo tries to fit into his role and he acts like he’s Kris Dunn.
I don't think I've seen a softer ejection than the one where Trae got ejected for looking at Kris Dunn lol
"I’m sorry but losing a head coach like that weeks before a season starts is incredibly unique and it’s silly to assume we’d be “exactly” the same had he not passed.   You think he’d tear apart the roster he built to chase a bunch of former bulls? Miss manage the personalities? Take a Kris Dunn, a 3rd center in Justin Patton?  You cannot assume that and doing so is lazy."
"Oladipo is one of the best in the NBA at that, if not the best.   Kris Dunn when he is healthy."
"&gt; #22. Connecticut &gt;Starting 5: Kris Dunn, Donovan Mitchell   Mitchell is from New York, or at least grew up here."
"Yeah it was an issue but with Kris Dunn on the floor i think it wouldnt be as big of an issue.  In the 4th maybe but Hawks I bet would run with a Trae, Dunn, Reddish, Hunter, JC lineup that would be more than decent.  We lost in large part because Capela was gassed and couldnt keep up with Jeff Green offensively.  Think this lineup solves for that and makes trae less of an issue."
Kris Dunn is on the Hawks so bad luck for him
Beal and Trae...  Kris Dunn would score 50
Yes Kris Dunn &gt; Trae Young.  You could say they are equal but imo offense is always more important.
Kris Dunn
Trae Young and Kris Dunn
Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn?
"So isn’t Donovan Mitchell from Connecticut?? If so, he’s gotta be better than Kris Dunn."
Uhhhh Donovan Mitchell was born in Connecticut and you have Kris Dunn listed as the best active player from there.
Giannis is to Zion what Kris Dunn is to sophomore and rookie Trae on defense.
Kris Dunn would like a word
I still am really confused as to what Murray is supposed to be. Is he good enough to run an offense or is he just like a much better kris Dunn? Cause I remember people loved him before last season and he disappointed. I haven’t had a chance to watch the Spurs this season so I don’t know if anything is different or if he’s just shouldering a larger offensive workload
"I think you need to swap Kris Dunn in there for Giannis. He might literally be the best, actually"
"Thibs was hired 2 whole months before the draft.  This is his pick right there, Kris Dunn, holding up the jersey .  Youre tell me Tom Thibodeau, President of Bball Operations, had 2 months to prepare but deferred to some scouts? Okay"
Literally just drafting Jamal Murray instead of Kris Dunn (like everyone wanted him to) and not trading for Butler would have us in a much better position to win today .  I could go on and on but it really wouldn't take much to drastically change our outlook
Thybulle blows and I’ve been saying it since the offseason. Please ship him out at the deadline before the league realizes he’s Kris Dunn with worse offense
"Also Bogdanivic, Capela, Kris Dunn.    My point was that it was not the Hawks ownership/management saying ""WIN NOW!!!!"" like the comment I replied to said.  It was Trae Young himself who demanded that.  It's a pivot in that they aren't using their cap space to take on bad contracts in trades in exchange for draft picks.  They also won't have a very good pick themselves."
"I disagree.  Take some time to look through who the wolves have drafted with their first rd picks , and let me know which ones went on to improve significantly after being let go.  Zach Lavine is the best example, although he was great for the Wolves during 2016 before he tore his ACL (better than Wiggins imo) and was then traded for Jimmy butler.  Kris Dunn developed as a defender, but we traded him after his rookie season, some improvement would be expected obviously.  Rubio improved his 3pt shooting, but ultimately had a similar impact on the court in Utah and Phx compared with his time in Minnesota   I see this argument youre making very often, but I dont see the evidence in favor of it.  Our draft history is littered with guys who we selected, then traded after 2 or 3 years, and they didn't do anything on any other team.  To me, that is a sign youre choosing the wrong guys"
"He’s still an athletic freak and a 6’10 PG with great passing, court vision, ball handling, defense, and rebounding. The other guys at the top of his draft class were Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Dragan Bender, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Kris Dunn, etc.     Even now how many of those guys would you take over Simmons? And keep in mind Simmons went straight to averaging 16-8-8 in his rookie year."
Lmao do people really still think defense has the same value as offense in the NBA? In a world where Kris Dunn got a minimum contract?
People forgot him because he’s injured but kris Dunn.
"The Hawks have the sixth best defensive rating right now according to [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors), and our best defensive player in Kris Dunn as well as Okongwu haven’t even played yet. Even still, we’re certainly not even going to be a top half defensive team this year. It’s way too early to make declarations like these."
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
Why are the Hawks sending Kris Dunn to Houston?
We don’t even have kris Dunn anymore and harden is worth way more than lavine
"I think the starter numbers are a bit misleading. Top picks generally go to bad teams, which means being a starter isn't as meaningful. Also those teams have an incentive to start their top picks for development and fan engagement.   If you keep going the pattern seems a bit shakier:  2015, 3 out of five starting, 3 all stars  2014, 3 out of five starting, 1 all star  2013, 3 out of five starting, 1 all star, 2 out of league  2012, 2 out of five starting, 2 all star, 1 out of league  2011, 2 out of five starting, 1 all star, 1 out of league  A lot of those starters are pretty borderline ones, as well. Guys like Cody Zeller and Kris Dunn. So I'm not sure if the return on investment is as high as you'd think.  It's possible we're getting better at identifying players over time, but I generally think picks in the 4-10 range are a bit overvalued.  Wolves will still find a way to lose the trade, though."
"Gallonari, reddish/bogdan(whoever doesn’t start), rondo, kris Dunn, Kevin huerter, onyeka okongwu...  This is deeper than most teams(sadly 5 of these guys are injured right now), and Gallo is maybe the best player coming off the bench in the league. Not including tony snell or Solomon hill who both got solid minutes last year. Near last huh"
"The team looks more than competitive enough and so far I'm liking it. Hiring Billy Donovan as a coach and AK as president has changed a lot of things. All these guys seem to be putting a lot of effort in the games and our perimeter defense seems to be making up for the loss of Kris ""Lieutenant"" Dunn. PatWill is looking even better than expected for a prospect labeled a ""project"" with pretty Tenacious Defense (pun totally intended) and a good feel for the game. Lavine has gotten a lot better as a defender too."
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
"Granted some of these guys are still respectable NBA players, but I thought they all had All-Star/All-Defense upside at the very least:  Jabari Parker  Nik Stauskas  Nerlens Noel  Kris Dunn  Frank Ntilikina  Terrence Ross  Evan Turner  Perry Jones III"
I watched a lot of kris Dunn at Providence and thought he’d be a smarter Westbrook.   I was also 100% convinced Perry Jones was going to be a fantastic player for years to come and was ecstatic when the thunder nabbed him in the late first round.
Jamal murray and buddy Hield would have way better trade value than kris Dunn. Changes the dynamics of the Jimmy trade.
"So if Jamal Murray gets drafted, he's then traded instead of Kris Dunn  I don't see how that's ""even worse"", whoever got picked in 2016 was gonna get traded"
You’re right it’s even worse. You guys drafted kris Dunn when buddy and Jamal Murray were drafted right after him.
"Rudy Gobert got over 200 millions because of his defence. No offence, but I don't think its his screen assists that got him that contract. And Btw bertans is much much better and more valuable than Kris Dunn."
"Look at how specialists are paid. An all-defense caliber player like Kris Dunn got 2/10 this past year. Meanwhile a guy like Bertans who is solely a shooter, which is just one aspect of offense, got 5/80 in the same offseason. They’re simply not valued anywhere near equally across the league."
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Exactly, everyone knows the REAL kd is Kris Dunn."
And kris Dunn and Kevin Durant have the same initials but only one of them is called KD
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
"Kris Dunn? c'mon man! no way he is in the conversation. i see him as being 2 years away, though."
"Not true and you may want to look into the methodology behind DBPM. It isolates the players impact and tries to withdraw the teams impact, hence why Kris Dunn had great DBPM while being on a shit team. It’s fine if you say his defence doesn’t matter but don’t spew misinformation about the statistic itself."
"Nah man. Players on bad teams have bad DBPM. There are exceptions, Kris Dunn was one for the bulls last year, but his entire role was playing defense. He had no offensive responsibilities.      Zach's DBPM is fine for the team he's on. In fact, he's look great on defense this year. He's never going to be an elite defender, but for a guy whose main job is to carry the load offensively each night, he's been fine."
"Perimeter - jrue, marcus smart, ben simmons, og, kris dunn  Help - giannis, Gobert, Johnathan isaac"
"Point taken, but Hawks have Rondo, Kris Dunn, and Snell out due to injury and Bogey missed the 4th quarter with an ankle issue. Hawks played Brandon Goodwin 8 minutes and kept Trae under 40. Thibs wins these games by running his horses into the ground."
Yeah the pick got ripped by smarter people at the time it's just been 5 years can be hard to remember. [The consensus take was Jamal Murray&gt;Buddy Hield](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2016/6/23/12016970/nba-draft-2016-mock-draft-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-kris-dunn-jamal-murray-dragan-bender). Multiple [sources had ths same conclusion](https://www.tothemean.com/tools/draft-models/#/2016/dv2/all).   It's kind of a microcosm of how NOP was run in the AD era always looking for the short term fix. They didnt want to wait and try to develop a player like Murray. Especially after 2016 which was frankly a disaster year for them they were looking to try to turn things around ASAP wherever they could find a quick fix. Hield was a known quantity they wanted to just get a guy whom they thought could help day 1. The irony was Hield wasnt actually good in NOP as a rookie. The DeMarcus Cousins market was alot worse than alot of people anticipated especially on here. Frankly if Hield had actually looked like some high quality prospect as a rookie Im not even sure NOP wouldve been willing to include him.
Is Gary Harris slowly turning into Kris Dunn or something?
I had this rant when Bulls we’re going around am calling Kris Dunn KD. Had to figure out that it wasn’t Durant. Dunn is a fringe NBA player now and doesn’t deserve an initial name
"I recognize Kris Dunn, Andre Drummond and Pau Gasol, but why did you list Lydon B Johnson??   A. He's not a basketball player.   B. He's deceased."
The worst was when Bulls fans tried to make KD a thing for Kris Dunn
"Yeah man, everybody knows KD is Kris Dunn, AD is Andre Drummond, PG is Pau Gasol, and LBJ is LeBarcus Jousins."
"Its almost a completely different team.  Are you serious?  For starters, we traded for Capela last year but he didn't play until this season.  We also added Bogdanovic (averaged 15 PPG last season) and Gallinari (averaged 18 PPG last season).  Hunter and Reddish aren't rookies anymore and have improved.  We actually have a bench this year.  So, yes, its basically the same team other than adding Rondo, Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Capela, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn.  Thats only 6 players on a 15 player roster.  So no different at all.  Exactly the same."
Sounds like Kris Dunn lmao
Gary is legit turning into Kris Dunn
Elfrid Payton  Kris Dunn but idk if you wanna call him a PG anymore
It also autocorrected kris dunn to kris dumb but I actually noticed that one
"Think it’s a combination of new coaching staff with little time to practice/prepare, partially turning Kris Dunn minutes (elite perimeter defender) into Coby White minutes (Trae Young level defender), and COVID season silliness. I think we’re going to see a lot of weird shit this season in general.  The Lauri at center experiment has also been pretty brutal defensively."
"We’re haven’t even healthy yet. Kris Dunn would be used in clutch defensive situations, Gallo would be playing an expanded version of Solomon Hill’s role and Okongwu would be getting spot minutes too if all were healthy"
"Trae, Collins, Bogdonavic, Gallinari, Capella, Reddish, Hunter, and Huerter (if Kennard starts for the Clippers, Huerter is a starting caliber player in my mind). Then add onto that Rondo, Okongwu, Kris Dunn, Solomon Hill, and Tony Snell. We mad deep"
"Our defence was basically asking Kris Dunn to lock everyone up while our offence was  Zach playing hero ball under boylen. Billy Donovan is implementing a drop coverage system and the guys are not used to it yet. Imo I think that's the reason for us allowing so many 3pt shots in this season. It didn't help tonight that the bucks were shooting lights out.   Let's come back to this discussion midway through the season when everyone finds their feet. Improvements I could see through the first few games was Zach is playing some good D, help defence has been good and the rim protection is somewhat decent after the pacers game."
"Rondo has missed more games than he’s played, tiny snell is still out, kris dunn is still out. Hawks bench was at half power tonight, if that."
Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray keeps me up at night
Kris Dunn
"This seems like the rare mutually beneficial trade. Celtics clear the center logjam, take TT off their books, and get a second and Kris Dunn which could potentially give them some PG depth. Atlanta gets a somewhat decent backup center while Okongwu is out and a large boost to the local strip club economy. Win win"
"A healthy Kris Dunn is the perfect backup pg. Solid defense, elite stealing, tall and athletic, can score a bit."
Kris Dunn has basically not played for a couple years and was pretty shit the few times he was on the court. You just traded a washed player in a position we need filled for a washed player in a position you need filled. It's not a bug win either way
Kris Dunn doesn't exist. It's time to move on
Didn’t Kris Dunn only play like 5 games for atlanta before getting hurt?
Well have I got news for you regarding Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn lmao
Those two will clap up any backcourt in the NBA if Kris Dunn is going to be able to earn NBA minutes again. Back when we had Kris I wanted Marcus in Chicago for that exact reason lol  Genuinely hard to imagine a better current defensive backcourt than that
Kris Dunn might be broken &amp; Bruno’s awful so take that as is
"I don't understand, why is Boston trading for a money laundering scheme in a Kris Dunn Jersey?"
“why does atlanta do this?”  guys Okongwu is out til like February lol. We have no center depth. Kris Dunn is bad Bruno Fernando is very bad  “TT is small can he really be ur center” idk Okongwu is like 6’9 bro!
Am I crazy or wouldn't you rather have Kris Dunn
"The Celtics are trading Tristan Thompson to Atlanta for Kris Dunn, and a 2023 second-round pick, sources tell ESPN."
People are going to meme about how Boston just solved their PG issues  Real ones know that Kris Dunn and Marcus Smart on the floor at the same time is going to absolutely eat backcourts alive on the defensive end. It's going to be fucking chaos when those two are together. Seriously. Hide your fucking guards. They won't be safe.  Really happy for my guy KD.
Positive value for Tristan Thompson is weird.  But if Kris Dunn ends up starting at PG lmao
They probably see Kris Dunn signing as a failure and Tristan can be an OK backup center. Plus a 2nd as sweetener
So the Celtics finally got Kris Dunn
Kris Dunn obviously
If hes anything like kris dunn you wont need 6 years or hell even 2 years
"Same reason I’m here, but for opposite reasons. Mitchell will be a slightly better version of Kris Dunn, book it."
Thibs sad he couldnt get Kris Dunn 2.0
I figured he was talking about Kris Dunn
Yea I thought Celtics were drafting kris dunn and took brown who was supposed to go around 7. But this hurts
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
"he's anchoring. He's got plenty of time to sell Simmons, and once he does it he's gone. I remember Bulls did the same thing back in the day when they started shopping Jimmy Butler-- Celtics wanted him and the asking price was every single young player of any value and every single draft pick they had saved up going back to the Nets trade.  They made that offer in order to get it out in press. That way, they save face with Simmons making it look like they think he's really good, they let the team they ultimately deal with think that they got a bargain, and they also get to tell whoever they ultimately acquire that they obviously think he is the greatest thing in the universe because look what their price was.  Bulls ultimately settled on what, LaVine, Kris Dunn (previous year's #5 pick), and Markannen (that year's #7). The modern equivalent would be if Philly goes back to Cleveland and gets something like Sexton, Okoro, and Golden State's #7 by way of trade"
"whenever I see a opt in for X millions, i'm like DUH  Kris Dunn got 5.7 last week...DUH opt in"
"&gt; I genuinely believe that trade established the precedent for teams wanting a ton of first round picks for star players.  And it will likely be the best case of a ''star for all the picks'' move in a long time, it was a perfect time bomb planted on a desperate franchise at the time that seemed to make all the wrong moves and the fact that Danny got the 1st or 2nd best player of the 2016 draft and the best one of the 2017 draft makes it look even worst, if the Cs take Kris Dunn and Fultz this trades turns into a lose-lose very quick"
I don't really know. Depends how much salary they might unload. They might think about taking a flyer on Kris Dunn if ATL would accept a 2nd or something like that. He would help shore up the perimeter defense post Simmons. I'm sure there are better guys but I'm not sure who's going to be available through trade. Melton maybe?
"Davion is like a Kris Dunn, Donovan is like a Dwyane Wade"
If you had Trae I don’t think you would do it. But if you had Kris Dunn I think you do it lol.
Kris Dunn: hey look free money
Except Kris Dunn can hit a free throw and costs about $30MM less.
"Still have to hope for more offensive development because defensive stoppers that make you play 4v5 on offense don't have a ton of value in today's league (looking at you, Josh Okogie and Kris Dunn).  There's hope though, almost 10 points on 42% shooting as a rookie isn't anything to scoff at. Just needs some work on his 3-ball."
"You wanna talk about wasting draft picks? The Timberwolves (along with the Kings) are the true experts in this field that all the other teams bow down to  Selected Brandon Roy in 2006, good job. Immediately trades him to Portland for Randy Foye because reasons.  Drafts a Florida Gator in 2007, sound logic as Florida were back-to-back NCAA champions. But y'all took Corey Brewer and not future DPOY Joakim Noah  The Timberwolves drafts 3 point guards in 2009, none of them were named Steph Curry or even Jrue Holiday  They took forward Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins in 2010, if they didn't want a big man Gordon Hayward &amp; Paul George were also still available.  Another forward in Derrick Williams in 2011 despite drafting Johnson the previous year.   Acquires Shabazz Muhammad in 2013, a shooting guard that can't shoot or guard anyone. Out of the league in 4 years  Drafts 4-year college player Kris Dunn in 2016, he shits the bed in his rookie season despite being touted as ""NBA-ready"" and ended up being packaged in the Jimmy Butler deal (not that I'm complaining, he was decent for the Bulls)  Drafts Justin Patton in 2017 (John Collins was still on the board), dude gets injured in Summer League and has played a grand total of 296 minutes of NBA basketball since. Last seen on the Rockets"
Kris Dunn when he's healthy is a master at that.
Kris Dunn
"Dudes a 4 year NBA vet and he has a career 37% fg%. Dude also got dropped from the rotation of a mediocre Knicks team. And he has 0 offensive skills. If you're going into your 5th NBA season and you're hands down one of the worst offensive players in the league, you're a bust. Dude makes Kris Dunn look like Steph curry."
Hawks could trade Kris Dunn (once he accepts his player option) +what? a 2nd? 2 2nds? for Bamba?  Then Bamba plays bench big man minutes while Okongwu is healing.
I’d rather bring back Kris Dunn than overpay Schröder.
I remember when the Jimmy to Minnesota buzz first started up during the 2016 draft I was kinda disappointed that the trade fell through because I was so high on Kris Dunn
"I know they aren’t “busts” in the typical sense, but I definitely thought Trey Burke and Kris Dunn would be solid starters and more coming out of college."
Ah you mean like Kris Dunn-level lmao
Let’s compare waiters rookie year stats to hardens. Wow why isn’t waiters better than harden ? Damn kris dunn had a better sophomore year than jimmy butler did? Must mean he’s a future nba player. See how that sounds
I remember when Kris Dunn was gonna be our closer
Kris effin Dunn is in.
You are obviously unaware of the mythical Kris Dunn
You're forgetting the draft where Dragan bender went 4 and Kris Dunn went 5
Ben Simmons vs Kris Dunn
How kris Dunn doesn’t get the start is beyond me smh
"We need his defense man. Holiday dropped the easiest 30 Point game I’ve seen in a minute, all his shots were wide open. It’d probably be Hunter on him but Kris Dunn is such a negative on offense we can’t play him, Reddish is super inefficient but he’ll give you something someway or somehow."
"It's hard to guard Trae I've only seen 3 players do it: Kris Dunn (he's got his ass glued to our bench) Ben Simmons, and for whatever reason TJ McConnel cause he can predict every pass Trae has ever made"
Why not play Kris Dunn too while you’re at it Nate
Trae Young and Kris Dunn taken with the same pick really shows how different two drafts can be for depth of talent. Wow
"No, they have some. I remember Kris Dunn fell once and had to enter concussion protocols"
"No. I view Schlenk as one the best GMs because he had a plan, stuck with it, and made it work out. You are viewing every single thing in isolation without understanding or accepting the context. If you aren’t willing to accept that *just maybe* that the Parker signing made sense for the team at the time or how Lloyd Pierce might have been the right coach at the time or how Okongwu, who has played his ass off this postseason, might have been the right pick at the time, then I can’t help you.   Let’s not act like Parker signed to an assload of money. He signed a 2y 13 mill contract. And sure let’s not act like losing Huerter and Collins for long periods of the season didn’t contribute to the low win total. And let’s not act like we literally didn’t use our cap space to acquire a shit ton of FRPs and we used those to move up to get Hunter. No we just traded for and paid Allen Crabbe and Chandler Parsons for shits and gigs.   Lol I love how your counter argument is Kris Dunn, as if Bogi, Gallo, Capela, TRAE, Huerter and Lou Will, which are all players that have been instrumental to our success this year and all players that Schlenk acquired, have not outweighed the loss of one dude who had to be treated for a totally unrelated injury than the one he originally had.   But anyways, I bet a shit ton of other teams, including your Bulls, would kill to have an executive like Schlenk."
"It's definitely impressive to get them this far, but it doesn't automatically make Travis Schlenk of the best GMs in the league. Otherwise, GM rankings would be just be a literal list of the teams with the best record in a given season.  What's the purpose of signing Jabari Parker? If it was to be a sixth man, he was one of the most expensive, and yet worst in the league. And team didn't win close to 30 games because of it and not picking up a backup point guard If it was somehow to be bad, you didn't have give someone a two year contract to do it. How is it possibly arguable that signing a bad player to a bad contract is better than using the capspace to get a first round pick or other asset?   It was a bad move. Just like hiring Lloyd Pierce. Just like choosing a backup center over Haliburton. Yes, these are things that his team was able to overcome, meaning he's pretty good GM. But he's not automatically fourth or one of the best because they are in the final four of the NBA.  You are defending to the death the guy who hired Lloyd Pierce and almost fired him too late to salvage this magnificent season. Anyway, enjoy Kris Dunn next year. Another genius Schlenk signing."
"Players who have a chance this year that could join this list:   -  DeMarcus Cousins (LAC, 5th overall)  -  Kris Dunn (ATL, 5th overall)  -  Deandre Ayton (PHX, 1st overall)  -  Trae Young (ATL, 5th overall)  - De'Andre Hunter (ATL, 4th overall)  ---  So for this to not change, the Bucks would have to win the 2021 championship"
He was gonna go 7 or 8. I remembered there being a consensus top 8 with the Raptors having the 9th in that draft. Yes Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn were in that top 8
"You can call it generous I guess. He was a number 1 overall pick that was traded to the wolves after his rookie season. I don’t blame the Wolves for not developing him though.  Wiggins played his first 5 seasons in Minnesota and was a complete let down. KAT is clearly talented and still relatively young but The Wolves have never figured out how to build a winning roster around him after 6 years. Jury is still out on Edwards but he looks promising.  Not to mention they did nothing with Rubio, Johnny Flynn, Derrick Williams, and Kris Dunn who were all top 10 picks in the last 15 years. Their best value pick is probly Lavine who they traded away. This response is way longer than it needs to be and it doesn’t matter that much but the point is that I’m not sure what another high draft pick even does for the Wolves. KAT and Edwards are number 1 overall picks under the age of 26. If that isn’t enough for the Wolves to work with then adding another number 1 overall probly won’t be enough either. Id like to see Detroit or Houston get their shot at developing a top draft pick"
"There's also this Kris Dunn guy who may or may not exist, he's very much like Schroedinger's cat at this point."
Kris Dunn? Very nice indeed.
Kris Dunn had a cup of coffee but has been Injured 98% of the year too
"Jaylen wasn't a gimme at 3. The whole 3-8 of that draft was seen as a coinflip, with a lot of people thinking that Kris Dunn was the 3rd best player in that draft."
"Except arguably their two biggest wing pieces, Reddish and Hunter, didn’t play.  Imagine if they were playing and you had a rotation of Trae, Bogi, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Heurter, Gallo, Capela and Okongwu.  All the while having Lou Williams, Kris Dunn for defense, Solomon Hill, and Tony Snell for “as needed” situations.  These are all at worst rotation players in the nba. This is an insanely deep Hawks roster."
"Exactly, it's hard to come up with a more one-sided defensive specialist player ever. At least one that was all-star tier or close to it, there's obviously other role players like Kris Dunn and Thybulle in the league rn."
And Kris Dunn is still in purgatory!
Ben and a pick swap for Kris Dunn
"Ehh mainly Kris Dunn who doesn't play and if you really want to, Solomon Hill. But all the other guys, you could make the case (which I'm sure the Hawks would if they had to),  were walking alongside their bench which they're allowed to.  Suns players walked away from their bench."
put Kris Dunn on curry
Kris Dunn. I thought he was gonna be a double double machine.  Of course I also wanted the Rockets to draft Melo Trimble.
"You are literally hypocritically arguing that Luka inflates his role players numbers but Trae doesn’t inflate his. Gallo and Kris Dunn were walking ER rooms, and Huerter didn’t deserve a bench spot in the NBA.   If every single GM would take the Hawks core over the Mavs why were the Mavs unanimously ranked as a Top 10 team, and the Hawks in the bottom half of the league?  Hunter and Reddish are injured players in their 3rd year. Everyone said Trae, Lou Will, and Capela were unplayable in playoff basketball. This delusional revisionist history is insane."
"I can't be the only one who thinks the Hawks are stacked.  Young, Capela, Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Collins, Williams, Hunter and you have Kris Dunn on the bench. Dunn was no joke with the Bulls before the pandemic. Can you imagine Doncic with this team instead of Porky and Hardaway. I know I shouldn't bring him up but I was concerned about how people don't see the Hawks as a stacked  team."
