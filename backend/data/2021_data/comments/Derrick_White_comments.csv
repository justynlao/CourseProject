"Dude no one ever, ever ever talks about the Spurs lol, and we all know this isnt new (Derrick White is clearly much better than DJ though)"
"Nine Grizz in double figures, Jenkins has them playing with confidence.  Also, 0-3 with Derrick White in the active roster."
Anyone know what happened to Derrick White? How come hes only played 5 minutes?
"I think he's overrated compared to Derrick White who's also on the Spurs, and who is a much better player"
Keep in mind Derrick white up until the bubble last year was benched/in a limited role so pop could run out 25 different iterations of Forbes/Mills/Belinelli back courts and some of that data isn‚Äôt really reflective of what he is capable of going forward or what he did in the bubble for example
"and LaMarcus didn't attempt a single 3 that game lol  I think we only missed our 15th attempt or so, Derrick White was the one that missed"
"SA has beaten both LA teams, Portland, Denver and Boston. Granted they've lost to Minne and Houston without Harden, but half of their wins have been against good to great teams. That was without Derrick White too, who is arguably their best or second best player when healthy. If they continue to play at that level, I think DeMar has a good shot at being an AS."
2017 draft class extensions:  Jonathan Isaac: 20 mil (even after the major injury)  Fultz: 17 mil  Derrick White: 18 mil  OG Anunoby: 18 mil  Kennard: 16 mil  Kuzma: 13 mil  I'd say the market for Lauri is easily over 18 mil - offensively he's better than all these guys and still hasn't realized his potential yet. Bulls will likely just match any offer thrown at him.

Is Luka even better than Derrick White?
"If Derrick White has million number of fans i am one of them üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. if Derrick White has ten fans i am one of them. if Derrick White has only one fan, that is me üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. if Derrick White has no fans, that means i am no longer on this earth üò¢. if the world is against Derrick White, i am against the world ‚ùåüåç‚òÑÔ∏è. i love #DerrickWhite till my last breath.. üòç .. Die Hard fan of Derrick White ü§ì‚ö™. Hit upvote If you Think Derrick White is the Best player &amp; most Smart In the world ü§†"
"That's a fair question. I think Keldon and Derrick White are the real deal.   I think Keldon has star potential and White is probably going to settle in as a really good ""star role player"". Someone who can't lead a team, but an X factor on a championship team.   Keldon's advanced stats look good. Derrick white has performed at a high level in the playoffs.   Also 7th, 7th is not that bad. I mean there are ton of teams with decent young talent who can't even sniff the playoffs. I think our current record (11-8) shows that there is something real here and not young guys just getting volume stats on bad teams."
"I mean instead of getting a Cory Joseph at 29 two years in a row. I would love to miss out on two 29th picks straight and then 3rd year finding Dejounte Murray or Derrick White at 29.  What I mean is if you find a Murray/White every third year, that's great, but there's not much great about finding Cory Joseph. It doesn't elevate your team at all."
"Popovich runs on a philosophy where he values a player's attitude. You may not be good, but as long as you're willing to put the effort and show results, you'll have a spot. I really doubt that any other team would have even drafted someone like Derrick White and expected he to become what he is.   It's the reason why our team has remained relative drama free for around 20 years (Thanks nephew). Everyone is on the same page, and respect runs the team. Even if you're the last guy in the bench, Pop is going to respect you like everyone, and chew the fuck out of you no matter if you're the best guy on the team."
Derrick White and now add Lou Dort to the list we meme. Who's the next random role player r/nba will say is better than Trae?
Rather have Derrick White tbh
"It will be interesting to see coming down the stretch of the season and hopefully into the playoffs, how it works for other teams planning for Demar. There‚Äôs a lot more around him for teams to account for than before. You plan for Demar and get BIG BODIED by Keldon, or your eyes cut out by Dejounte, or FIBA patty goes off, BLOKOB POETLE is basically Rudy Gobert, Lonnie streaks for 12 points in 3 min, Vaselle wrecks havoc on defense and hits 40% from 3. Not even mentioning if Lamarcus Frankenstein goes sleep walking for 20-30, and NOT THIS GUY Rudy Gay does exactly what he‚Äôs been doing all season. Spurs are good! Currently sitting 4th in the west and finding their stride.  Edit: And Derrick White is back! Time to groove."
The people in those replies are probably the same people that said they‚Äôd rather have Derrick White over Trae last year.
Considering his 2 way ability its really not that much of a stretch. In the bubble it was about 50/50 Derrick and Demar being our best offensive playmakers while White plays significantly better defense.
"I'm excited. They invested in both so they know Spurs are behind them. If White plays anything like Bubble Derrick White, wow the team is going to make lots of noise this year."
&gt; Dejounte finally made the jump on the offensive end and doesn't gamble every single passing lane on defense anymore  People were too impatient with him. Usually takes a year after the ACL injury. Right on schedule...   &gt; Derrick White still hasn't even been in the lineup most of the year and he's arguably our best player to a certain degree &gt;   Played only 1 game this season. LFG!!
"Demar's been in all star form in each season with Spurs, its jus now the players around him are better, he doesn't have to over exert himself tryna carry, gets more assists.  Aldridge is still an incredible shooter, has done good to hit more 3s, but is atrocious on d. Poetle is exceptional on d but terrible at shooting. Centre is our weakest position and typically we lose to teams with good big men.  Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray have both been incredible, could both be in the convo for MIP. Vassell looks great but still gets less minutes being a rookie. That said wouldn' be surprised if he takes more minutes from Lonnie Walker once our star pg Derrick White is healthy.  Patty FIBA Mills. Patty fucking Mills. Is a solid candidate for 6th man of the year. Been playing out his skin this year.  So yeah peeps might stop sleepin on us soon. There's weaknesses to the team, youth can be inconsistent, but they play with so much heart. So much fun to watch."
Derrick White and Kyle Lowry on the same team?  other teams would get called for a charge on every posession lol
"Personally I'd move White to the second unit, because if anyone is getting dropped for him it's Lonnie and I have no interest in a Lonnie lead 2nd unit. Hopefully Derrick is our leader off the bench for now, start him later on"
Man I did not expect this and it's crazy that Derrick White is still out cause of injury that dude was our second best player last year
and Derrick White is playing tomorrow as well
"Its just a whole team contribution, it can be any single guy on a given night. DeMar knows when to take over and he also knows when to step back and let the young guys get their run. Its kinda insane how good he has been about not being selfish and knowing what helps the team be its best.  LMA is regressing pretty hard and its sad to see. Devin is solid and gives off rookie Kawhi vibes, not aggressive at all, can shoot and defend but looks a bit shaken out there. Hes doing great even though the box score might not show it.  Hopefully with Derrick White back tomorrow we'll be even better"
Scary thing is we are doing all this without Derrick White (who returns tomorrow!)
Derrick White returning from injury tomorrow too
"$SPURS TO THE MOON BABY!!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ  but honestly as a san antonian, the spurs are sneaky good this year. Demar has been clutch and BIG BODY KELDON JOHNSON is having a hell of a season. The baby spurs are a lot further in their development and Derrick white comes back tomorrow, who before the season started was definitely my pick for the biggest breakthrough!"
"I dont think they'd *need* to trade Johnson, but something like around Derrick White/Devin Vassell/Tre Jones. As long as they include enough picks they cover any trash. I mean the main selling point of Harden's deal was all the picks, the same could be here."
"Rudy Gay, Derrick White, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Love, Dwayne Bacon"
&gt;Him and Derrick white were set to have a ~~forehead~~ fivehead dynasty smh
Him and Derrick white were set to have a forehead dynasty smh
"There's no way you can compare the spurs to the wizards lol. The spurs have dejounte Murray, derozan, Aldridge, keldon johnson, two good veterans in patty mills and rudy gay, as well as promising young talent in Lonnie walker and derrick white. The spurs roster is WAY better than the wizards."
"Lebron always argues about calls. I remember in Spurs game, he shoved Derrick White to the floor, scored a layup while Keldon did some marginal foul and had the audacity to complain for an and one."
I was *begging* to move up for John Collins. (Though Derrick White turned out pretty great)  Then the next year for SGA.   This year it was Haliburton (Though Vassell looks good)
I'm just ready for Derrick White to be back
having DJ and Derrick White is about the closest to that it gets lol
Wait... And Derrick White is coming back this weekend? Let's go!
How is derrick white doing
"Derrick White over Trae as well lmao, definitely on Pop"
derrick white supremacists are always out there smh
"Wish I could find the link, but it‚Äôs a reference to the time that somebody made a thread on the topic, and the geniuses on r/nba said they would rather have Derrick White than Trae Young on their team"
Trae Young? Lol hell no why not Derrick White instead
Are they sure they want Trae instead of Derrick White?
Hopefully Derrick White is selected
"Yeah that's been weird although his overall 2 point % is still in line with his career norms, like 48%, last season being the outlier at 54%. I bet the % at the rim regresses back some. His free throw rate has been higher that might regress a bit and his turnovers might regress back to his career norms but yeah I would generally expect his RAPTOR to stay in the top 50 range offensively all year.  Contrary to expectation theyve actually been way worse with him at the 4 this year, not just defensively but offensively also. So what goes on there if Popovich ends up deciding to change some lineups is also something to monitor. Will also have to see what happens when Derrick White comes back they paid him like a starter but they might ease him into things. Spurs offensive rating has been down like 5 pts when DeRozan hasnt been on the court this year compared to the past 2 seasons combined, White  not being there plays into that."
I will never feel insulted by someone who Unironically thinks Derrick White is anywhere close to as good as Trae Young. It‚Äôs like being insulted in CSGO by a 8 year old
&gt; they're going to need an elite P&amp;R guard/system to make the contract worth it  Derrick White. Better than Trae ever was/is/could be.
He probly won't but Kings should've traded him for at least a future 2nd round pick. Guys they could've drafted besides Giles:  Terrence Ferguson Jarrett Allen OG Anunoby Kuzma Derrick White Josh Hart Thomas Bryant Dillon Brooks
"Ah yes, Derrick White"
"where derrick white at, spurs flairs"
"I'm from Colorado and I can tell you that in the early 90's Billups was all over the news here. He won Mr. Colorado Basketball 3 years in a row and just was in totally different league then everyone else.   However, there is an argument to be made that Michael Sugar Ray Richardson was the most talented player to ever come out of Colorado. He got kicked out of the NBA 4 years into his career for drugs though.   Derrick White was hardly recruited out of high school and went to D2 UCCS. I played some pick up with him at the gym his freshmen year and he was really good, but I don't think anyone suspected that he would get to the NBA. He worked his way up to play at CU though and I use to hear stories about his legendary work ethic at UCCS.   Some other notables:  Tom Chambers- Had [this wild dunk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDyBSTQDwH8&amp;ab_channel=TC24)  Joe Barry Carroll- Drafted #1 overall in 1980.  Dave Logan- Drafted by the NBA, NFL and MLB, I don't think he ever played in the NBA.  Pat Garrity- Was traded for the draft rights to Dirk  Justinian Jessup- Was drafted this year by Golden State  Jason Smith- Nothing really, but he went to CSU. (Go Rams!)   Michael Ruffin- [Threw the ball in the air that one time](https://youtu.be/gRBF3JpbnOI?t=80)  Reggie Jackson- Looks like [Bobby Shmurda](https://twitter.com/i/status/1222900051158061058)"
Derrick white shouldn't be the only active player from Colorado. Reggie Jackson graduated high school in Colorado Springs.
"Vassell is not one of our top 5 players. Demar, Lma, Rudy, Patty and Derrick White are all better"
"DJ is getting pretty good at just being a steady point guard. He‚Äôs getting guys good shots, not turning the ball over, attacking mismatches but not forcing things, generating pace but also staying under control, knocking down shots and finishing consistently enough. He‚Äôs just looking solid. Kinda like Derrick White, not a lot of serious holes in his game right now. Defensively, he‚Äôs definitely looking like he‚Äôs back to being elite. This is crazy to think about because even during the bubble a lot of Spurs fans were unsure he would ever figure it out and maybe that his 16 mil a year contract was a mistake. Now it‚Äôs looking like a steal."
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."
"Future looks promising for the Spurs with a solid youth core of KJ, Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell and maybe even Samanic.   Even in the coaching department, Pop is setting them up well with Becky Hammon and Will Hardy."
"What's going to be the deal with Derrick White when he comes back now?  I thought going into this year he was going to be your best player, but now I'm not totally sure what his role will be."
"Dejounte still isn't a great playmaker for others. He's more of a combo guard and he's very good at getting his own midrange shot with screens where he shoots over 40 percent. He was very bad at finishing at the rim before this season and has clearly worked on that a lot over the offseason. Once Derrick White comes back from his injury, he should handle the more traditional point guard stuff and they should work well together."
Don‚Äôt sleep on Derrick White. The league is about to be put on blast when cha Boi makes his epic return.
"They‚Äôve fallen off a bit but I still think the Spurs are up there with those other teams when it comes to player development. Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White developing like they have as the 29th picks of their respective drafts is nice."
"So far we‚Äôre doing a lot better then last season. Especially when Derrick White comes back, I feel like the team should have a better record this year"
It‚Äôs unfair to compare Trae to Derrick White. Derrick White plays elite guard defense
He‚Äôs a poor man‚Äôs Derrick White
"From what I've noticed:   Coby White up to 6-5 from 6-4.  Wendell Carter up to 6-10 from 6-9.  BI up to 6-8 from 6-7.  DMitch down to 6-0 from 6-1.  De'Andre Hunter is now 6-8,   Dwight is back to 6-10,   Ben Simmons up to 6-11.   Shai gained an inch (6-6).    Melo down to 6-7.   Derrick Favors down to 6-8 from 6-9.  Surprisingly, Shaq Harrison stayed at 6-7. Mentioning bc he said that he was 6-4 when asked last year.  Kuzma now at 6-10 from 6-8.  Again, possible that I missed people, I only checked the ones that sounded different to me."
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O‚ÄôNeale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Steph  CP3  Kyrie  Lowry  Jrue  Conley  Brogdon  Lonzo  Schroder  Beverly  Derrick White  I'm sure other people could name a few
That ref is on some bullshit calling that gather step travel on Rudy Gay lmao Spurs are missing Derrick White hard rn
derrick white or trae young
"pretty much. this applies to a few players to varying degrees. i think some casual fans would be under the impression a guy like westbrook is a top five player when healthy but shot selection kills his value imo. on the end of the spectrum, no one knows who the fuck derrick White is as a casual but he's genuinely literally our best player when healthy.   andre drummond has some monster box scores, he must be great, but you miss all the things he doesn't do right that way. bu then again, KCP was 20 spots ahead of demar derozan on the ESPN list so who the fuck knows what consensus actually is on anyone. lol"
"Dejounte or Keldon. If you asked me before the season, I‚Äôd have said obviously Derrick White.  We have a very promising young core."
Don‚Äôt forget Derrick White
"Gotcha. Normally for SL and GL the only thing I look for is production. For example Murray, and now Luka, kind of scared me because they played alright (sometimes horrible). While Derrick White and Keldon would fill it up on offense. It's probably an oversimplification.  With Keldon I always think about what KD said about him when he was coming out of HS. He said that Keldon can score no problem. He just needed to figure out the team stuff. Which looks to be true so far."
"If the spurs can stick around 0.500 while Derrick White is out, we are definitely making the play-in games at least imo"
You joke but Derrick White was originally going to play at the Denver campus of Johnson and Whales which is only known for its culinary program.
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Christian Wood is also older than all of the spurs young players except for Derrick white
Derrick White basically didn't play his rookie year when he was 23. Draymond was regularly getting 30+ minutes and started some games in the playoffs when he had just turned 24 and in his second year under Mark Jackson.
His MPG (and everything else) will likely go down once Derrick White comes back.
"He has a very similar guarding profile to Dame - ideally the weakest perimeter player on the other team. But more flexible to taller players if that's the least dangerous matchup. I had a look at their top-15 respective matchups (based on [NBA tracking data](https://go.nba.com/bo3c)) by minutes played last season.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want one, but to avoid an even longer wall of text, here's a summary (these are sums over the top-15 defensive assignments for each, positions from wikipedia):  * Luka spent 34:29 on PGs, 40:55 on PG/SG, 11:53 on SGs, 27:43 on SG/SF, and 52:36 on forwards who aren't even part-time guards. That is far more time on only-guards at 86:17 minutes compared to 52:36 on only-forwards, or about 64% more time on only-guards than only-forwards. * Dame spent 55:38 on PGs, 43:33 on PG/SG, 31:46 on SGs, 10:56 on SG/SF, and 36:21 across three different forwards who aren't even part-time guards. More time on players who are never-PGs than only-PGs. * Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both top-15 lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. * Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens. The only difference is that one is taller so the coach maybe has more flexibility in picking the more suitable guy to guard.  Also, this ""you are what you guard"" concept is a mess of a circular argument. But even if that is applied, Luka is certainly more of a guard than a forward. And since he's a guard, he's also clearly playing at on-ball/point rather than off-ball/shooting guard."
I respectfully disagree. DeMar has been balling out of his mind this season and has vastly improved his shot selection since Toronto but Derrick White scored a comfortably our best two way player. I‚Äôm not against the idea that DeRozan is a better player than White but for the Spurs and all of our massive defensive deficiencies I think White is the more important player for us.
"I said I wouldnt crown Derrick White the best player on the spurs already but apparently that annoyed alot of spurs fans telling me how wrong I was. DeMar is still the best until proven otherwise. I get Whites defense and high IQ play and all but if your career high in made field goals is 10, you cant crown him as the best player over DeMar yet."
"Spurs have taken Kyle Anderson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Keldon Johnson with the 29th picks. Hell of a run there."
Both him and Derrick White have been gems as the 29th pick in their respective drafts. Murray too was in the 20‚Äôs. Last first round picks are valuable to the teams that draft well.
"With Derrick White and LMA out so much this season, most games he has been the second best player on the team. He can get hot from 3 and is great at finishing up around the rim. Really just needs more playing time to build confidence. He's easily going to be starting for us from now on."
Most Surprising: The ball movement has been awesome. Murray improvement at finishing at the rim.  Most Disappointing: Derrick White toe injury.
"*with Derrick White injured, as he would probably share the ball with Murray and DeRozan as well"
"Derrick White, I guess. I think they'd be more 1a/1b, but Collins has produced more so I'd say he'd be the #1 option."
"um . . . *Pop?*  In reality, I don't know. It would be convenient if one of their guards (Derrick White) got the keys to the car and could drive it. But, it's likely they have to grind/tank harder to find a franchise cornerstone level player  Collins is an amazing big who can shoot (what more could you ask for?). But needs a PnR partner and someone to initiate the offense."
"I think in general Spurs fans are really high on Keldon, potential all star some day. Personally i love Murray. I love his leadership and defense and his offense has taken a big leap this year. Derrick White is the key to our engine tho, a two way player who doesn't make many mistakes and plays great team and individual defense, he's just proving to be really injury prone. Lonnie Walker is like our JR Smith minus the bonehead personality. Luka Samamic is the biggest what if because he extremely raw and lacks a good motor but has an extremely high ceiling, possible all star due to his versatility and skills but like i said he seems to lack a motor to ever fulfill his potential"
Crazy brother because we‚Äôre 3-1 with Aldridge in the line up and don‚Äôt even have Derrick white   We‚Äôre going to be the 6 seed come March and laker flairs are still gonna be wondering when we‚Äôre giving them derozan for kuzma lol

Derrick White is arguably Spurs best player? wtf are you smoking.
We were missing Derrick White tonight
Spurs have been down a key player too with Derrick White back out.
"spurs also missing derrick white, but I'm just glad the spurs didn't get swept by the lakers"
"Derrick White, Keldon Johnson"
I've always had a soft spot for Derrick White.  I love what he brings as an all-around player with great two-way skills.
"I hear you, stronger core. Spurs have nowhere near that strong a core.  But the Spurs won't likely won't mess with Dejounte/Derrick White/Jakob/Keldon Johnson/Vassell, who are their current building blocks.  They'd likely give up ""meh"" picks and a guy like Lonnie Walker, who is a high upside player that seems to be near his ceiling with San Antonio."
It's probably going to have to require giving up at least 2 of the following:  Devin Vassell  Keldon Johnson   Derrick White  DeJounte Murray   This years pick. Whether it would require more draft capital would depend on which of these players   The fit is pristine though.
"We recently been without Keldon Johnson (recently came back last game), Derrick White, Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell. All were getting decent to big mins. Luka Samanic has stepped up and contribute as of late which is nice to see. Can't wait to get the whole squad back and healthy."
Yeah pretty badly actually. Spurs have played like 4 less games than most teams because of COVID and derrick white has essentially missed the whole season. Then Derrick white comes back and is out two weeks for Covid regulations along with Keldon Johnson.
"I think that Popovich enjoys that part of the job. Meeting young and promising guys that want to work towards earning a spot. I doubt that guys like Derrick White, or even Dejounte would be where they are if they were drafted into most of the other teams. Plus, Pop sadly doesn't have his life companion anymore, and retirement would be lonely. I believe he looks forward to preparing future prospects for a couple of years. Maybe not as an arduous job like a coach, but he has  the right to a ""Whatever the hell he wants"" spot in the organization."
The last three games we played were without Derrick white and Rudy gay. KJ also missed two games. Demar missed a game due to his dad passing. We did postpone a few games but we also have been playing with guys missing.
Derrick White has barely played. That point differential is going to improve once he‚Äôs on the court.
"we take a lot of midrange even after the youth revolution. dejounte, demar, derrick white and lonnie take a lot of midrange shots and all of them are our main source of scoring which is fine because teams tend to lave that midrange spot open and our guys are good at hitting them."
Also Derrick White has essentially missed the whole year apart from a few games? And he‚Äôs probably our second or third best player at the moment.
"Yeah, the Spurs have been rebuilding basically since they traded kawhi. The Murray extension, drafting and developing KJ and Lonnie, jakobs development, Derrick white, drafting Vassell. I‚Äôll admit I was on the ‚Äútrade LA and Demar will never work here‚Äù wagon, but I‚Äôm happy to say PATFO were once again smarter than me.   The real fans know the pain of watching Bryn and Marco close out games, so to see these young guys develop and play the way they have has been an absolute joy. Also, it‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre not done improving either."
"DeRozan is PROBABLY staying, and yeah on paper we are at best a second round exit, but you never know  &gt;I feel like Murray, Keldon, and Walker are all 3rd bananas at best.  Now here's where you're wrong, first of all because calling Lonnie a third option is way exaggerated and also because the other two are at worst good #2 options and both still developing, specially Keldon. There's also Derrick White who's a great option as well, for now future looks bright"
"We had a pretty tough schedule to start the year so that helps, we are currently with COVID problems and 2-2 since that started (missing essentially everyone who plays significant Minutes off the bench minus Patty + Derrick White) plus the rest of the west is inconsistent as heck, so as long as we don't fall apart after the All Star break we should be in"
"Yep, played our last 4 games without Derrick White, Rudy Gay, Vassell, Keldon Johnson missed 3 and LMA and DeMar have also missed a game each. We're 2-2 in that span"
They literally have players out for covid this past week and all their games were postponed. Not to mention Derrick white has been out most of the season
Derrick White.
Derrick White had career highs in the last two Spurs games I attended
"He was their best player right before the bubble. He had a slow start to the season coming back from surgery and short training camp/pre-season. I think he's showing once again that in the right situation, he can excel. They should probably bring him back given that they lack size. He's younger than Derrick White."
Yea i mean its fair. Id say i was lightly taking their potential into consideration when saying who the better 29th pick was.  What pisses me off is we aren't even talking about Derrick White who is also a good player haha fucking Spurs
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
overated - derrick white-    underrated- jak jak
"Look, I understand that it's common for people to try to trade garbage for real assets but this isn't one of those times.  Have you watched either of those guys?  Luke is a 6'5"" guard that shoots 44% from 3 and is only 24.  Hes going to make ~$14M.  Similar cost to Jordan Clarkson and Kyle Kuzma.  Far from terrible for a great shooter that is still improving.    Marcus morris was highly sought after last off-season during FA.  He's shooting a blistering 49.2% from 3 and can guard 3-5.  He's going to make ~$16M per year.  That's around what Bertans and Derrick White are going to make.  Raptors want young guys and vets and these 2 fit those needs.  They're both in long contracts that are easily tradable.  Clips just don't have 1st round draft picks to offer.  Even though it won't happen, if clips included Zubac then raptors would accept.  Keep in mind raps are rebuilding and don't expect to contend for a couple years."
"It's a win trade considering the situation. Pop wasn't gonna give the Lakers another Superstar, and again, their offer for Kawhi at the time wasn't close to his value, specially after looking what they sent for AD. The best value of the trade was BI. Lonzo doesn't do much for us. We have enough guards. Josh Hart really isn't as valuable either.  &gt; Ingram at 21  Would have been nice, but Derozan has done his job as the first offensive option. The sole reason we struggled so much last year was having two of the worst defenders in the entire league taking so many minutes alongside Derozan, and we had lost DJ for a season. Plus, Ingram isn't a stud on defense as well. Derozan's job is offense and to facilitate, and he does that well. His defense struggle can be hidden by playing him as a Forward while he's alongside good defensive players. He has bought into the team, and it's also an awesome presence for our young unit. Derozan has saved us many games. He's far from perfect, but he isn't the main issue with our team.   &gt;Lonzo/1st round pick   Why have Lonzo when we have Derrick White and Dejounte? We got a first round pick from Toronto that turned into Big Body, and Jak fills that very much needed defensive anchor as Lamarcus has regressed a lot.  &gt; While giving away D Green  Danny was sent to match salary, and the dude was coming off a bad year. So you can very well say it was Danny for Jakob and Keldon, and both have turned out incredibly well. May not have been that good because we gave up our perimeter defense, but seeing how the team is with Keldon and Jakob, I'd say it was worth it in hindsight.  &gt;  Just doesn‚Äôt make any sense at the time and now  It made sense at the time. Kawhi tanked his value, and with the mystery surrounding his injury, no team was gonna give anything for a year rental. Lakers offered, but for a player like Kawhi, and them being conference rivals, it wasn't worth it. No matter what the team would have done, we would have been clowned, either for not falling for the ""godsend"" offer, or because we gifted the Lakers a free superteam In both situations, we were getting fleeced. People talk about how we could have gotten an AD-like haul or a PG-like, but that type of deal was never offered in the first place for us. Toronto was the team with the best offer, since Pop really wasn't gonna spend his last years in a rebuild, so we took that one. Toronto made the gamble with Kawhi and it paid off. We did made the playoffs with Derozan on his first year, and pushed the second seed Nuggets to 7, but last year we went to shit thanks to Marco and Bryn Forbes playing so goddam much. This season we are in a much better position for now. We were expected to be under 30 games for the season."
"I just don't see how you could ever say he would *clearly* be the best player on the team when there's not much special about his game.   Especially when we have DeMar DeRozan that's still a walking bucket and should've been an All Star, Dejounte Murray whose still lockup on defense and finally a consistent offensive option, Keldon Johnson who is just an absolute monster, Derrick White, another extremely solid player on both ends and our best passer. Devin Vassell is a rookie and I think he has a bigger impact on both ends than Poetl.   Like yeah these advanced stats make him seem like he's top tier defensively but the eye test of watching him for the past 3 seasons doesn't really impress me."
Getting Tobias would've meant giving him that massive contract or letting him walk. That Smart contract would've had to have been 5M+ more than the celtics ended up paying him and the spurs already had Derrick White and Dejounte Murray as defensive minded guards. The difference between these trades is not much even if you think those trades are better. The lakers trade offer was Ingram and one pick. Possibly having the spurs having to take on Deng's contract. Kawhi tanked his trade value crazy hard.
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
"when you see Derrick white play, do you lowkey root for him cause you know him? Lol"
"Very happy. Once Derrick White was announced to be out the first 20 games or so, I assumed we would have a bottom 3-4 record in the west by the time he came back. Dejounte has become a much better finisher at the rim this season and Jakob has played far better after his slow start."
I'm pretty sure you're trolling but true Derrick White &gt; Trae just ask Pop.
Overrated playmaker and masterfoulbaiter rather have Lou Dort or Derrick White
"Pop moving demar to the 4 lets the Spurs hide him better on defense which has been nice. Their recent starting lineup that features Jak, DJ, and Derrick white, 3+ defenders has a small sample size but their Net has been pretty great. Unlike The main perpetrators like Lonnie or LMA who can‚Äôt be hidden on defense"
Derrick White as well. Was very high on him at the start of last year before his bubble breakout.
"He deserves 20m. The guy is averaging 14.3, 5apg, 4 rebounds on 39% from 3 and is also their best defender.  Derrick White, Fultz and OG got 17-18m a year on worse numbers in every category"
No this is bullshit. Fucking straight bullshit. Who the fuck does Kyrie think he is? He ain‚Äôt no Trae young or Derrick white. Dude needs to be humbled.
"Well, that's the whole point of the deal, isn't it? That Trent is 22, and Derrick White is nearly 27. The risk is that the ceiling isn't as high as they hope. The reward is that he's a potential all-star.   Knicks fans will tell you silly things about Obi Toppin's potential...he's almost a year older than Trent. Super young FAs get paid because the feeling is that they have untapped potential."
"if he ends up making more annually than Jaylen Brown and close to 2x what Derrick White makes (that extension was a steal) it's going to be rough for Portland.  They have no choice but to match, and at that cap figure he needs to take another leap to provide good ROI on the deal."
"Yeah the team that got keldon Johnson, Derrick white, and Dejounte Murray with 3 different 29th picks declining has to do with the front office, not a star player deciding to fuck us over lol  Being a GM in new York with a good owner is easy mode"
"When we drafted Derrick White i was like ""why the fuck did we pick this guy?""  I was an idiot....a complete idiot"
DERRICK WHITE IS THE FUTURE
"For Spurs Derrick White, it was learn how to run the Spurs offense as the floor general. For Keldon Johnson it was learning the offense on top of becoming a better shooter, play D. Lonnie Walker, learn since he was raw (and still is in some areas).    Tre Jones just turned 21, but it'll be very similar to White as a PG, running the offense. Spurs Luka just needs more game time and to dominate more along with showing hustle.  Spurs having their own team is very helpful since they use the same playbook."
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better. They're up to 9th this season for DRTG after being 25th last season.      |||||+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|OnCourt|On-OffV| |1|Jakob Poeltl|26|564|+10.9|+21.1| |2|Rudy Gay|25|552|+9.7|+18.8| |3|Patty Mills|26|661|+7.9|+18.3| |4|Derrick White|7|162|+9.1|+11.2| |5|Devin Vassell|25|444|+4.9|+8.7| |6|Dejounte Murray|26|789|+1.2|+5.0| |7|DeMar DeRozan|24|800|-1.8|-3.1| |9|LaMarcus Aldridge|18|480|-8.2|-12.0| |10|Trey Lyles|14|165|-14.2|-15.5| |11|Keldon Johnson|26|781|-6.8|-16.0| |12|Lonnie Walker|24|647|-8.5|-16.0| |13|Drew Eubanks|10|132|-20.5|-22.2|    Based on these On-Off per 100 possession numbers it seems that the Spurs' success has also been driven more so from their deep bench and role players compared to their veteran starts."
"Derrick White was our rookie during that year, so it had to have been Nick Johnson"
Not sure why Miles Bridges tried to play defense from his knees and just ended up falling into Derrick White.
"Derrick White and DJ have been tearing it up defensively, so they could be an honorable mention.  Conley and Mitchell are being a great backcourt duo and the Jazz have the best record on the league."
"It seems like Johnson to me. His game seems really well developed for a 2nd year guy and his size gives him a little more versatility. Derrick White seems like a guy who will just be a really good 2 way PG for the next decade but doesn't really have ""the stuff,"" to be a superstar if that makes sense. Murray could, his speed is unreal, but of the 3 he's the worst shooter imo. I like walker a lot but i think he's clearly a step down from those three. I think flipping Walker for 3+D, Vassell off the bench would be ideal imo. White, Walker, Johnson, 3+D wing, and Poeltl seems like a nightmare starting five in like 2 years tops."
"This one?:   Hear me and rejoice! You (Charlotte Hornets) have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Forehead. You may think this is suffering. No... it is salvation. The universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... for even in death, you have become children of Derrick White."
"White, Derrick"
"the worst thing a ref can be is indecisive and look out of control   that being said. great showing by the  spurs tonight, derrick white finding his form and jakob poeltl once  again asserting himself as one of the most fearsome interior presences in basketball."
Derrick White
Derrick White
I‚Äôm just here to simp for Derrick White
Derrick White
Derrick White for John Collins would make both teams better imo but idk if you‚Äôd get both sets of fans to agree
"Yeah alright, then he doesn't sound too much of a bad fit like I briefly imagined. We have a nice young guard rotation and most of them are capable playmakers, especially Derrick White.   What's Collin's fit Capela like? Our center at the moment is a defensive specialist with excellent rebounding and rim protection but limited offensively (sort of like Capela I imagine). Does Capala's lack of shooting/range hurt Collins in any way?"
"In fairness, he got a huge amount of his scoring in when both Dejounte and Derrick were sitting at the end of the first.  He went 5-6 on FTs, 3-3 on 2 pointers and 1-2 on 3 pointers in the last 6 minutes of the first quarter after Murray and White checked out to score 14 of his 25 on great efficiency. He shot 4-10, 1-5 from 3 and 2-2 from the line for his other 11 points."
absolute beast but will fall out of 6MOTY contention now that Derrick White is back
"Teenage mutant ninja Poetl‚Äôs, Demar is Leonardo, Derrick White is Donatello, Dejounte is Raphael, Keldon is Mikey, Pop is Master Splitter and Kawhi is Shredder"
Swap Trae with Derrick White and the scores would be flipped
Derrick white
What‚Äôs going on with Derrick White?
"I disagree, suns have had 8 missed games total between all of their starters. Saric is the only guy missing a lot of games and I wouldn't call that ravaged. I'd say they're pretty comparable with the spurs who have missed Derrick White all but 6 games this season and I would definitely not call the spurs ravaged."
"God that Jakob and Vassell double block sequence was so dope though   Steph showed me how important Derrick white is to our overall execution as a team defensively. We were chasing our tails the whole game, we would have still lost but maybe it‚Äôs not as ugly."
Derrick White.
"I've never seen a team feed off of momentum the way the Ws do. Like they get a couple of shots and all of a sudden their defense tightens up as well and next thing you know a close game turns into a blowout.  We really missed Derrick White tonight, if I'm quite honest."
"Honestly, if you look closely, Derrick white looks like he was about to foul Draymond  Green. I seriously think that was the case here."
"I was thinking he thought White was going to bite and get called for a fowl, but c'mon, you got to know Derrick is a pretty smart player and no way he does a boneheaded foul like that at the end of the game."
yes the OP vid doesn't show the full sequence after the dangerous pass from Derrick White  https://streamable.com/88djmj   this one shows the whole thing!
"How is everyone so blind that they honestly think this was a serious attempt by Draymond. White reaches in and Draymond is expecting him to foul resulting in 2 foul shots. Draymond knows they are down by 3. His only hope is to hoist a 3 hoping he gets rewarded 3 free throws instead of 2. White sees this and backs off.  Honestly there was very little Draymond could do in this situation other than at very best getting two foul shots and almost certainly losing the game anyway, because Derrick white would‚Äôve definitely fouled him if he didn‚Äôt try and yeet at 3."
"At first glance this looks like a dumb ass shot by Dray. But credit to Derrick White. Dray took the shot cos he thought he was gonna rip through White's reach/intentional foul and draw 3 FT shots. White made him think that.    White lured Dray into thinking he was luring White, lol. ‚ù§  P.s. ""What did he do that for?"" LOLLL. his tone of voice."
"The way Derrick white rushed him, it looked like he might have been going for the foul. But quickly put his hands back when he saw draymond start to go into his shooting motion"
And the Spurs were doing everything possible to deny him the ball. Good team defense by you guys at the end and just a great play by Derrick White to bait Draymond into chucking it up. I honestly thing Steph would have done the same
derrick white is one of the smartest defenders in basketball it's more surprising draymond thought he would jump into him
He tried to draw a shooting foul for 3 free throws but Derrick White didn't bite.
Dray thought Derrick White was stupid enough to foul.
"Derrick was reaching initially so he was trying to draw a foul, White however was smart enough to pull back as soon as Dray went up for the jumper."
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
"He‚Äôs on the Spurs; Pop traditionally has rookies on a shorter leash, and they‚Äôre stacked at G/F with Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, Demar, Keldon Johnson, Patty Mills, and Rudy Gay. He‚Äôs averaging 17 minutes a game, which isn‚Äôt terrible, but it‚Äôs the least of any lottery player besides Okongwu, Toppin, Jalen Smith, Kira Lewis, and Nesmith. Those guys suffer the same problem as Vassell- being stuck in the rotation due to roster depth- but I also think they‚Äôre significantly worse than Vassell."
"For whatever reason that 2018ish roster of Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, Bryan Forbes and Derrick White all seemed like one interchangeable person."
Literally only the 16th best player under 25. Not even better than Derrick White tbh
The Nuggets team that almost lost to Derrick White? lmao

"nah - gary was by far our best perimeter defender. did you see what derrick white did to us before he came back? gary is put on the best opposing guard / wing for a reason. he guarded white, mitchell, and kawhi last playoffs. who the fuck was the nuggets best perimeter defender if not him?"
"&gt;What?  The Lakers win a ring every 4 years, on average, and Towns would've been a Laker for 5 by now.  Their rate is much higher when they have a top center, as well, somewhere around 50%, actually.  So he'd certainly have one, and quite likely more.  Towns has been an extremely good player from his 2nd season on, and if you think about their roster moves over the past 6 years, it's obvious they'd have been very competitive with Towns.    Had they drafted Towns instead of Russell, in 2017 they'd have had Towns, Randle, Ingram, Nance up front and even though young, that's as-good as anyone's frontcourt. They'd have never signed Mozgov -- almost certainly a guard, instead.  Maybe they still draft Zubac in the second round to backup Towns -- which is by-far the best center tandem in the league in short order -- or they flip him for a guard, because they wouldn't need or want Muscala.  They don't sign Andrew Bogut's corpse, either.  They probably don't dump Jordan Clarkson and Nance to clear that second max free agent spot, since they wouldn't need to.  They don't waste a 2019 second trading for Roy Hibbert, either.  They don't trade for Thomas Bryant, either.  There's not any telling who'd they'd draft after that point, but that front office did not really miss on draft picks, so they would likely be good.  They probably don't trade for Kuzma, but don't really need him anyway with the aforementioned forwards.  They almost certainly don't spend two more late-first round picks on centers in Moe Wagner, and Tony Bradley if they have Towns -- probably get guys like Derrick White, or Jalen Brunson instead.  They also don't fire Byron Scott in 2016, who was a very good coach.  The Lakers have wasted a ton of assets since 2015 in searching for a quality big man, and then blew an unprecedented package of assets to rent one last season.  With Towns, none of that would've been necessary, and they'd have been a far more attractive free-agent destination to boot.  There is basically no time in NBA history where the Lakers had a top 5 center and didn't at least make the Finals more often than not -- and the Lakers have had a top 5 center for about 30 seasons."
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist¬†**Harrison Barnes**¬†(Sacramento Kings);¬†**Jaylen Brown**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Joe Harris**¬†(Brooklyn Nets);¬†**Brook Lopez**¬†(Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Donovan Mitchell**¬†(Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist¬†**Mason Plumlee**¬†(Denver Nuggets),¬†**Marcus Smart**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Jayson Tatum**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Myles Turner**¬†(Indiana Pacers);¬†**Kemba Walker**¬†(Boston Celtics); and¬†**Derrick White**¬†(San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
No guard gets back to recover and block/affect more shots on drives that they were initially beat than Derrick white
"Bobby Portis, Donte, and Derrick White, and Pat are your 5-8 guys that will play minutes in the playoffs. And I don‚Äôt think they are as good as the nets guys in Harris, Jordan, Blake, LMA, Brown and the Lakers in Harrell, KCP, Gasol, Drummond, Morris, Kuzma"
"I doubt it, but Colangelo‚Äôs comments about ‚Äúvowing to remember‚Äù team USA withdrawals make me a bit nervous. I‚Äôll be so freaking pissed if I see players like Mason Plumlee and Derrick White out there in Tokyo"
"&gt; As it is, you have an aging team who‚Äôs tried to compete for the last four years, and the best they could manage was the 7 seed  This is the youngest roster Pop has ever coached.  We've been rebuilding in place since our franchise player forced his way out, and are plenty happy with how we've drafted and developed players while actually trying to win games.  It's also misleading to ignore how much more difficult it is to advance up the board in the West.  &gt; We drafted an all-star, two very good players, and a number of role players and got to watch them grow.  A little reductive to called Luka Donƒçiƒá an All Star, honestly.  But seriously, I really do enjoy watching Young play and think he's got clear comparisons to Steve Nash.  It's just bizarre to me that Hawks fans insist on pointing out that the guy they essentially drafted 3rd overall is better than the 29th pick we found at a culinary school.  It's not like Pels fans need to remind everyone that Zion is, in fact, better than Luka Samaniƒá.  &gt; So I‚Äôd say Hawks fans are happy w/ the result of the last four years. Can you say the same thing about the Spurs? You enjoy losing those 7 seeds that much?  I can't speak for them, but I somehow doubt the average Hawks fan has enjoyed watching Hawks basketball the past four seasons, if they bother tuning in at all.  Kudos to those who do, but I don't blame anyone for choosing to skip watching a bad team play meaningless games.  As for us, it's great watching our guys develop together and gain real experience in the playoffs.  Watching the steady trajectory of genuinely likable blue-collar guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Luka Samaniƒá, Lonnie Walker IV, Drew Eubanks, and Devin Vassell is a treat.  While I don't think anyone on our current roster can be the centerpiece of a championship roster, they absolutely have the chops to compliment that kind of player."
"I think the reason why Derozan has had the opportunity to showcase and develop his passing ability with the Spurs was because of the massive amount of injuries to their PG rotation during the beginning of the 2018-2019 season.  During that season Dejounte Murray was out with an ACL injury, and Derrick White was out with a foot injury.  That forced the Spurs to start the undrafted Bryn Forbes as their ""point guard"" alongside Derozan.  During that time the Spurs had no legitimate point guard, so Derozan took the PG responsibility and performed admirably.   Even Pop himself stated that he had no idea Derozan was that good of a passer until then.   So overall it's a complex situation of Derozan proving himself able to shoulder the playmaking responsibility and the Spurs starting to use that skill of his."
"Look, I think Trae is easily better than Derrick White. But advanced metrics are not a good way to judge defense. Everyone knows they suck. They're only useful combined with the eye test.  Anyone who's watched Derrick White will tell you he's a good defender. Anyone who has watched Trae Young will tell you he is not a good defender. Simple as that."
Derrick white lol
"That's interesting, it felt like we shot way less though not any better or worse than we usually do. We are one of the best shooting teams in the league and it felt like the Spurs were getting over the screen really effectively to limit guys like Gallo from getting open looks.   That said, while you guys were 13/40 Derrick White shooting out of his mind was supremely frustrating."
"Derrick white drove on Trae once, and Trae got away with a blocking foul, but after that y‚Äôall let us hide Trae in the corner on D"
Trae only wishes to be as good a derrick white one day
i mean derrick white turned into prime ray allen so give and take
Who would you rather have: Trae Young or Derrick White?
derrick white &gt; trae young
Derrick White is virtually the only reason we're still in it and I can't stress enough how much I love him
Derrick white definitely doesn‚Äôt usually play like thisüòÇ
Derrick White.
"They do. Derrick White is averaging over 1 block/game, in 28mpg.   It's because they count stripping the ball on the way up as a block instead of a steal. The funny thing is that FVV himself has said they should count as steals instead of blocks."
"Yeah he reminds me some of last years version of SGA. I think SGA now has gotten alot better but in terms of floaters, scoop shots, not being able to quite get enough separation to get to the rim, not being super athletic finishing at the rim, willing shooter at all 3 levels etc. SGA has a slow release which affects his catch and shoot 3 point attempts, in Haliburton's case he has more a line drive 3 point shot which can affect how often he can get it off vs taller defenders. As a passer he reminds me some of Derrick White, Haliburton's main passing value is on drives + manipulating and looking off defenders till the last second  Anthony Edwards I think the hope kind of has to be he's Donovan Mitchell with more strength when it comes to finishing at the rim while probably not being as good a catch and shoot 3 point shooter."
The Spurs might be about to do it again.  Dejounte Murray - 29th in 2016  Derrick White - 29th in 2017  Lonnie Walker - 18th in 2018  Luka Samanic - 19th in 2019  Keldon Johnson - 29th in 2019  Devin Vassell - 11th in 2020  All of which are really solid pieces. We're just lacking that franchise cornerstone at the moment so I hope one of these guys completely breaks out.
Oh yeah that‚Äôs derrick white
Derrick White
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."
"Don't I know it, man.   I have been a huge advocate for getting whatever we could for DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay and Patty Mills (and even, before the extension, Derrick White if it was enough value) and hitting the reset button.  This team stinks, none of the young guys have the ceiling to actually be *the guy* and we're either going to overpay aging players this summer to keep them around, or we're going to lose them for nothing because we wanted to go 37-35.  All because our coach is 72 years old and doesn't feel like resetting the roster."
In the bubble I thought Derrick White did a better job on Fox then Murray
"DeRozan got snubbed, but he is all star caliber. Spurs have a very balanced and talented young team right now and will make the playoffs. People used to say similar things about Kawhi when he was on the spurs. I'm not saying the spurs have another Kawhi, but they do have very promising talent in Keldon johnson, vassell, Lonnie walker, dejounte murray, derrick white... That defense...."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Bam Adebayo 3. Donovan Mitchell 4. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 5. John Collins 6. OG Anunoby 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Jarrett Allen 10. Derrick White
"Those are likely the consensus top 4. I‚Äôd also add Dejounte Murray, Gary Harris, Thybulle, Butler, PG, Kawhi, LeBron, Mikal Bridges, Derrick White and PBev. All of those guys aren‚Äôt as consistently solid, but for one game/possession I‚Äôd take all them over FVV for guard defense."
"Compare the Spurs record/roster with some of the other rosters in the league and it's undeniable Pop is the GOAT.   Spurs currently have a record of 23-20 with their main core being Demar, Dejounte (29th pick), Derrick White (29th pick) and Keldon Johnson (29th pick).    Compare that to the Celtics being 23-23 with a core of Tatum/Brown/Kemba/Smart.    Compare that to the Pelicans being 20-25 with a core of BI/Zion/Lonzo/Bledsoe.    Compare that to the Kings being 20-25 with a core of Barnes/Hield/Fox    Or Pacers being 20-23 with a core of Sabonis/Brogdon/Turner"
Derrick White was carving up that swiss cheese defense with his passing
&gt; maybe even Spurs  The spurs have barely any money on the books after this season lol. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray making about 30M is over half of our payroll next year
My defensive lineup:  PG: DJ Murray  SG: Derrick White  SF: Devin Vassell  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Jakob P√∂ltl
"I don't see how it matters if a player missed time due to covid or injuries. Teams like the warriors, blazers, and wolves have had awful injury luck this season. The mavs missed a ton of games due to covid, the spurs just played 5 games missing 4-5 players due to covid and Derrick White who most spurs fans thought would be our second best player has missed over half the season, Jaren Jackson hasn't played yet and Ja missed 7 games."
The fact that Draymond has two plays that can easily get him the #1 slot and there has to be clarification really is funny. Personally I like the one where Derrick White baited him into launching a neat half court shot that had no chance of going in.
Derrick White lol

"I don't know what that is where guys just aren't called fairly until they're an official star in the refs eyes. I see derrick White, DeJounte, and especially Keldon get smacked on the forearms and legitimately fouled and the refs swallow the whistle. meanwhile DeMar (who does set guys up for fouls extremely well to be fair) gets more star treatment since he got back in the spotlight. he was getting a ton of free throws in Toronto and he didn't magically get worse at basketball when he got traded.   when he first got to San Antonio his foul numbers went down and I heard people say it's because  he's falling off and all this dumb shit but his foul numbers went down because he was officiated differently. the last season and a half he's been awesome and a lot of that is because he started getting more respect from the refs. nothing really changed besides public perception.   people stopped shitting on him once he fixed his shot selection, but the finishing was always there. he's just being called differently. he was one of the league leaders in techs because he would always get mad about it and yell at the refs lol"
I'll take a Derrick White as well while we're at it
Derrick white has been the best player on the court this first half
This version of Derrick white who takes contested step back 3s is betterv
Didn't Derrick White drop like 35 or 36 on the nuggets a few seasons ago?
"Pop chose Derrick White over Trae and Kuzma, Bagley (missed cut at later point), and Plumlee over John Collins and Adabayo. They didn‚Äôt make sense at the time either."
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
Imagine inviting Derrick White and not Ja
"You guys can tell me if I‚Äôm being a homer here, but how are Derrick White, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard, and John Wall on this list and Ja Morant isn‚Äôt? How the fuck does that make sense?"
"No one really knows exactly because he technically withdrew himself from consideration shortly before the final cuts but it was heavily implied that pop wanted derrick white on the team instead despite reports of fox dominating in practice. When asked about it fox said ""thats for me to know, but im healthy"""
Derrick white got to that spot first and as long as derrick white's feet are set and he's relatively stationary it's a charge. But most block/charges are a judgement call. This one was pretty blatant.
Flagrant 1. Also Derrick white shot the free throws not Poeltl
Derrick White. LOL.
Derrick White got a friendly face
"I mean, I think most contenders would rather have Derrick White than Trae. That doesn't mean he's *better* but just that I think he fits into what you're trying to do on a title-winning team better than Trae (who is so ball-dominant and whose defense is really problematic)"
Jesus Christ. You must be one of those ‚ÄúDerrick White is better than Trae Young‚Äù truthers.
"Pretty sure Keldon is around the 4th option behind Demar, Dejounte, and Derrick White"
"Having Looney, an average bench player, be your best player in a 5 year stretch is horrible. McCaw and Bell suck and only seemed serviceable playing on the best team ever.  The Spurs had low draft picks on the same years and drafted Dejounte Murray and Derrick White with the 29th pick.  Warriors also passed on Lamelo when all the most respected draft experts had him number 1."
"It doesn't make sense on paper for the spurs at all. We already have Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Patty Mills, and DeMar DeRozan running the offense."
While Derrick White is a good and impactful player for us I would not put him higher than Jakob or Dejounte
Derrick White is legit
Damn. Now I know why Pop chose Derrick White over Trae.
"Love how you ignore that their second best player, Derrick White has been out for the rest of the season. Before going down, they were tending up and won 5 out of their last 7 games.   Also, Spurs had the toughest schedule to close the season out while the Mavs had one of the easiest.   So move on and enjoy your minute success. Tsk to me when Luka leads y‚Äôall to a title and stoops fighting with KP and your head coach."
It doesn't necessarily mean those things. This would be our rotation:  Murray / Mills / Jones  White / Vassell  Johnson / Walker  Robinson / Free Agent / Samanic  Poeltl / Free agent or Eubanks  No matter what we're overloaded at the 2 spot if you only want to play Vassell and Walker there because of Dejounte and Derrick. Vassell has to play 3 sometimes for the rotation to work.
"just playing a guy doesn't mean he just gets better...it's almost like the Spurs have a 20 year history of developing talent and have found better players at 29 (keldon, derrick white, dejounte) better than most teams draft in the lottery"
HOLY SHIT Derrick White!  Didn't know he was that fast.
yall missed derrick white tonight.
Derrick white is so underrated that he isn‚Äôt even on the underrated team
"Ironically he left because there were no minutes at PG, and the second he left Dejounte and Derrick White got hurt lol"
"Derrick White is, theoretically, a good 3 pt shooter."
Devin vassell‚Äôs gonna get 20-25 minutes probably since Derrick white is hurt
Our roster doesn't have anywhere near the basketball IQ those guys did and Derrick White who is our second best player is out
"Our serious chances at the playoffs ended we got screwed by covid and dropped two close games against OKC. I'm amazed we did as well as we did this season with Derrick White missing half the season, missing training camp, and having to come off an injury or covid 3 times."
"We have Derozen and a bunch of other G-League players, and still managed to be a fringe playoff team until Derrick White went down, he‚Äôs fine."
"It's not like Dejounte was purposely guarding Ingles, it was just what happened in transition or off switches. You would think an older forward like Ingles would use his size to deal with Dejounte's defense, but he was easily getting free lanes to the rim when Dejounte was guarding him.  Murray has definitely been better than White on defense this year but yeah I thought Derrick was better last year and think he will probably be better next year.  The main reason for our defense this year is because of Jakob. I think players will start respecting him more next year though and our defense will take a hit because of it."
KJ had a good start to the season but has trailed off as of late. He‚Äôs shooting the ball with a lot of confidence and goes to the rim with bad intentions (in a good way). He could be out of control at times but you can live with the aggressive that he shows.  Luka is showing flashes of what he can become... he‚Äôll have a few nice drives and dunks but isn‚Äôt really getting minutes to improve. Hopefully more with the injuries to Derrick White.
"If pop is coaching Derrick White is never a ""No""."
"If i wanted a word salad i would've asked something to Raptors fans.  ""If this happens and then that and this and that"". You couldn't name anyone at the beginning and then said Derrick White would have top 25 impact.   To outside readers: Let this show you how Spurs has no real future without a rebuild."
"This game was incredibly close when I kinda wasn't expecting it to be with no DeMar, Dejounte, Jakob, and not to mention Derrick White who I think is your best young player.  Pop is GOAT."
"We had 4 starters out. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, DeMar DeRozan, and Jakob Poeltl. I'd say they're our 4 most important players too"
DJ isn‚Äôt even our primary ball handler. It‚Äôs usually DeMarr or Derrick white with the starters.
They‚Äôre a lottery team with him and him leaving would open up lots of opportunity. Also Derrick White has missed half the season and was pretty inconsistent until recently
Don‚Äôt forget about Derrick white  Although he‚Äôs hurt now he‚Äôll be a beast
"Here are the Spurs 1st round picks in the past 5 years:  2016 - Dejounte Murray (29th)  2017 - Derrick White (29th)   2018 - Lonnie Walker (18th)   2019 - Luka Samanic (19th)  2019 - Keldon Johnson (29th)   2020 - Devin Vassell (11th)   All these guys listed above look like they can be legit rotation pieces at the minimum. Also, considering they‚Äôve only had one pick in the lottery, they‚Äôve drafted incredibly well relative to their position. I‚Äôd probably go Raptors, Spurs, Heat, Nuggets, &amp; Hornets in that order."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
Derrick White is gonna beat this
"Also Derrick White has a solid argument for this. He has struggled with injuries this season and is still averaging a block per game, more than Simmons and Green."
Derrick White. No one ever talks about him
"Derrick White missed training camp due to surgery on a toe, played one game and broke that toe, came back and got Covid, then came back started playing well and now he messed up his ankle. I thought this would be the season where he solidified himself as the spurs second best player and he's just been screwed by injuries all year."
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
Derrick White turned his ankle really bad and Popovich said after the game it looks awful he‚Äôs their 2nd most impactful player and their May schedule is hell so I could see em falling to 10
"[Immediately reminded me of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mp4z44/highlight_derozan_gives_the_spurs_the_lead_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), except luckily he made that one  Looks like the clip was top short but Derrick White was just as open as Patty is on this play the whole possession"
You really went to the Spurs and didn‚Äôt go with Lone Star DeMar OR Big Body for Keldon OR The Great Forehead for Derrick White???
"The 92-93 Nets were always my "" if everything broke right"" team Rafael Addison Kenny Anderson Sam Bowie Chucky Brown Maurice Cheeks Derrick Coleman Chris Dudley Tate George Dave Hoppen Bernard King Doug Lee Rick Mahorn Chris Morris Dan O'Sullivan Dra≈æen Petroviƒá  Rumeal Robinson Dwayne Schintzius Jayson Williams ( second degree murder Jay Will, not white chocolate Jay Will)"
Derrick White has this quirk where of he doesn't make one of his first two 3 point attempts you know he's shooting 1-10 from 3 that night
 I think he'd be great in Chicago. You guys would be a more natural fit for what he does best than what we need. I think people look at box score stats and discount how certain players fit with certain teams. Lonzo won't have anywhere near the same transition opportunities playing for us. In Chicago they can run lineups with White and get in transition for Lavine. We need a PG more on the mold of Lowry. A guy who can really create in the halfcourt. I mean look at how good we've been with 30 minutes of Derrick Rose.
"Yeah, Derrick White finally being healthy is part of why."
"Prime Steph, Prime Melo, Prime Derrick Rose, Vince Carter, White Chocolate, Prime Jason Kidd  That‚Äôs a good startb"
"Steph, Prime Melo, White Chocolate, prime Vince Carter, unironically LaMelo Ball, prime Derrick Rose"
I believe we held Booker to 13 points with Derrick White mainly guarding him.  But as we all know Spurs news is no news.

Derrick White.
Umm no lie that lineup barely plays together and they only played with that lineup while Derrick white was injured.  Were not better without derozan if I'm being honest. Suns just decided to shit the bricks against us.
We're already very young going into next season. Our oldest guy under contract will be Derrick White
Wasn't Derrick White luckily the only starter with it tho? Thought it was like Quindary Weatherspoon and pals
I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôve never seen Derrick white and Haley Joel osment in the same room

"Vuc and LaVine have played great in almost every one of their games. Neither of them are taking bad shots, both are creating for their team as best they can at sg and center. The problem is that no playoff team should have to decide whether to play satoransky or coby white as a starting point guard. The de facto and unquestioned starting small forward is literally a year one rookie who ian't even in contention for roy (no disrespect to pat will, he's a great rookie but it's odd they threw him in the deep end). Thad young has been playing worse since the deadline, and Lauri...well, I was ahocked that he got 4 rebounds tonight, and that should be done in sleep for a seven footer.  The main concern is that there are two all-stars but literally no other starter-level nba players on the team. Add in that both the stars are primarily offense generators, and you have a big hole at playmaking and defending. Literally putting anyone good like Derrick White or TJ McConnell or PJ Washington on the bulls would probably get them to a clear playoff spot. Just bad drafting from garpac over the last ten years coming back to bite them with bad depth."
That is skewed because he played more when derrick white was hurt. Then Walker. The past 10 games he barely plays outside garbage time. Maybe 5-8 spot minutes.
Not sure why Derrick White kicked it out for a 3 when they were only down one.
Derrick White
Derrick White has missed multiples stretches of games because of that. From what I've read it hurts a lot.
"It was 56, but that game was absolutely mental for both him and Derrick White. And we still Kept giving Demar the final shot even when he was ice cold"

"And all year there were posts asking ""Would you rather have Trae Young or Derrick White"", ""Would you rather have Trae Young or Lonzo"" and most people didn't pick trae. So, my point stands."
Derrick White. What a year
No one in this sub even talks about Derrick White lmao
"Look how far we've come man. Just last season it was Trae or Derrick White, Trae or Lonzo, etc."
I maybe sorta implied that Derrick White was perhaps a better basketball player than Trae Young...
DERRICK WHITE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK üòÇüòÇ
People on this sub thought Lu Dort and Derrick White were better than Trae. They still think Ja and Fox are better than him. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt watch games
"I'd have to agree. The number of good/solid players they've been able to draft at the end of the 1st has been insane.  Just the past 7 years they've drafted 5:  Kyle Anderson #30  Dejounte Murray #29  Derrick White #29  Lonnie Walker #18  Keldon Johnson #29  However, the Spurs also have an incredible coaching and development staff, and it would be hard to say how well these guys would have done in other places. Meanwhile, my franchise routinely blows top lottery picks on guys like Dunn and Culver."
"Man management - LP is a terrible man manager. Everyone of his players hated him. He lobbied to other coaches that Trae shouldn't make the all-star game. Told Trae to wait his turn when it comes to representing the U.S after Pop chose Derrick White over him. Publicly complained about how Trae draws fouls. It come out after his firing that Cam Reddish felt that he was being bullied by LP. John Collins asked for a bigger role in the offense and LP called him selfish. Players said he was unapproachable and regularly lobbied for change through his assistants.    Terrible rotations - For some reason he had a hard on for giving Bruno Fernando minutes even though everyone could see Bruno Fernando is a bonafide scrub and we have a Okongwu our 1st round pick who is 10x the player he is just sitting on the bench. Regularly ran out trash lineups for far too long. We'd be up big with 4 minutes left in the 3rd and down double digits with 8 minutes left in the 4th.    No schemes - He literally doesn't have an offensive or defensive scheme. His scheme was hope Trae puts up 40pts and 15asts.    Also Bogi's injury came back ahead of schedule after LP was fired. Take that for what you will. LP is a terrible coach and I hope any eastern team takes him and gives us free wins next season. We had 11 blown 4th quarter leads with LP and became the best 4th quarter team in the league with McMillan. LP doesn't know when to call timeouts, doesn't ever hold himself accountable and I genuinely can't think of one positive thing when it comes to LP's coaching."
I just don‚Äôt think Murray shoots well enough. Derrick White maybe but it‚Äôs just hard for guards to score that much with below average jump shots.
"fun fact: Derrick White is my grandmas cousins grandson, so I'm basically bff's with an nba player"
r/nba would still take Derrick White
"Amazing! I mean, I might be a homer lmao, but I love him so much, prolly because he's the first rookie I followed intensively. About his games skills I made a huge post in our Spurs post (sorry for the lil spam but I put so much effort on it) if you wanna look at it here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). TLDR: He made a HUGE step, his mid range shot is automatic, finish at the rim with ease, defense improved even more but he's still surrounder by bad defenders (Lonnie, DeMar) and this obviously makes him worse but next year it should be better without DeMar and with Derrick White; he still needs to work on his ability to space the florr and maybe take more efficient shots without forcing them. Anyway, in that post I linked you can find a more elaborated analysis, also about the Spurs situation in general if you wanna know more about us since you said you didn't get the chance to follow us. Anyway, what I like about him the most is his mentality. He grew up with literally nothing, on the streets and I think this made him stronger than ever, he wanna prove he is THAT dude, that he has value in this world. If you wanna know more there is a crazy interview with Chris  Haynes, the only big insider, other than Woj and Shams,you can trust about Spurs' news, where he  talks about his past, here's a [link](https://youtu.be/oyhVwXBwww4))."
"I do think Pop and the front office have a lot of influence on the Austin Spurs.   They run a very similar system, which is why so many Spurs players have grown up through though the GLeague and had successful careers (Ian Mahinmi, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Drew Eubanks, etc.)  Not at all trying to take anything away from Snyder. He is a great coach and has shown it this year. He paved his own path, and deserves all the respect."
"Nah man, Derrick White is definitely better than DeMar DeRozan because his +/- is higher."
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"I'm a Spurs fan too, but I'm not ashamed to admit Jokic is my favorite players. Followed closely by Derrick White."
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
Derrick White made it over Bam and Trae young dude. Pop was showing favoritism
Derrick White
"I know I‚Äôm forgetting guys from further back, but off the top of my head Bryn Forbes, Bertans, Danny Green, and Cory Joseph come to mind. Jonathan Simmons was a really cool story. I know Spurs were the first to bring Boban to the league from Europe. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray don‚Äôt fit the criteria but as far as development goes they seem to be on a good trajectory so far. And in addition to Manu I do think TP and Kawhi are major scouting and development success stories.  I think the main thing is that they haven‚Äôt had a lottery pick in a long time, but stayed dominant by scouting and forming high-caliber role players and even stars. I‚Äôm not sure that Manu, TP, and Kawhi get to be among the very best players in the league if not for playing with the Spurs."
Derrick White plays defense really well. International games typically have a very different pace of play and standard of officiation. It's not the insult you think it is.
"I don't think the spurs would trade White or Murray. Pop said like over a year ago that he's the most important player on the team and Dejounte is the leader of the lockerroom and has improved substantially every healthy offseason he's had. They would rather gamble in free agency than give up Derrick or Dejounte to get Kemba imo.  I was imagining more like the spurs would take Kemba's contract for no salary but since the celtics are so far over the cap right now, that doesn't make much sense for them."
"&gt; Dallas will keep developing players in Carlisles system and next to the Spurs it‚Äôs about a stable an environment as there is in the NBA  I'm not sure what you meant exactly, but the Dallas FO is much worse than the Spurs FO. Dallas obviously got Luka, but they got rid of Seth Curry. Gave Porzingis 100M contract. Got Josh richardson who sucks. Got JJ who didn't play.   Spurs have been muhc better at finding diamonds in the rough with Keldon, DJM, Derrick white, etc. I'm not sure if Dallas has really been that ""stable"" , but I do agree Carlisle is a great coach"
Well that means losing either Derrick White or Dejounte Murray depending on who you ask assuming you're not including free agents. I'd say no considering both of them make about half what Porzingis does. Dejounte is the clear leader of the spurs locker room and the front office loves him. Derrick is a very good player who every team would want. His only problem is staying healthy. Porzingis has easily the highest potential of these guys but that contract plus his health is risky.
Man I really hope Trae can beat out Derrick white for a.spot.
Ooh that would be legit aaaaaand Derrick White made the team over Trae üò≠
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
I'm so stupid. I can't believe I forgot Fox. John Wall and Derrick White being in the pool but not Ja and Fox is wild.
It's ok. Derrick White gonna take us to the promised land
Well when Pop actively picked Derrick White over Fox and Trae I'm not sure he really gets to complain about not having the best talent.  He shouldn't be absolved from the FIBA debacle and certainly shouldn't if we don't win gold this summer.
Will they take Derrick fucking White over Fox again like last time over pure nepotism?
"Derrick White being on that team was absurd. He's gotten better, no doubt, but after the 2018-2019 season, there was no reason he should have sniffed that roster."
"DoesNot matter, Pop will take dejounte Murray and Derrick white over everyone"
Give us Poeltl and Derrick White and we have a deal :)
Imagine picking Derrick White over Trae Young. Trae would have solved so many problems on that 2019 team.
Would you guys still take Derrick white over Trae young?
"Trae, Shamet and Derrick White are fucking triplets wtf"
"I mean i think Pop did an amazing job with this years Spurs. The top 5 minutes played on the Spurs were Dejounte Murray, Derozan, Keldon Johnson, Poetl, and Patty Mills.   They still got the 10th seed and for the better part of the season were in the 8th seed ahead of GS until Covid hit them and they lost Derrick White for the season after he only played 30ish games.   1) DJM - elite defensive player with no consistent outside shot  2) Derozan - sucks on defense, has no outside shot   3) Keldon Johnson - effecxtively a rookie with no outside shot   4) Poetl - good on defense, no offensive game outside of rolling to the baskett   5) Mills - career 6th man   He still took this team to a record better than the Pelicans with BI/Zion, Kings with Fox, Hield, Barnes, Haliburton, and was close to the Warriors who had an MVP candidate, Celtics who had Jaylen/Jayson, etc."
"it shows how errors can compound and absolutely torpedo team building for sure.  They had a rough 2016 offseason, so then Olshey doesn't have roster spots for multiple draft picks in the 2017 draft, so he trades up to take a home-run swing on Collins.  Just imagine Derrick White in a back-court with Dame &amp; CJ instead of Biggie Swanigan, he's exactly the kind of guard they need.    2018 was also sneaky bad because instead of taking Simons, another home run swing that fit the Zach Collins timeline instead of the Dame &amp; CJ timeline, they could have drafted Jalen Brunson (playing crunchtime for Dallas and was in the 6MOTY convo this year) or they could have simply taken GTJ in the first, thereby giving the team another year of cheap control over his rights, which would've been critical for a super capped out team that needed bargain production!  If they'd just drafted GTJ over Simons, he'd still be on the team, but instead they had to trade him because he got too expensive too quickly and now Simons took so long to develop they have to make a decision on him without a ton of data to go off of.  I give him a pass on Nas Little in 2019, that late in the 1st it's tough to identify talent and he's actually shown some good flashes of potential as a piece they can use.  I've said it before &amp; will say it again, no coach in history could get passable defense out of a Simons/Melo/Kanter 2nd unit, that's on Neil much more than it is on Stotts."
"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
"Derrick White. If he can stay healthy, he will definitely be the best spurs player next year I think. There's an argument he was more important to the team than DeRozan this year."
Pierce told them all the vote for Derrick White instead. Why he hated Trae so much I'll never understand.
Serious question  OP do you really think anyone gives a fuck about the Olympics?   There is such a lack of players who give a fuck that the 2019 team included:  Harrison Barnes Mason Plumlee Brook Lopez Derrick White and Marcus Smart
"US team that was led by Kemba and had Harrison Barnes, Plumlee, and Derrick White on the roster"
This sub constantly overrates defense. Like how there was that whole thing about how people would rather have Derrick white than Trae bc he can get 1 more stop every 100 possessions or something stupid. Offense always outweighs defense because you can‚Äôt stop the best players in the league
Lol he looks like Derrick White tho bro only with smaller forehead
I love Derrick White but holy shit that‚Äôs actually wild lmfao
Derrick White
Truth. Derrick White has a better POPOVICHCOMMAGREGG and NEPHEW rating
Woah lets calm down now. Trae Young isnt even an all-star.  Infact I'd rather have Derrick White
Yeah but would you rather have him or Derrick White?
"For the future of the Knicks, it's best they look at a younger guy to be their starter. Not too many teams in the NBA will need a starting PG next year.  Hawks have Young, Wizards have Westbrook, Heat COULD use him over Dragic/Nunn, Hornets have Ball, Magic have Fultz/Anthony, Raptors have Lowry/VanVleet, Nets have Irving/Harden, Knicks probably don't have anyone else, Sixers have Simmons, Celtics have Walker(!), Pacers have Brogdon, Bucks have Holiday, Bulls could definitely welcome a return for Derrick, Pistons have Hayes, Cavs have Garland, Grizzlies have Morant, Pelicans need a new PG if they don't want to stick with Ball (could help lead that team to the playoffs with Ingram and Williamson), Spurs have Murray/White, Mavs have Doncic, Rockets have Wall (for the time being), Suns have Paul, Clippers might could get him, Lakers have Schroder/LePointForward, Warriors have Curry, Kings have Fox, Blazers have Lillard, Jazz have Conley, Nuggets have Murray, Thunder have Gilgeous-Alexander and the Wolves have Rubio/Russell.  Would really be interested in seeing if he wants to come back home to Chicago, stay with Thibs, or go ring chasing with the Clippers."
Probably Derrick White after DD and DJM
Or Derrick White?
"Let's be honest though, who would you rather have- Trae or Derrick White?"
"I think that would be a great deal for the Mavs.  I also think Poeltl and Derrick White would be cool, or if the Pacers want to change it up I think Myles Turner would be a great fit."

"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
"when you don't have top tier talent coaching matters a lot. I think the Kings and Pelicans have way more talent than the Spurs, but both were quite a bit behind the Spurs until Spurs got covid /lost derrick white."
Byron Mullens. Derrick Brown. DeSagana Diop. Cory Higgins. Jamario Moon. DJ White  all in 1 fucking roster
Forbes had some really good games in the Nuggs - Spurs series a couple years back. He and Derrick White both. I mean this is pretty damning evidence of how poorly the Heat played but give my dude some credit cause he ain't a scrub.
"they do it all the time. it's fucking insufferable. just constant hating on every player for any reason.  Patty, Marco, Bryn, LaMarcus, DeMar, Rudy, Dejounte and Derrick have all been periodically scapegoated over the past four seasons by the Spurs fanbase. (usually for the dumbest reasons).  this season was particularly bad with so much incessant whining. we're not playing that well this year? get rid of LaMarcus! he's already gone? Trade Derrick White! Oh he's injured? Patty and Rudy suck! wait they're playing well now? we need to get rid of DeMar!"
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
"You think derrick white, Keldon Johnson and a meh center is worth Kawhi, and you‚Äôre gonna talk about bad takes?"
"I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again;  Derrick Rose is legitimately the sole reason why I like basketball. An inner-city white kid from Chicago who had no interest in hooping. From day one, his style and quiet, humble demeanor appealed to many more than just me I‚Äôm sure.   Without question my favorite athlete of all time."
"We had Bryn Forbes last year, Davis Bertans, Kawhi, Danny Green, a couple years before that.  Derrick White has upped his 3pa rate, but was hurt most of the season. We still have Patty and Rudy Gay shot more 3s this year.  Pop coaches to his players strengths and by the end of the year our 2 best players in DeMar and DJ both don't shoot many 3s. Remember we started the year with LMA who had started shooting 3s a little into the 19-20 season."
"No, it‚Äôs really just circumstance. We definitely haven‚Äôt been avoiding shooters, that‚Äôs just dumb.  Patty launches 3s whenever he can, and Bertans, Forbes, and Bellenelli did the same. The issue with the latter 3 was they didn‚Äôt help us defensively at all, and even though our current team is bad at shooting I prefer this team being athletic and aggressive than the past few seasons where bertans, Forbes and Marco could shoot but killed us defensively.  Our problem is we just haven‚Äôt gotten any good 3 and at least average D guys. That‚Äôs why Derrick White is so important for us, he slumped when he initially came back from injury this year but he‚Äôs our only guy rn who can shoot and defend at a high level. I think Murray can improve as a shooter seeing as how much he improved his midrange game, and he‚Äôs finally got a fully healthy offseason to work with."
"Assuming all the vets are gone, Derrick White, assuming he stays healthy (tough) will average 22+ppg."
"Did you even see us play? We had a positive record until COVID derailed us and we had to play without rest. We also lost Derrick White for a good chunk  of the season which only made it worst. 2-10 without him. Our rough schedule was the final nail in the coffin.   &gt;  You have talk about LeBron despite him having nothing to do with anything.  You mentioned ""We are good now"", as if Lebron James signing with your team despite the shit show that your FO had for the past years wasn't a good reason for that. LA is good now in huge part because of Bron and no one can deny that."
Probably Derrick White
Heck yeah if only y‚Äôall had Derrick White available! But y‚Äôall might‚Äôve saved yourselves from an angry Curry hailstorm of 3‚Äôs as well next game. That grizz/warriors rematch is gonna be crazy
I really don't think it's hating. DeMar's teams have been better with him on the bench literally every year of his career except one. He's a talented guy but his bad defense and lack of a 3 pt shot limit his game a ton.  Front offices agree with me too. No way DeMar comes back to the spurs last year if he was offered 27M/year plus long term. Even Pop said that Derrick White was the most important player on the spurs over a year ago. DeMar just isn't that great of a player.
"Lost Derrick white mid season, everyone got corona which fucked us up good. Doesn‚Äôt matter anyways, Spurs will get top 5 in the lottery and draft a superstar. Come back when THAT happens"
"Yep.  Best player on a team that missed the playoffs for the first time in 20+ years.  Also, Derrick White was our best player in the Denver series."
"I think this end of the season for sure means that Derozan ain't coming back. Dude is the best as a second best player in a team. Missing Derrick White definitely hurt but at least our guys fought till the end. However, it was a terrible performance. Hopefully something good happens in the offseason."
"Rudy gay really tried to carry though, respect man. Hopefully your young players make a leap next year and Derrick white is healthy again"
"Dude had two picks in the lottery since 1997. One turned into a two-time DPOY, two-time Finals MVP and top five player. The other is a rookie showing extreme promise. He also found Keldon in the second round, Derrick White and DJ at the end of the first. He‚Äôs great."
our only other shooter (Derrick White) was injured pretty much all season  Vassell is a good shooter but hes a rookie and just lacks experience/mentality and Lonnie is a good shooter but is extremely inconsistent
"Reason Derrick White is important, is because he plays with a lot of energy and we always need that."
Derrick White is *that* important to the Spurs offence?
this mfer derrick white munching on girl scout cookies
"Lol, would have been closer with Derrick White"
We started the season without Derrick White and that was maybe our best run (and when we beat Memphis).  It‚Äôs a toss-up.
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
I think Memphis takes it. Spurs look bad without Derrick White.
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Poeltl, Keldon, Lonnie Walker, Vasell, Samanic and because we need an eighth player Drew Eubanks, but that's literally everyone we have under contract for next season  Edit: Swap Drewbanks with Tre Jones, forgot about him"
"It‚Äôs not about the scoreboard, it‚Äôs about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It‚Äôs pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."
"never forget the ""Derrick White is better than Trae"" takes"
"i mean they do have a player higher than 82 lol (derozan) , but they fell apart because of covid and injuries (derrick white out half the year)"
I have no clue what guys like Derrick White and Dejounte Murray have to do with my comment
"derrick White got a 20 million dollar contract and is our best two way player when healthy and DeJounte is one of the best two way pgs in the NBA, and Keldon Johnson went like 5 or 6 in John Hollinger a redraft for his year. they're certainly lottery picks, if not in the top half in those years."
Derrick White
"Derrick ""better than Trae Young"" White"
Derrick white is getting ready as we speak
"Pop does play favorites though, and a great game by Keldon doesn‚Äôt change that. There were still plenty of better players he could have chosen, and it‚Äôs not like this is the first time Pop‚Äôs done this. Remember when he chose Derrick White over Trae and Fox? People on this sub even defended his decision then just like they are now, despite it being just a hilariously terrible decision at the time."
Derrick White come on down!
Spurs have several candidates for MIP if Derozan is gone. I think Derrick White actually has the best shot at it
Spurs fans are hilarious. First derrick white now Keldon Johnson are better than trae lmao
Derrick White
"Derrick White was definitely the wrong pick. If he picked Dejounte Murray, that's a solid choice instead of Fox."
melo is just as washed as love is.     &gt;  pop did it so that he could give him olympics experience to improve his spurs team.     lol derrick white isnt as bad as you think he is. pop may be playing favorites but he isnt treating the olympics like the summer league just to get white some xp
"Can you point me to some articles about Fox‚Äôs performances from those camps? Not attacking, sincerely asking‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt following camp too closely at the time, but from what I do remember reading, Derrick was also playing really well in the scrimmages and practices.   I will absolutely concede that Fox is a more game-changing talent right now and would rather have him on Team USA (and I love Derrick), but I don‚Äôt remember ever reading about White getting outplayed by Fox during that camp, and reading about Derrick White, good or bad, was the only thing that interested me about Team USA in 2019."
"I definitely see where the favoritism takes are coming from. I get that.   But as a Spurs-homer, Derrick white is a baller.  There were a ton of articles about him impressing the coaching staff during the FIBA practices, and some coaches saying he was one of the best players on the team. Dudes for real if he can stay healthy.    Even as a spurs homer, and Keldon-stan, I wouldn‚Äôt have chosen him for the Olympic team. I‚Äôm psyched as hell though, keldon is awesome."
"Without Derrick White, we held him to under 25 pts in the play in. Valenciunas Brooks and the refs are who really beat us. If Ja took those last shots Rudy took, he would‚Äôve actually gotten those calls and gone to the line. If Rudy was treated fairly, he would‚Äôve been able to take us into overtime.  (Over his Spurs tenure, Rudy has gotten flagrant fouls for what memphis ended up getting away with&amp; those few times Rudy‚Äôs gotten these flagrants were all accidents)    That play-in game was 100% swung in Memphis‚Äôs favor, but still Brooks and Valenciunas were the MVPs vs Ja in that game. Refs couldn‚Äôt even get Ja personally over that hill‚Ä¶   There are definitely better guards out there and thats just an objective fact. Maybe he just hasn‚Äôt peaked yet, but ATM he isn‚Äôt a superstar"
"IDK, we've been seeing a lot of Pop hires on these teams. Derrick White and Keldon Johnson don't really have a place on these teams.   It looks like Pop is giving his own guys a leg up at the expense of the roster."
"Hawks and Kings fans still mad about Derrick White, eh? I guess they got nothing better to do."
Don't forget Derrick white also
is your name derrick white?
He did the same shit with Derrick white over d fox
"No excuse for Derrick over Fox either, even though White was reportedly performing well in scrimmages. I love Derrick but I‚Äôd take Fox and Young over him 100% of the time."
"What are you talking about?  The pool play is basically a round robin tourney.  Their pool has France (a few NBA players headlined by Gobert but after that, not much), Czech Republic that got in by the skin of their teeth against Canada missing Shai and Murray, and Iran.  If they have that day, it has to be absolutely apocalyptic.  In reference to the FIBA WC team, you cannot seriously compare a Derrick White to Damian Lillard or a Joe Harris to Kevin Durant.  For the rest of the world, they're still massively behind.  Sure they lost to Nigeria and Australia but they're more than likely will adjust and be better."
"Yeah, there is definitely more to this story than just what‚Äôs happening here.   I remember a few statements that were made in 2019 about Popps wanting to reward guys that trained with team USA for FIBA.   Young is a super confident player who has basically always played like he is the best player on the court. With that mindset things like playing for the USA select team was something he probably thought was under him when someone like Popps would view it as a stepping stone to the national team.   Realistically there was no excuse for Derrick White over Trae Young in 2019 too."
Atleast they didn‚Äôt pick Derrick White &amp; Miles Plumlee over Bam again üòÜ. Idiots
That Donte Divincenzo (skip Bayless) and Derrick White (r/Spurs) were better than Trae Young
"Pop choosing his own player in Keldon Johnson over other, better young American guards like Trae Young, De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, or even LaMelo Ball is just laughable. Not that I'm surprised after Pop chose Derrick fucking White over Fox for the terrible 2019 FIBA team lol what a joke."
Or Derrick White
"Its not terrible tbh, but too mediocre to win a championship.  The 3 big issues are the 2016 offseason, the 2017 draft, and the general inability to bring in a starting-worthy small forward.    2016- tons of money thrown at Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner, which was a complete waste.  2017 draft- the bigger issue isn't that he drafted Collins, but that he traded the 15 and the 20 to get him at 10.  It wasn't even clear that we needed to trade up for him.  If you also look at who else was available, whether at 10, 15, or 20, the potential Portland team is just so much better.  Also, at 26 he took Swanigan.  3 of the next 4 picks were White, Kuzma, and Hart.  This Portland team *could* have had Mitchell or Bam, or John Collins AND OG/Jerrett Allen AND Derrick White.  Instead we've got broken Zach Collins and the ghost of Swanigan.  Forwards- Since Batum and LMA left, the ONLY starter quality forward we've had is RoCo.  We've had solid bench-quality forwards like Harkless, Aminu, DJJ, and Melo, but we've never had a real 5 man lineup."
damn lebron isn‚Äôt playing this year because derrick white was picked over fox? everything makes so much sense now
Fox wouldn't have played 3 minutes a game he could have played like 20 on that team that's the difference between him and Derrick White lmao
&gt;Terrible end to a great career.  Lmao butthurt about derrick white over trae young. Just say  ur bias
We're talking about a guy who chose derrick white over Trae Young and Dearron Fox lol
"Dude picked Derrick White and Plumlee, come on man. I know he's your coach, but you can't actually defend that shit lol."
Lol I‚Äôm not even saying Derrick White is better.  I‚Äôm saying people are way overreacting about the decision between players who are gonna play like maybe 3 mins/game.
They are pros. They can play in a week. That spot is a bench warmer spot anyway so it should go to a good young talent like trae so he can learn the ropes. Keldon Johnson shouldn‚Äôt have been picked over trae young in any universe. This is pop picking Derrick fucking white over fox last year all over again. He has A Track recoord of this shit
"Imagine willing to die on the hill of ""Derrick White is better for Team USA than DeAaron Fox"".  Oh wait it's another defensive Spurs fan lmfao."
I'd love Derrick White again for memes sake
Yea Derrick white was the problem with 2019.. lol you can‚Äôt tell me who‚Äôs a better choice but somehow that makes KJ inferior to your non choice lol
It's the Derrick White selection all over again
Yeah this is clearly favoritism. And I mean yeah he provides defense i guess but they need a playmaker too. Even if you gonna pick a Spurs player get Derrick White or Dejounte Murray then
"But when ~~the World~~ the US needed him most, Colangelo decided to leave him off the roster for Derrick White."
"&gt; I think the general consensus that I saw on here was that Love was on the team for a veteran presence, in terms of international play  Colangelo fked over Melo the most decorated Olympian in US Basketball history by refusing even to allow him to practice with guys on the scrub FIBA team. While dudes playing in Turkey were on the select team. So I don't really buy that narrative too much. Dude definitely plays favorites, Popn as well, Derrick White had no business being on that team, pop did it so that he could give him olympics experience to improve his spurs team."
Of course Keldon got selected. Coming from the same Pop who elected to go with Derrick fucking White over DeAaron Fox in 2019 we now have another Spurs goat on team USA.
Pop needs to step down ASAP.  I‚Äôve already said it previously but my least favorite thing about Team USA is the blacklisting they get off on doing to young players.  Fox is a guy that would be perfect for this team and I bet you their rationale for not taking Fox is him leaving FIBA training camp early even though the only reason he did that was because they already told him they would take DERRICK WHITE OVER HIM ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I‚Äôm still mad
OH FOR FUCKS SAKE. DERRICK WHITE WASN‚ÄôT AVAILABLE?
"&gt; They have two spots and need a point guard and rim protection  You're right, let's call Derrick White and Drew Eubanks"
"Didn't Trae say don't call me now? Or was that Ja? Regardless there are two more spots open, and he's not calling Derrick White again"
Go on Pop pick Derrick White again
Obviously Derrick white and Keldon Johnson are better than anyone Pop could use as replacements
"Uh, that's MLB celebrity softball game MVP Derrick White to you, buddy"
What system do you truly need when your 8th player is better than their #1.   Why the hell are Derrick White and Keldon Johnson even near a Team USA practice let alone the rosters.
Time to pickup Derrick white  a.and piss off all the trae young fans lol
Well the original question is why Keldon Johnson and Derrick white over Trae and Ja and that was your response‚Ä¶.ü§îü§î
"The best players never go out for FIBA (no one in the USA really follows it) so it's actually rare we overcome the lack of team chemistry and win there.      If you go back and swap out Joe Harris for KD, Derrick White for Dame, a sophomore Donovan Mitchell for Devin Booker and Harrison Barnes for Draymond Green do you still think we lose in FIBA? I don't."
"Pretty sure Trae wanted to be in the World cup roster as well, Pop just chose Derrick White over him (lol)"
Ew Derrick White
"lol, they were going to cut him in favor of Derrick White. He just saw the writing on the wall and dipped before they could do so. And then the team went on to get like 8th place. If he's blacklisted for that, Team USA is fuckin' braindead."
"According to your senile coach: Derrick ""2019 World Cup 9th Place"" White &gt; DeAaron Fox as well."
"To be fair in this case, he did apply for the world cup but got rejected for Derrick White lol"
How does team USA include Derrick White and Keldon Johnson over Ja Morant and Trae Young?
"Just bring Derrick ""2019 goat"" White and Dejunte Murray and all will be saved!"
"lol this is par for the course for Team USA. I remember a few years back, Pops decided he wanted Derrick White over DeAaron Fox. It was that moment I knew how fucked things were."
Derrick white &gt; trae young
It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not as good as Derrick White.
As he should. Derrick white over fox is laughable and biased
Fox was destroying everyone in practice on the world cup team. Pop snubbed him to keep derrick white
what does derrick white bring that trae young wouldn't? defense I guess
BAH GAWD THAT'S DERRICK WHITE
And Derrick White because why not
"Pop needs to fucking chill, Derrick White over Trae was already a crime when we desperately needs playmaker. Now you‚Äôre adding another shooting option? Put Coach K on the line right now."
"You joke, but Derrick white would be a great addition to this team as a role player defensive guard who can create for others and make open threes.   He's coming off an injury so we don't have to worry about that"
"LP was notoriously shitty to Trae as the Hawks HC, he even pushed for him not being voted to the all star team by coaches this year.   Pop no real evidence, outside of for the qualifiers that America sucked ass in Pop went with Derrick White over Trae Young. But I sorta get that. Trae was going into his second season and White was a spur. But it looks terrible now when passing and scoring was a huge issue with that team leading to the worse finish for America."
"It's probably closer to 8-12 mill over the life of the contract, and considering Derrick White is supposedly on the trading block, I don't find it that hard to believe. He's already 27."
Yet Derrick White did. He did that out of spite of him leaving in 2019 due to injury.
So you‚Äôd rather have maybe 5 mil in cap space than Derrick White? Nah.
where did that Derrick White team place again
"""I hear Derrick White is available."" - Pop probably"
"&gt;Why would the Spurs agree to give up assets in a sign and trade for him if they have space to sign him to a max  So that they can get him on less than a max and the asset they give up might be somebody they don't mind losing, a la Derrick White.   &gt;Why would Collins accept a deal for less than the max if he is capable of getting the max somewhere else  Because the Spurs might be the only team that would've given him a max, but they no longer have a reason to because of the S&amp;T."
I wouldn‚Äôt blame Trae for turning team USA down Pop picked his guy Derrick White over him and it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if that pissed him off and he doesn‚Äôt wanna play this time around
"They should pick a role player who worked with the coaching staff last season so it's an easier transition: Eric Gordon, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, or Malcolm Brogdon."
"Reported by Zach Harper  &gt; ""While it seems unlikely the Spurs would move their pick, keep an eye on them being active with the trade machine around the draft. The Spurs have to figure out where they want to be as a franchise and what their plan is moving forward. They‚Äôre kind of stuck in the middle right now. Murray and Derrick White could both be gettable, according to league sources."""
Where is 9th place 2019 World Cup legend Derrick White at when we need him?!?!?!
My Cousins best friend's played college b-ball with Derrick White
"No. You said ""Derrick White is going to win MVP"", but it's okay it takes time to get used to it"
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team‚Äôs best player is Kevin Durant."
"imo let the old vets walk except for rudy gay, yes the spurs should move on from patty mills as well even if he's a spurs legend. and don't trade either derrick white or dejounte murray nor any of the young guys unless they're getting a star in return."
"Spurs get:   * 3rd overall pick  * 2023 1st, top-10 protected  * Kevin Love  Cavaliers get:   * Dejounte Murray  * Derrick White  * 12th overall pick   This is the sort of deal that might entice the Cavs to trade their pick. They get a very good young PG, a solid SG, and a low lotto pick for the crown jewel of the trade (3rd overall), another, protected 1st, and a salary dump (Love). Dejounte pairs well with Darius and White would be a great third guard for them. Plus, they can still get someone promising with the 12th pick. A protected 1st isn't much to dump Love and balance the deal, either.  Spurs do it to get a top tier prospect as well as a veteran who pairs well next to Poeltl. They're guaranteed one of Green/Mobley/Suggs with that pick. Probably either Mobley or Suggs, since top two looks to be Cade and Green. They get a prospect who can be their centerpiece for the future. They also get another first to help them down the line.   Use their cap space wisely on a PG this offseason and some vets for the bench, and they'll still be competitive next season. Something like Dinwiddie or Scroeder /Vassell/Keldon/Love/Poeltl with Patty, (Porter Jr?), Mobley as your first guys off the bench. Maybe they are able to sign two starters, so they also get a SG or SF. Maybe Oladipo or Josh Richardson would come for an overpay."
Derrick white and Reggie Jackson 2 man team
"We will give you DeRozan and Murray for him along with a pick. Roll with Derrick White at the 2, and Simmons at the 1. Then pull a real boss move and sign Trez or Millsap."
Nah gotta make room for Derrick White
"All of it. He‚Äôs coming off one of the most embarrassing coaching performances ever in the World Cup. Like there‚Äôs pattern. He just won‚Äôt do obvious stuff, when it comes to roster selection or rotations. It‚Äôs hard to tell if they‚Äôre even running a real offense, it‚Äôs like a all star game.  I used to really fuck with pop and I was a big Spurs fan. I really don‚Äôt like him at all anymore, I think he‚Äôs an arrogant pos, it‚Äôs always excuses with him, never takes any accountability. We lost the World Cup because he benched all the centers against France  and tried to play small against gobert with Middleton at center and gobert just dominated both ends the whole game. France didn‚Äôt even end up making the final.  Watch he‚Äôll bury Bam even though he‚Äôs the most important player on the team. He cut Bam from the World Cup roster for plumlee, word out of camp was Bam one of the best players and shocker he broke out the next year and made a finals appearance. Also brought Derrick white and cut daron fox. Draymond and love are complete liabilities in international play for various reasons."
"Cause they didn‚Äôt want to give the ball up to Derrick White unfortunately, would have easily won it otherwise"
derrick white would be so dope lol doubt we get murray but i‚Äôd be geeked
"i would say he deserves a lot.  since taking the job as head coach for the US team the team has done fuck all.   it is night and day after coach K retired.  also last world cup he kept playing derrick white big minutes and now hes playing kelden johnson... he is playing dudes who dont deserve minutes because they play for the spurs?  what kind of unprofessional shit is that?!  id say give coach k 70% of the blame, 20% on colangelo and the assistant coaches for not giving any attention to defense, and 5% for tatum who seems to have started to believing his own hype and the rest of the payers get the last 5%"
"Would take him, Derrick White, or Dejountay Murray‚Ä¶"
ACtually a team with Derrick White as its best player should for sure win 60 games!
Yea hate to be a homer here but Pop and LP deserve every heaping pile of shit if this thing goes up in flames because they have no playmaker and they left Trae Young out over Derrick fucking White out of some sort of petty bullshit
Just like Derrick White in 2019. Pop needs to be fired as the coach.
"Interesting, any guesses on who's gonna step up? Derrick White? Keldon on his current trajectory might fall into it naturally. Wait, is Rudy also a FA?"
This team really needs a playmaking guard. I bet you still woulda rather have derrick white over trae lmao pop
"Wow Derrick Fucking White being a starter playing 27mpg on a team that got bounced in the first round. What an amazing achievement. Must be a beast of a player, oh wait."
I'm laugh commenting with y'all spurs stans acting like Pop picking Derrick fucking White over Fox was justifiable. 2019 there was a guard shortage as Lowry got hurt so save your excuse.
"Derrick White booming on Paul Millsap, and Malcolm Brogdon killing Bron and Kyrie in the same game is up there for sure üòÇüòÇ"
"Darius garland, kevin porter, keldon johnson, derrick white, and jordan poole seem like good bets maybe dejounte"
"Derrick White   John Wall   Malik Monk  Manu Ginobili   Tim Duncan   Super small ball I guess lmfao, ima Kentucky fan hence Monk and Wall"
"Just peeked at the Spurs roster - remembering they lost DeRozan (their leading scorer), Patty Mills &amp; Rudy Gay (arguably their two best guys off the bench) - and it's looking a little dire. Dejounte Murray &amp; Doug McDermott are probably their top two scorers this season - maybe Derrick White too? Spurs were last in 3pt shots made &amp; attempted per game &amp; 24th in 3pt%. ""McBuckets"" will help with that, but I think at this point the Spurs might be best just to Choke for Chet (Holmgren).  Orlando seems to have a slew of players who aren't really starter material yet but someone's gonna have to do it. Where's their offense coming from, guys who can't stay healthy?"
Derrick White?
You know your franchise is fucked when Derrick White is your best player lmao
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"
"we ain't tanking. we just parted away with our three vets in rudy, demar, patty that sadly where damaging more than helping us, stats speak. with damaging i just mean they were kinda ballhoggin. we have added doug that would substite demar, luka samanic will substite rudy, tre jones will substite patty mills. all our young guys gained another year of improvements. we get derrick white back, arguably our best player and definitely our most complete and experienced one. we get guys like collins and landale that can be solid pickups. so we gain ton of shooting, easily our biggest problem last year. and this to exclude thaddeus youngn who i think we will deal before the season starts for picks and maybe a young guy. and we still have pop.  i mean, i doubt we will be much worse as everyone predicts. let's see."
I think when everybody's healthy Derrick White is our most impactful/important player on both ends and I think  I'd go Isaac if he's healthy or Suggs
"so in conclusion (Derrick white)spurs and (Johnathan Issac)Magic. thank you honestly with injuries and all forgot about Issac, and the spurs with DeRozan leaving Derrick white is the best player. Both teams have a lot of talent wouldn't be surprised if this changes"
Derrick White for us
Probably Derrick White or Dejounte Murray for the Spurs and either Suggs or Isaac for Orlando
Spurs is probably Derrick White and Magic is Isaac when he‚Äôs healthy.
"As a Spurs fan, Lonnie Walker is not a starter level player, not even close. He is not even starting for us, and our starter (Derrick White, who I love) is likely not even a top-15 SG."
"You‚Äôve got it all wrong. It‚Äôs Simmons, keldon Johnson, and poeltl. With Derrick white as the starting pg. that‚Äôs our big 3. They‚Äôre counting on keldon to turn into a star."
Ben is a negative on his contract. That's the my main reasoning. I'd much rather have derrick white over dejounte though if I had a choice between the spurs guards
"A healthy Derrick white is the key. Him and Dejountae together I‚Äôm pretty confident in, running the offense and can keep the offense just good enough to where the improved defense propels the spurs into decent success.   If Derrick white cannot stay healthy, I have no idea who can fill his role properly on the offensive side of the ball in terms of playmaking, 3 level shot creation, and running the offense, and the offense is gonna take a pretty big hit"
"Yeah Ben‚Äôs only 2 months older than Dejounte so it‚Äôs a lateral move in terms of their timeline. But I agree they prob aren‚Äôt serious enough about it to give up all their young players + picks and run Ben, Derrick White, and Poeltl as their big 3."
"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
I‚Äôm still waiting for Derrick White to become their next superstar.
Ya I did a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p5l7ch/how_good_has_your_team_been_at_beating_the_vegas/) a couple days ago. The Spurs over has hit 13 out of 16 times since 2005 and in the Popovich era they're 17-5.  They were on a 37 game win pace last year and that included a second half schedule where they lost Derrick White and played 40 games in 68 days never having consecutive days rest. I don't think we're winning 45 games this year but we should hit 30 pretty easily.
"1-3 - No 1 option on a winning team  4-10- Sporadic all star / high level 3rd option  10-14 - solid starter 15-60- You take what you get imo..gambles like poku doesn't matter much if they dont pan out but drafting older players like perhaps kispert this year, derrick white,brogdon desmond bane expectations will be of atleast a competent rotational piece with ceiling of an borderline allstar perhaps."
The two best players are clearly Derrick White and Dejounte Murray. No clue why he used Jakob Poeltl.
Dejounte Murray and Derrick White!
Derrick White and Chuma Okeke
Derrick White &gt; Trae Young üòè
Derrick White is such a high positive impact player I just want him to have the opportunity to prove himself over a full season with a steady role and a normally spaced offense.  20-7-5 with elite perimeter defense is reasonable IMO.
Healthy Derrick White adds as many wins as we lose from Demar.  We gonna lose more games but it will be because of inconsistent bench play with no Rudy/Patty
"Derrick white is very underrated, def agree on fox tho"
"Derrick White, Garland is a good shoutout.  I know White is older then the other San Antonio guys, but he's shown more flashes of shot creation, and with Derozan gone I think he could be the guy who's usage goes higher/benefits from having actual NBA spacing since he's already more advanced than the others as a driver."
Derrick White or JV
I‚Äôm a believer in your young guys but you don‚Äôt have much depth. If you guys win 40+ it means Derrick White (and/or Dejounte) is making the all star team.
Possibly add Derrick White and Derrick Rose
"I'll say it...I'm extremely disappointed with the Primo pick. I really wanted Sengun who is already looking like a stud.  The Spurs already have five young G/Fs in the pipeline with Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, and Tre Jones. We also brought back Bryn Forbes for some dumbass reason.  There is absolutely no reason why we should've used the #12 pick on a 18-year old guard who will probably need two years in GLeague to be NBA ready. He was projected to go late first or early second round. He would've been a great pick at 25...but 12!?  I can only trust that Pop and the front office sees something I don't...obviously they've found diamonds in the rough before. But we left a lot of talent on the board to reach for a player who doesn't really fit right now."
"Ezeli Was drafted in 2012. The peak of Mccaw and Bell was about 10 good games in their rookie seasons, both of them regresssed their second season and are out of the league now.   The Spurs drafted Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Keldon Johnson, all high-level starters picking at end of the first round like the Warriors."
"The Spurs jerseys are just wrong. As one of the winningest teams (by win percentage), their jersey is iconic.  Also, one of featured players needs to be Derrick White."

"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
"I would be very suprised tbh, Lonnie got a lot of burn last year and he kinda sucks. He would have to take a quantum leap to be better than any of Dejounte, Derrick and Keldon.  I think Derrick White is the guy to look out for as a breakout on the Spurs, and maaybe Devin Vassell."

"Idk if it could actually happen but I‚Äôd like to see Derrick white get traded to Denver, partly so Derrick could be our last piece and come home and partly cause I‚Äôve always been a Tre Jones fan and want him to get minutes"
"I doubt it. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and maybe Keldon will all probably score more points per game than him. Lonnie probably won't even start for the spurs"
"&gt; But then again if you're not willing to give up a lot of picks then you're retaining your non-lottery picks in order to find talent - not the easiest path to build a team.   no wait Daryl is calling he said he wants   Keldon     Joshua Primo     Derrick White     Samanic     Vassell     seven first rounders     Gregg Popovich's brain, in a jar     tickets for the rodeo, but not for him for his buddy Doug who's into that     pictures of those big ol san antonio women he always hear about     a lifetime supply of churros      and a second round pick swap, but he doesn't mind if it's protected somehow, he wants us to meet in the middle       we can keep Tre Jones"
"I guess I'm still kind of confused as to what the future of the Spurs is, and maybe the fans feel that way too. If you don't want to push for a playoff spot building around an obtainable ""star"" if I can use that word, then the flip side would be to commit to a longer term rebuild and have Pop retire. I don't see finding guys on the margins as a realistic path back to the top. It helps get your team assets and good players like Walker, Murray, Derrick White, and Poeltl. Maybe the idea is to keep riding it out waiting for a better player than Simmons to become available? But then again if you're not willing to give up a lot of picks then you're retaining your non-lottery picks in order to find talent - not the easiest path to build a team.  This is an option. I don't think the past history of the Spurs is a great indicator of what they're going to do in the future, given they haven't been in this position in a long time. Now with Aldrige and Derozan gone there's another chapter to turn to. I don't think Ben is something that'll set you back, but it's a swing for sure.  But the report shows interest, so they're at least thinking about it I guess"
You really think sixers would trade Simmons for Derrick white and Aminu...?
"True. Ben Simmons is so much better than what Murray will ever be. He‚Äôs been in the league for several years now under the tutelage of the most disciplined coach yet he‚Äôs still inconsistent and injury prone. As a Spurs fan, give me Simmons for Murray any day as a trade considering Primo or Derrick White will be at the PG slot as a replacement."
How about Derrick White and either Thaddeus or Aminu to fit the salaries?  Although not sure if a Dejounte and Ben can see the floor together.
"I think the most realistic deal would be Thad Young, Derrick White, a young player (vassell or Lonnie walker), 1 unprotected or 2 protected firsts, and a couple second rounders  Not saying this is a deal I‚Äôd like to make but it seems feasible"
i wanna say miles bridges but i dont know if hes going to have enough opportunity to up his scoring load enough.  ill say derrick white.  dudes way better than his career stats and i think with a full season under him and the spurs going full young hes going to get a lot of opportunity.  20/5/5 coming from him.
" In no order:  PG: Simmons, Jrue, (healthy Dunn), Murray, Zo?  SG: Thybulle, Smart, Dort, Harris, Brooks   SF: Kawhi, OG, PG, Jimmy, Mikal   PF: Giannis, AD, Dray, healthy Isaac, RoCo  C: Gobert, Embiid, Bam,Turner, Capela  HM: Jakob Poeltl, Pascal Siakam, Derrick White, Aaron Gordon, Pat Bev when he‚Äôs not hacking, and Bledsoe when he tries. I think any of these guys could easily be swapped into that top 5 of their respective positions."
"Spurs have 3 MIP candidates this year, but Derrick White has the best shot. He showed he could be a 20ppg guy and was the best player on our team last year by every advanced metric. The only thing holding him back was only playing ~30 games."
"Donte DiVincenzo, Derrick White and DeAndre Hunter would all look really really good if they could stay healthy and had larger roles."
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"That Dejounte and Derrick are the starting One and Two. That means our two guard position is shorter than the Point, and both players have a penchant for catching and driving. We're much better off either subbing Derrick in for DJ, and letting White run the offense after DJ does defensive work on the other teams starting PG."
"The problem is that the qualifying system wouldn't allow for NBA players to participate.   That said, I think a team something along the lines of:  Nerlens Noel-Mikal Bridges-Derrick White would be a fun team."
Not necessarily the place but how do you feel about trading Derrick White? Dude's significantly older than the rest of the core.
"White, Thad Young, Aminu, and the Chicago picks. This hurts because I love Derrick and honestly I'm really low on Simmons"
"Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Thaddeus Young, 2022 Top 10 protected pick, 2024 swap, 2025 bulls pick"
"Imo, Derrick white is the barometer of how good the spurs are next season. If he stays healthy and can be the guy we all know he can be? That‚Äôs the ceiling.   If he again has another injury filled season, then I really worry about the team. DJ,Derrick, and Lonnie to an extent as the team‚Äôs primary offense initiator I can have faith in. If one of those guys go out or Lonnie can‚Äôt put it together again, it‚Äôs hard for me to see anyone else carrying the load, running an offense without it going really poorly for the team"
"IMO Colangelo did a worse job than Billy King during his mutilation of the Nets.  At least King's moves had a somewhat sound logical basis. Colangelo was a total moron selling 2nd round draft picks (he sold the rights to Sterling Brown in 2017), and using 2 first rounders to draft Fultz, one of the biggest busts of the decade. There are reports that Colangelo overrode his staff's concerns when Fultz had terrible workouts.   Also, here are a few players drafted after Paseƒç≈Üiks (25):  * Kuzma (27) * Derrick White (29) * Josh Hart (30) * Wes Iwundu (33) * Dillon Brooks (45)  In summary, fuck the Colangelos."
"We can't truly tank without trading Derrick White, and his value is too low to trade after a broken season last year.   If he's good but the team is on pace for 32 wins, it's gonna make for some tough decisions at the deadline."
"The 2023 Draft has Victor Wembanyama and Emoni Bates.   2022 Draft has Paolo Banchero and Chet Holgrem.   I'd say best to just go full-on youth movement and try to get a Top 3 pick the next two seasons.   1994: Derrick White  1995: Poetl,. Jock Landale  1996: Dejounte  1997: Zach Collins, Eubanks  1998: Lonnie  1999: Keldon  2000: Vassell, Samanic, Tre Jones"
"High: Derrick White, I think he‚Äôs kinda under the radar for how good he is, he‚Äôs a pretty good defender, can buy a bucket and mans the point well  Low: Collin Sexton, I used to think he was underrated but now I think he‚Äôs a bit overrated. He‚Äôs good but at this point he really hasn‚Äôt shown that he can do much more than scoring at will. I think Garland is the better guard for the cavs"
"I‚Äôm always annoyed Spurs don‚Äôt get talked about enough in the media, until I actually hear/read when they ARE talked about, and then realize it‚Äôs just because they don‚Äôt watch our games or have a clue.  It‚Äôs obvious. We‚Äôre going youth movement and seeing what happens with Derrick White, DeJounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson leading the team. We either sink (likely) and get a lottery pick, or we swim because at least one of them broke out and made the leap. The other signings are valuable assets that we can trade away when teams want them. Simple.  Also just a terrible take on DeJounte Murray. Other people have said it already but his midrange game is elite and he can create for others. He‚Äôs a good offensive presence, even if he doesn‚Äôt shoot 3‚Äôs."
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
"The spurs roster if full of guys who will at worst be decent role players. If one of Derrick, Dejounte, or Keldon makes a significant improvement this season and we stay healthy, we'll be about as good as we were last year imo. We just drafted an 18 year old that had a good chance of being a sure lottery pick next year.  If we decide this roster won't get it done, we can easily trade Derrick White and possibly Dejounte Murray for good future assets and build around Primo, Vassell, and Keldon who are 18, 20, and 21."
"I didn't like it either at first but we're not competing and Patty just left. If one of our guards misses time due to injury (and as much as I hate to say it, I mean we do have Derrick White) he can space the floor so BIG BODY can have room to drive"
"Oh, why not?  Spurs. A few sneaky solid signings, Big Body takes a huge step forward, Lonnie Walker plays well, Derrick White stays healthy, and Jock fits in well. Luka Samanic MIP.   Ok, I don't really believe it but seeing Pop go out guns blazing with a bunch of kids and spare parts would be pretty epic."
&gt; We already have point guards we're trying to develop in White and Murray.  Derrick White is 27. I don't think there's much developing to do.   Lonzo and DJ would fit together perfectly. Derrick as the third guard/Manu type.
"Yeah this team isn't much worse than last year. A healthy White is worth almost as much as Demar. I'd say our bench will be ugly without our vets, but we'll be staggering one of DJ or Derrick into it so we'll see. This is a 30 win team at least. Sorry to everyone praying for a tank."
"Primo's Canadian but the OP was being sarcastic.  We draft American players all the time: Dejounte, Derrick White, Keldon, Danny Green, Lonnie Walker, and on and on."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
I'd say we started rebuilding last season. Pop played a rookie decent minutes. He sent Aldridge to the bench before he asked to be waived. We still relied on vets a good amount but part of the reason we relied so much on them was because Derrick White missed like half the season.
"I think the Spurs are tanking, at least to the extent that SA can tank.  DeMar *was* our offense last year. He accounted for 31% of our FTs drawn per game and 36% of our FTs made per game he played in. He obviously led us in points in assists.  Granted, part of that huge disparity on offense was due to Derrick White being hurt. If White is healthy, I like our chances as a very low seed or at least with a chance in the play-in game.  Signing Zach Collins on a flyer, letting go of our vets, etc. all point to some sort of pseudo-tank."
"Derrick White is actually a pretty good playmaker when he is aggressive, he just hasn't been healthy. Doesn't help that our young guys deferred to Demar too, this year should be about empowering them and letting them make mistakes and grow on the court. I don't think anyone on the team has superstar potential but we do have a lot of guys that have #3/4 option on a championship team potential in my opinion. We are opting for the late 00s Rockets and late 10s Nets version of rebuilding rather than the Trust the Process version."
"You definitely know better than I do, I thought Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and to a lesser extent, Lonnie Walker and Dejounte Murray all don‚Äôt seem to have that much creation skills for themselves or for others (Dejounte‚Äôs passing probably being the most impactful of the bunch)"
i know theyre going to wish they took Derrick White and some picks for Benny in about 4 months
[Derrick White](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Egz_t52UMAAdcIa.jpg)
"Derrick White is the most unlucky player I've ever seen, dude finally came back from an injury this year and gets his tooth knocked out early in the game. Dude broke some mirrors or some shit."
"It depends on demar, but if he walks, The Spurs were all ready a 10 seed and had a losing record, I struggle to see how swapping demar/Rudy gay/Patty mills for Doug McDermott/Luka Samanic/and Tre Jones or josh primo doesn‚Äôt make this team quite a bit worse. And Derrick white, who just cannot stay healthy gets hurt again, this is probably a bottom 5 team"
"that's why I was in on Olynyk. you still need a vet or two around so guys know the ""what it takes to be in the NBA"" sort of thing and to pick up the tips on the day to day stuff. still there's no denying this is a rebuild. Derrick White and DJ are the elder statesmen on this team lol"
Derrick white yammed  on his ass
Derrick White or Patty most likely
Derrick White in shambles
Do Mavs have space this year?  Rumor is Spurs shopping Dejuante Murray and/or Derrick White.  They're both at ~$15 mil/season.
Big strong body and handles that can be built upon. He may not be backup point material but I can see him being a Kyle Anderson or Derrick White type if Nate gives him a chance.
"[ok you can just go through the list then. ](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/page/2/seasontype/4)  Derrick white, fultz, Terry rozier."
"Yeah, that's like saying pass on Luka because you have Derrick White, Murray and Tre Jones."
"They have good talent for where they‚Äôve drafted the past 10 years. Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson were all pick 29. You don‚Äôt get starting caliber players that consistently late in the draft unless you‚Äôre good at evaluating and developing talent like the spurs"
"Dejounte, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson all look pretty good considering where they were drafted. Kyle Anderson was good while a Spur, not sure where you're getting the idea that he only blossomed in Memphis. These are also guys being drafted at the end of the 1st round, where expected value is very low but they manage to get contributors more often than other teams.   Going back further you have Parker, Ginobili, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Tiago Splitter. The highest pick of any of those guys was like 26."
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"""The Southwest division, I have some bad news... you're going to get your butts kicked this year by the San Antonio Spurs. They're gonna win 35 games. They're gonna be up by 3 points in a lot of them. There's gonna be a lot of high fiving. A lot of fundamental scoring. A lot of people standing, because Derrick White hit his free throws to put them up 4 with 3 seconds left"""
It's the Derrick white and pre playoff takes all over again lol. Nobody watches trae play. They just read Twitter and this sub reddit 3 year old take of trae
"I mean.. dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson were both 29. Derrick white too.   You can put quotes around ""contributing players"" but I think you'll have a hard time arguing that those 3 guys don't contribute."
&gt; They might just be better at picking guys they think will continue to make significant improvements.    Like even the players themselves say it's Coach Pop and The Spurs personal. Guys like Derrick White don't go from being a senior at colorado to developing and ultimately being better than guys like Markelle Fultz or Dennis Smith Jr. because the Spurs guessed it
Yes. Kawhi Leonard at 15 - incredible pick. Kyle Anderson at 30 - great pick. Dejounte Murray at 29 - great pick. Derrick White at 29 - great pick. Keldon Johnson at 29 - great pick. We drafted an MVP caliber player and 4 starter level players while having no lottery picks until last year.
I feel like all those picks are more credit to player development than good picks.  Forbes/Kawhi/Murray/Dejoune/Keldon all didn't have spectacular rookie years   Like Kyle Kuzma who was drafted around the same time as Derrick White had much better NBA start to his career but now Derrick White seems to be better.
"I think this was in reference to the 2019 team (Derrick White got the nod).  I think Trae wasn‚Äôt a candidate this time around due to injury.  Could be wrong.  In retrospect, a terrible choice, but the thought at the time was that Trae was unplayable with Kemba and Mitchell and wasn‚Äôt built for the more physical international game."
ah yes forgot about that MAXIMUM CALIBER USA basketball team in 2019 which lost b2b games vs france and serbia. legendary 7th place team featuring:  mason plumlee  myles turner  harrison barnes  derrick white  joe harris  some real talent there. and yet they're all still better than kevin love lmfao.  BTW kevin love withdrew from that team.
"Pretty sure the Spurs like Lavine a good amount, they could probably get Derrick White/another young player/picks off of us."
"Rudy Gobert, the 5th highest paid player who is an incredible defender, and also capable of making freethrows at a rate which prevents hacking. The next closest non-scorer to Simmons (ranked 13 highest paid) is... Al Horford at 45th. Next closest is maybe Derrick White ($17,500,000  AAV, 79th highest paid)?"
So that should be Ben's value. 1 Derrick White.
You think swapping Simmons for Derrick White makes the sixers win the east?
Sixers win the East easily with a point guard who can shoot 3s and FTs.  Embiid will be so much more dominant if he doesn't have a 6'10'' point guard hiding under the basket on offense.  Just give him Derrick White / Malcolm Brogdon type of guards
At a similar time on the same team lol. It‚Äôs not debatable who‚Äôs better. I really just meant best record wise. His perceived failures are why he fell out of favor so much that people are now bold enough to say Caruso or Derrick White are better.
We have 5 guys 22 and younger and 3 guys 25 and younger on our roster that matter. We're going to trade Thad Young and after that the oldest core guys on our roster will be Doug McDermott and Derrick White who are 29 and 27. We're already one of the youngest rosters in the entire league lol
"They‚Äôre not superior. They‚Äôre better fits. More teams might take White because they already have a star who‚Äôs better or has more potential than Demar. The Clippers for example would take Derrick White over Demar because they have Paul George. If they didn‚Äôt and wanted to stay competitive Demar would be higher on their list. The problem is that there aren‚Äôt many teams that either A. don‚Äôt have a star who‚Äôs better or B. Aren‚Äôt actively trying to suck. Neither type of team would want him at the moment but he was getting looks from the Lakers, Bulls, Toronto and I think a couple other teams."
"Theres a difference between being a better basketball player and being a better NBA player/someone who would be more preferred by NBA teams. In terms of just vacuum basketball ability, fine, Derozan is a good basketball player and a better basketball player than Derrick White, but I don't think most NBA teams would prefer his services over White's. The players you mentioned are good examples too."
"Derrick White is an elite defender and good 3 pt shooter lol. In the last 2 seasons the Spurs' net rtg with White on the floor and Derozan off the floor was 2.57 pts per 100 poss, when Derozan was on the floor and White was off the floor it was -5.46 lmao. Good minute sample sizes for both too. Unless they needs a primary shot creator/scorer, no team would prefer Derozan over White lol. Even then, a team that has Derozan as its primary scorer can only be so good. I think he'll benefit from being the 2nd/3rd option/best player this year."
Derrick White is better
MVP- Trae DPOY- Embiid  ROY- Suggs  MIP- Derrick White
"Yeah if Kawhi didn't screw the spurs over, all anyone would be talking about is how the spurs are still good and drafted Derrick White and Dejounte Murray with the 29th picks when they should've gone in the lottery."
"As a Spurs fan it would probably be Derrick White, Lonnie, Thad, 2 1sts"
"&gt;first of all pick any of vanvleet, derrick white, barnes, etc you probably getting the same reaction from philly fans as you are to the minny package.   Ok, that‚Äôs not the point though, the picture is all those potential packages are BETTER than Minnesota‚Äôs potential deal. Idc about the reaction of Philly fans when they finally make a deal    &gt;also simmons is not that young, he‚Äôs 25 and has showed little to no growth since coming into the league.  Yet he‚Äôs still one of the 40 best players in the league despite his lack of OFFENSIVE improvement. (It‚Äôs disingenuous to say he hasn‚Äôt grown).    &gt;even a guy like vanvleet who is older than simmons has improved more over the last couple of years.   And he‚Äôs still worse than Simmons so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to get at.   &gt;and hoping getting a talented a player as simmons? there‚Äôs been quite a few more talented players then ben simmons that were in his draft class and that have come into the league since, there will be every year.   Yes, and it‚Äôs players generally drafted at the top of their class... like Simmons. None of these teams realistically are in, or will be in positions to draft this high. And if they were to add Simmons to their team they sure as hell aren‚Äôt picking that high. Even if they were to have a terrible season and end up in the high lottery this is the exact reason why pick protections exist.    &gt;why take on a good player who is who he is and already might be on his biggest contract of his career (if he doesn‚Äôt improve) when i can draft guys to develop   Because those guys you‚Äôre trying to develop realistically will never be as good as the 25 year old all star DPOY level player that is currently available right now.    &gt;and if i get to the point where i need to pay my young guy you hope that he‚Äôs not the next ben simmons or andrew wiggins (i‚Äôm not comparing ben simmons as a player to wiggins just the max deals they got)  If every young guy on my teams‚Äô roster turns into a ben Simmons caliber player we would have the best team of all time even if you trade everyone else away. I pray the young guys on my team get to that level."
"first of all pick any of vanvleet, derrick white, barnes, etc you probably getting the same reaction from philly fans as you are to the minny package. also simmons is not that young, he‚Äôs 25 and has showed little to no growth since coming into the league. even a guy like vanvleet who is older than simmons has improved more over the last couple of years. and hoping getting a talented a player as simmons? there‚Äôs been quite a few more talented players then ben simmons that were in his draft class and that have come into the league since, there will be every year. why take on a good player who is who he is and already might be on his biggest contract of his career (if he doesn‚Äôt improve) when i can draft guys to develop and if i get to the point where i need to pay my young guy you hope that he‚Äôs not the next ben simmons or andrew wiggins (i‚Äôm not comparing ben simmons as a player to wiggins just the max deals they got)"
"&gt;my point is these teams should rebuild through the draft or continue to develop those players   They would be rebuilding through the draft in hopes of getting a player as talented as Simmons. Why do that when you can accordingly trade for him when he‚Äôs still young on a long term deal?   &gt;not trade for ben simmons and his giant contract.   You‚Äôre eventually going to have to pay players no matter what and all these guys I named are on starter level, high starter level contracts and some like Sexton, hunter, reddish may all see new deals nearing 20+ despite not being nearly as good as Simmons. Money isn‚Äôt a problem.    &gt;if the pistons traded cade cunningham for simmons it would probably make them better, would they ever do that tho?   Ok but we‚Äôre not talking about #1 pick Cade Cunningham, we‚Äôre talking about rotational guys like Fred VanVleet, Derrick white, Harrison Barnes, Collin Sexton etc."
Derrick White and his foot letting him play
"Derrick White, he's our most impactful player on both ends when he's healthy imo"
"I absolutely think Morey is willing to bet on one of Beal, Lillard, or LaVine becoming available before the deadline, and that he thinks the team can stay in the top 6 in the east without Simmons.   At that point if none of those guys was available, he would have to ask himself - is a package built around Derrick White, or Malik Beasley, or Collin Sexton, or another non all-star level guard really worth giving up his best trade chip? I'm not sure any of those players really make it more likely that the Sixers make it past the first round than if they go in with the roster as is."
Idk about Derrick White but Poetl has been looking like an insanely good rim protector
"That and Jakob Poetl/Derrick White being borderline All Stars and Zach wasn't left me scratching my head a bit.  I'm not quite as in love with Zach as the rest of my Bulls fans, but he's *at least* as good as Fred Vanvleet and Derrick White."
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
Maybe their model needs work if KD is borderline and Jakob Poetl and Derrick White are clearly All Stars. And that Curry is just a mere ‚ÄúAll-Star‚Äù
"Look how late those Spurs picks were.  They weren't drafting early!  As to Kevon Looney... To judge players' value, lets look at what they get paid.  In his first real contract (the contract after rookie contract), Looney got paid about 4.5 million/yr.  But Kyle Anderson got 9.5mil/yr.  Dejuante Murray got 16 mil/yr.   And Derrick White got over 18mil/yr.  Those guys might as well be in a different league than Lonney.  They're starters.  Looney is bench.  As to the missed drafts-- my original argument was that Warriors don't deserve a rep for being **good** at drafting/developing players (i.e. mentioned in same sentence Spurs or Celtics).  Because they simply haven't done it since 2012.  Trading away picks is a part of that.  There are simply no real success stories to point at and say ""Hey, these guys are good""."
How many first round picks would you give for Derrick White?
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."

Dejounte Murray or Derrick White
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins.

Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
"The closest guy to Derrick White I can think of is Marcus Smart. Great defender, takes a lot of charges, one of the best shot blocking guards in the entire league, and can switch on to a decent amount of 3s. Offensively he's pretty good at running pick and rolls and can shoot from outside but isn't great at it. He can play 1 or 2 offensively and I think if he was playing next to an athletic big like Jarrett Allen, his pick and roll game would be great.  If he's healthy this season, he'll probably be the best player on the spurs. Even Pop said he was the most important player on the team like 2 years ago."
"I think most Spurs fans would agree it's Derrick White, when healthy. But since injuries have kept him down, I would say DJ Murray is the most important player on our team right now."
Derrick White for Tim Duncan? Idk man.
"I would say that atm Derrick White is. The most complete one with more experience and age. Next up is DJ, but he still has to grow and have more potential than Derrick, for sure"
Derrick White
Oh hell yeah. Derrick white for Tim Duncan straight up.
"Would you do Derrick White, Thad Young for Malik Beasley '23 wolves frp? Young 24yo shooter, roll with DJ, Beas, Keldon, Doug, Jakob?"

I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
"The Spurs have good players that would help the Sixers. Derrick White has not been an all-star but is a solid combo guard, for example (though I doubt the Spurs are interested in unloading him) Thad Young is a solid NBA vet who could provide front court depth to the Sixers but I doubt in this scenario he moves the needle much.   The problem is figuring out what the Spurs would get out of engaging in this deal. They are already overloaded on bodies so are not candidates to absorb salaries. Do not have an obvious star player that would fill a hole for the Sixers - the aforementioned White would be the closest thing to that and while on the older side, he's entrenched in the system and the community and expected to be a team leader in SA. Philly is looking to likely gain draft capital, not expended it.   What from either Philly or Minn is on the table that would be positive from the Spurs such that they would be willing to throw in picks? (keep in mind, the Spurs are not in a position to convert picks to wins right now either and they generally do not like dealing picks)  Sentiment aside, They could make White available along with Thad and Aminu and the Bulls pick they got from Demar and may have interest in the Argentine kid Minnesota drafted. That's a hell of a stretch and not near enough return, tbh.   The only real way to get involved here it likely to offer up those vets (Thad/Aminu) and take back end of the roster garbage that we'd cut and eat, hoping to pick up a heavily protected pick or a 2nd tier prospect. Someone like Thad could be seen as a win now addition for the Sixers but the improvement would be marginal. A protected pick swap or two that would convey if the Spurs were at the ass end of the lottery or somehow snuck into an 8th seed in the next 2 years for the presumably later in the draft Sixers pick.  Meh, there's just no obvious incentive to get involved here but I imagine they will certainly try."
"Geez they really killed it in that 26-30 range for years. Tony Parker (28) in '01, Udrih (28) in '04, Mahinmi (28) in '05, Splitter (28) in '07, George Hill (26) in '08, Cory Joseph (29) in 2011, Slo-Mo (30) in 2014, Dejounte (29) in 2016, Derrick White (29) in 2017, Keldon (29) in 2019. Consistently solid selections in that area of the first round"
"Cedi Osman once came to my school couple of years ago and I asked him who was the hardest opponent that guarded him. He told me it was Kawhi and Derrick White. He also told that White looks like a clean/baby faced dude, but is very agressive and dirty on defense lol."
"Real ones know it‚Äôs Derrick White, he has no weaknesses in his game. Reminds me a lot of Kyle Lowry"
"Judging based on previous performance pretty clearly Derrick White and Jakob Poeltl. Dejounte did close the gap this last season however.   Dejounte graded out much better in ESPN‚Äôs RPM and bballlindex‚Äôs LEBRON than he had in previous seasons which aligns with how much better he played last year and improved as a facilitator and mid range scorer. He was on almost dead equal footing with Derrick in both of those measures last season, but Derrick struggled to stay healthy and Dejounte wasn‚Äôt rated as highly by 538‚Äôs RAPTOR. RAPTOR favors Derrick and Jakob pretty clearly. For clarity‚Äôs sake I prefer LEBRON to RAPTOR, and prefer watching basketball to any statistic no matter how they‚Äôre derived. I wouldn‚Äôt trust a measure that deviates far from what I see from watching games, but in this case these 3 measures all align closely with my opinion of them. A 2 season sample size would be preferred for all 3 players. After all Derrick was hurt a lot this year making his sample size even smaller, but including 2019-20 will also obviously hurt Murray‚Äôs statistical argument as he was demonstrably worse that season than 20-21 where he can seriously rest his laurels on maybe being their best player.  These quantifiable measures are much quicker to digest and easier to stand on than anything else given most people probably don‚Äôt see 95% of Spurs minutes. An amount which is probably necessitated given all the oversights we make without re-watching film of previous games where you catch a lot of things you miss watching live. In any case, Dejounte is the only player (based on previous performance) who could be argued in as impactful as Derrick and Jakob.  Going forward? Given many players young age/inexperience in the NBA, or someone like Dejounte‚Äôs continued improvement every season, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who‚Äôll be the best this year. I would take the safest bet with Derrick for now.  It really wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if any 1 of 6 guys was their best player after this season but only using past performance you‚Äôd probably pick Derrick and give Jakob and Dejounte serious consideration. Their past performance obviously doesn‚Äôt restrain them from becoming the Spurs best player this season but I wouldn‚Äôt go so far to make big predicted growth until we see some signs of it."
"That's actually a pretty tough question. It's definitely between Derrick White and Dejounte based on what we saw last year IMO, but the answer could be solidified after this season. Either of them could step up their game, Keldon Johnson or Lonnie Walker will make a crazy leap this year.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm excited to see if someone steps up. Such a young team, not used to seeing this as a Spurs fan."
Derrick White if he's healthy
"Derrick White. Pretty clearly too, imo"
derrick white
Derrick White.  Dude can ball but he plays maybe 6 games a year (sic).  Get out the way so Primo can Primo.
"Yeah, this is clearly bait, but other than Lonzo and Fox clearly needing to be switched (and maybe OG being a couple spots too low), the rest of the list is pretty decent.  Oh, and I'd probably take Dillon Brooks over everyone up to maybe Derrick White"
Derrick White &gt; Tarik Black.
"I raised the question to point out that black-and-white, accolade-based logic like ""FMVP &gt; no FMVP"" is silly and misguided. I'm not equating the careers of Derrick Rose and Kawhi Leonard, and I thought that was fairly obvious."
Derrick white should be a starter for a championship team a so frps and some role player should so it.
"Assuming this is ""guards that didn't make the All star team last season but are really good"" (MPJ makes no sense of course), let's put Jrue Holiday in for MPJ.  1. Young 2. Fox 3. Holiday 4. Murray 5. SGA 6. Ja 7. LaMelo  Though LaMelo isn't that far away.  And if you add Colin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White, I still have LaMelo at 7."
"To be fair, every elite athlete looked like that vs high school players. I remember Dorial Green-Beckham putting up 18 catches for 285 yards and 3 TDs on ESPN in a high school game. Just looked up his high school stats and he had 119 catches for 2233 yards and 24 TDs in 13 games that year. Derrick Henry had 58 carries for 482 yards and 6 TDs in a high school playoff game. In his senior year, he had 4261 yards and 55 TDs, running for 328 yards per game. I remember Thomas Tyner having a 600-yard rushing game in high school make the headlines at ESPN and he only cracked 600 yards in a season once for Oregon. I remember the hype around Noel Devine, this guy with the last name Brownlee, and even a white dude going to play for Michigan as the next Reggie Bush with their high school highlights.  Edit: just found their names‚ÄîJayvon Brownlee and Sam McGuffie."
"I understood this narrative, frustratingly when they were winning games on the back of derozan and Aldridge, 2 guys who are good players but aging and not exactly guys who will be on the team for more than 3 years.   but now? I don‚Äôt understand the narrative. Their lead players are probably 24 year old Murray, 21 year old Keldon Johnson, and the elder 27 Derrick white. If they‚Äôre a playoff/play in team again, it likely means one of their young players had a break out season and became a young player worth building around, what‚Äôs exactly the difference between them and say Memphis if this happens? And if they don‚Äôt get better, there‚Äôs no derozan or Rudy gay to bail them out and win games. It‚Äôs sink or swim with these players"
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
"yes?! we just took out demar, rudy, patty and added mcdermott and figurately derrick white (since he was missing last season and he is our best and most complete player) and luka samanic and add tre jones too. and add the fact that all these young guys are finally free to play instead of always rely on the vets that mostly ballhogged and after covid hit us were pretty bad (patty and rudy). also consider that our defense was extremely atrocious with demar since he was our 4 and he has no size and also he's a bad defender. and also add the fact that all these young guys gained another year of improvement and were devasted after the grizzlies game and i think they have a sense of revenge as they expressed in the interviews. they all have a nice relationship between them and i think a united team is the most important thing in competeting. and also before we got badly hit by covid, we are in the playoff range and performed well in the half of the season.  we fixed our biggest problem of last season that was spacing in the starting five and we got doug mcdermott that is one of the best active shooters in the league (i think he is 9th). he also adds size, thing we need, even tho keldon johnson grew over two inches, he said in an interview during the olympics. not saying doug is better than demar, but surely he is such a better fit and also let the other players such as dejounte and derrick and even keldon do their work, something that rarely happened when rudy, patty, demar were out there, same goes with the bench  so i'm not saying we will go out there winning tf out, but just that we are not as bad as the media and most of the fans think."
No... Lmao.   Top 15 players by ORAPTOR  Steph  Jokic  Lillard  Harden  Luka   Kawhi  Trae  LeBron  Kyrie  Mitchell  Beal  Durant  PG  CP3  Giannis  Top 15 players by DRAPTOR  Gobert  Capela  Poeltl  Thybulle  Turner  Embiid  Gibson  Caruso  Dort  Draymond  Gasol  Gay  Derrick White  Isaiah Stewart  Crowder  Which of those lists is a stronger list of players?  The only time people pretend to not realize how much more valuable offense is than defense is trolling about how good players are online.
"The Hawks will be the one seed (they won't be better then the Nets or the Bucks in the playoffs tho)  Both the Knicks and the Bulls will be in the play in  The Mavs will be a big time disapointment, end up in the play in, but real dangerous in the first round because they have fired Jason Kidd  The Clippers will look like fringe contender   Ben Simmons will make 5+ 3's this season  Russell Westbrook will shoot 36+% from 3  Derrick White will average 20+PPG"
"Our best player is Derrick White followed by Murray. I think people are overrating Keldon. He's a good, young hustle guy but there are still far too many holes in his game."
"&gt; he was 3-4 years older than most prospects  Not compared to those picked around him in the first round. He was around the same age as Lydon (pick 24), Pasecniks (25), Derrick White (29), and Josh Hart (30). He went in the late first for the same reason a ton of guys go in the late first. The difference is he became a much better NBA player than most guys in the late first."
"The Spurs are really good. Look outside of Kawhi or their stars. They turned an undrafted Bryn Forbes into a borderline rotation guy. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray were back to back 29th picks who became good rotation players. Going back even further, they basically resurrected Danny Green's career and made Patty Mills the guy he is today. Kawhi is the pinnacle of their development but they've done great work with a lot of players"
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"Dejounte Murray Derrick White, Thadeus Young and maybe a pick or 2."
"Over, and Derrick White will be the MIP.  The dude was hurt by playing with a complete non shooter at the 3 + a relative non shooter at the 1."
Covid messed Derrick White up for a good minute for us
"I would have OG, John Collins, jarrett Allen, Kuzma, Derrick white, and Dillon Brooks all on that list. In no particular order but they need to be acknowledged"
dejounte murray and a healthy derrick white are the best defensive backcourt in the league and the baby spurs take the 5 seed
i‚Äôd give dJ and derrick white + 2 first round picks to get him on the spurs   he‚Äôs good and we are not good
"Simmons for Derrick White and Thad Young is interesting. SAS might have to throw in some future assets.   Simmons for Gordon Hayward would be interesting if you knew Hayward would be healthy.   Simmons for Jaylen Brown makes Boston a better team, but then the 6ers need a point guard. If they can do that while getting a PG somewhere else, I think they are better. A three way trade loosely built around Horford to Cleveland, Brown and Rubio to the Sixers, and Simmons and Osman to the Celtics works on the trade machine. Guessing picks would have to go to Cleveland for taking on Horfords salary.   If Zach LaVine tells Chicago he won't re-sign, a Simmons for LaVine + stuff package would be good for both teams."
"I‚Äôm betting on San Antonio.   I think it‚Äôll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I‚Äôm going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I‚Äôll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I‚Äôd probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it‚Äôs not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they‚Äôd be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I‚Äôll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don‚Äôt see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn‚Äôt take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
Some super weird Spurs/Kings/Philly trade where whoever out of the Spurs and Kings that didn't get Simmons looks absolutely fleeced.   ------------------------------  Something like...   Simmons to Kings  Hield + Derrick White + picks to 76ers  Bagley and Davion Mitchell to the Spurs
OG and Derrick White were also in this draft
I'm pretty sure it's Dejounte. He's the most consistent. Derrick White will probably be second  My guess is that a single game high for the season will go to Lonnie Walker. He's just that kind of player
Beal is an all nba calibre in my books in his last season of his contract given next is a player option..given wizards are looking to rebuild they should be able to get 2 legit  all star potential youngish guys and 2 unprotected picks imo... Levert/Brogdon ( though neither are young) +2 picks.. Dejounte Murray+Keldon Johnson+2 picks +/- lonnie walker/derrick white.
"Why does saying that I watched them lose (more importantly Derrick White, a Colorado native) hurt your feelings so much?"
"sixers: mccollum, derrick white, FRP   spurs: maxey, simmons   blazers: dejounte murray, thad young, FRP"
I like the way you think sir but these are probably all overpays.   Getting Covington back vs. Derrick White in a Sixers uniform is a tough pick too.
White Derrick
Derrick White will definitely shoot more. White has a quick trigger even when he‚Äôs 0-7.
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I‚Äôm still acting as if he‚Äôs a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"Jakob Poetle as the best player on the Spurs isn't even as crazy as having him, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray all above Brandon Ingram. Also Kawhi's comp this year is Paul George from last year, and the 40M less valuable PG's comp this year is Larry Bird from 89... that doesnt make any sense to me.   But hey Nate's a total math nerd so I will just accept this highly intellectual and math based prediction of the future, the best thing about math is the numbers are numbers, they cant lie."
I more want to see Derrick White unleashed  Also I want to see more Devin Vassell
"Everything from 2018 to now. Highlights include Aldridge putting up 56 on the Thunder, Derrick White dunking on the Nuggets."
"Derrick White has already improved, he just didn't get to show it last season. A healthy season with extra derozan touches and I'll be shocked if hes not putting up 20  Hes a great pick for MIP"
Derrick White.
Derrick White   Lonzo Ball   Jrue Holiday
"Spurs, Cavs, Grizz, OKC, Houston, Orlando. Basically any team that‚Äôs just down and far from contention.   None of those teams had a valuable trade piece that comes to mind but maybe one could emerge. Maybe like Derrick White for Bagley and a good bunch of picks. Who knows what direction the Spurs are trying to go in."
"I was seriously debating including Devin Vassell, but he's not as far along as Keldon Johnson. Maybe next year he enters the conversation but right now he's trailing behind the other 4.  I'm very torn on Derrick White, he is 27 but he's had a few stretches where he showed that he has the potential to be a fringe All Star, but hasn't put it together yet. But to be fair he's been injured a decent chunk of the time and with DeRozan gone he's probably going to get more play. I'm waiting to see how he does next season before writing him off yet."
Ppl on here legitimately thought that Derrick White was a better player than Trae Young
Derrick 'The Thrill' White!
That one Luka with the step back on Dejounte I think maybe it was Derrick White idk
Also Derrick White is a natural playmaker who should run point but plays sg because Dejounte Murray
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"
Coby White and Derrick Rose seem like the best value picks. Especially if their teams continue to improve and they can build that narrative. Wouldn't be surprised to see Clarkson put up similar numbers again to last season in his role as a microwave scorer but I'm not sure if he'll have the same storyline to drive voters his way.
"If spurs get Simmons, they would likely not even make the playoffs and give the Sixers some very juicy draft picks and good young talent like Dejounte or Derrick White.  I really hope Simmons never puts on a spurs jersey."
" I'll list all the guys that I think are really really underrated (of course not the same level of players) :  DeAndre Hunter : A lot of people think he's just a 3&amp;D, but he's shown some mid range stuff that could translate into low all star type of shot creation already  PJ Dozier : I think he's a high end back up, good defender, good ballhandler, good positional versatility, athletic  Eric Gordon (crazy overpaid tho) : still a guy that can switch well, was very solid defensively in the playoffs every year, can shoot, spot up from deep, can shot create a bit still  Kyle Anderson : his shot is crazy slow and he's unathletic, but other than that he basically is decent or good at everything  Richaun Holmes : the Kings were good with him on the court last year, and were basically the worst defense of all time without him  Derrick White : has shown some impressive shot creation in the bubble, think he's underutilized because he shared the floor with 2 guys who can't shoot and therefore had to take a backseat when he came back from injury"
"The usage and playing time voids created by the departures of DeRozan and Rudy Gay are substantial. However, based on the data from last season, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, and Derrick White are the most likely beneficiaries of that void."
I mean Marv would say random names and change it up because of how incoherent he was. That dude consistently called Derrick White the same wrong name all night. He just had no idea who Derrick was.
"its still saying Derrick White is our best player. I love him to death, and he is amazing on defense, but there's no fucking way he's that much of a positive on defense to make up for how ass he's been on offense so far, when we paid him more than anyone on the team. lol"
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it‚Äôs guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc‚Ä¶ fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they‚Äôre my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
"Murray and Vassell*  The mistake is understandable as the Lakers‚Äô color commentator spent the whole game calling Derrick White, ‚ÄúLonnie White‚Äù."
Spurs Austin system has a solid track record with their young guys who have talent. Even Derrick White who played 4 years did a year in Austin.
"He hasn't been played much in the regular season, but the flashes he's shown in preseason and summer camp have spurs fans *very* excited. When they blew out Orlando, there was legit chants for Primo through most of the fourth quarter. Spurs fans are very excited to see what they have with him. He plays with a swagger and confidence and poise that 18 year olds don't really ever show, and he makes shots that many of the Spurs' veterans (lonnie walker, dejounte murray, derrick white, etc) aren't taking at all.   Overall: So far so good. Hasn't played much. Spurs fans excited. Will probably get stashed in g-league as is spurs tradition once that season starts. Will earn his stripes and then we'll see."
"The lakers commentators are in watchable. They referred to Derrick White as Lonnie White, Lonnie Walker as Lonnie Murray, and Drew Eubanks as Brett"
why is derrick white still out there
Billy Mac keeps calling Derrick White ‚ÄòLonnie White‚Äô
"Derrick ""Better than Trae Young"" White"
I swear if Derrick White played for almost any other team he'd have so much more respect for being as great as he is on both sides of the court (except last season cause he was hurt and dealing with Covid all year)
Derrick white and Dejounte Murray could probably play on it idk about the rest
"You proved yourself wrong lol. It is clear you still don't know how to read the stats you yourself posted so I'll humor you.   [Here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PASSES_RECEIVED*GE*50) is all the guys in the league who receive at least 50 passes per game, sorted by passes made. You can see Ant is at the bottom of the list, ahead of only Herro, McCollum, Ingram and Beal. Yet he also plays more minutes than all of the guys below him except for Ingram. Edwards is on the floor more than most guys and receives more passes than most guys but isn't passing.   But that's a small sample size, so let's look at last year. [Here](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=PASSES_MADE&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PASSES_RECEIVED*GE*38:MIN*LE*34) is the same link, but of guys who received at least 38 passes per game (Ant was at 40.2). And to be fair to him, I capped the minutes per game at 34 since he was only at 32 MPG last year.   If you're look for Ant on that list, you have to go to the 2nd page, where he is once again at the bottom of the league. This time there are only 3 people who passes less than him - Eric Gordon, Derrick White and Devin Booker.   It is very clear that of guys with Ant's usage, he passes the ball among the least in the NBA. So maybe instead of telling others they don't watch the Timberwolves you should pay more attention to what's happening in the games you watch."
Derrick White though

Derrick White instinctually avoided it
"just a tiiiiny bit of space, derrick white couldve been hit in the head like james harden. lucky him it was jokic who passed it"
Derrick White afraid of the ball
"For the spurs:  Malcolm Brogdon - 2016  Kawhi Leonard - 2011  Jimmy Butler - 2011  Nikola Jokic - 2014  Last spot is between Derrick White, Norman Powell, and Larry Nance Jr. I'd say."
"So a couple things:   1. Time is lost by waiting.  Obviously not a day or a week, but if the season goes by without a trade, that is a lost year and Embiid, while enormously talented, is not a star player I would be patient building a team around.  He has very serious injury considerations that could limit the Sixers window.     2, The other thing that is lost is Simmons' potential fitness.  There have been guys who if they've been away from the game a certain period of time, they show back up out of shape and may not be the same player.  After the 98 lockout, Shawn Kemp gained a ton of weight and was never really the same.  Dennis Scott too, fwiw.     3. The alternative is not peanuts.  If Lillard doesn't want to be moved, its not like the alternative is just to trade Ben for some second round picks.  Other teams have younger players with some upside who could fit well with Embiid. If the Spurs for example offered Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson for Simmons and Curry, that seems like a good match.  Sure none of them are all stars but they could fit very well with the Sixers as it stands. And that dovetails into my last point:     4. The Bucks just proved you don't need a 'superteam' to win the championship.  They won it with an MVP player and other rotational players that fit very well with Giannis, and then they went out and got Jrue Holiday without giving up a whole lot in terms of talented players.  They got him with mostly draft picks.  So getting rotation players that fit with Embiid doesn't foreclose on the Sixers chip hopes."
You‚Äôre prob the type that still thinks Derrick White is elite after the bubble
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
She won a summer league championship with Derrick White on the roster I believe
"honestly, every team could use Derrick White, DJ Murray, Keldon Johnson, Vassell, and Poetl. every team could use  strong defense and energy."
What? Thad young is averaging a triple double this season. So is dejounte. Poeltl is averaging 3 blocks per game this year and Derrick White is hitting 4 3s a game. Keldon is gonna average a double double and Doug will be among the league leaders in 3 pt%. All of this happens and we have a shot ok.

"Every rookie just about gets a year in Austin, minimum. Even Derrick White a 4 year college player did Austin. But he came in even more polished after that year."
When did Derrick Rose turn white?
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"Nooooo, no gleague for primo pls... but im confident he'll set the gleague on fire and end up getting minutes when derrick white gets hurt again :/"
"I haven't watched Poole much but that sounds a lot like Derrick White to me. He understands how to play and runs plays correctly. Even when he shots badly, I'm not worried about him because I can see he's playing the right way."
"A team with players like Derrick White, Murray, Poeltl, Thaddeus Young can't bottom out"
"Started"" but actually it was Presti who drafted them...    &gt;You started your franchise with 3 MVPs, lost them, lost in the first round,  I think you are leaving out the part with the 4 WCF appearances and going to the finals. 1992 was the last time the blazers went to the finals btw.   &gt;then started rebuilding yet you‚Äôre up there with teams that have actually put together winning teams.  Yeah its because they were in a tough spot with the Russ + PG teams. They got solid returns while also doing right by the players. They have SGA who looks like a future all-star and they have a treasure trove of picks over the next 5 years that they can use to hunt for a second and third guy or they could trade picks if someone becomes available.   &gt;If it was about the past the Spurs wouldn‚Äôt be at the bottom  Yeah, I mean it's a little harsh on the spurs but honestly, they've been pretty middling over the last couple years with no direction. They have 1 protected first coming in over the next 5 drafts, they have a couple guys with potential (Murray is decent, Derrick white is fun but older and injury prone, Keldon Johnson has potential), but probably no future all-stars. They are going into a rebuild but it's not ideal to not have extra draft picks or a potential star. Unless they hit on in the next two drafts, it's going to be a long rebuild. They are taking flack for not trading guys earlier and starting the rebuild two years ago."
"His ast% (impact) is elite while his tov% (impact) is on the bad side of ""okay"" (~16% in OKC, ~18% in WAS - his quote claims teammates need time to gel, so I'm anticipating another 18% year) (Harden ran 15-19% in HOU, Steph tightened up from 16% to 13% in their Finals years, Lowry fluctuated from 13 to 18% in TOR)  His ast:to ratio (efficiency) of 2.4 is firmly on the right side of good for a starting PG. Tyus Jones is usually the best at this sitting at 5-7, and Chris Paul/Ricky Rubio are the [best starters](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/assist-to-turnover-ratio) (both ~4.0 last year). I personally call 3.0 elite, but I'd be happy with Brogdon (2.9), Derrick White (2.8), Lowry (2.7), Jokic (2.6), Simmons (2.5). The other side of that metric are DLo at 2.2, Trae at 2.3, Jamal Murray at 2.1.  His good efficiency in playmaking specifically compliments his unmatched ast% to paint a picture of a dominant playmaker. The value of stats oftentimes change at the edges, which tells me that his healthy 2.4 ast:to is even more impressive with the sheer volume of passes he's making  Those are the stats I like. If you want to get more in the weeds, you can check out the [NBA passing dashboard](nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;sort=AST_TO_PASS_PCT&amp;dir=1). Last year, WB was #2 on ""ast to pass %"" (what % of his passes result in an assist? - measuring the efficiency of any given pass WB makes) and topped the chart in ""ast to pass % adjusted"" (giving more value to assisted 3's). Westbrook also **received** the most passes, which gives some credence to the idea that he's in a system where the ball always comes back to him - you could consider this an additional knock on his raw numbers and even his ast%, but it gives him more opportunity to bolster his tov% and his ""ast to pass%"" isn't affected by this"
Good one. I'd actually say Derrick White too. I've been expecting his breakout for like 3 seasons now. If he can be consistent for a whole season I'd like to see him solidify himself as a good consistent starter in the league.
"couldda drafted OG Anunoby, John Collins/Jarret Allen, and Derrick White with their picks"
In exchange for what? Lots of teams would like to have Derrick White
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"

"this thread didn't really understand the question lol. as a spurs fan i would put george hill and derrick white in this category.   they can score, pass, defend, shoot, etc. and it seems like they have the talent to be an all star, but they never really became a master of any category so they have some breakout games, but overall pretty above average role players who can do a bit of everything"

The numbers say we were MUCH better defensively whenever DeMar didn't play so I'll be really bold and predict that If we hold onto Thad Young &amp; Derrick White can stay healthy we will be a top 10 defense.
i feel like Brogdon would be the minimum viable player to get back in a trade. other useful if not amazing players could be Derrick White or D'Angelo Russell.

Derrick White is a better player than Trae Young.
Go to any non playoff team and try to get their best veterans.  Harrison Barnes. Dillon Brooks. Kyle Anderson. Thad Young. Derrick White. Etc. you could get a legit starter. A 6th man. And a big to fill the roster.
Dejounte or Derrick white are by far better players than KJ even though you could argue he has more potential
The spurs went 6-5 without DeRozan last year. You think they go 19-42 the rest of those games last year? Even Pop said Derrick White was the most important player for the spurs a few years back and he missed half the season last year and had to recover from injuries 3 separate times and missed training camp.
"Teams need tank commanders. I'm sure teams like Spurs and OKC would take him if there's a pick or two involved. Warriors could use someone like Derrick White, they need a backup ball handler afaik."

How do people feel about Derrick White?
"i loved demar but his middie and length are the only things that inarguably outclass derrick   better defender by a damn site, obviously better from 3, obviously younger, just that fuckin hustle man, and my boy d-white has severely underrated bunnies going to the rack  so... in theory, yes"

"the last thing derrick white needs is more covid horseshit  hes been our best player in theory for 2 years now, for the love of god can we get 82 games of proof"
I think we could win 30 if we stay healthy. Derrick White missed half the season last year and we still went 33-39. I just mean we're not going to be an awful bottom tier team this season. I expect the defense to be better with DeRozan gone and McDermott fits better than DeRozan did for our young guys to do well offensively imo.

"We were also missing our starting point guard for all but the last game when he clearly wasn't himself. Yes he should have made some adjustments, he should have told our wings to rotate when gobert helped against drives. But subbing out gobert would essentially be waving the white flag. Who would he put in who was actually on our team. Derrick Favors is just a worse gobert at this point. I mean maybe running a five out offence with ersan might have worked but very much doubt it would. Running anyone else at the 5 would just be stupid."

Dejounte Murray and Derrick white are quality
As a spurs fan we try for a big name then if we can get a smaller man in market like a Christian wood kinda person then we resign Murray trade derrick white and start Lonnie and let primo get minutes our worst scenerio is we don't get a free agent Murray walks and we can't find a trade piece for white or Thad young we package the two together with maybe mcdourmet and a pick or two for a Lavine or klay kinda sg so primo could play the one

"I like everyone on our roster. They're not good but there's tons of underdog guys like Bryn who went from undrafted to a reliable sharpshooter in the NBA, Derrick White who started out at a division two college, Drew Eubanks, and Keita who were undrafted and a second rounder that was let go."

You mean Derrick White?
Trae Young wasn't even all-star last year. Infact Derrick White might be better.  Keep Sleeping.
The idea of Derrick White showed up today
"i don't get why ppl hate Forbes, he's supposed to be an end of bench player.  derrick white is our highest paid player (or 2nd?) and hasn't shown any improvement"
derrick white. they keep thinking bubble white is coming back
Derrick White has been getting a lot of hate this year
"Derrick White. Not disliked by most, but he's got the loudes haters other than Forbes."
"While personally it‚Äôs bryn Forbes, on our subreddit it seems to be Derrick white"
Except for the random 1 every 5 games he turns into what the idea of Derrick White is and scores 20
derrick white. can defend sometimes but forgot how to shoot
Mhmm also insert Derrick White forehead joke here
"Yes, I agree that Duncan to Trae is not a totally apt comparison. Because Tony Parker and Manu were both international players, there wasn't really a good 1 to 1 comparison in this context. A better analogy would have been imagine Tony Parker was American and he got snubbed from the 2008 Olympics in favor of a role player of Kendrick Perkins' caliber for example. I imagine your sub would have been pretty up in arms and definitely clowned the hypothetical role player a fair bit.  As for your original comment, since you don't seem to care to address it, Trae is currently outperforming Luka in every statistical category except for rebounding and steals, has very comparable career stats to Luka, has had more postseason success than Luka, is easier to build around then Luka, is a better culture fit for the city than Luka, etc. So I'm not quite sure how the fact that we traded Luka for the better player for our team is supposed to somehow be a dig at us.  &gt;So when I see comments like this putting down White, I‚Äôm reminded that you guys really have it in for a guy who, by all accounts, is a lovely person and a passionate player.  Again you're taking memes way too seriously. Nobody has it in for Derrick White on a personal level.   &gt;All because your franchise player kinda sucked for most of his rookie season.  Well Trae averaged 19.1/3.7/8.1 his rookie year, so if that's ""sucking for most of his rookie year"" then he must have been historically great for the other portion of his rookie year to achieve those averages. For reference, let's look at the highest drafted PGs from the classes after Trae and see how they fared their rookie year. LaMelo averaged 15.7/5.9/6.1 and Morant averaged 17.8/3.9/7.3. So if Trae ""sucked"" his rookie year, then those guys must have definitely sucked their rookie years as well. Wait a min, those guys both won rookie of the year didn't they? Hmmm"
Or Derrick White.
"By Derrick White, I assume?"
"Listen dude, if you weren't already aware 95% of our sub's content is memes and circle jerking. If you're taking basically anything there seriously, that's on you. It's poking fun, I'm pretty confident in saying I don't think anybody in our sub actually hates Derrick White as a person. It's a sports hate over a petty reason because it's sports and it's fun. If Tim Duncan was snubbed from the Olympics in 2004 in favor of a role player, do you not think your sub would have had a similar reaction?   Once again, haven't seen the post, but I'm guessing based on what you described, the sub was more laughing at the fact he fell on his face rather than the fact he was actually hurt. I'm pretty sure the title of the post wasn't ""LMFAO Derrick White has a concussion, what a loser!""  Also STRAWMAN, Jesus Christ this has nothing to do with the topic of your original dumb comment and you're just chosing to not acknowledge that"
"I'm not digging through three years of your sub's post history just to prove that you guys hate Derrick White (for no valid reason, I might add).    Honestly, I'd like to know why you guys feel the need to endlessly mock a role-player whose promising career has been derailed by foot injuries.  It just seems mean-spirited, is all."
Friendly reminder that your subreddit made a post mocking Derrick White when it looked like he suffered a concussion.
Derrick ‚ÄúTrae is good but d white is dope‚Äù White to you
Derrick White is a lockdown defender though?
What do you mean? He was playing against Derrick White the olympian
Y'all remember when coach Pop snubbed Trae for Derrick White for the Olympics? Pepperidge Farm remembers
Derrick white no question
derrick white better
i got to like -150 for saying trae was drastically better than derrick white. i‚Äôll stay petty til i die shit was funny
Starting to think Keldon Johnson and Derrick White might not actually be better than Trae.
guys would u rather have derrick white or trae young
"Tbf, with the new foul rules Derrick White will probably average more points."
"Just wanna ask, y‚Äôall remember when Pop snubbed Trae for Derrick White, and r/nba said he was better than Trae? And then when JC was snubbed for Keldon Johnson for the Olympic team, something that actually matters, and half of r/nba did it again? This one feels good, real good. Fuck Pop and fuck LP for agreeing"
"Be honest- who would you rather have for the rest of their career, Trae Young or Derrick White? [Serious]"
Who Would you rather have Trae Young or Derrick White?
Yeah Murray. 2nd option is probably Derrick white or Keldon but it slowly but surely is becoming Devin vassell

Dejounte Murray  Devin Vassell Josh primo Keldon Johnson  Derrick white  Jakob poeltl Tre Jones  Lonnie Walker
"Coby white looks either lost or outmatched. Hoping for the former, but watching him go from starter to struggling to get minutes is at least a sign of how much better the bulls have gotten.  The bulls are playing better defense for longer stretches than before and its really great to watch.  Derrick Jones played his ass off last night. Energy energy energy"
"I read this the other day   Spurs Receive: Russell Westbrook.    Lakers Receive: Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Thaddeus Young"
"Derrick Jones Jr, Pat Williams, Coby White, and Tony Brown Jr for pascal? Lol"
"I think we'd give Thad and Derrick White to get someone's picks who is taking Simmons. I mean, I know we won't, but I wouldn't mind getting in on this action as a 3rd team but I don't want Simmons. At this point, I'm on the half of Spurs fans that would rather lose with guys we like as opposed to....well, still lose, but with a supposed 'superstar'."
He went from having Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White being the best players on the roster besides him to Zach Lavine &amp; Lonzo Ball. Defenses were ecstatic when pretty much anybody besides DeMar tried to score in the half court especially in crunch time last year but you can't do that with the Bulls cause they're just far more talented.
Recently he called Derrick white trash and to get some buckets. Bit majority of us agreed with the take. Before no idea
Derrick white if you‚Äôre playing categories
"as a lakers fan for over 14 years , i would pick derrick white first ( 27 years old but has proven to be a good shooter and smart iq) than i would pick colby white because he is playing for the bulls more time to put more points   &amp;#x200B;  tht is 20 years old but he is not  a realible three point shooter , he is shooting at 28% from three, but he has more potential than both of them if he learns how to shoot and be a better ball handler and passer when its in crucial moments , he is turnover prone"
Derrick White is 7 years older than them. What‚Äôs this comparison about?
Holy shit let‚Äôs go.  Gonna grab him from the waiver wire.  THT or Derrick White or Coby White?
Derrick white man. Give him time
I‚Äôm debating whether or not to pick him up in fantasy and drop Derrick White.
"well that's kinda my point, I think Pop would fix the attitude problems, probably have a few vets in there to establish a good culture and probably have a system in place to take advantage of their strenghts/weaknesses  like D-Lo does have talent, he showed it in brooklyn he put up 22/7 as 22 year old but has regressed probably due to bad coaching/situations  my point with Pop is that he actually improves players. he took Patty Mills and made him a solid 6th man. takes a lot of guys as late 1st round picks and makes them into rotation players (keldon johsnon, derrick white, dejounte, george hill, dejuan blair, tiago splitter)"
Derrick White is so old for being in his fifth year in the league because he played for a division two college the first three years he was in college. He was 6' tall when he graduated high school and the division 2 scholarship he got was for $3000/year
"On a side note, what the hell has happened to Derrick White. He looked like he could become a decent starter but you'd feel Vassell should start over him."
I'd say Derrick White and Marcus Morris's contracts are definitely better than Markkanen's. But yeah it wouldn't be hard to trade him I think. I do think it's pretty weird the cavs gave up Nance who liked being in Cleveland to give him that contract though.
"Markkanen hasn‚Äôt been great, but has been solid for the Cavs even without his 3 falling this season. Given he‚Äôs on about the same contract as guys like Derrick White &amp; Marcus Morris you could easily move him.   Bertans is also obviously overpaid, but at $16m I still think you can move him fairly easily.  The Westbrook, Wall, Love and probably Porzingis contracts are the clear worst right now IMO, those are the ones teams would find it hard to find a taker."
"Jordan isn't even one of the top 5 Bulls let alone top top 2 players in NBA history.Maybe he is at best a top 10 bull  Derrick Rose is 1,Alex Caruso is 2,Jimmy Butler is 3,White Mamba is 4 and Reggie""Coach Fuller"" Theus is 5"

I was at the game and Derrick white is excellent at defending the rim. He‚Äôs not going to get blocks but the shots he contested didn‚Äôt go in more often than not
"I mean why not include Derrick White or Dejounte Murray who were both 1st round picks?  Both barely played as rookie.  You really said, ‚ÄúPop is effectively stunting his rookies out of valuable playing time‚Äù, and your wondering why you come off as biased?"
"Derrick White played 17 games his rookie year dude. Dejounte Murray 38 games. The two of them would have actually dragged the averages down since it dilutes Devin Vassell's contribution to it.  I didn't add them since it makes sense why San Antonio didn't play them, they were contenders or at least a playoff team."
"The Spurs have been stuck with mid first and late first rounders and the hit rate on those are EXTREMELY low.   Plus they turned 3 straight 29th overall picks into starting level NBA players with Dejounte, Derrick White, and Keldon. Plus, all those guys outside of Samanic and Primo (rookie) have been serious contributors and have been playing well this year."
"Very convenient to cut it off just before Derrick White and Dejounte Murray, who have been significant contributors who were picked at 29th.  And idk why you are extrapolating for Primo. The Spurs always send their picks to the G league for a year. He's never going to play much this year."
"Absolutely. It's such a strange formula for success that keeps working.  In the past decade, they've had back-half FRPs pan out like nobody's business.   Kyle Anderson, Cory Joseph, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, and Lonnie Walker. None of these guys had any significant playing time their rookie year. Maybe they know something we don't."
"Best aspect: Dejounte Murray's breakout, being competitive in most games.  Worst aspect: Keldon Johnson and Derrick White being off shooters, inability to close out games."
"how good would the all-color team be  Jaylen Brown  Jeff Green  Draymond Green  Derrick White  Bruce Brown  Bench:  Danny Green  Cam Reddish  Derrick Rose   What if you added LeBrown James, Kelly Ochre Jr. and Bradley Teal"
Derrick White?
White is old enough that pick-slot weighting has almost entirely fallen off his projection.   The issue is that Lonzo Ball's draft position and Derrick White's draft position are equally irrelevant because neither player is on their rookie contract but Lonzo's draft position is still partially weighted into his future projection due to his age.
"I don't think they're pick arbitrary values for how to weight draft position. I'd assume they're pick weights that historically would maximize accuracy.  Likewise Derrick White scores very highly, so not sure how much draft position is being weighed anyways."
Derrick White AAV being higher than Bam‚Äôs makes no sense to my pea brain
Derrick White did not play towards the end of last season. A big reason why we fell off a cliff
"Derrick White has taken a big step back so far this season. If he can start playing like he did towards the end of last season, we'd be much better maybe around a 0.500 team if we keep Thad Young all season."
Derrick White has been so bad this year. He doesn‚Äôt even look like the same player.
"I will send you Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Bryn Forbes (when he can be traded) plus 2022 Top 3 protected pick, 2023 pick swap, and CHI‚Äôs 2025 Top 10 protected pick to get Dame with Popovich plz noooo don‚Äôt hang up lol  But yeah I‚Äôd say hang onto Dame as long as possible"
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
I‚Äôve never seen a player trip over his own feet as much as Derrick White
I just wish Derrick White would start hitting his darn shots.
"I think you're mixing up 2 drafts, but yes, the Kings fucked up the 2017 draft as well ‚Äì instead of NBA champion Justin Jackson and the corpse of Harry Giles, they could have rounded out their bench with John Collins, OG Anunoby, Jarrett Allen, Derrick White, even Kuzma"
Thanks for your answer too.  I‚Äôll probably got Thad but for now I‚Äôm gonna keep Derrick White and see. That‚Äôs who I was gonna drop for Thad anyways.
Mike White is not a bigger story than Derrick Henry.
"Magic commentators in the entire 2nd quarter be like   ""Hey did you know what picks were used to draft Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray?""  [Twenty Nine](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/ee/New_Student_Starfish_087.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190822081634)"
"&gt; They drafted Lydon who i wouldn't have drafted with the 60th pick. How come these proffesional front office geniuses with much better scouting and information than me fucked that up?  Dunno what to tell you there. Teams will reach for a gamble with their late 1st. Nothing is guaranteed at that point whatsoever. You can confirm this with how many players drafted after him are out of the league, it is almost all of them. They had some sort of intel that told them that maybe this was a little bit better of a gamble than others. Of the ones who are still in the league now only Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, and Dillon Brooks are starters. Not exactly guys anyone thought to pick either.  Luckily Denver also found Monte Morris late in that draft who is now the best back up PG in the league.  &gt; Giving Jamal the contract a year early your risk is fairly high while the reward is at least comparable as giving him the contract a year later . Giving him the contract a year later your risk is clearly much lower while the reward is roughly the same if not bigger. Surely you agree with this.  No, I don't agree with this because I've followed the NBA long enough and have seen enough lousy rookie/RFA/UFA situations to know that if you think your player will be worth that, then give it to them. Countless times they wait a year and it sours the player, it says to other players we are going to make you wait to get contract security as long as we possibly can, we want to wait for you not to get injured another year before we commit to you, and when they go to RFA they get to hear from other teams how much that team values them, how the team they're on didn't give them the max but that they would have, that they're going to do everything that their other team can't do if their team doesn't match the max. Whether or not they end up staying with the team, that has a huge impact on someone in their early 20s.   Again, this isn't 2K, the human element in this is a huge deal. That's why all these teams secure their guy a year early. It's not like the ""logic"" and math isn't obvious. It's that it's clearly outweighed by the negatives, considering if the player plays the exact same as they did the last year you're gonna give it to them anyway."
"i love the idea of a white middle manager sitting through a meeting thinking *jeff's new cornrolls look good. i should tell him.are they called cornrolls? shit what if they're cornrows? rolls, rows, rose? like derrick rose? kiss from a rose? seal is black. but roses don't grow near corn. roads do though. cornroads!* ""hey jeff! nice cornroads!"""
"&gt;What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.  He still has trouble getting the ball to Jokic in the post, though he is much better at it. I don't see why it's relevant that he's better now. He's clearly worth the max now which isn't my point.   &gt;You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series.   He didn't struggle somewhat, he simply struggled. Also don't act like it's normal for anyone to struggle while guarding Derrick White. He's an average player at best. If you're gonna undermine all of Jamal's weaknesses while enhancing his strengths there's no point in having a discussion.   &gt;What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?  You can't seriously tell me I don't watch the Nuggets and come out and say this. He didn't even guard Lillard.   &gt;Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently  He is 6'1"" but that's an ok size for a point guard. His wingspan is same as Jamal's. He's also more efficient than Jamal was at that point and much more consistent.   &gt;furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good,   Again, he's more efficient than Jamal and has shot around 40% from 3 every year. Again better than Jamal at the same point of his career.   &gt;and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.  He scored 24 points on 55 ts% last year. Jamal in his 3rd year scored 18 on 54 ts% with much less consistency as well. I think Sexton had clearly shown both a higher scoring potential and floor than Jamal. Jamal's passing was better but not by much. Sexton is one of the worst in the league. Jamal was still below average though , there's a reason a shit ton of Nuggets fans were doubting if playing him at 2 would be better for the team. Jamal clearly had much more potential there than Sexton.   &gt;Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.  &gt;Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.  Sexton is a bad defender but so was Jamal. Defensive stats are also garbage so there's no telling how much better Jamal was on defense than Sexton now.   To sum it up. Sexton is a much better scorer, much more consistent, proven by all the stats. Jamal was the better passer defender and had slightly better physical attributes. Neither should have gotten the max, both had glaring weaknesses. Again, you're making Sexton's sound like the end of the world. At the same time you're making Jamal's sound like small inconveniences on the road to greatness. Which for me they weren't.   &gt;I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  You say they took a calculated risk, I say they took a gamble. An unnecessary one. The scenario where Jamal doesn't improve at all was just as likely, everything else are fairy tales. Waiting another year to max him carries much more benefits than consequence. Getting a better look at a player is much more worth than ""he may get annoyed and won't re-sign in 5 years"".   If he doesn't improve you're gonna be able to retain him even 5 years down the road cos he won't be commanding a max. And in case he really doesn't want to re-sign 5 years down the road, replacing an 18/4/5 guy isn't too hard"
"we honestly """"""just"""""" need a superstar which we are aiming to get this draft by selecting high high. paolo banchero fits like a glove here. DJ, Jakob, Vassell, Keldon, Primo are staying here longg term (as for now) and would build a really solid team in the future, but, as I said, we need that superstar PF (casually the same position as Timmy). Then add Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV: we are still figuring out what to do with our SG position, wr have ton of guards. In any case, the ones that we do nog keep would provide us a good value in return. Same goes with Doug McDermott and in an immediate future Thaddeus Young."
"&gt; No it's not. Sexton just posted better numbers and they didn't want to give him 100mil. It wasn't shocking that he was inconsistent, it was shocking how inconsistent he was and it was shocking that he hadn't improved on it since coming to the league.  Because looking at numbers isn't a good way to tell if a player is worth giving a max contract to or not. It is so much more nuanced and complicated and in depth than looking at someone's bball ref page.   &gt; His playmaking improved a bit, huge is a hyperbole and you know it. He upped his assists by 1.4 and still struggled to get the ball to Jokic in the post. As for his so called defensive improvement i would suggest you take a look at him attempting to guard Derrick fucking White in the playoffs.  What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.   You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series. What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?   &gt; His growth wasn't linear. Going from year 2 to year 3, he improved his passing and his efficiency went down. Meanwhile every 5 games or so he would tweak something, or roll an ankle etc. And since i already used Sexton as an example-Sexton had 48 games where he scored 20+, Jamal had 28 in a longer season. His inconsistency was insane.  Growth isn't linear. But Jamal's growth has been about as linear as it gets. Inconsistency is one of the least worrisome things in a player when they show that they work hard and have that All-Star caliber play inside of them. Young players always get more consistent unless they truly bust. They knew he would and he has.  &gt; Everyone on here is upvoting this when i literally didn't say it. The opinion of the majority isn't always right.  I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  &gt; Would you give Sexton the max though?  No.   Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently -- furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good, and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.   That's also the archetype of a player who doesn't fit in very well with teams, can't play off-ball like Murray can and hasn't shown the ability to not be a black hole on offense.   Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.   Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.   The things teams look for as far as upside, tells of potential growth and future value, ways that a player can succeed in the NBA on ball, off ball, man defender, help defender, are not there for Sexton in the way they are for Murray, or SGA, or even MPJ to a lesser extent.   The offensive ones aren't anywhere near good enough to make up for the defensive issues like in the case for Trae Young who will likely rate as the worst defender at his position for the rest of his career.   The defensive ones are no good either and the physical tools aren't something you can suggest future success either.  So no, Sexton doesn't get a max. He is a great example of the antithesis of Jamal Murray however in how teams properly evaluate players."
"&gt;You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract.   No it's not. Sexton just posted better numbers and they didn't want to give him 100mil. It wasn't shocking that he was inconsistent, it was shocking how inconsistent he was and it was shocking that he hadn't improved on it since coming to the league.  &gt;Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up.  His playmaking improved a bit, huge is a hyperbole and you know it. He upped his assists by 1.4 and still struggled to get the ball to Jokic in the post. As for his so called defensive improvement i would suggest you take a look at him attempting to guard Derrick fucking White in the playoffs.  &gt;There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.  His growth wasn't linear. Going from year 2 to year 3, he improved his passing and his efficiency went down. Meanwhile every 5 games or so he would tweak something, or roll an ankle etc. And since i already used Sexton as an example-Sexton had 48 games where he scored 20+, Jamal had 28 in a longer season. His inconsistency was insane.    &gt;Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.  Everyone on here is upvoting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ql7zfd/comment/hj1pk64/) when i literally didn't say it. The opinion of the majority isn't always right.  Would you give Sexton the max though?"
"Not to directly compare the two, but people are always doing this with Derrick White too.  It‚Äôs infuriating.  Solid players the organizations have spent years developing just entering their primes, nah expendable."
They'd favs over kyrie less brooklyn had they got hield instead and added maybe another starting  point god  like derrick white instead..alas we will have to this through
I think the spurs would do it. Something like Thad Young and Derrick White for Porzingis and a few picks. Spurs reportedly have had interest in Porzingis and we are trying to get picks. White is actually good and on a reasonable long term contract and Young is good too but only 1 year left.
"Not a PF but if they just need a backup big to take up minutes and start in case of injury, Derrick Favors seems like a solid fit for them. Could salary match with DJJ and still keep Coby White to use in a potential separate trade or just to play him"
"Spurs.  Mostly positive.  The effort level is inspiring and the team competes hard.  Their record reflects the talent level, but until the Indy game, they were competitive every night.    Some of the talent hasn‚Äôt taken the step I hoped for (primarily Lonnie Walker and Derrick White, who seem to have plateaued), but it‚Äôs a developmental year, so too early to judge them harshly.  We won‚Äôt see the Spurs lottery pick (Primo) until late in the season.  Murray‚Äôs attitude as a leader has been huge, and he is the heart and soul of the team that was needed once Patty Mills left.  Keldon is in a slump, but is still on the right track.  Poeltl has been great and worth every penny.   Spurs are at 2-5, which is expected.  They need 24 to get the record for Pop, which is achievable.  They‚Äôre on track to be a bottom-5 team that competes every night, which is all I could hope for."

"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."
"Derrick White??? He was out, it was a fair game"
We dont have Derrick White tho
"Vassell hasn't been playing a lot other than preseason and last game. But man, oh lord he's good. You might not say it by just looking at the stats but his defensive instinct and team defense is crazy and already elite. It's crazy how much this guy play team defense and help everyone get in position and slow down a lot other team offense. In Preseason nd Last Game he showed that he has no fear to let it fly when it's his time. He scored crazy clutch points against the Clippers! In Preseason he was gettin more touches and now less but it's nice since Pop prolly prefer to let guys like Patty Mills and Rudy Gay shoot more than a rookie but when it happens to him he has no problem and let it fly. Yeah he still needs to improve but he is already a nice role and bench player. Once Derrick White comes back I think he will see his minutes decrease or even totally disappear, unfortunately, but he has a long way, especially next year since all our vets finish their contract.  What about Jalen Smith man? I wanted him sooo badly since he has the perfect skills and everything you need from a center nowadays and it's one of the position we need to improve the most."
"Coby White, Derrick White, Royce White, DJ White, Hassan Whiteside"
"Coby White, Isaiah Whitehead, Derrick White, Okaro White, Hassan Whiteside"
"Derrick White. Bates-Diop hasn't played for a reason, he's not very good"
"I'm not gonna say greatest game, but as for ones I've watched, LMA dropping 50+ on Steven Adams head to win the game in OT was great. i remember Derrick White getting a chasedown block on Jerami Grant who was destroying us basically to win the game. probably the most fun I've had watching a regular season game."
Dejounte Murray   Derrick white   Keldon Johnson   Devin Vassell  Lonnie Walker   Jakob Poetl   Derozan and Aldridge
"He kinda has no choice atm. There is no gleague Luka Samanic, Trey Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Keita Bapes Diop are all playing like shit and Derrick White is out but of course he has shown that he can be useful."
"Man Dejounte has clearly improved his game again this offseason but I do not want him to be the primary ball handler at the end of games. Leave that to Derrick White when healthy and DeMar. DeMar was clearly pissed when they told Dejounte to call the play with about 40 seconds and for good reason, we didn't have any semblance of a decent play after that. DeMar did not play well tonight but he's much more reliable than Dejounte."
"Considering Derrick White only played one game so far, and was on a minutes restriction, I think it‚Äôs possible lol"
" Spurs, almost 8  DeMar DeRozan 21.3  DeJounte Murray 15.0  Keldon Johnson 16.2  Lonnie Walker 12.7  LaMarcus Aldridge 12.0  Rudy Gay 12.2  Party Mills 12.3  Derrick White 9.0 almost"
"Lonnie Walker IV, Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, DeMar DeRozan (on expiring not sure if we‚Äôre bring him back next season), Luka Samanic (could take a risk on not protecting him not like he‚Äôs on teams‚Äô radars), maybe mills?"
"Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, DeMar DeRozan, Luka Samanic"
"We really have a terrible luck with our guards. When Dejounte seemed to be making the jump, he got injured and lost an entire season. Now Derrick White who's our floor general is gone for now."
Derrick White getting hurt after playing 1 game. Spurs season is already over.
Dejonte felt more proven. Kinda forgot how old Derrick white was when he entered the league. Really it should be Vassell keldon and walker.
I'm 100% biased. That spurs core is going to be solid. OP didn't even mention Dejounte who's younger than Derrick White.
Derrick white is 26
"Rudy was better than Eubanks at least. Where missing LMA killed us was on offense. It really helps to have someone pulling Gobert away from the rim.  The Jazz are always good at not allowing 3pt attempts because they never have to help on PnR with Gobert in the paint. You have to break them down from the mid range or attack Gobert with strength, but with Derrick White out and Dejounte off, we didn't have the firepower to do it."
"i see a lot of players with a chance honestly   Jarrett Allen and LeVert, Josh Hart, Harrell, Boucher, Dragon, Haliburton, LaMelo, Ingles, Clarkson, Derrick White, Bogdan, Gallo, Bertans"
Derrick White  Mikal Bridges  Keldon  Cam Johnson  Vucevic or something
My replay is a replay of what happened. What happened was Derrick white was completely moving. That‚Äôs not a charge in any way shape or form just admit you were wrong
It still baffles me how this was a thing. Hawks fans were literally getting downvoted for suggesting that Trae was better than Derrick fucking White last off-season lol.
For sure of course it's a spurs fan downplaying it those idiots were trying to have convos about derrick fucking white lmao
How they gonna turn on a guy they said is worse than Derrick White lmao
"&gt; The other loss was a close game to the Pelicans  Which was the second night of a back to back. We've played much better than our record shows, and Derrick White is just coming back from injury."
"Did you actually watch the game yesterday? Because this comment pretty much confirms you didn't. DeMar didn't guard Davis, like at all. Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Jakob Poeltl and Drew Eubanks were the primary defenders for him for the entirety of the game.   I'm not disagreeing that DeMar is a bad defender but you sure as hell didn't come to that conclusion by watching the game..."
"Naw, DeMar and the rove of guards can all shoot, dribble, drive, and dish. They attack the basket relentlessly and with efficiency, and they swarm on defense as best they can. They're good. They can't compare to Timmy era spurs, early or late end, but they're still good alright.  DeJounte looks ready, Keldon Johnson looks like the real deal, Derrick White is back, Lonnie Walker is hitting 3s, and most importantly y'all got rid of Bryn Forbes. God he blew."
"Yeah everyone always talks about how 'who can beat a lineup of Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD, AD, Draymond, Klay, Dame, etc etc etc etc. But since when do all those players actually choose to opt in?   The last us Olympic team was Kyrie/Lowry, Klay/Jimmy/DeMar, KD/PG/Melo, Harrison Barnes/Draymond, Boogie/DAJ. Which obviously still won gold and most years would also still win gold, but I wouldn't exactly call currently Melo, Harrison Barnes, DeAndre Jordan or Kyle and DeMar the top of the top talent. Great players, especially at the time, but not exactly the best of the best.   It gets even worse when you look at the last world cup roster  Kemba/Smart/Derrick White  Mitchell/Joe Harris  Middleton/Jaylen  Tatum/Barnes  BroLo/Turner/Plumlee  I know American players tend to care more about the Olympics than the world cup, but like................"
I like Duncan but Ive noticed one of his huge blind spots is he writes young guys off way too soon.  If they look bad their rookie year he's quick to give up on them. Same thing happened with Derrick White.
This ain't motherfucking luka or Derrick white you better be guarding that boy 35 feet.
"So we just going to act like Lebron didn't just elbow and manhandle Derrick White with 30 secs left???? Right in front of a ref!! Clearly an offensive foul.  Even the commentators laughed and said ""I guess the ref are letting the players to decide the ballgame""..  But yeah, pretend that the refs were trying to hand the W to the spurs"
How do you fake getting bulldozed by LeBron? Do you seriously think Derrick White is strong enough to get shoved by LeBron like that and not go to ground?
Ah yes blatantly ignoring LeBron shoving Derrick White for the bucket that iced it is ‚Äútrying to hand the Spurs the game‚Äù
Anyone want Derrick White now?
lol Derrick White just a toooouch out of rhythm
You must‚Äôve heard Derrick white back
Derrick White.
"When they chose Derrick White over Trae due to Pops nepotism, I knew it was over. Plus guess what Team USA lacked the most? A floor general.."
I'm expecting big things from keldon and derrick white this season
Sure just like how Derrick White was such a beast in 2019 right?
"man if we somehow got Derrick White out of that, i'd be all for it. Vuc, Thad, and PAW all make Lauri more replaceable"

Derrick white has been hanging out with thrill at the softball celebrity all star game.  He may he recruiting him
"&gt; His teams underperform  how exactly?  we were predicted to be the 12th seed by espn and ended up being the 10th. we had a team with no allstars and mostly late first round picks, while we shipped off lamarcus halfway through the season?  and that's all with the fact that our entire team got covid struck halfway through the season, demar had to take multiple games off due to his dad passing away, and our second best player (derrick white) missed half the season due to injury.   im really not sure how u would define that as underperforming?   &gt; There‚Äôs no evidence whatsoever that he‚Äôs an elite coach in today‚Äôs game.  16/17 season???"
Should have picked up Derrick White
idk what these people are talking about. I guess cause he picked his own player Derrick White over Trae he must hate him?
"The olympic team is a different beast. World cup teams have guys like Plumdog, Derrick White, Faried, etc."
"&gt; Yeah, Coach K just needed arguably the greatest roster ever assembled to pull it off.  In that case, why has Pop never recruited the greatest Olympic rosters then? Why did he leave off promising players like Bam or Trae at home while his favorite Derrick White led the Americans to a shameful display at the World Cup?"
"Gosh, all those people arguing that Derrick White was more valuable than Trae Toung smh"
"As opposed to Derrick White who was a sophomore averaging 9,9 points a game"
Had to make room for Derrick White again?
Pop should get one of his Spurs PG's in there. Demar? Dejounte Murray? Derrick White?
Behind Derrick White on the depth chart
Yeah but Derrick White defense
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"No idea, probably just a knock on effect from being close with Lloyd Pierce. He picked Derrick White over him for FIBA team that got shit on too."
"Probably worse? Bruh it‚Äôs obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
"Spurs really had 3 point guards last year, murray, white and derozan. Mill wasnt a point guard because he doesnt run an offense. Of the 3, derozan has better stats but derrick white is the most impactful of them because he's the more reliable shooter, can draw charges, block shots and generate steals. He is injury prone so far so that's the only knock on him"
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
"Dude has the worst trade suggestion I might have every seen, and that‚Äôs not even me being bias lmao   Mf said Derrick White AND Dejounte Murray for   Marcus Smart, Tristian Thompson,  Aaron Nesmtih and Payton Pritchard. I gotta get off this app lmao"
"So the plan is to intentionally trade 2 of our only good players for worse assets than what they‚Äôre worth? What is the logic in that? The ceiling of white and Murray isn‚Äôt what potentially brings a chip. They are supporting pieces. It‚Äôs the  players you add onto that, and  the players you develop with them that vaults you to that position.   ‚ÄúTank for first pick‚Äù   We can literally tank with those 2 on the roster without taking on worse players. And either way tanking doesn‚Äôt guarantee you get the 1st pick.   ‚ÄúAnd absorb bad contracts to get FR so finally found gems like Manu and Parker from late picks‚Äù   I‚Äôm 100% confused on what you meant by that statement so I‚Äôm just going to assume you meant take on bad contracts to get picks so we can get gems like manu and tony. In that terrible deal you suggested we got Tristan Thompson who has absolutely 0 positive value, Marcus Smart who is expiring and 2 players at rookie deals at positions which we literally do not need. On top of that no picks whatsoever. And the Spurs have already found and developed gems with late picks; those being Derrick White and Dejounte Murray both of whom were 29th picks, and both of whom who aren‚Äôt getting traded for scraps to the Celtics."
Derrick white tradeable
Trae Young for Derrick White: who says no?
"Nah, Dame for Derrick White sounds like a better trade for everyone in my unbiased opinion"
Derrick White over Trae.
"yeah, but Tatum turned his ankle and didn't finish out the tourney, also frankly I like this team much better than the 2019 roster.  A good chunk of that roster is significantly below this squad (Plumlee, Harris, Smart, Barnes, Myles Turner for sure and also Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba &amp; Derrick White)"
San Antonio was without Derrick White for 3/4 of the season and he is arguably our second best player.   Its clear you have no idea what your talking about and just making up stuff to fit your narrative.
"I don‚Äôt know why you list Lonzo as if he‚Äôs like this great player.   Haliburton is okay and was a rookie  but was hurt in the latter portion of the year. I wouldn‚Äôt say he is better than Derrick White (who, granted, also was hurt).   Derozan is still a solid player, as well as Murray. Millls and Gay coming off the bench are very good players to have coming off your bench. Better than anything NO or SAC has to offer coming off the bench."
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
"doesn't start for the spurs. Dejounte, Lonnie, Derrick White do"
Just because Pop is a great coach doesnt mean he's infallible.  It doesnt take a genius to realize Trae Young and Bam &gt; Derrick White and Plumlee
"Well, at least he wouldn‚Äôt put Derrick White on the team again"
Derrick White was 2nd in blocked shots and 2nd in charges taken this yr at the guard spot. He played 25 games‚Ä¶and was 2nd in the NBA in both. He‚Äôs an elite defender and a plus offensive player. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard not to eyeroll all of r/nba talking about players they don‚Äôt watch.  Then in a year or two we get to hear how underrated DWhites career is.
"Derrick white is as average as it gets dude. 18 million for him is wild. 15 a game on below average efficiency is not even close to worth that.   Murray is a great defender, but a bad offensive player at a position where defense means relatively little  There's so many better guys that make significantly less than them"
"You tried with DeMar and LMA. But then it clearly wasn't working. But you didn't recognize that and instead have let those guys turn into no value. Now you have a team of role players that are too good to tank but not good enough to make the playoffs   You needed to trade LMA and DeMar, then tank.   (Derrick white is 100% overpaid though. And I think Murray is too)  You don't think a Portland fan knows what it's like being a small market franchise that's consistently good?"
"That isn't him being heavy footed that's him having a high, slow handle. OG has quick feet as we can see on defense, but his handle being not up to par really limits his quicks on offense. Look at OG moving off ball especially coming off screens and pin downs then him with the ball in his hand. He isn't like a Saddiq Bey who is a little slow with and without the ball, he clearly is being hampered cause of the lack of a strong handle. I also don't think he has much burst due to his handle which is why he's ball handling is limited to PnR off the wing rather than up top where burst is needed more to create seperation, off the catch or in the post.  Its in fans nature to want to big up their players, and it is true that he had improved from the below 30s he was shooting as a rookie and sophomore to his slightly below average 35.9%, but I expected a regression of sorts because that season was an outlier from his previous season in terms of percentage and volume.  Did I say he is worth it? I said any player who was a second option on a championship team is getting a max. I also said he is a valuable player who is not a very good but a legit elite defender as well as showing improvement as a ball handler and playmaker in spite of his regression as a shooter. Even with that regression he has put up a comparable but slightly lower PPG and efficiency (per100 from 30.9 points to 28.9, 55.4 TS to 54.7%). Is he worth the max right now based on this season? No. Would any player who was in the position Siakam was putting up what he put up doing what he did going into free agency after a championship they'd get the max as well. I actually was against extending Siakam for the max as we could have just waited for his RFA and if he gets a max offer from another team then we match it, if not we offer him a cheaper deal.  &gt; If OG shoots under 35% from three this next year you can take the 3 out of 3-d and that contract starts looking like ass.  A career 37.5% shooter who has shot two seasons in a row at and above 39% isn't regressing to under 35%. OG isn't Nick Anderson, you're teaching super hard right now my guy. He isn't a Siakam where he had one true decent shooting season, he has a track record of being a great shooter.  Any player can regress, but acting like OG going from 39.7% this season, 39.0% last year and 37.5% for his career to below 35% is a longer reach than OG, Giannis and Jonathon Isaac wingspans. At this point it is absolutely a team friendly deal even if he regresses to his career average of 37.5% let alone staying steady at this season's production. Derrick White putting up 15/3/3 shooting 41/35/85 got 4 years 70M, the difference between White and OG as players and assets isn't so small that 2M makes it up. If OG went to RFA, he is getting more than 72M easy."
Worst thing was people justifying this shit at the time. There‚Äôs a reason Derrick White is still infamous on the Hawks sub.   We really had dumbasses on here saying Derrick fucking White was more valuable than Trae Young because of defense. It wasn‚Äôt an controversial opinion either
"No, I said team friendly. When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M, then OG for 4 years 72M is below market value and a team friendly deal.  A player doesn't have to be top 30 to not want them to be traded outside of for a star or for a franchise to value them."
"Joe Harris is an overpay but guess what? It is those types of overpays that are then used to negotiate larger deals. No player or agent is going ""Joe Harris is a nuts overpay so let's not even try to ask for something in that ball park or more."" Even going back to before the extension you had people like Zach Lowe who were saying they thought OG would get closer to 90 million for four years. If Derrick White is getting 70M over 4 years, OG signing for 72M over 4 years is team friendly.  It isn't about what is ""fair"" it's about what you can demand. The Raptors lucked out by extending him before this season where he took a big jump on both ends of the floor."
"4 Years 72 Million isn't team friendly for a player of OGs caliber to you? When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M. None of them offer equivalent value on the court that OG brings or as an asset so yeah, OG getting locked in at his current extension is team friendly."
Fucking Derrick White was picked over Trae Young and Bam
"Don't have anything against my fellow Brazilians, but they haven't won any medal on WC or Olympics for 40 years. I don't see them as a basketball nation at all. Volleyball and football, huge yes.  It is strange that Serbia who played 3 finals in last 4 major competitions and won 5th on WC last time won't play.  It is strange that Greece with the best player in the world and team who was until recently the only who beat USA won't play. At Olympics which they invented.  It is strange that Canada who has most of the NBA players after Americans won't play.  And of course, it could be a national crisis for Baltic that Lithuania didn't qualify and indeed it is strange.  But that happens when FIBA makes a political war with other bodies and all the good teams who have their players in international teams cannot play for qualifications, while worse teams have their core always ready. That's how Croatia loses against Hungary, Serbia against Switzerland, Greece against Bosnia.  It is not the only problem of course, we can discuss it, but if you don't get your Visa on previous competition, your coach has so many challenges to make a team which will get it and later tell some of these guys they won't play because of the arrival of NBA players on their spot.   Also, NBA plays a big role of conditioning international players for choosing to play for National teams. But that topic can be catchy, at least you got me wrong last time. You guys from USA have a different view on our European pride and right to tell who has an obligation to play for their country. American players on the other hand, fight for their position in the team USA every 4 years because OG give them a chance to make more money. On WC and other FIBA competitions, you play with Derrick White and Joe Harris, but still find yourself woke enough to give Serbs lessons for being angry on the MVP for riding a horse while his compatriots are getting rekt by Italians who cannot miss. Cheers."
I‚Äôm not ready for Trae with an even bigger chip on his shoulder than the time Pop ditched him for Derrick White on the FIBA WC roster
How's Derrick White and Lonnie Walker btw?
"They have 3 actual contracts left on the team at this point.   Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, and Jakob Poeltl.   What free agents are looking at that and going ""Yeah this is where we want to spend the next portion of our careers""?  Not to mention Pop is going to be 73 heading into next season.   The only free agent they've ever really gotten was Aldridge, and he went when they had Kawhi, Duncan, the rest of their amazing supporting cast, and fresh off of a 55 win seasons (two seasons removed from a championship).   You can have an infinite amount of cap space but if you're not primed to win then it's not going to get you anywhere."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
If only we had Derrick White.
"The difference is that WC team had their 4th-5th choices for the majority of the slots. No offence to Derrick White and Mason Plumlee, but they‚Äôre not exactly on the same level as Lillard and Adebayo. There‚Äôs like 4 players from that WC team that would get on this Olympic team and even then only 2 of them would probably get extended minutes.  Imagine any other national team having to forego even their first options for the starting five, probably couldn‚Äôt even qualify.   (Still not sure wth Love is doing on this team tho lol)"
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that‚Äôs also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
Dejounte Murray or Derrick White
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"Derrick White, he's our second best player. I'd do DeMar s/t + Derrick + 12 for some kind of Simmons trade."
Derrick White
"I agree Jackson is arguably the better coach, but the way this worded makes Pop seem carried by Duncan and blames him for Kawhi which is 100% not true. Duncan as good as he was wasn't the reason Tony Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi all developed into good players. This also doesn't take into account the insane amount of player Pop brought the best out of players like Patty Mills, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, George Hill, Danny Green, Dejuan Blair, and the list goes on. The guy is a minimum Top 5 coach all time minimum and I would go even as far as to say he's probably higher than that. I think the idea that he's overrated is just simply not true."
"Critical race theory (CRT) is an academic movement of civil-rights scholars and activists in the United States who seek to critically examine U.S. law as it intersects with issues of race in the U.S. and to challenge mainstream American liberal approaches to racial justice.[1][2] CRT examines social, cultural and legal issues as they relate to race and racism in the United States[3][4] and, more recently, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.[5][6][7][8]  CRT originated in the mid-1970s in the writings of several American legal scholars, including Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman, Kimberl√© Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, Cheryl Harris, Charles R. Lawrence III, Mari Matsuda, and Patricia J. Williams.[1] It emerged as a movement by the 1980s, reworking theories of critical legal studies (CLS) with more focus on race.[1][9] CRT is grounded in critical theory[10] and draws from thinkers such as Antonio Gramsci, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and W. E. B. DuBois, as well as the Black Power, Chicano, and radical feminist movements from the 1960s and 1970s.[1]  While critical race theorists do not all share the same beliefs,[2] the basic tenets of CRT include that racism and disparate racial outcomes are the result of complex, changing and often subtle social and institutional dynamics, rather than explicit and intentional prejudices on the part of individuals.[11][12] CRT scholars also view race and white supremacy as an intersectional social construction[11] which serves to uphold the interests of white people[13] against those of marginalized communities at large.[14][15][16] In the field of legal studies, CRT emphasizes that merely making laws colorblind on paper may not be enough to make the application of the laws colorblind; ostensibly colorblind laws can be applied in racially discriminatory ways.[17] Intersectionality ‚Äì which emphasizes that race can intersect with other identities (such as gender and class) to produce complex combinations of power and disadvantage ‚Äì is a key CRT concept.[18]  Good enough ? This is widely seen as one of the more popular definitions. I could try posting a longer pdf if need be but this can all be found online"
"Portland would have made out way better just keeping the picks and choosing any two of Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White instead."
Derrick White as well
i mean this is the guy that vouched for derrick *white* last time
Hopefully he can become as good as Derrick white one dayüôè
Derrick White played for USA during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. There‚Äôs definitely cronyism with coaches playing favorites but White also had a history with the program
"If you want to see it as wasting a roster spot, I‚Äôm not gonna argue with that. Plumlee was selected because they preferred someone who had a history with the program, it was not racial. Same reason Harrison Barnes and Derrick White made the team over Bam"
"tru, the seniority of derrick white over trae young last time worked out well /s"
That doesn‚Äôt fix your spacing it actually compounds the issue because Murray and Derozan also aren‚Äôt three point shooters. It would be like splitting Ben Simmons into two players who aren‚Äôt as good as him.  Shouldn‚Äôt you only care about fit around Embiid if you are gonna take a talent hit anyway.  Like Derrick White and Patty Mills are way better fits even if they aren‚Äôt as talented as players.  Embiid just needs 4 elite trustworthy shooters around him and Philly could be a top 3 offense because no one can guard Embiid one on one and he‚Äôs have to be hard doubled.
"can't win a title without a bench- *possibly* swap out either thybulle or maxey for milton, but 3 for 1 rotation players for a mega-max player, on a team with another max (harris) and another mega-max (embiid)... I don't think that's getting it done.  which is to say, I don't think philly can put together the best package for dame unless portland wants their picks.  look at it this way: if its simmons for derrick white basically straight up, and then philly can trade all its picks for *other* players in the future, that team is just as if not more dangerous."
Cause Derrick White is better
"#Perfect offseason  Tatum recruits Bradley Beal during the olympics, he requests a trade to Boston and we trade Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a decade of picks and swaps for him  #Realistic offseason   Re-sign Fournier to a 3 year deal around 40-45m   Trade for a good starting PG like Derrick White or Ricky Rubio  Agree to a cheap extension for Timelord"
"Same exact issue with the Bulls, our owner Reinsdorf has his guys and doesn‚Äôt care about the results. Had Garpax for nearly 20 years with no success outside of the Derrick Rose blip in the middle, which they lucked into   He also owns the white Sox and does the same things, hired Tony La Russa to be manager for our stacked roster when everyone else in the org was against it. Would be like if the Pelicans or Mavs hired Larry Brown right now   Billionaires bro, they have one big break and think they know better than everyone else in every situation for the rest of eternity. In Reinsdorf‚Äôs case, his big break was buying the team the year they drafted Michael Jordan and coasting off that"
"2018? Do you mean the World Cup in 2019? That team had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee getting minutes. Taking out Kevin Love, everyone else on the Olympic team is an All-Star caliber player at minimum."
Well Pop picked Derrick White over Fox and Trae so he couldn't have cared that much
"Yeah we‚Äôre in purgatory now, but bleakest future in the league?! Not at all. I think the Magic have it worse right now, probably even the T Wolves too.   Derrick White was playing some solid ball before his ankle injury and we were threatening to get to at least 7th before that happened. DJ‚Äôs improved his offense each year and is becoming a triple double threat each night. Keldon is blossoming quicker than anyone thought. We don‚Äôt yet know what‚Äôll happen with our three oldest guys, but I still don‚Äôt think we have the bleakest future in the league even if they each depart and we rebuild."
"The thing about the spurs is they're extremely reliant on Derrick White right now. The spurs played like garbage the last third of the season after White got hurt. It's what I expected to happen after he got hurt in his first game of the season.   Our 3 pt shooting is insanely bad and could get even worse if we let Rudy walk. Also I think the amazing defense the spurs played the first half to two thirds of the season was kind of an anomaly. I don't expect us to be much better than a mediocre defensive team going forward even with good defenders like Murray, White, Poeltl, and Vassell on the roster. Walker and Johnson played terrible defense most of the season."
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"

"Trade away Demar not Dejounte. Keep the young coreof Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell and Luka Samanic.  Then have Chip Engelland work with Ben on that shot."
It literally was check our subreddit we keep receipts lmao mfers said Derrick white was better than Trae
"We still competed for a playoff spot despite the second hardest schedule after the ASG, Derrick White injury, and Covid.  Are the Spurs on the verge of being a contender? No of course not. But look at the roster and tell me another coach besides Pop who has the team in the play-in. As long as Pop is coaching and half the team doesn't die there's zero chance we're bottom 3."
Derrick White
Derrick White deserves his spot on the team over Trae easily
"Derrick White, Ben Simmons, and Lonzo"
Trae?  You mean Derrick White
"Trae Young? You must be mistaken, I think you meant to write Derrick White"
&lt; Derrick White
Not all nba caliber  Not a superstar  Not even a star  Is he even good at basketball? Did you see Jevon Carter put the clamps on him in Summer League? Bust. Rather build a team around Derrick White or Ben Simmons.  I only read /r/NBA tho.
I‚Äôm still taking Derrick white over him tbh
"That team was flawed and just not very deep. That team also had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee on it. If you would've taken two of those guys off and replaced them with Durant and Dame that probably changes things significantly. That team didn't have *The Guy*"
If that + was something besides Derrick white then maybe but he‚Äôs on a great contract and probably our most impactful player when healthy
"Not the worst trade I‚Äôve ever seen, but Derrick White will be 27 next year and has an injury history. He doesn‚Äôt match the Magic‚Äôs timeline at all, especially with Hampton/Fultz/Anthony at the guard spots.  I personally think this draft is a crapshoot outside of the top four guys. Kuminga is wildly raw, not at all a sure-fire prospect and much more raw than Patrick Williams was last year. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a prospect worth trading up for."
"Spurs got some really likeable guys like Keldon Johnson and some really entertaining players like Derrick White, DeRozan, and Dejounte Murray. End of the boring era?"
No Derrick White? What was Pop thinking smh
"I read a [solid article](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/) explaining what kind of coach she is. Basically a player's coach in the mold of Pop (obviously) and someone who's not afraid to push her players. Not to mention she was instrumental in developing the young guys in SA. From the article:  &gt;She‚Äôs a noble leader, one who connects with players and teaches them to be the best versions of themselves. Her imprint has made a noticeable impact on the growth and development of young players like Bryn Forbes and Derrick White. Hammon‚Äôs guard expertise in her own playing days made her a one-of-a-kind point guard and now, she‚Äôs instilling those floor general qualities in the next generation of Spurs.     I'd imagine her background as a guard should help her work with Lillard and, should the team decide to blow it up and trade Damian, she'll be around to mentor any young players they get back."
"I'm just saying hed be able to cover for Seth Curry defensively and he wouldn't be a liability on offense. he isn't as good as Ben Simmons in a vacuum. he's a better fit on some teams, though. I would love nothing more than to trade DeRozan for Ben, honestly, more than DJ. it helps both teams. if I'm the Sixers, I demand Derrick White before anyone else on our team."
"Valid point. Counterpoint: Pop also realizes when shoving a round peg into a square hole isn‚Äôt the right approach.  It was front page stuff when Pop and Aldridge had dinner all those years ago and Pop realized he should have let Aldridge be himself a little more. This is also the man who played Derrick White at small ball C the last season and in the bubble to fit around DeRozan‚Äôs discomfort extending his range.  I‚Äôm not saying Pop is gonna be complacent with Ben, but I also think there‚Äôs been a lack of creativity from Brett Brown and Doc between creating a more cohesive 48 minute plan between Ben and Joel. Pop is measuredly more creative then those 2"
"When you straight up cut guys like Bam, Fox, and Trae and instead select guys like Plumlee and Derrick White I'm not sure you get to complain about not having enough talent.    And that roster still had more than enough talent to win the tournament or at least finish much higher than 7th."
No. Y‚Äôall can take Derrick white üòÇ
"Their 2 highest paid players next year will be Dejounte Murray and Derrick White at $15M and the Spurs would not want to trade them. If you combine everyone else left on the roster next year, it does not even reach $30M so they don't have enough salary filler to throw into the trade.   The only possible way is if another team does a sign and trade for DeRozan so that they can create a trade exception and get Ben Simmons that way, but that would mean some team is willing to sign him for $33M next year which I don't see happening."
Give it to Derrick white obviously
"Ben for Derrick White, Lonnie, and a protected 1st"
"2019 29th pick Keldon Johnson  2017 29th pick Derrick White  2016 29th pick Dejounte Murray  2014 30th pick Kyle Anderson  These are all picks within the last decade that are solid role players for any team. All picked late first round, which is more than what some teams hope to get at that spot. Maybe I'm wrong and Primo becomes a bust, but their track record has been pretty good imo"
Trade you Derrick White for your rooks
"I really wonder what the fuck the timeline for this team is, we have a ton of guards and Derrick White for example is 27 years old something has to give"
A super raw guard? Very odd. Guess we might see a Derrick White trade soon
"Yes yes front office  we have Lonnie Walker, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Patty Mills as our guards so lets take ANOTHER ONE"
Derrick White and Dejounte Murray are dope though
"Dejounte Murray, Derrick white, two firsts"
"i realize Jrue Holiday and getting off Bledsoe warranted five picks, but Daryl's crazy if he thinks any other team is ""one Ben Simmons away"" from resigning a Giannis-esque player and winning a chip lol there is zero chance if the asking price remains SEVEN picks and a DeJounte Murray or Derrick White level player."
"Parker and Ginobilli were from 20 years ago. Stop thinking that Spurs could consistently pull an all-star from low 20s pick.  People conveniently like to forget the mediocrity of Loonie, Derrick White, Slomo, Cory Joseph, George Hill, Splitter or the absolute disaster like James Anderson, Dejuan Blair and Ian Mahinmi.  Whether Pop wants to admit it or not, the Spurs has entered the rebuilding mode. It's better for us to wait for an all-star potential player rather than getting a collection of mediocre players now.  I'd rather wait for Knicks to offer the 19th pick and Obi than 22nd and Kuzma"
"If the Spurs could get Ben Simmons for Derozan, Patty Mills (or Derrick White) and a first round pick. That would be great for the Spurs and better than the Brogdon offer the Sixers got from the Pacers.   If they want D White, they would have to throw in another player or two so just so the salaries match. If those salaries expire in the next 2 seasons, I don't think the Spurs would care"
"Contrary to popular belief on this sub, Simmons isn‚Äôt going to be traded for Derrick White and a protected first"
"This completely ignores the reality around Kawhi being an absolute Nephew with Uncle Dennis. They both, purposely, devalued Kawhi so they could try and get traded to a team with as many pieces as possible.  &amp;#x200B;  Pop is not a dumbass. Receiving an All star, a top of the line defensive center and Derrick white is a good trade because it was the most the spurs could get."
I don't think any trade for him makes sense for both teams. I might consider trading Derrick White but Ben Simmons would be a bad fit next to Murray. I would consider trading Dejounte but he has stepped up as the clear leader of the team and makes significant improvements every offseason. Zero chance I would trade both Dejounte and Derrick for him.  I'd consider trading Keldon and this year's first I guess but there's no trade that makes sense for both teams imo.

He also has a say in the team being built so its no real excuse for him either. I mean we've had back to back tourneys where he's taken a young spurs player over guys that were way more deserving lol with Derrick White in the world cup over Trae and Fox and Keldom Johnson over a multitude of players really
If anything we trade Derrick white cause he is who he is at this point
I feel like I see more and more blame going to coaches than ever before. Every single time the Bucks would lose a game it was because Bud was the worst coach in the league and every time they won it was in spite of his shitty coaching.   I‚Äôve seen people say Pop isn‚Äôt good anymore because the Spurs haven‚Äôt played well the past two years as if two of his three best players aren‚Äôt Dejounte Murray and Derrick White. Like a different coach would take the Spurs roster to the 5th seed.
"The spurs went 6-5 without DeMar this season with Derrick White out half the year. So unless you think the spurs would've gone literally 3-58 the rest of the season if DeMar missed the whole year, no we will not be as bad as the process sixers lmao.  Depending on how free agency goes, I expect us to be about as good as we were this year."
Pop should‚Äôve brought in Derrick White again to put Team USA over the top üí™
"I've got this idea in my head that they could get Terry Rozier and Derrick White in a 3 teamer, that's about it though"
"Theres no point trading him for Hield or Brogdon. That really would be bottom of the barrel.  If not Beal, Lillard or Lavine, my ideal package is Dejounte, Derrick White and the 9 pick from the Spurs."
"No all star caliber players were playing on the select team, that's not what it's for.    They cut Trae for Derrick White in 2019, why would he come back to play with a bunch of first and second year guys to let Pop and LP send him away again?"
"Right, I‚Äôm sure a roster with Derrick white, joe Harris, Marcus smart, Harrison Barnes and mason plumlee was the very best they could send. If the best players cared they would be there"
Add Derrick White to the list.
"The thing is, in half the threads talking about Derrick White there's still almost always a hawks fans going in there just to make fun of Derrick White. It's crazy how much they hate him."
Derrick White should've never sniff the team USA selection in 2019 but Pop stay pulling nepotistic shit. Same shit he did for Keldon this year.
It's wild to me how many users on this sub love to hate on young players. How many Hawks fans complained about how Trae was thought of but then went and trashed Derrick White whenever they got the chance for example?
"Pop is one of the main people in charge of picking the rosters though, do you think Derrick White and Keldon Johnson just randomly appeared on the squads?"
I mean he also brought Derrick white to the world cup over Trae and Fox so it's not a surprise
No that was definitely a fluke look at that fucking team lol. Derrick White made it over Trae Young
He went 5/21 and played his usual bad defense. He's not a great player but that was a bad game for him. Honestly I think he's only a little better than Derrick White.
Popovich ruined it by choosing derrick white over him in FIBA.
Patty Mills and Derrick White have both been taking off the dribble 3s regularly. I think it's clear they want Lonnie taking more 3s too but he doesn't have much confidence.
"You're completely ignoring the context of the spurs roster. Who exactly should've been taking more 3s on those teams? Parker was a bad 3 pt shooter. Even now, Kawhi doesn't take very many 3s considering how good he is at them. Aldridge didn't have confidence in taking 3s until his last few years. DeMar is terrible at 3s.  When Patty is on the court, he has the green light to take 3s basically whenever. Derrick White has started taking way more 3s. The real reason the spurs have so few 3PA is just because they don't have the roster to be taking tons of 3s."
"that comment is so misleading lmao. Fiba world cups are so different compared to the oympics where US can bring its best roster. That tournament you mentioned where they finished 7th, had some guys like brook lopez, derrick white, joe harris, harrison barnes clearly not the best roster lmao. Your insane if you don‚Äôt believe this roster rn has the potential with better coaching and chemistry to dominate this tournament. I see i international fans always say look at this obscure tournament or exhibition and say see the US isn‚Äôt good when there roster is horrible. This was the first olympic loss since 2004, the oympics are the only tournament US actually cares about lmaoo. Compared to past oympics other international teams should still be considered pushovers, they have played teams way better then this france or nigerian teams for example. There are plenty of problems with this roster and USA basketball but actual quality of players isn‚Äôt it, ppl love to shit on the US but in reality they could very realistically win gold lmao"
"No, I read on this sub the other day that Keldon Johnson totally deserves a place on this team.   Pop would never play favorites with the roster. The likes of Derrick White and Keldon Johnson are just better than Trae or Fox."
It wasn't Lonnie. It was derrick white
"His nepotism hurts the team so badly. Imagine Trae young instead of Derrick white in the fiba World Cup, or Literally anyone over keldon johnson"
Yup that's classic Pop in USA basketball. He's made questionable choices like choosing Derrick White over Fox who was already killing it
"Because the 2019 roster was even worse? Their best player was Kemba Walker and they were rolling out guys like Mason Plumlee, Brook Lopez, Kyle Kuzma, and Derrick White."
"That's a weird way of saying ""DeRozan S&amp;T, Derrick White and pick #12"""
"Trae Young Defensive win share 1.3   Notable guys worse than him Durant, Ntilikina, JJJ, Barnes, Rondo, Mills, SGA, Lillard, Fox , PJ Tucker, Horford, Derrick White, Dort, Ariza , Pat Bev. Lots of supposed great defenders on that list. See basketball reference."
"They have plenty of valuable role players and promising young talent, the oldest player they have on contract for 2021-22 is Derrick White (27). They won't make a push for a championship for a couple years, and that's okay."
"Getting Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, and Keldon Johnson at the 29th pick is incredible. In a redraft all those guys go in the lottery."
Derrick white for pick 28 and one of ur scrubs
"I really like what I see out of KJ in the Olympics and think he will develop into a very good starting player.  Derrick White is a very solid player.  DeJounte Murray looks like he can become an all star player based on his improvements every year. Will it happen? Who knows for sure but there is reason to believe it can with his talent. His defense is so good.  Lonnie Walker is promising, Poetl is VERY underrated great Rim protector.  The 12th pick is not a spot where you are likely to add a game changer even in this pretty deep draft. The Suns for example added Mikal Bridges around this pick when they were rebuilding and he has helped them improve. Then all it took was CP3 coming \[and Booker/Ayton developing\] to turn them into a huge winner.  Spurs if they drafted Duarte he can be really good then imagine this team:  Murray PG White SG Duarte G/F Keldon F Poetl C  Vassell, Walker, Samanic, Eubanks \[young but solid\]  that team will win 30-35 games in the West and be in lottery. In East would have made play in games and push for 8th seed.  Maybe you get better luck and win lottery? Maybe you package a bunch of good players for 1 great player? Maybe you finally sign a big time free agent in 2022 by paying the most? Spurs will have the most cap room that summer.  I don't think this is the year to go crazy. I say draft Duarte, let the Vets walk, get into the lottery and plan to start signing players in summer 2022. This is probably Pop last season he needs like 25 wins to be most all time so celebrate that and then rebuild next season with a new coach and go looking for a superstar."
"We took y‚Äôall‚Äôs *healthy team* into overtime without DeMar, DeJounte, Poetl, and Derrick White. Yall literally won by one bucket."
Derrick White and DJ are both on about 16mil a year lol   Good luck to whoever pays Schroeder 20+
"I think if he was next to a point guard like Derrick White or Malcolm Brogdon that can handle the ball and create for himself and others and can guard bigger guys than most point guards, he could do great. The problem with Sexton though is that the cavs also have Garland who is a good player but defensively it's not ideal to play them both."
"They turn into high level starters and all-stars for the Spurs and Raptors. See Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Kelvin Johnson, Siakam, FVV, Norman Powell."
And Derrick White
"Based on the Utah game, those somebodies are Tony Bradley and Derrick Jones Jr.  Coby White still hasn‚Äôt played a game yet either."
Derrick White
"We do, his name is Derrick White! But he is playing like a washed up version of Danny Green right now. He needs to come back and fast, or we keep losing these close games and end up in the top 5 for lottery‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Wait, is that good?"
I had hoped and prayed we would bring him home this year because he would fill a ton of needs we have off the bench. Him with coby white and Caruso would have been a sick ass bench. Still I am happy he is playing an extremely important role on the knicks and if NY some how made it to the finals I‚Äôd be rooting for Derrick to get his ring.
"Yeah Pop making me nervous with this shit, my guy picked Derrick White over Trae Young &amp; Fox, Plumlee over Bam and now he's interested in a washed Love."
If your sixers who you want Derrick white or dejounte As the centerpiece?
"Ah yes, but Derrick White has a higher +/-, so he‚Äôs obviously better than DeMar."
"Derrick white, Lonnie walker, pick 12?"
Well I'm not sure what they want but sure they can have Derrick white or Dejounte Murray according to Bowen Pop won't mind trading them.  But if they won't a scoring guard who's also a great passer I would still take proven all star Demar
"I dunno we stay hopeful Derrick white, Johnson, or walker can go to that next level"
The spurs have no one/money to trade. Half their roster is FA with the end of the season. No pieces to really entice the sixers. Derrick white or dejounte Murray? Better be ready to throw in a ton of picks.
"Hugely disagree. Demar was playmaking forward bc derrick white and dejounte missed time with injury. What does Ben give you that Simmons doesn't? More defense and less offense?   Spurs have great defenders already, itd definitely be win for Philly, lose for San Antonio so they need to add something to Simmons to make it work"
We have Dejounte Murray and a Derrick white backcourt. Already two defensive prowess guards that aren‚Äôt the best offensively. The last thing we need is to trade our best scorer for a slightly better Dejounte Murray that takes up 30% of our cap space.
"That's because we don't have anyone who is worth building around. Dejounte is a nice player, but he still can't consistently shoot the ball and he'll be 25 at the start of the season. He's not going to morph into an All-NBA guard at this point.  Derrick White looks like he's best suited to be a 3rd guard, has trouble staying healthy, and he'll be 27 in a couple of weeks. This might just be who he is. The ceiling for that backcourt isn't a title. Then what do we have? Lonnie Walker is one of the worst rotation players in the NBA on both ends.  Keldon Johnson gets lost on defense and can't shoot yet. Devin Vassel looks like a role player.  Jakob Poeltl is a 25 MPG defensive center who can't do shit on offense.   I have never been high on Ben Simmons, but he's better than anybody on our roster."
Derrick White
"There's some very good pieces on the Spurs, I'd get excited for Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, or Derrick White. Even a Demar sign/trade could be intriguing."
Never forget Pop picked Derrick fucking White over DeAaron Fox lmfao.
Well this time they won't be trying to ride the Celtics + Derrick White and Plumlee
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: DƒÅvis BertƒÅns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting BertƒÅns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
NBA coaches are the biggest scammers. They thought Derrick white was better than trae and that firing Lloyd pierce was a mistake.
"This is like the Derrick white over trae young argument, except even dumber."
"I don‚Äôt know if you know this, but the USA never sends its best players to the FIBA world cup. At best they get some younger stars in there. Mason Plumlee, Joe Harris and Derrick White we‚Äôre literally on the 2019 roster. So i think you‚Äôre the one who needs to pay more attention lmfao."
Didn't Booker commit too? Funny to see him mention Tatum and not Booker. Although Tatum is a massive improvement over the 2019 roster where Derrick White was a second rotation.
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."

Pop cutting Trae Young and Bam for Mason plumlee and derrick white was certainly a decision
"I don't think so. Prior to the all-star break and covid destroying our season we were as high as 4th in the West and had a top 10 defense. On top of that Dallas is a mess right now, Houston is bad for the next 2 to 3 years, and OKC has potential but no guarantees.  Going forward:  Dejounte at 24 is an all-defense level guard who can give you 15/8/6. Keldon Johnson is 21 and going to average 15/10 next year. Jak is 25 and is a top 5 defensive center at the worst. Derrick White is 27 and is a very good two-way guard who gives you 15/5/5.  We also have a 22 year old Lonnie Walker 6th man, a 21 year old Devin Vassell who is already a good 3&amp;D wing, and a 21 year old Luka Samanic.  That by itself is a good foundation of youth that has one or two all-star level talents (DJ and Keldon) and 3 or 4 very good role players. We also have 50 million in cap space (assuming Derozan and Gay walk), the GOAT coach, and a lottery pick in a deep draft.  If even one top 25 player came in a trade or FA we'd be looking at a guaranteed playoff seed (above the play-in cut off)."
I think Derrick White has star potential. Maybe Dejounte or Vassell  too. Not sure about Keldon though.
"i would take Pop over say a Carmelo/Chris Bosh type of player. When I say Pop I mean the whole Spurs FO that was able to scout, develop, coach Tony, Manu, Kawhi,  Derrick White, Tiago, Keldon Johnson, George Hill, DeJuan Blair, Dejounte Murray, Danny Green (cut by the worst team in the league), Aaron Baynes, Boban, Patty Mills (never played meaningful mins in Portland), Jonathan Simmons"
"DeJounte Murray because he's like Ed Reed in passing lanes and Derrick White because he's the best blocking guard since Dwyane Wade, unless you call Thybulle a guard rather than a wing."
"Ben for Eric Gordon,  Ben for John Wall,  Ben for Kemba,  3 Way - Ben to Bulls, Kemba to Sixers - Vuc to Celtics,  Ben for Love,  Ben for Pat Bev and Kennard,  The saddest trade ever = Ben for KP,  Ben for CJ,  Ben for KCP and Kuzma,  Ben for Derrick White,  Ben for Bledsoe,  Ben for Buddy,  Ben for Shia (saves sixers a lot of money as the Thunder have massive trade exceptions and the Thunder would get a premier tank commander)"
