"And him and Haliburton are gonna feast on steals from the rushed passes Davion forces opposing players to make. They’re both already good passing lane defenders with their length, anticipation and athleticism.   I’ve noticed a few games so far where you watch the game and it’s like Davion is everywhere on defense and creating all these turnovers with deflections and ball pressure, and it’s like “oh man he’s gotta have like 4 or 5 steals at least”. But you check the box score and he has one, while a couple of his teammates have like 4 to 5. Last night Louis King had 5 and Emanuel Terry had 5. He just brings the defensive intensity of the team up and creates a lot of opportunities for the team on that end."
"Yeah, a bunch of G-League players. Will Davis II, Justin Anderson, Brian Bowen II, Josh Gray, Shaq Harrison, Haywood Highsmith, BJ Johnson, Luke Kornet, Chasson Randle, Zavier Simpson, Emanuel Terry and Isaiah Thomas."
