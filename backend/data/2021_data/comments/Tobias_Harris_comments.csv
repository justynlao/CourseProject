"Imagine being Blake Griffin.    You're drafted by one of the worst organizations in the history of the NBA. A racist owner, horrible team management, team players themselves hating everything about organization, the whole 9 yards. You're Blake Griffin, however, and you do your best to put this organization on the map.    Griffin redshirts his 1st season due to injury, and in his 1st official season in the NBA, he wins ROTY and gets into the All-Star game as a rookie. You've turned this franchise around in just your first real season playing. The next season, the team capitalizes on your success and acquires Chris ""Point God"" Paul, and you and the team continue to have arguably successful season after successful season. Consistent playoff berths for one of the worst NBA organizations of all time for the better half of a decade. Their biggest downfall was just not making serious headway in the playoffs, with consistent First/Second round exits. That being said, you can't say those weren't successful seasons for the LA Clippers, considering their storied history.    At the end of the 2017 season, Blake Griffin had been expecting some sort of contract extension. He was, afterall, the face of the franchise for the better half of a decade. Blake Griffin wasn't expecting the biggest extension, heck he realized his own position at that point in his career, and was willing to work with the Clippers and compromise on a contract. When he walked into the extension, the Clippers had set up their room with various global icons, implying that Griffin would be an icon for the Clippers. Clippers employees wore custom made shirts featuring Griffin's face along with historic icons such as Obama, MLK, Gandhi, and Mandela. He was told that, as difficult as the times have been, the LA Clippers were committed to Griffin's future to the team. So according to Griffin, this was his team of the future. He was the face of the franchise, and he was offered a max contract from the get go. Of course, you accept a max contract, no matter who it is.   Just the next season after, approximately 6 months after the extension, the LA Clippers trade Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, a future 1st and a future 2nd. Talk about getting your back stabbed by one of the worst franchises in NBA history. Not to say that the Clippers did the wrong thing, we have all seen how Griffin has declined since his 1st Detroit Pistons season, but it's how they did it that makes them the bad guy. The LA Clippers didn't have to lie to Griffin like that. Sorry Blake, you deserve better."

Tobias Harris is putting up 20 a night on 54/46/83
"Only the Lakers or Clippers can compete with them in a series.  The 76ers are interesting. Embiid will actually abuse any small ball lineups they like to play unlike most bigs, but it will be up to Simmons and Tobias Harris to not disappear come playoff 4th quarters."
"I think he will miss if the Wizards remain last in the standings. For example if it's between Middleton and Beal I think Middleton will get votes since his team is much better, I could honestly even see Tobias Harris getting in ahead of him due to Philly's record.   They love rewarding teams with good record with multiple all-stars. Remember when Korver, Teague, Millsap and Horford all made it in 2015?"
wiggins and tobias harris are the two best contracts in the nba
The fact that Tobias Harris isn't even in you snubs list makes me question this list hard.
Starters for the all star game are voted in by fans chances are beal doesnt make it because of his terrible team record. Kyrie is one of the most popular players in the league So are harden and KD not to mention all of them are playing fantastically the fact you think simmons who is playing worse than last year and Tobias Harris would get in over our 3 is ridiculous
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.

"No.   Your list has zero consistency. Is it based on this year alone, since your claiming Hardens new role makes him not top ten. Then why is someone like Kemba over someone like Fox, or Randle, or to be honest, damn near everybody below him. Why is Jimmy Butler top 12???   Is your list cumulative, based on recent seasons? Then why is Westbrook at 45 under someone like Tobias Harris? Why is PG over Kawhi?  You have Bam over Luka. Seemingly because of defense? Yet you have KAT right over Bam, who is still not a better offensive player than Luka.   ... and I’m just not seeing Zions name on the list anywhere?   This list is disturbing"
"Worst part is the trade happening minutes after all their teary eyed interviews. Controversial opinion at this point but I felt it was a good trade at the time. If I went back in time, I'd do it again (keep Zhaire away from sesame oil this time). That Miami pick got them Tobias Harris and a better GM than Brand would've done more with it.  Also, super early but that Miami pick is looking tasty again (they'll turn it around though)."
I guess I see that as more like a Tobias Harris or Harrison Barnes type more than another guy similar to Love. Prince is kind of like a poor man’s version of that. Durant or George kind of the rich man’s version.
I thought Philly should start Shake Milton over Tobias Harris

How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Sixers:  Pleasant: Tobias Harris. Truly rewired his basketball brain this year and has almost entirely gotten rid of all his frustrating tendencies from last year. He’s a big positive on the floor, insanely consistent, and is a quick decision maker, shooter, and ball mover. Truly didn’t think it was possible but gleefully eating my words.  Unpleasant: Not much. Maybe Ben’s offense early the season, but he was clearly still recovering from injury (and was missing a disproportionate amount of layups) and has looked improved over a recent stretch. Dwight’s a great add to the team but I think people over-exaggerated how good he’d be, he’s a really bad fit with Simmons and we still need to acquire a stretch 4/5. The trio of Ben/Dwight/Matisse are just putrid, you can’t have two effective non-shooters on the floor with Simmons, but that’s fine, it’s still early, moves will be made. Pretty great start so far!  I’m a little less bullish on the Sixers playoffs prospects than some, but it’s beautiful to have a team that’s fun to watch and is moving in a positive direction again after the last few years of mismanagement."
But they’re not game wreckers. Tobias Harris and Jerami Grant aren’t dominating teams in the playoffs.  You put Drummond on the Nets or Clippers and he will ruin teams on the inside.
"I don’t think it’s a hot take to pick Murray over Tobias Harris, what are we doing here?"

Tobias Harris. He will never be that bad again haha.

Tobias Harris has really played great this season. Any Sixers fans that can tell me what happened between this year and last? Was he just not used to their offense last year?

"I’ve taken note that Tobias Harris is left off this list, not sure who you think you are"

Now, in what universe is that ""below average?""  I can tell this was the first time you've ever actually looked into his stats. You throw out ""below average"" without any research or any understanding as to how moronic that claim sounds.  How about you actually watch some of Tobias Harris because it's clear you really never have lmao"
"They won the Chip last year and improved their roster. AD's not playing like himself and Bron coasts _at least_ 2 quarters per game (except for 2-3 statement games), yet they're only one game behind the topseed in the entire NBA. They are the very real deal, although people will claim they're having problem since they lost 2 in a row recently against teams they should have won along with the 6ers matchup. That 6ers game they almost sleepwalked to the W btw, just came up short due to a Tobias Harris gamewinner.  Every year people forget what LeBron teams are capable of come playoff time so I'm ready for all sorts of weird narratives and arguments claiming team X is the _real_ team to beat, only to have the Lakers dominate the post season and suddenly everybody claiming they knew all along lol."

Next you'll be saying they should get Tobias Harris
"Tobias just finished a book about rockets and how they generate lift, and power  His teammates were curious, so he described it in laymen’s terms by doing this   And everyone learned something   TOBIAS HARRIS IS AN ALL-STAR!!"

He was one of the biggest people involved in the Say Her Name efforts for Breonna Taylor. If that ain't social justice I don't know what is."
"Karl Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, and Tobias Harris."
"He’s not kidding. NBA fans got angry at him for cheating on Tobias Harris with Luka, and we implemented this rule to punish him"
I’m not going to lie I didn’t see Tobias Harris being significantly better than Siakam this season
"&gt;The Raptors were playing against the Magic, and there were 3 Orlando players with whom I had something – one from before, and 2 who had just arrived via trade.  It's either two of Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, and Beno Udrih, or Von Wafer and Glen Davis. Leaning towards the latter."
sounds to me like this tobias harris guy must have extremely poor dribbling fundamentals and shouldn’t be even sniffing the all star game. shame because i had him on my ballot until your comment.
Are you saying it's better to be paying the ghost of Blake Griffen a max contract because he used to be good 5 years ago? Rather than Tobias Harris who is scoring efficiently from everywhere on the floor and has supplemented his lack of volume with top shelf defense on players who are already acknowledged as stars?  Okay then.
"Tobias Harris has taken more shots than Ben Simmons in every game theybe both played this season, you're not even trying to pretend like you're making a real argument right now.  E: Hell Simmons' season high is 15 shots, that's lower than Harris' per game average for the year"
"I'll try with you because every time someone says Tobias Harris is an All-Star I ask them, ""who does he beat to the team?"", and they don't reply. Just downvote and move along.      --       Who does Tobias Harris beat out for a front court spot in the East out of: Giannis, Embiid, KD, Brown, Tatum, Bam, Sabonis, Middleton, Randle, Vucevic, Hayward and Grant.      He has to beat out at least 5 of those players listed above to make the team."
"The trick is to sign an incredibly clutch player to a bargain contract, like the Sixers did with Tobias Harris"
"Tobias Harris and Trae Young is the most replaceable in the All star roster. And Bam, Sexton, and Zach will have the best chance to sneak in."
"If it's short term, I can see 8-12mil per year with options. He can easily be your 7th 8th guy off the bench, and provides good defense and shooting (even if it can be a bit streaky). Like, just watch him, on offense he is always cutting and moving. There's a reason him and Lebron had like the highest +/- last year lol. On defense, he's always a stud, and imo he played great D on Tobias Harris last night despite the big size difference, Tobias just hit the tough shot.  I'm hoping he re-ups with the Lakers for a cheaper and longer deal, maybe 3 years 21 mil, or a scaling one that's cheaper now but grows as Lebron gets older. Every team needs an Alex Caruso type player."
"Not when he needs to stop a Tobias Harris game winner. Overrated bald fraud. But hey, he is a young white guy so.........."
"The magic, trade vuc, Fournier, and ag. Funny scenario tho is what if they never traded oladipo Tobias Harris and sabonis"
"Didn't see Tobias Harris in there, he should also miss it in favor of Adebayo or Vucevic, maybe even Randle if he can keep it up."
"More like a bruised ego haha gottem, shoutout tobias harris"
"Once Curry passes back to Tobias with 5 seconds left, how does Lebron not force the switch with Caruso so he can guard Harris?   Maybe if the switch isn't executed well and Harris picks up on it, he could pass back to Curry, who would need at least some time to get rid of Caruso. All pretty tight for 5 seconds, but I'd rather have this scenario happen as a Laker fan than Harris taking Caruso down the lane for a high probability pull up on a short defender."
"That’s what the problem is. We know that Simmons cannot be the main ball handler for a championship team, so that duty is delegated to dudes like Tobias Harris or Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz, who are simply not good enough offensive engines."
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.   Mine are -   East:  Jaylen Brown  Brad Beal  Tobias Harris  Domantas Sabonis  Jerami Grant   West:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Chris Paul  Brandon Ingram  Paul George  Andrew Wiggins"
"If Tobias Harris can be counted, I don't see why Wood shouldn't."
The duality of tobias harris:.   Last night: makes clutch shot to win game  A few games ago: dribbles around and steps out of bounds in a very similar situation.
"&gt;The 6-11 Miami Heat don't own their own draft pick. It belongs to...the OKC Thunder, unprotected of course.  &gt;In 2015 the Heat traded their 2021 first round pick to the Suns for Goran Dragic.  &gt;The Suns traded this pick to the Sixers in 2018 to move up and take Mikal Bridges.  &gt;The Sixers traded it to the Clippers in the Tobias Harris trade.  &gt;And then the Clippers traded it to the Thunder for Paul George.  &gt;With the team ravaged by Covid, the team has dug themselves into a hole that will be difficult to recover from, and Sam Presti is rubbing his hands together.    Commenting to come back to this when the playoffs start. Say hi everyone"
"LbJ did the same thing AGAIN later in the game to Tobias Harris but he didn’t fall, and refs didn’t give the call."
"He'd have a better shot there than at a forward spot.  The stats are impressive, but for a forward reserve spot he's going against Middleton and Tatum. There may be an argument for him in one of the positionless spots (I have either Hayward or Tobias Harris there). Both of those guys are shooting lights out right now and with Tobias he's on the better team.  And you can make the same argument about Randle at the 4 with Sabonis, who I think has a better shot than him."
Because we have Tobias fucking Harris who is obviously a top 10 player in the league at this point baybeee
KD would most likely guard Tobias Harris because he is a scorer and KD's length may give him trouble but I could see them mixing it up.
"Ball movement matters because it moves the D and you don't know where the shot is coming from. LA had to guard Green, Curry, Embiid and Harris. Atlanta had to put in a half effort on Durant, and that's it. Everyone else was laser focused on Harden. They knew where the shot was coming from.  And yes, Harden has made it 1000 times. He's also missed it 1500 times.  Tobias' shot was a higher percentage shot. I don't have the stats to prove it, but I'm sure they are available somewhere."
"My brain is telling me that I should be worried that the Lakers went on a, what was it, 12-0 run in the fourth? All for them to lead the game with 13 seconds left, just for us to get bailed out by Tobias Harris of all people.  But my heart is telling me Tobias is a bonafide All Star, and that sometimes you just have to grind out an ugly win in an empty gym against the defending champs."
Replace Tobias Harris with Beal instant finals

Tobias Harris is underpaid
"Tobias Harris of the NBA team Philadelphia 76ers, currently coached by ex NBA player Doc Rivers used to play for a different NBA team called the Los Angeles Clippers and during his tenure there was coached by the very same Doc Rivers"
"Well, shit. I turned away when the Lakers got down by 14 in the 4th, and were showing no signs of life; to find out they came back AND took the lead would've shook me to my core if they had won. Thank you for posting this, OP, and thank you, Tobias Harris, for making sure that didn't happen, 'cause seeing that live would've f'd up my whole night."
i still think harden harder to stop tho. give harden tobias harris and seth curry with ben simmons playing small ball 5? how do you stop that
"Sixers lead series 3-1.  Game 5 Sixers won series 4-1.   Final score: Sixers 138- 110 Nets  Joel Embiid: 40pts, 15 reb, 3 ast, 4 blk Ben Simmons: 21pts, 14reb, 12ast, 5 stl Tobias Harris: 27pts, 12 reb, 3 ast Kyle Lowry: 21pts, 4reb, 14ast"
"Jerami Grant, Tobias Harris, Bradley Beal"
"Who do they have to guard Embiid, washed Deandre Jordan? The Sixers also have probably the best defensive answer to KD in the league in Simmons, lots of capable wing defenders to throw at the others in Thybulle/Green/etc., elite rim protection from Embiid, great spacing even with Simmons out there, and an improved Tobias Harris.   I would favor the Nets. But the Sixers do have some mismatches that work for them, so to say they don't have *anything* seems inaccurate to me."
If you can beat a team consisting of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid and then beat the MIL Bucks AND the GSW that’s a solid ass run
The game was terribly officiated and got out of hand a lot earlier than the 4th and OT. Both sides had missed calls but the majority seemed to occur late 4th and/or overtime at pretty key moments.   1 of 7: Tobias Harris traveling no call  2 of 7: Embiid charge while stepping on Gobert’s foot no call  3 of 7: Donovan offensive foul for wrapping his arm around Simmons leg (watch the replay)  4 of 7: Royce O’Neal and/or the ball barely if at all touching the ref’s leg making absolutely no effort to move out the way.   Those are the 4 that stood out. Anybody else feel free to add to the list for either team.  This is more of an indictment on shitty officiating than anything else.
"The biggest proof of this was when 2 of the first players to get busted and have their contracts voided for PED use were Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis in 2012.   Hmmm, 2 of the notoriously worst contracts in the NBA at the time both also got ""randomly"" caught for PEDs when they put their new testing in place.  Don't be surprised if the next positive PED tests are from John Wall and Tobias Harris."
"I mean, the Process only took 4 years and it turned the Sixers into a top team for years to come. Hinkie got Embiid, Simmons and developed the assets that got Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris. Outside of the Okafor pick he put the organization in a really good position. If Colangelo screws it up from there that’s on him."
Obviously it doesn’t count because harden is not carrying scrubs like Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. Murray and AD are nobodys too so they aren’t import either.
"I believe Tobias Harris was an all star for one year on the Clippers, right before Philly traded for him"
"I guess Tobias Harris never turned into an all star, but he’s been a near all star level player most of the time after he left and they basically traded him for nothing."
At the very least he did a good job of staying far enough from Tobias Harris that Gobert couldn't come over and pressure him
I don't mind him complaining. I just don't know what he's complaining about. Gobert fouled Embiid. If he is complaining about the tech then idk because idk what he said.   Maybe he thinks they deserved more calls in general but they were primarily shooting jumpers and when they did drive they weren't really driving at defenders as much as they were around them. Much like Tobias Harris does.
"Yeah, can you imagine a team with Jokic surrounded by Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and Reddick when he was actually good? That team wins the title. Embiid on the Nuggets would lose in the first round if they even made the playoffs, just like he does in Philly, especially with how many games he misses. Plus the nuggets literally have a better net rating and more expected wins than the Sixers right now, even missing 7 players and having a much harder schedule."
"He also hooked Simmons and got called for an offensive foul...   Tobias Harris absolutely torched them in overtime and they had nothing for him, I don't know what Mitchell problem is."
"Apparently Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and Embiid all reffed the game"
"Tobias Harris was one Joel Embiid three away from being crucified, now he should be deservedly getting praise lol"
the correct call being made is terrible because it resulted in a clutch embiid 3 and the Jazz not being able to stop Tobias Harris at all and only scoring 5 pts in OT.  If it was reversed you'd be totally cool with it all.
Can't blame him.  He just wanted to be like Tobias Harris 😤😤
"This is nba finals quality seventy sixers. What a win, playing from behind the entire game, just absolutely roasted by Jazz 3 point shooting, and then the entire roster steps up to play. Dwight fucking Howard hitting a three, then a steal in clutch time. MVPiid hitting a ridiculous 3 to send the game into OT, oh and also scoring 40+ and like 20 rebounds. Ben having his way in the post. Tobias Harris coming out of nowhere to dominate OT. Huge contributions from Shake and Matisse. Sixers bully ball getting the Jazz to commit stupid penalties"
"And people actually criticized the contract. Tobias Harris, what a man."
Absolutely Tobias Harris is MVP   /s
"Jazz fans gonna pin the game on the refs like they didn’t let Embiid drop 40, let Tobias Harris score at will on OT, and blow a 13 point lead."
Philly need to hypnotise Tobias Harris into thinking every quarter is OT
Tobias Harris is my dad
"Jazz fans gonna pin the game on the refs like they didn’t let Embiid drop 40, let Tobias Harris score at will on OT, and blow a 13 point lead."
Tobias Harris is my everything.
Utah needs an answer quick for Tobias Harris.
Tobias Harris being able to create for himself in the clutch is gonna be super important in the playoffs
I'm 10 minutes old and Tobias Harris is the greatest basketball player I've ever seen
# TOBIAS HARRIS BITCH
Where the Tobias Harris haters at?
THE TOBIAS HARRIS OVERTIME
The Tobias Harris Overtime.
Tobias Harris is dogshit
Tobias Harris looks just like a cross between J Cole and the Weekend
"The full bench mob was defensible when Tobias Harris was injured, but now he's back there's no excuse not to have one of Embiid/Simmons/Harris on the court at all times"
What about Tobias Harris and no picks
"Every time someone mentions X player is playing pretty good this season, 9 times out of 10 dude is averaging 40% from 3.   Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nicholas Batum, and even Jeff Green are all averaging above 40%.  Frank Kraminsky is averaging 42%.  Even Kent Bazemore.  Come on."
"Denver is not a better team than Philidelphia. Embiid has a very strong team around him in Simmons, Curry, and Tobias Harris. Jokic has Murray, really.   That being said, Denver is starting to heat up and that team narrative may change over the next few months.  At the very least, Denver is a better offensive team across the board, and Philadelphia is a better defensive team across the board."
Joe “Gary “Tobias “Gary “Joe “Tobias “Gary Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris”
"Yeah, that doesn’t make a ton of sense to me either but to NBA execs they seem to think that half season matters a lot (maybe to evaluate the player in their system with their roster? Idk.)   Like, look at what the sixers gave up to get Tobias Harris for half a year before he was an UFA. Or what we traded for a rental of Butler even though he had said he wasn’t going to re-sign.   Once a player is signed to a bigger deal, then you can’t trade for him unless you have outgoing players with salaries that match. Which can be hard to pull off"
Do you honestly believe that Tobias Harris is our best scorer...
"Embid would for lack of a better word molest Jarrett Allen. I'm a fan of him but pure strength is his biggest weakness (throwback to Charlotte Dwight giving him a 30/30 game). Plus Tobias Harris is the Sixers second option on offense, not Simmons (also Levert probably still misses time because of his kidney)."
I'm looking forward to that game.  I really hope both teams are at full strength.  You got:    Ty Lue vs Doc Rivers:  Ty now coaches the team Doc was just fired from.  Doc pretty much said don't expect any different results from this Clippers team because Ty is just as responsible for the Clippers blown 3-1 lead since he was Doc's lead Assistant Coach at the time.  Plus Ty was supposedly the front runner for the 76ers job until Doc took it from him.    Paul George vs Doc Rivers:  There have been sneak dissing comments from both towards the other as to who is to blame for The Bubble.  Plus PG fucked his daughter then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Tobias Harris vs The Clippers:  Tobias plays his former team who he left because he felt like they low-balled him a contract offer.    Paul George vs Seth Curry:  PG13 fucked his wife then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Plus they had a lot of chirping goin back and forth during The Bubble when Seth was with Dallas.    Kawhi Leonard vs The 76ers:  Kawhi hits one of the most memorable post-season shots of all time to eliminate the 76ers in a Game 7 to then go on and win a Chip and Finals MVP.
"Everybody saying Simmons, but he couldn’t win playing with Embiid, Butler and Tobias Harris. Ja was the leader of a solid team in the west in his rookie year."
"No need to be a condescending dickhead. What I said isn’t really that outlandish. Think it was actually relatively objective.   Yes, Smith was a miss. The circumstances around his situation sucked. Was high on him before the draft and would’ve loved to see him actually develop. But, overall it was still a successful draft considering that year we got Shamet+the heat pick - which became our third “star” in Tobias Harris, while also grabbing Shake Milton who is our best bench player.   Paul Reed was the 58th pick of the draft. If he can become our cheap backup, how is that not a win? We pay max deals to 3 players. We need to find value in later picks. Reed is currently averaging 21/12/2 with 2 blocks and 2 steals shooting .587/.412/.714 in the GLeague. I’m not saying he’s a fucking star, just saying we’re able to find good value.   Every team misses on stars in a draft. Hell, even your Bulls passed on SGA for Wendell Carter. Shit happens"
Tobias Harris over Jimmy you are smoking crack
sabonis was my biggest east snub... and i think id take tobias harris over jimmy too
The 76ers passed up on both Mikal Bridges and SGA for Zhaire Smith (who has played a total of 143 NBA minutes and isn't even in the league currently).  I guess they did also get the 2021 Heat pick that they used as part of the Tobias Harris deal - though they may have been able to just use one of their own picks in that trade.
"Yeah he's been the leader (or one of the leaders) in 3PT assists for the past few years. I believe he was the leader last year while passing to Al Horford, Josh Richardson and Tobias Harris."
"What the fuck happened to my father, Tobias Harris?! I'm at work rn and OOTL."
Doncic had a bit of separation from Simmons and still shoots an airball - but when Tobias Harris was practically in his jersey he nailed 2 tough stepbacks
he hit some shots on Tobias Harris so im guessing youre not watching the game
I think Tobias Harris or Middleton is the worst that can be considered a star. Both are consistent 2nd option who play good defense.
If you have Lowry I think you might not draft another guard at #1. A lineup of Lowry/Butler/Tatum/Simmons/Embiid with Tobias Harris on the bench...
"I mean, there is literally no downside for him going to bat for his player. It's not like he is calling players out, or even saying Harris deserved it over a guy like Sabonis. He's speaking generally, but we all know he's talking about this because Tobias was not selected. We're the number one seed and he has MVP numbers but we are not far and away the best team in the East so I never thought we would get three. Us getting three makes more sense than Boston getting two, but I would probably put Sabonis in over Tatum and leave Harris out personally."
Hes just doing this to big up his player  Nobody in their right mind thinks Tobias Harris is a damn All Star..might as well cancel the game
"He got 2 All Stars. Ben Simmons made it putting up 15 8 and 8 (not that these are bad stats by any means) so I'm not really sure what he's complaining about - obviously team success is being factored into this. The top 2 seeds in the east have 42% of the eastern conference's all stars. I really don't know how you could argue Tobias Harris is more deserving of an all star than the guys who made it or guys who got snubbed like Sabonis, Trae, etc who have a way bigger load to carry than tobias."
"There are a lot of ways to look at All-Star voting but if you put Tobias Harris on the Wizards, Bulls or Magic in place of Beal, Lavine and Vuc they'd each have half as many wins. Its a pretty easy way to look at who is the better player."
Khris Middleton. He's already forgotten about quite a bit in 2021. Damn shame because he's an awesome player  Tobias Harris is another good one
I didn’t watch the game lmao of course Ben had a good game if Joel didn’t play then lmao. He’s the 3rd best player still behind Rudy and Donovan. I don’t think Ben is a better player than Tobias Harris.
"You're a Nets fan who spends most of their time complaining about the Celtics.   Not really a great position to talk about salt.   &gt;Jayson Tatum is not an all-star. I mea 54% TS, negative net rating and mediocre defense doesn’t exactly signal All Star.  &gt; Harris deserves it over Tatum or Brown  &gt; Mostly salty Boston fans  &gt; Um no Bird is not ahead of KD  &gt;No they haven’t been as good as Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons. Tatum has league average offensive efficiency. Brown 59% is good not all-star level. Defense down for both.  &gt;Boston should trade Kemba Walker, who might be one of the few players with a worse contract, for Blake.  &gt;Yes 56% TS doesn’t scream superstar, it’s about league average.  &gt; Can’t even beat the Wizards  &gt;Maybe just maybe he’s not great yet, I mean 56% TS nothing to write home about  &gt;Remember when people were comparing Kemba to Beal?  &gt;Cs are one loss way from blowing it all up, you can feel it here ..  &gt;Tobias Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kemba Walker which is incredible to think about considering what was being said about Harris’ contract at the beginning of the season.  &gt;etc etc."
"He doesn’t have better stats or efficiency than Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Hayward, Trae young, or Khris Middleton. You can’t just take out the parts of the season that help. If that was the case I’d say simmons is averaging 22/8/8 since febuary"
"Oh yeah for sure, I believe Tobias Harris is a great player. It’s just that he doesn’t have a flashy game. But I believe he’s a smooth scorer and does his job right."
"The Tobias Harris mention confuses me because he’s been really good all year... 21/8/3 on 52/42/89 shooting, plus about a steal and a block each game"
 Not a single mention of doc rivers in this thread? He deserves coty just for fixing tobias Harris.
"Kawhi fucked the spurs hard. Some other offers the spurs got were Tobias Harris and pick 13 and 14. Marcus Smart on an 18M/year contract and picks. Covington, Saric, and a few picks. There wasn't even any word from the blazers on them being willing to trade McCollum."
"He shouldn't take jumpers because he will probably never be good enough at them to be worth guarding. He'd just be wasting possessions. That being said, because he's so limited, the Sixers aren't winning dick with him as their second best player. No team relying on Tobias Harris as its secondary shot maker is a contender."
"Tobias Harris, Boban, Meyers Leonard and hot(?) take: Draymond. Draymond stands up for his teammates more than almost anyone - even if to a fault. Definitely takes pride in teaching and helping guys out and is the complete opposite of a “me-first”"
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"Tobias harris is having a very similar season and also didn't make it.   Just too many guys,."

"This was the game ender. Everything after this was just garbage time.   And he absolutely faked it to Danny in the corner (who could've taken a pretty good three himself) and then throws an absolute last to Tobias Harris who, because of the fake and the velocity of the pass, is absolutely wide open despite not doing anything all that special to get so open.   This is what people (or at least me) mean when they say stuff that doesn't show up in the box score. This goes down as an assist but he absolutely raised the likelihood of that shot going in by a very significant amount."
Might not even be the worst trade involving Tobias Harris.  People tend to forget that the Bucks originally drafted him only to trade him for half a season of JJ Redick who very clearly didn't want to be there.
"It's even worse when you look at the big picture that that trade lead to.  Magic trade Tobias Harris for Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings.   They then trade Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis for Serge Ibaka.   They used the cap space from trading away Tobias Harris to sign Bismack Biyombo.  Ibaka is then traded for Terrence Ross and a 1st that AFAIK never played a game for the Magic.    So in all, they basically traded Tobias Harris, Ilyasova, Oladipo, and Sabonis, for the corpse of Brandon Jennings, Terrence Ross, a 1st that didn't play for them, and Bismack Biyombo."
They really said Tobias Harris. Bruh
I’m gonna pretend like Tobias Harris was Dr J and Forkan Korkmaz was AI this game
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
no one has really mentioned Tobias Harris. Def think he should at least be considered for backups
I’m surprised no one in this comment section has said Tobias Harris yet. I’m biased but Toby and Embiid are firing on all cylinders this season
"Cuz a) the all stars aren’t record based, and b) Tatum and Brown aren’t why the Celtics have a .500 record. They’ve been missing at least 2+ of their top 5 guys all season and have had a brutal schedule: 19 games in February that included a 5 game west coast road trip.  You act like 1 game is a lot, Boston’s a mid tier playoff team in the east rn. Like who you want on the Raptors over Tatum or Brown? Who on the Pacers? Sabonis? His stats aren’t as good. The Jazz are in another conference and really only have 2 stars on their team. You really think that freaking Tobias Harris should make it? Really?"
Tobias Harris
Tobias harris snubbed
tobias harris in shambles
Tobias harris?
Tobias Harris is not a snub
This man really listed Tobias Harris over Sabonis.
"True, Embiid is just so dominant and a favorite to win MVP.  But also add in the fact that Sixers have spacing now with Seth and Danny, and Tobias Harris is an all star, congrats to him."
"DeMar and Booker, I see an argument for Tobias Harris instead of Simmons too"
"I'm high as a mfer but think I figured out their thigh process here.   Whenever there is a bad trade people always look at the team as if they were the ones who offered the deal. Unless it was a trade not involving a team that's tanking or having a a player wantinf out, there's an equal likelihood that they were the ones approached.   I think what happened is,  the Suns saw that Philly took their guy and immediately called them up with an offer. Philly probably had Zhaire second on their board and decided that an unprotected first rounder, in the year high-schoolers were allowed to be drafted is more valuable than the gap between them. So they told Phoenix that if their 2nd guy was still there at 15, they'd accept.   That pick clearly was valuable as it ended up netting them Tobias Harris. It's still a bad trade but it was nearly impossible to know that Bridges would be this much better than Zhaire.   At the end of the day, the trade is just as bad no matter who made the offer. But it's interesting thinking about what the team was thinking."
"I guess when I hear someone say “good to great” that means he can be the 3rd scorer on a good team. To me, he is not that guy. He’s much better cast in the Lou Williams role. So maybe a dime a dozen was harsh but “good to great” is a big overstatement.  Edit: like Tobias Harris has been good to great."
"&gt; And then to go from winning ten games in a year to back to back 50+ win seasons should further prove that.  oh yes such merit bringing a team with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler to 50 wins.   Brett is a good guy but he was essentially a nanny, had 0 accountability established as said by JJ Redick, Jimmy Butler and others sixers and held back players like Simmons and Embiid from developing by being more a babysitter than a coach  And the thing many forget: he had a hand in creating the abomination that was the sixers 19/20 roster and didnt want to play Horford off the bench until it was extremely late in the season  He's so bad that literally no team wanted to sign him after so many seasons with the Sixers"
You still have to trust the management. Nobody trusts the knicks management stars don’t want to play there. People saw what Brooklyn was doing organizationally and they at least looked respectable in that regard.   Also if the nets kept all their players they also would’ve been able to add two max players outside of kd/kyrie in 2019. Some names were like Tobias Harris. So with that roster they’re probably still a mid level playoff team in the east.
We didn't have tobias harris
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"I know tobias harris is having himself a decent season, but that contract is a nightmare. Trade that bitch away as fast as you can say Philly"
"Lowry - Curry - Simmons - Harris - Embiid would be an insane line up, three legit ball handlers and a lot of spacing for Simmons to work with.   You’d have to rotate the first three guys around during the game to make sure one stays on, and you’re probably thin on the bench for the remainder of the year.   Maxey, Danny Green (salary), idk who else they can use as salary unless it’s Tobias for Lowry in some shape."
"Umm..Middleton, Tobias Harris, Ingram, Sabonis, DeRozan are all playing better. And seriously OG is a lock down defender who if he got the usage Siakam did he very likely would out do Siakam's production."

"Tobias Harris is shooting that well from the field and the line? Holy shit I never noticed he was that efficient. I love his game but damn that's crazy, granted I dont watch all their games but I had no clue he was that close. Hell of an achievement, hope he makes it"
"Yeah but those guys aren't just readily available.   I think the simplest trade both sides like is CJ for Tobias Harris. They need a guard, we need a forward. They're practically the same player.    Lillard/Powell/Harris/RoCo/Nurkic has plenty of offense still, but it's got a lot more size and defense"
"That was me being generous. It’ll likely just be Kyrie, Tobias Harris is the only other person close.  Either way statistically the difference in shooting is normal compared to previous years. Which means it is a fact that this year isn’t different from previous, you just have a bias."
Kyrie and Tobias Harris are the closest ones who look likely to meet the shot requirements and make it in. Snell and Satoransky have the percentages but have no where near enough shots
"Yeah, a second-tier 3/4 on a meh contract seems like the thing to do with CJ as the matching salary (because first-tier ones don't move).  Tobias Harris as you said, Hayward if something changes there, Barnes if Sacramento changes their thinking, Thaddues Young. I actually think Julius Randle would be great in Portland. Maybe a Lonzo Ball sign-and-trade?"
maybe tobias harris would be even more suitable (if we're already taking Philadelphia).
TOBIAS HARRIS
"Tobias Harris?  Myles Turner + another piece?  Just 2 ideas off the top of my head. But yes CJ needs to be traded. They're about to lose in the 1st round for the 4th time in 5 years, Lillard is entering his 30s, it's just time to get serious about winning and try something new"
"Tobias Harris, Wiggins, or Otto Porter"
"I think it is mostly luck and basically a crapshoot. For example the Suns drafted Booker at the 13th pick but he was mocked around there and the Suns would have likely picked Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson instead if they fell. Similarly the draft class they got Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss was seen as an amazing draft class but ended up sucking. Kelly Olynyk was drafted by the Celtics who are seen as a great drafting team and I remember during the GM/front office survey he was seen as the biggest steal of the draft and not Giannis who was drafted two picks after him.  Also, another talking point people talk about is ""well, he was drafted by the right team and developed him is the reason he busted."" This may be the case were one team brings up the best of a player more than another to a certain extant but I think this is severely overrated as well for true busts. If this was case we would see a lot more busts who sucked on one team all of a sudden blossom on another that unlocks their potential. For example Josh Jackson was still only 22 years old when the Suns gave up on him and still was extremely young. If he had the super high potential that was hidden away and not developed because of the Suns he would have turned into the next Kawhi lite or w/e when he switched teams. The last time I can think of this sort of happening when one player is seen like a bust and then blossoms on other team is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't entirely fit the scenario."
"Like someone mentioned in an earlier comment, Lefkoe isn't terrible persay and can keep dialogue going - but he has some cringe moments. Like asking Tobias Harris to say a J. Cole verse in a live postgame interview. Like even we all get he looks like Cole, but it was just awkward lol."
What about Embiid and Tobias Harris ? Curious if the numbers are better with which one. This seems more like an Embiid is really good stat than some synergy with Simmons
"I am so mad the Bobcats didn't wait on an offer like that. We ended up dealing him for 19th pick in 2011 and 26th pick in 2014. The first one ended up being combined with Stephen Jackson just to trade up in the draft for Bismack Biyombo (the 19th pick was actually Tobias Harris), the other one was used to draft PJ Hairston..."
Look up Tobias Harris texting and driving commercial for Fox Sports Florida. He got no competition
"Sorry, what do you disagree with?  Ben Simmons benefits tremendously from having an elite rim protector behind him.  Rim protection is still the most valuable part of defense. Embiid is an elite rim protector. Therefore Embiid is the most valuable defender on the team. The 76ers have other solid perimeter defenders but have nobody else who can do what Joel does.  Tobias Harris is incredibly underrated, he's playing at nearly an all NBA level.  Ben Simmons is tremendously overrated. He does one thing at an elite level and even then he has the backing of another player who is even better than he is. I'm not saying he's a certified bum, he's definitely a starter level player in the NBA but lets stop acting like any team with Ben Simmons leading the way would ever get out of the first round.  Did I tell a single lie? Instead of attacking me as a person, try actually watching the games. BTW; if you haven't been watching the NHL this year you should give it a chance, pretty entertaining product with much less red-ball."
"Nah it's legit. Harris is the second best player on that team, consistently. Not even just shitting on Ben Simmons just giving my props to how excellent Tobias has been."
"have you considered that you acquiring Griffin from the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic, a 2018 protected first-round pick, and a 2019. The 2018 ended up being Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.... what you got in return was 2 years of dead cap"
And Embiid has Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons.
Hes decent on ball but not good enough to stop decent nba scorers. He was getting targeted by Tobias harris all night ln
"The entire makeup of our team and the way it operates is completely different. We went from Brett Brown and Ime Udoka  to Doc Rivers, Dave Joerger, Sam Cassell, Dan Burke, and etc. The team went from having 3 inconsistent scoring threats in Tobias Harris, Horford, and Jrich to having 4 dudes in the starting 5 shooting 40%+ from the 3. Like Horford was really taking a good amount of threes last year because of the team makeup and it was not fun watching that shit. Tobias Harris and Embiid are playing the best basketball of their careers."
"the sixers added danny green, seth curry and dwight howard, and tobias harris got good again, and the celtics kinda don't play as a team anymore i guess i dunno, they're weird"
Tobias Harris averaged 5/2.5/.5 in his rookie season with 46/26/81 splits. He is currently averaging 20/7/4 on 52/40/90 splits with above-average defense. Not the biggest jump but worth mentioning.
"Joel Embiid gonna average more than 30 in the playoffs for sure, sixers championship run is going to be dependent on if Tobias Harris can perform like he has recently in the playoffs and how efficient Simmons is."
"The NBA has way higher AAV contacts though.  Bryce Harper is making less than Al Horford this year.  Trout, Lindor, and Cole make about the same as Paul George, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard and Tobias Harris.  I was really shocked when Bauer got $102 million over the next three years but that deal has two opt-outs and other crazy stuff."
"Bucks lost 4 straight to the Raptors and then lost to an inferior Heat team in the 2nd round last year   The Sixers literally got swept last year and their 2nd best player come playoff time is Tobias Harris.   The Jazz have the best record in the league, they hit the most threes, they have the DPOY, and they’ve proved they’re contenders this year."
Both easily. Isn't Tobias Harris on one?
I think what boban is saying is he regularly engages in group sexual activity with his wife and tobias harris
"The key isn’t really embiid, it’s dealing with Ben/Tobias/Seth/Harris etc. nothing we can do about embiid honestly, but we can figure out how to deal with everyone else. One man can never do it alone."
Lol i remember sixers podcasters talking about not wanting Tatum in the draft because he is Tobias Harris   And they were basically right... except we now have harris and Tatum is a more willing 3 pt shooter and better defender.  And also we drafted Fultz
Tobias Harris forgetting how to shoot and play basketball altogether.
Tobias Harris looks like my old HS classmate Norman
"In other words, the actual reporters like Shams Charania have the wrong information on this by saying it wasn’t seriously considered.   You as a fan clearly know more given how you said “to really understand this, you need to take into consideration the personalities involved and their relationships“. Even though you know nothing about these people personally or their true personalities.   You acknowledge how the Celtics had no use for Tobias Harris, but somehow that’s a bigger situation to consider than adding Kawhi Leonard.  Sure thing."
"Yeah he doesnt generate many easy shots so he'll have series or 5-10 game stretches where if the jumper is off it wont work. But really biggest issue is his playmaking and processing is still too limited. Doesnt play super fast, holds the ball, and even if his assists are up doesnt see the court well at all. So it's not really about the PPP or TS%. It's about what happens to your overall offense when you throw it to him. He's not gonna playmake. He's gonna miss opportunities and hold the ball. So the poss he gets it and doesnt get a shot it's a problem. And he just leads to predictable stagnant offense especially late in games when you throw it to him.   It's not his fault per se you dont ask Tobias Harris to be a lead offensive hub. This [cant happen](https://go.nba.com/tbv1) whatever limitations Simmons has you cant be 250th in the NBA in shots per 100 poss in late game situations. And at least half of them are things like putbacks or cuts he just actively avoids doing anything in those situations."
"&gt; Tobias Harris is hitting shots this year and has a cool TS% but there are just a lot of limitations that come with relying on him the way they need to.   This has to be a huge concern for Philly fans. Tobi has 4 seasons hovering around 19-20ppg now, he hasn't managed to break 16ppg in any of his post-season runs yet.   They're already going to need him to step up in a big way, if his scoring drops ~5ppg like it has the past 2 post-seasons they're in some big trouble."
Oh god there's Tobias Harris somewhere in Philadelphia blasting Nada Topčagić at 2AM
There are so many rationalizations about why “it’s fine that he doesn’t look to score more and be more of a scorer/attacker” from “thats not his job” to “he does so many other things” etc.  At some point it just becomes obvious this team needs him to do that and it clearly puts them at another level when he does. Tobias Harris is hitting shots this year and has a cool TS% but there are just a lot of limitations that come with relying on him the way they need to. Everybody knows Simmons has limitations point isn’t to rely on him to. It just comes down to the “take 9 shots and focus on playing defense and throwing cool outlet passes” Ben Simmons=Assured early round exit for Philly
"&gt; Well it's confusing because the difference between 6'8 and 6'10 is not big enough to mention with regards to how he finishes around the rim.  Lol you think AD at 6'10'' and Tobias Harris / PG at 6'8'' finish at the same level at the rim? You're talking about the difference between a 3 guard or an oversized 1-2 and a typical 4/5.   Coming from someone that actually plays basketball, 2'' is a big difference. My friend who is 6'9'' feel GIANT next to other guys that are 6'6'' 6'7'' ish.   Also Simmons just is better at getting to and finish at the rim. Nothing to do with size in particular, he's just better at it. You keep fixating on the height thing, I only brought it up because they are both taller than the average player at their position."
"I’m sorry but CP3 could start for every team in the league my guy. As for my team, Tobias Harris"
Who do you mean by Doc? Doc Rivers? Also when did Ainge take Kyrie’s word over his?   Which trade at the deadline was even proposed that included Kyrie? From what I remember he wasn’t even included in talks with New Orleans for AD. [This is what this article says too.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/04/celtics-sheltering-irving-from-the-trade-deadline-whirlwind/amp/)  Even [this source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2833296-kyrie-irving-rumors-clippers-asked-celtics-about-deadline-trade-got-quick-no.amp.html) says the Celtics gave a “quick no” to the Clippers when they asked about Kyrie. Besides is Tobias Harris and Lou Williams really enough of a “what if” over Kawhi Leonard?
Exactly. And let’s not forget about the fact that Tobias Harris is having his best season of his career lmao
"One day while jogging in the park I ran into Boban Marjanovic and I said hello to him. He turned around, pulled me close while smiling and hugged me. His glistening body made contact with mine and I shuddered at his manliness interacting with me. He whispered a love poem in my ear while putting goldfish in my mouth by the fistful before turning around and disappearing in the tree line where Tobias Harris and Luka waited for him. The three of them locked hands and skipped away while I was passing out from pure euphoria. I awoke several hours later feeing amazing and still lathered in Boban’s sweat and I felt like a newer, more enlightened person"
Tobias “15 PPG on .500 TS% in the playoffs” Harris
And it probably is or will be CJ now (actually Tobias Harris is probably the one)
"This is all a set-up for Boban to double-turn on Tobias Harris and then Luka and Boban will become THE TWO MAN POWER TRIP, MR. MCMAHON HAS FINALLY DONE IT, KING, THAT SON OF A BITCH"
"somebody show this to tobias harris lmao, i wanna know how he feel about this"
"Luka is clearly a locker room cancer. The Mavs need to foster a better locker room for their real star Boban. I propose that the Mavs should trade Luka, cap filler, and a few firsts and pick swaps for Tobias Harris, that way Bobi can be happy and the Mavs can be real contenders."
why would boban need another friend when he has tobias harris??????
"Well it's his fourth year and you're comparing him to two guys with three MVPs between them and an outlier finisher in Zion. I'm hopeful that with a full off-season with Sam Cassell he can improve his finishing and shooting but right now he's the primary facilitator and like the fourth or fifth scoring option.    Think about this: the second scoring option is clearly Tobias Harris right? Tobias is a three level scorer who is flirting with the 50/40/90 club this season. He is averaging 20.8ppg this season. Ben needs to grow his game and be less reliant on a stretch 5 but with Howard there's just no reason not to pack the paint and make his life hell when he tries to drive. He also is rarely rewarded for being aggressive. He's just as likely to get an offensive foul when a guy bounces off of him than an And-1. Giannis doesn't have that issue.   And *again* I will say that if you watched Ben Simmons' entire career and you thought *this off-season* when he was coming off of an injury and rehabbing that for the first time in his career (really) and there was the shortest off-season of all time, was the one where he'd take a giant leap then you were always being naive. I am one of the most optimistic Ben guys alive but I didn't think he'd make this huge leap when he hadn't before when he ended seasons fully healthy, didn't have a coaching change, and had a full regular off-season.   The Sixers are number one in the East with him playing his role and real Sixers fans know what happens when he isn't there. Everyone needs to chill."
"You must accumulate a minimum amount of makes in each category before you can qualify for the 50/40/90 club. Since this season is shortened at 72 games the minimum makes are 264 FGs, 72 3Ps and 110 FTs. Neither Satoransky who hasn't reached half of the minimum makes in any category and especially Snell (with 7 FTs) are close to qualify for the club given their currents rates.   This season the players who seem most likely to make the club are Tobias Harris and Kyrie Irving, after them I'd say that Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard and Khris Middleton are next in line."

"Simmons, SM, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Embiid"
Something tells me Kevin Durant vs Tobias Harris won’t end well for the 6ers
"But r/nba told me otherwise a month ago? 😂😂😂 “He’s an all-star, he’s all-nba, he’s this, he’s that ....” but when he’s in the 2nd round against the Bucks, Tobias Harris is putting up 15 a game on .300 TS% and they desperately need a bucket from someone else not named Embiid, we’ll see how it goes down"
You taking Blake Griffin over Tobias Harris too because you used to be an all star?
"Come on, it’s Tobias Harris and Joel leading them to that high seed. Ben isn’t the 2nd best player on the team"
Ben Simmons with 7 pts on 2/6 shooting yikes. Tobias Harris with 21 pts on 8/14 shooting.   Tobias is their 2nd best player this season @me.
"Playing with Embiid your whole career help. Give KAT a guard with the amount of talent Embiid has, and he makes the playoffs every year. Even the Tobias Harris is better than anyone in the rosters that missed the playoffs with the Wolves. Even Redick was arguably better than Wiggins."
I got a better one. Why isn't Tobias Harris being considered?
"Underpay, this man making less than Tobias Harris lmao"
Tobias Harris' agent is his father
"Mentally I'm still used to 2014 salary cap where the highest paid players made 20-24 million per year so every time a great (but not elite) player like Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton and now Jrue Holiday gets a bag this big, my mouth always drops."
"I mean look I watch Embiid and I see how he plays. How he takes advantage of his speed advantage and his size advantage. How he uses his strength. Also how so many teams play him. The doubles are constant and that means more turnovers and more fouls. It's high risk high reward but it's better than getting bullied in the post.   I imagine double teaming someone who passes like Jokic isn't the smartest move. Although occasionally people double Ben in the post for some reason so idk maybe it does happen. But my point is Joel plays through a lot of contact. The crazy thing is Sixers fans, and coaches, and Joel himself knows that he gets fouled more than is called. But the refs can't call everything. Or at least choose not to.   Jokic reminds me of Tobias Harris. He drives a lot, shoots a ton of mid-range shots, but rarely goes to the line. Meanwhile Jimmy Butler lives at the line. Harris just avoids contact more than goes through it with strength. And he is shooting an amazing percentage so it's not like he's not doing well getting to his spots and shooting around contests. But he just is never gonna be a guy who goes to the line a bunch.  I watch Jokic games. But not nearly as many as you. But when I do watch him, I don't see him *driving* to the rim and laying it up through contact. I see him shooting jumpers and hook shots in the post. He has amazing touch and skill and uses that to score. I'm sure calls are missed on him, and I'm sure he gets some non-shooting calls as well. The bottom line is he has his own style of play that is working well. He's figured it out. And he is the frontrunner for MVP (and if they get the three seed, it's his) because of it."
I’ve never seen Tobias Harris miss a shot (this season)
Last three years:  Blake Griffin:   One time all star  All-NBA Third Team  Tobias Harris:  ...
"it's not necessairly a small market thing.   Tobias Harris caught Philly in a similar position, they had to either pay him a max, or let him go and lose that cap space for nothing.   Dennis Shroeder is doing the same with the Lakers by refusing 4/84m."
I did forget Tobias Harris and I’m ashamed that I did. He’s having an excellent season
So you gonna forget Tobias Harris?
"Cause if we look at his past teams those teams end up being better with him.  Clippers were just much better with him (until Kawhi came of course), Blake Griffin wouldn’t have gotten them far and neither would Tobias Harris in that very short stint.  Rockets basically missed the finals because he got injured. They become a worse team after he’s traded for Russ  Okc is talented as always, but he had them over performing and almost beat that rockets team in just a season  And while the Suns are getting momentum from that amazing bubble performance, I don’t think they’d be 2nd seed good without Cp3 this season.  Him being there just makes good teams even better then they should be."
"If he keeps playing the way he has he is a max player  He’s playing way way way better than dudes like Conley, Love, Tobias Harris, Wiggins  If RJ Barret keep developing they could have some really nice teams moving forward"
"Pretty much. I feel like there’s basically be three tiers of teams.   -	one superstar like LeBron or KD and a bunch of scrubs -	Two medium stars and a meh roster around them (say like Jamal Murray and Tobias Harris or Simmons and McCollum, guys who teams won’t throw the bag at because they can’t carry by themselves)  -	One star and a good roster built around them. Could a team be successful building around, say, Middleton or Gobert or Tatum?   I think it’d be really interesting to see what team composition is the most successful. LeBron might be eating up 70% of your cap; normally ring chasing vets would come play, but other teams could easily offer five times as much to them, would they still go for cheap? I’d tend to say no."
I was saying that I don't love harris on kd. Who do you think doc puts on him? I'd say it's probably ben or Danny. I would however love to see Brooklyn try to guard Tobias with kd as I think Tobias would body him and get to his spots

There are two Tobias Harris.  The first without Doc Rivers. A good player.  The second one with Doc Rivers: an All-Star player.
That’s Tobias Harris
yea because 50 percent of our fanbase is ben stans... Harris has been far better than ben while double teamed because of ben and most sixer fans that arent just ben fans agree... ben limits joel and tobias in the half court on offense... imagine having a legit shooting pg who spreads the floor over a guy who stands in the corner behind the 3 point line and doenst move with his defender playing 10 feet off without the ball. Joel and Tobi constantly deal with double and triple teams because of bens lack of shooting... Been refused to back down delly who he had 8 inches on lmfao
"&gt;With 4/4 made FTs tonight, Tobias Harris is currently averaging 20.75 points a game with 52.4/40.8/90.2 splits  but its not that hard for a very good play to avg those numbers when they are the best player on their trash team... Avg similar numbers while not being a center when you lose shots etc from joel/ben and so on means alot."
"Tobias is easily second best player but Sixers are fucked up without Simmons so Simmons is the most important player for Sixers. Embiid, Harris and Simmons know their roles pretty well"

This year Tobias.  The question is is Beal enough with Embiid/Tobias next year?  Obviously they would need a pg after losing Ben but they have enough scoring with Beal/Embiid/Harris.

Tobias Harris is UNDERPAID
"&gt;This is factually incorrect as Kyrie Irving was not a max contract player in 2018, he had a salary of $18.8M (**half** of what Kemba is due to earn next year!).   Maybe you should read up on how the salary cap works. Kyrie's contract was a max extension at the time that he signed it. He was on a max contract. The value of a max contract changes year to year and based on experience. For example, Steph Curry makes $43M, so is Kemba not on a max deal?   &gt;And even if you think they ever had a chance of beating Lebron, if they made the finals they were going to lose to the Warriors in 5 games.  They were not at all legitimate contenders that year.   They definitely had a chance of beating Lebron. They were up 3-2 and were in the lead in the 4th quarter of game 7.   And being in the finals makes you a contender. People could have said that the raptors weren't really contenders. Then KD and Klay went down and look what happened.    &gt;I am telling you, it is completely unprecedented and a ridiculous concept for a team to be a **real** contender when you have a bad max contract.   Kevin Love - 9 pts, 7 rebs in the finals - 15 pts, 6 rebs in ECF with very bad defence = nba champion   Michael Finley - 2006 Mavs - 4th highest paid player in the NBA, didn't play   Keith Van Horn - 2006 Mavs - 14th highest paid player in the NBA, played 12mpg   David Lee - 2015 Warriors, highest paid player on 25% of salary cap, played 8mpg in the playoffs   Larry Hughes - 2007 Cavs averaged 11ppg in the playoffs, paid 25% of the cap   Patrick Ewing 1999 - highest paid player in the NBA, injured for the playoffs, knicks made the finals   I'm not going to keep going back but I've proven my point.   20, 4 &amp; 5 of decent efficiency is not bad relative to the examples above. Its not what you hope for from a max contract but its a nice player.   By this logic Mike Conley and Tobias Harris are bad max contracts, too. And they are on the two 1 seeds."
"Tyreke Evans instead of Curry. Thomas Robinson ahead of Lillard. Bismack Biyombo instead of Kahwi, Klay, Kemba, Vucevic, Tobias Harris, both Morris brothers.  just the worst scouting and leadership"
"absolutely not man, their size and defense alone is trouble for a lot of teams. Tobias Harris can take some of the offensive load as well, very disrespected player"

"This is why I think the Sixers' success relies on Tobias Harris. Embiid has duds, man. He wont go all playoffs long without some duds, and the Sixers can absolutely be beaten like this in a series."
"I’m scared for Simmons in the post season. He’s much closer to Draymond than he is Magic. He can’t score at all in the half court. Tobias Harris being our most reliable perimeter scorer will be trouble, just ask the Bucks how Khris Middleton being their most reliable perimeter scorer has been for them."
"To be fair, he most likely suited up because he needs to play in 70% of our games so he can appear in our team stats. For instance, if he missed this game, Tobias Harris would be listed as the teams top scorer.  He was diagnosed with the flu less than three or four days ago. I’ve never gotten over the flu that quickly lol   Doesn’t excuse the rest of team though. We just sucked collectively. Tobi tried to carry but Miami knew he’s the only one who could’ve gotten a bucket.  Nice heat win though. They’re catching fire at just the right time"
"I'm glad Tobias has found himself, or Doc has unlocked him, though I wonder if a balance of usage between Embiid Simmons and Harris can be found, it seems like through the different iterations of the Sixers someone has always felt left out"
"My TV just popped up an option to pull up those red sneakers Tobias Harris is wearing. Very cool, very creepy, very unnecessary"
People called the bucks frauds for having Middleton as a second option but sixers get a pass with Tobias harris?
Yo don't bring Tobias Harris into this.

&gt; You took my friend  \- Tobias Harris  Tobi about to have a Carmelo moment
Tobias Harris is somewhere speechless
Tobias Harris is in shambles
"yea I feel bad for Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, JJ Reddick"
"Actually out of curiosity I went and avgd out the 5 guys above tobias in annual pay, and the 5 guys below him (just used annual pay the first yr of Harris' contract)  and his stats are almost exactly that avg which I found interesting.  Ben on the other hand, shoots worse than random kids in this comment thread.  Good luck in the playoffs... let's see how far that 1 seed takes them"
Been praying for a blow up since the Tobias Harris days
you can join the tobias harris all star club too
"It’s not like he’s not an all star? Plus he’s getting paid at a super max. Obviously the Jazz could not afford to lose him. And rn, the Jazz are doing great bcuz bogdanovic has been on an absolute rampage.   I have guys like Jrue holiday/Mikal bridges/ Tobias Harris/ demar Derozan as much more underrated."
"Lol you're crazy.   That Sixers team had three all NBA players (Simmons, Butler, and Embiid) who are also all NBA defenders, two of which being legitimate DPOY caliber players. So not only did you have those three elite guys, but your fourth option was fucking Tobias Harris, a guy who casually averages 20/7 on great efficiency pretty much every year.   To add onto the fact that they had easily the second best starting lineup in the league behind a healthy GSW, they also had guys like Reddick screaming around corners and draining threes, or Mike Scott whos a certified raptor killer, or McConnell coming off the bench and providing a spark.  If having 3-4 guys who can provide elite production on both sides of the floor consistently isn't a superteam, then superteams don't exist and this whole conversation is moot."
i feel bad for Sixers fans. Embiid potentially winning MVP was the closest thing to success they could have had in 20 years but now it's gone down the drain. now they're stuck gassing up tobias harris and ben simmons' nonexistent DPOY chances. sad times ahead
"Does that mean Embiid, Simmons and Tobias Harris arent leaders because they made Thybulle get them fast food as part of his rookie duties?  Stupid hill to die on"

"Lol wtf? This is what i said: Stats can paint a misleading picture. Not: Every single stat lies every time. Do you see the *very* obvious difference in those two statements?   Plus, advanced stats hated Kobe in general, not just in terms of defense. Does this means he just sucked in general now too? You know who is also ranked as top defenders according to multiple metrics? Jokic, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Kuzma etc...  &gt;Game tape showing Kobe loafing and playing free safety the majority of games lie?  What about game tape showing the opposite?   &gt;I know it's Kobe fanatics I'm dealing with  Kobe fanatic? Then i might as well call you a Kobe hater if thats the level you want to put this discussion at."
1- iverson 2- thybulle 3- Danny green 4- Tobias harris  5- embiid  😤😤😤
"Tobias Harris has never had a legitimately good playoff run. If you’re relying in him to be your secondary scorer, you’re in for some trouble."
we couldn't throw entry passes. tobias harris shot 2 for 15 from 3.
"we already have 3 okayish to decent shooting guards (Melton, Bane, Grayson) that struggle to get their fair share of minutes. If we need anything it's a solid wing who can shoot, a Tobias Harris type."
shout out to everyone that said Blazers should trade him for Tobias Harris  (CJ’s playoff numbers are superstar level compared to Tobias’ btw)
They don't even have 2 20ppg scorers right now and likely won't come playoffs. Tobias Harris is close but thats it.
Tobias Harris better be back for the playoffs or else
Tobias Harris is going to show up to training camp next year 4 inches shorter and with newly found rapping ability
SMH how is Tobias Harris gonna be ready for the playoffs if he's playing for another team
Best case: Cj for Tobias harris.  Roco+ DJJ + Pick for Harrison barnes.  Sign a back up guard like Patty Mills.  Sign a back up big like Nerlens Noel.  Resign Powell and Melo.  Our lineup would look like this:  PG: dame/Mills  SG:Norm/Ant  SF: Barnes/Nas  PF:Harris/Melo  C: Nurkic/Noel/Collins
"Tobias Harris had a similar stretch last year and did not come back, crazy that Barrett did"
I think it’s starts with firing Stotts and seeing what’s on the trade market for CJ.  The dream-scenario would be exchanging CJ for a star. I don’t think this happens though. CJ’s value isn’t enough to garner the swap of a superstar. I could see maybe like a Tobias Harris deal but that doesn’t help the team.  Maybe they move Dame?
"are you talking about the team that also had gallinari, sga, and some of tobias harris?"
"This would hold up if we were talking about 1 or 2 people, you are saying there are 3 individuals better than anyone on the Lakers. Not to mention the Sixers are also rolling out Dwight Howard, Danny Green and Tobias Harris to round out their rotation.   The only negative defenders in their top 8 rotation are Seth Curry and Shake Milton, both guards."
"CJ for Tobias Harris, win-win for both teams, salaries match too.   Allows Norm to play his natural position &amp; shores up the Portland defence and adding more wing playmaking.   Also gives the Sixers some much needed play making from the guard position."
Because KD is better than Lebron when it matters.  Embiid has not proven himself in the playoffs. This is the year to do so. The last time Simmons was in the playoffs he was God awful. Tobias Harris is playing better than he has in years and I'm a fan. This is why I've been stating since the beginning of this convo that in many ways a series between the Nets and 6ers plays by how well Tobi does. He will be the factor. Ben wont do shit and Embiid will play well in 3 of 5 games.
"The only that stops me from betting on the nets is hardens injury. At full health no ones stopping them.  Either way IMO the sixers are not championship level. If Simmons can actually shoot then that’s another story.  In crunch time, they’re just gonna double team Embiid and keep Simmons on the perimeter and that’s it. Tobias Harris can do what wants but he’s not gonna be the X factor.  Which team can stop the nets all 3 of the nets big 3 from getting a basket in crunch time? None"
"LeBron  Kawhi  Giannis  Curry  KD  Harden  AD  Luka  PG13  Dame  Jokic  Tatum  Embiid  Butler  Beal  Westbrook  DBook  CP3  KAT  Bam  Mitchell  Murray  Simmons  Kyrie  Zion  Trae Young  Middleton  Brown  Jrue  Fox  Randle  Shai  LaVine  Vucevic  Demar  That’s 35 guys with a solid step on him.  Then you got guys like Siakam, Tobias Harris, Wood, Brogdon, etc. we’re depending on who you ask they may also be higher.  He ain’t top 30, and he is not on Ben Simmons level."
As many times as Tobias Harris has averaged 16 PPG on good efficiency in the playoffs (e.g. none)
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
Simmons is not the 2nd option on offense lol thats Tobias Harris
"Is he even really that overpaid in a league with Conley, Wall, Walker, Love, and Adams getting paid more than him?  I mean Tobias Harris, McCollum, Russell, Hayward, Otto Porter Jr, Hayward, and Murray are all players in the $27-35 million range that between availability and production are comparable to Wiggins.   Maybe other people see it differently though"
Their second option is Tobias Harris though.
"Tobias Harris will get eaten alive and Thubulle is horrible on offense. And Simmons cant shoot. Its not going to go the way you think it will. Embid at some point will have to come out on the perimeter and will get torched there and on drop coverage.   He can still do it lol. Even now they have some plays where he moves off ball. With KD out he's needed to have the ball more and create more for others like in his Houston days. He doesnt need to run for 40 minutes. He can just sit there and hit open threes if Kyrie and KD can pass well enough which they can. Lol, yea Harden, Kyrie, KD, Harris+ whoever, horrible spacing. Please. Anyone who thinks James Harden actually ruins spacing is kidding themselves. Yea who cares though, great offense will always beat great defense. Green isnt that good of a defender and Thybulle and even at some points Simmons are complete liabilities on offense. Their defense will get better in the playoffs while Philly's offense will get much worse. Damn I forgot all the times Harden and KD had trouble with Gobert in the playoffs. You really dont understand that KD and Kyrie are going to abuse him in drop coverage. Kyrie especially."
"Simmons/Green/Thybulle or swap Tobias Harris in if KD plays small ball 4 is quite possibly the best defensive answer.  They will get theirs, but that defensive setup with Embiid at the rim will reduce their scoring and make them less efficient, which is all they need to do.  I’ve never pretended all Harden could do was iso.  He used to move off the ball very well his first year in Houston.  But for the last several years it is all he’s done.  They might be the 3 best iso players in the league, actually.  But when Harden doesn’t have the ball he takes plays off, because he’s too muscular and asthmatic to run for 40+ minutes.  This is fine, and having expert iso scorer and sharpshooter Kyrie will help him take plays off, and KD is an even better option who fits better than Kyrie or Harden in a championship level offense.  But the basic problems are spacing and defense.  Harden and Kyrie standing still at the perimeter when they don’t have the ball isn’t good spacing.  They don’t run a (mostly) motion offense like the Spurs or Warriors to create extra spacing with their shooting.  And the long armed and quick recovering combo of Simmons/Green/Thybulle will challenge kick out shots better than any group of 3 in the league.  They also don’t need to pack the key as heavily as the Warriors did to stop Harden, because they have Embiid.  Embiid has been phoning it in on defense most of the year and is still a top 5 rim defender.  He’s second only to Gobert come playoffs."
"To a degree, I still think 2019 was a funny case of throwing the process out the window to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris. It's like they went 80% of the way and then said ""f- it"" and chunked everyone out in trades to get those two."
He's turning into Draymond on offense with his aversion to scoring but a better finisher and worse screener. Tobias Harris is the 2nd option on that team
"I mean, I definitely do watch the games. Having Lavine or Beal instead of Simmons would 100% result in a much better offence, that’s just an accurate fact. Is Simmons a good passer? Sure. Is Simmons creating 27-30 ppg on elite efficiency off passes alone? Definitely not. There’s a reason the offence is only slightly above league average despite Tobias Harris having a career year. The only season with Simmons that the Sixers have had a top 10 rated offence was the lone season with Butler.   The defence would definitely regress but I’d be comfortable with Thybulle as my primary perimeter defender with Embiid anchoring the defence that it would still land in the top 10. That’s a pretty easy trade off that results in a more balanced team on both sides of the ball as opposed to a team that’s elite defensively and average offensively.  Personally I think if either player became available the Sixers FO would be all over them. Morey isn’t a dumbass, he knows how important high level isolation scoring is come playoff time."
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Who do these people expect to start at the 4?  Mike Scott?  35 year old Anthony Tolliver?  PF is literally our thinnest position and these guys are like yeah trade him for a guy who will replace Seth Curry in the starting lineup.  A Seth Curry by the way who's basically done everything asked of him.  Seth Curry + Tobias Harris &gt; Mike Scott + CJ McCollum
"Regular season.  They match up uniquely poorly against the Sixers and it’s going to be a brutal series for them.  They have also only had 2 games with Kyrie, Harden and KD sharing the court.  They also have negative floor spacing with DAJ, Blake Griffin, and Kyrie/Harden not moving off ball.  They’re going to be trading isos against a team with Simmons and Thybulle at the perimeter and Embiid guarding the rim with in/out defense from Tobias Harris.  Then they have no real defense at the other end and nobody who can stop Embiid from averaging an efficient 40 through a series.  It will be a rude awakening."
you think Tobias Harris’ regular season numbers translate into the playoffs  they don’t
Tobias Harris as a 2nd option?  just look at last postseason
"I love Tobias Harris and think he’s having a stellar season, but I do wonder if Portland would get the same player without Doc."
Tobias Harris is the same.  He’s also been complete dogshit in the playoffs for his career.   CJ has saved the Blazers in the playoffs time and time again.
We need Tobias Harris appreciator shirts made ASAP in Philly.
"Yeah. Totally. Ben Simmons is apparently super overrated and not that good, Danny Green can’t shoot, and Tobias Harris isn’t an all star. The Sixers have no spacing, no bench, and no shooters. The Sixers have dealt with zero injuries (other than Embiid apparently missing the entire season) and no COVID issues. The Sixers are in first solely because all of the super good players I mentioned earlier took their vitamins in the morning and have immaculate health."
"They cant afford a real PG cause they gave all that money to Tobias Harris. That’s why they’ve cornered the market on around average point guards (Milton, curry, Hill). The sixers do a terrible job of making the opposing big play on the perimeter despite the other team always needing to play big against them"
"Heck, even beyond that, that can give a chance for some talent- someone like a Tobias Harris would be good enough to be an expansion team's first superstar, but the contract's high enough Philly would be ""I DARE YOU to take his contract off our hands."""
Most recently DJ wilson. Sterling brown was that dude for a while... Christian Wood... Johnny o bryant... Tobias harris
No the fuck he isn’t. You just said Tobias Harris and Anthony Davis are close defensively this season. Delusional.
With only 7 games left the only guy who I could realistically see do it is Tobias Harris. It's just really hard to raise a season average in only a few games.
"According to 538’s RAPTOR, AD is 28th in the league this year, Tobias is 59th.  Most other impact stats agree. Bad season AD is still an All-Star calibre player. Tobias Harris is nooooot."
I agree.   But just because i remember Tobias Harris picking his college team in New York and \*not\* picking Syracuse. HE EVEN PICKED AN ORANGE TEAM. Dude i'm still salty.
Siakam is an elite defender lmao and who knows what his stat line would look like if he was the 3rd - 4th option.   Tobias Harris hasn’t done shit his entire career. He’s a 3rd-4th option while Siakam has been the proven #2 option on a championship team. What team would say no to an elite defender with championship experience that can perform well alongside their star?
What do you expect? Our team sucks and you have the runner up mvp and Tobias Harris on your team
"who are realistic targets for a CJ trade that can put you in title contention territory though  maybe karl anthony towns?    I know people are floating tobias harris but I don't think he pushes your ceiling high enough  also a CJ trade just feels like more of that same shuffling the deck chairs.   if you could add someone like KAT without giving up CJ that might give you enough to make the finals, but you have to give up so many assets for it"
All of a sudden jrue fuckimg holiday is chump change compared to Tobias harris or what?
"You also needed shot creation from the perimeter, which is why they drafted Markelle Fultz. Tobias Harris isn’t gonna give you that consistently enough. Jimmy’s playmaking and ability to still draw defenders out on the perimeter, even with his declining shooting is far more valuable than Tobias Harris."
Are you the same person who thinks Gallinari is better than Tobias Harris? lmao yeah I'm wasting my time arguing with a dumbass. Good day.
"He's probably a little worse than Tobias Harris and a little better than Harrison Barnes, and both of those guys are well compensated"
"I think Tobias Harris the wild card. Embiid will get his but if we don’t have an answer for Tobi, then it’s a wrap in 4-5 games."
I chuckled when they flashed the East’s big 3’s and for Philly it was: Joel Embiid - Ben “I scored 5 points last game” Simmons and... I think Tobias Harris? Sure will go with that.   Good luck in the post season!
"Probably the playoff team with Tobias Harris in 2016, so not that long ago. But besides that, this season has been the best in over a decade.   We're pretty happy with most of the young players overall."
"Its more than that. You can't just go by stats He's not being asked to score. He's a tertiary shooter at best when he's the floor. Sixers have other veteran shooters when he's on the floor. If you were a coach on a playoff caliber team, who are you asking to shoot Shake Milton, George Hill or Thybulle? Seth Curry,Danny Green, Tobias Harris or Thybulle? Come on man... Plays is not running through him right now.. Theres a huge difference when you have plays ran through you instead of playing clean up. He might have to get his shine on a different team but its there. His real weakness is his ball handling. If fixes that he'll have better shots."
Tatum is Tobias Harris on a Keto diet

Tobias Harris should not be closing games out in the playoffs bro lmao
"If you’re relying on Tobias Harris in the playoffs, you’re gonna have a bad time."
"Well I mean not hard core tanking but cleveland was absolute garbage without Lebron which led them to get Kyrie, Thompson, and Wiggins (flipped for Love)  Not only do you have to get lucky as tanking does not automatically guarantee you a top 3 pick, you have to hit on them. Philly hit big on Simmons and Embiid but also missed big on Okafor and Fultz. Their 3rd star didn't come from the draft but rather Tobias Harris who was a free agent"
Suns traded for CP3 though. Knicks traded for Randle. Same with Tobias Harris.
"Fairly decent list, but recent All-stars should not be exempt because Khris Middleton is one of the best 3&amp;D players &amp; Klay Thompson is probably the GOAT3&amp;D.  7 Gordan Hayward is a playmaker &amp; a tone setter, you should feel weird putting him here because it is)  13 Tobias Harris is avg 20ppg, he's more of a dynamic scorer than 3&amp;D  19 When I think of Brogdan, I think Primary Ball-handler  25 Andrew Wiggins, haven't watched much GSW but in Minn, he was a scorer, has he turned into a shooter?  28 FVV was draining unassisted 35 footers in the 2019 NBA Finals while sharing the court with Kawhi, Lowry &amp; Beyblade"
"I consider a 3 &amp; D player someone that only focuses on those two aspects of the game, and doesn't really create shots for himself. So some on your list like Gordom Hayward and Tobias Harris aren't really 3 &amp; D players. Danny Green is a great example of a 3 &amp; D player imo."
"3&amp;D players originally meant defensive minded players whose only offensive contribution to shoot threes, like Bruce Bowen or Shane Battier. Nowadays, even the ""limited"" version of this list include guys like Joe Harris (not a defensive minded guy) or Tobias Harris (a 20 PPG scorer who scores mainly from midrange)."
"I feel like the criteria for ""D"" on this list is very liberal. ""3&amp;D"" is someone who plays good, not average defense and can space the floor. I would not consider Joe Harris, Tobias Harris, and Pat Connoughton (probably a few more too) to be 3&amp;D."
"&gt;It was a 2v1, then a 3v2  3v1.5, one of them was Trae after all.  &gt;Wide open corner 3s are the 2nd best shot in all of basketball, after only dunks.  third, you forgot free throws. especially if Tobias Harris is shooting them like he should have been here."
Tobias Harris and Trevor Noah
Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam.
"Robert Covington on Wiggin's contract would be clowned on too.   Look at Tobias Harris, so many people clowned him last season for his performance relative to his contract. Ppl are quiet this yr because he's producing."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
Tyler Herro  Tyrese Haliburton  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Talen Horton-Tucker  Tobias Harris  lol. no active big available
Yes I would trade Tobias Harris for another Ben simmons…the spacing would be *mwah*
"There were in the bonus  They were against a backcourt of TRAE YOUNG AND LOU WILL  They have 3 all defense player, one is the runner up MVP and the other is the runner up DPOY   Tobias Harris finished the season as a 20ppg guy on 51/39/89 splits  Seth curry put up a career-high 36 pts including going 7 /12 from 3  Up 26 late in the 3rd  How the fuck  It's easily one of the most embarrassing losses ever"
Tobias Harris is escaping the slander here The reason for this: everyone forgot he even played today
"the offensive plan for the Sixers was terrible. I don’t know what Tobias Harris was doing to close the game. Trae and Lou could be hidden because Sixers chose not to exploit, and most of the Sixers team was nonexistent. I think McMillan running the Gallo,Collins,Capela frontcourt was smart. They have good size and can switch around as necessary. Gallo is slow, but his size helps him to body up players."
"that's fair but then you have bums like Tobias Harris who are getting maxed. Not to mentions other bums in other teams who don't deserve 10 mill a year, recent example dennis schroder was offered 20 mill a year by the lakers LMAO"
"I think the pendulum will swing in the form of strong guards and forwards realizing they can post up they’re 3pt specialist matchups. Give a guy like Tobias Harris an off-season to work on his post ups. All of a sudden you can’t put Danilo Gallinari on him because despite similar speed, in the post a refined Tobias Harris post game would eat Gallo alive."
they also maxxed tobias harris dont forget
"Embiid gasses out, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris were born with a missing clutch gene"
"I disagree with that line of thinking about your defense. In the playoffs, you are only as good as your weakest defensive link, and a competent team would be able to attack Trae and Lou on defense, just like how the Nets just murdered Brook Lopez and Connaughton with KD over and over again, or how the Jazz attack Reggie Jackson and Kennard every single time that they are in. The issue is that the Sixers have no one who can hunt those defensive vulnerabilities down the stretch. Best bet is Tobias Harris but he fucking sucked today."
tobias harris and ben simmons forgot they were playing a basketball game
I never understand why when Middleton does bad he gets lumped in with “and people said he was better than Harris” then when Tobias scores 4 points and Middleton scores 25 he’s somehow the one that’s called a choker.
"At least we already knew Simmons couldn’t shoot, Tobias Harris scored 4 fucking points on 2/11 from the floor, and the only starter with negative +/- with -10"
"He isn’t #2, at least as far as scoring goes. That’d be Tobias Harris, who finished tonight with a whopping 4 points on 2/11 shooting."
I completely forgot Tobias Harris was in the game...OMG!
Why is everyone shitting on Ben Simmons when Tobias Harris went 2/11?
Hinkie wasn’t allowed to see his process through. A big part of it is amassing assets and having flexibility. Does Hinkie go out and get Tobias Harris or Al Horford? Does he keep Simmons or does he sell high on him? Does he draft Fultz?  There are so many things that could have gone differently since Hinkie was forced out in 2016. To use this current roster as proof that the process failed is incredibly short-sighted.
every season sixers fan ride for that contract like the fact that it was him instead of an actual 3rd star wont cap them forever and put a massive load on embiid and ben to carry when it matters  and then every playoffs he reminds them that hes tobias harris and in no way deserved that deal off one above average season on the clippers of all teams.  a fake big 3 will break your heart every single time but no one wants to accept it till it falls apart when you need it
"&gt;and if you had another 25 ppg offensive guy  That would be Tobias Harris, except he's not."
"I have to go with the Bucks.  76ers lost but Tobias Harris has been a 20PPG player all series, he'll bounce back even if Simmons sucks.  Jazz while an unbelievably disappointing L, no Kawhi is still debilitating for the Clips. Mitchell will play better."
"I’m sorry kitty, it’s not fair you had to watch Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris tonight."
"They should have kept Jimmy. Having a Top 10-15 caliber guy is a massive asset, and to lose him for Josh Richardson is terrible asset mismanagement.   The Tobias Harris trade was also stupid. The Clippers weren't going to re-sign him, and the cap math worked out with cap holds for the Sixers to be able to sign a max guy and bring back both Butler and Redick. I don't 100% hate the trade, but I think they could have gotten it done with only their own, less valuable picks, while retaining the 2021 Miami pick asset.   They could have been much more aggressive including Simmons in trade offers to try to land a third star that better fit around Butler and Embiid too had they kept Butler."
Let’s not forget Tobias Harris scored 4 points in the game
"Thinking just about the roster I see some vague personnel parallels (gotta squint really hard tho...)  Seth / Korkmaz / Milton etc. as the shooters (ultra poor-man's splash bros), Tobias Harris as (a better version of?) Harrison Barnes, and Embiid as a much better version of Bogut?"
"I get it. Simmons is a liability on offense. His free throw shooting can't be relied upon. He definitely wasn't great by any means down the stretch of this one. But i don't get why ALL the hate is heading his way.   Tobias Harris is a max player. Unlike simmons, he is being paid to score. He was trash all game tonight. He scored 4 points! He was the only starter with a negative +/-.      -10!  Im not telling anyone to stop hating on simmons, but give harris his share of the blame, too."
Lots of people shitting on Ben and deservedly so but where the hell was Tobias Harris tonight? Also we have to stop pretending Doc Rivers is one of the best coaches in the NBA.
"Embiid is weak, which we already knew. Also imagine spending as much as they did on no show Tobias Harris 😂"
Everyone shitting on Doc and Simmons but holy shit Tobias Harris was horrible. Just awful play from him after looking like his contract wasn’t the worst in the league.
Marcus Morris or Tobias Harris?
Everyone roasting Simmons but Tobias Harris literally scored 4 points
"Tobias Harris didn't show up, but Seth Curry took on responsibilities of being 2nd scorer. I feel like previous regime didn't maximize this roster."
This wasn’t the problem… the problem was Tobias Harris passing up a wide open three right before this
Can we talk about Tobias Harris?!?!?
how tf does Tobias Harris have 4 points what?
"He literally was 1 of 2 sixers to hit a shot in the second half.   Ben Simmons out scores him in the timespan because yet again a team played hack-a-Ben, but this time it worked.  Ben Simmons took 4 shots the entire game.  He was 4-14 from the line, straight up disgraceful for anyone playing basketball at any level.  Tobias Harris is playing the worst basketball of his life.  Joel is playing better basketball than anyone not named KD, playing the most minutes of his career, all with a fucked knee.  What the actual fuck did you watch cause it certainly wasn’t the sixers hawks game."
"""Joel Embiid, you trash.  Tobias Harris, you trash.  Ben Simmons... Ben Simmons listen to me when I say this: You are trash"""
What was Tobias Harris doing
Tobias Harris is being paid approximately $8.5 million for each point he made in today's game.
So they can have the 6'3 version of tobias harris ?
PG - Tobias Harris  SG - Ben Simmons  SF - Joel Embiid  PF - Seth Curry  C - Furkan Korkmaz   Checks out to me.
"Nobody's talking about Tobias Harris because we all know what a joke of a contract that was. He would come up short in the playoffs when it matters, as usual   Like, 76ers fans were really campaigning for this guy to make the All Star Game"
Is no one going to talk about Tobias Harris going for 4 pts in 38 min and having some of the worst turnovers at the end? Ben Simmons is a liability offensively completely but dang vintage Tobias Harris in the playoffs.
Simmons is worth a max on a team like the warriors. Him and Joel just do not fit at all. Doesn't help when max Tobias Harris also has a trash game.
Tobias Harris
How does Tobias Harris only end up with 4 points?
TOBIAS HARRIS LOL
They had it in jimmy but idk if that fit would've worked long term. They also fucked it up by trading for tobias harris and maxing him instead of getting taht third 25 ppg offensive guy. So many roster construction mistakes
Tobias Harris slowly backing into the hedge.
"Yes if they had James harden, an mvp, and he was doing all the crunch time work, they would be better than with Tobias Harris.   That’s my point. KD, lebron, Kawhi don’t need someone else to take care of crunch time because their post ups don’t work"
tobias harris effect
"Embiid is a phenomenal front runner. When his team is up 20, he’s scoring and dunking and doing everything.  When it’s crunch time it’s “why is Tobias Harris just Tobias Harris, and not a superstar?”"
"Or get a better perimeter scorer than Tobias Harris. They coulda traded for Harden which woulda made them the favorite, but didn’t and it’s hurting them with a hampered Joel"
"No… I was disagreeing with your assertion that you need to build around elite wings to win. Nothing to do with the Hawks. I only mentioned the Hawks after you said you expected the series to be a sweep, hence why I highlighted Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons, because they haven’t shown anything for fans to have so much faith in them dominating a 4th seed with superior offense.   &gt; Again, comprehension is key, nephew."
Kyle Kuzma/Danny Green/1st round pick for Tobias Harris who says no?
"I did, the whole game unfortunately. I won’t be able to sleep tonight for real.  He was inefficient. The sixers choked hard and deserved to lose, but seriously it’s more on doc leaving our bench out their to get roasted by sweet Lou for a whole quarter and not making the starters go back on. Tobias Harris having the worst game of his career. Literally gonna vomit, and Trae got his points but was super inefficient."
No. Tobias harris and ben simmons having horrible games just made it easy to throw bodies at embiid later in the game
Wtf happened to Tobias Harris? 4 pts????
Not Tobias Harris and his 4 points?
"didnt watch the game, where is tobias ""all star"" harris?"
Are we just going to ignore Tobias Harris having 4 points? How does that happen.
Tobias Harris keep gettin dem check bruh
They intentionally sent him to the line on about 10 of those when they were behind by 20 or more points. It is embarrassing but in this game we did not lose because of it. We lost because Rivers sent a shit house five man rotation out there and let the game slip and lost all momentum.  Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons were equally ineffective on offense tonight.  But we lost because of Doc.
Like he’s bad but he can’t control Tobias Harris being bad and Simmons being a complete liability
“Tobias Harris...listen to me when I say...you...are trash.”
"Embiid fell apart at the end, but he carried for 3qs, feel like he gets a pass. But where the fuck is Tobias Harris? Feel like Ben's awful ft shooting is letting Harris slide a bit."
Tobias Harris was a complete no-show.Ben Simmons can’t make free throws. Embiid disappeared in the second half. A very flawed basketball team certainly not championship caliber.
"Tobias Harris, the second option on offense, probably takes those honors."
Another question is who is going to take tobias harris? it's obvious he's not a good fit with embiid with his reluctance to shoot 3s and his wanting to post up lmao
Tobias Harris had 4 points…
"I know Ben Simmons played bad, but where was Tobias Harris this whole game? Dude was a ghost unless he fouled someone on Atlanta."
Tobias Harris ducking the fade but he was hella ass
Tobias Harris. Bejing Ducks. Kormaz. Rwanda Patriots.
Ben Simmons &amp; Tobias Harris: 4-15 from the floor 4-14 from the line 12/8/12 in a must win game. Inexcusable
Ben scored 2x the amount Tobias did today.  4 on 2/11 from Harris. jesus
Why are they dragging out Tobias Harris?
Embiid is no where near as big of a problem as Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris 4pts and no one is surprised
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris disappearing act are Houdini-esque. Kinda amazing when you think about it.
Wtf are they paying Tobias Harris for? 180m for 4 pts? Smh
Playoff Tobias Harris = Basketball Africa J Cole
Nah Tobias Harris 38 min 4 pts  He lost the game for the Sixers
How bout Tobias Harris
"Lmaoo I went to the washroom for 10 mins, and came back too ATL down 9. Then I realized tobias Harris was a no show and Ben can’t hit free throws."
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris… yikes
Tobias Harris and Simmons combining for an absolute BANGER 12 points
Lost in all the Simmons hate is the fact that Tobias Harris has 4 points on 2-11. Everyone not named Embiid or Curry should be ashamed
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris are way more fraudulent than Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe but they get a pass ‘cause they play for a big market.
Imagine giving Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris max contracts when you’ve got one of the most skilled centers ever in the prime of his career lol
Imagine paying Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris max contracts.
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris happened.
TOBIAS HARRIS SELLING HARD LMAO.
"I mean, Tobias Harris deserves at least part of the blame as well."
"Lou Will more impactful in crunch time than Simmons or Tobias Harris, you love to see it"
Tobias Harris is such a bum lmao. 2-10 for a whole 4pts and gets blocked when Embiid is getting hounded in front of the rim
"Clearly, Philly's problem is that they are never going to win it all with Tobias Harris. A straight up Harris for McCollum swap is the key to their success. Absolutely. Trust me here."
Imagine giving Tobias Harris the max.
Tobias Harris 2-11 lmao
Tobias Harris throwing
max player tobias harris
Tobias Harris is the MVP for the Hawks.
i feel bad for Sixers fans. Embiid potentially winning MVP was the closest thing to success they could have had in 20 years but now it's gone down the drain. now they're stuck gassing up tobias harris and ben simmons scoring 15 ppg. sad times ahead
Tobias Harris 2/10 with 4 points.   Ben Simmons 2/4 and 4/14 from the line.
"&gt; Tyshawn Taylor  Bucks legend.   &gt; Bucks learned anything from losing Tobias Harris, it's gonna be to play their youngsters   We clearly didn't learn this.  Cool post. Specially for these guys like Khris who came in so unsung."
"I think they’d make it work, but it’s still bad for spacing. Embiid needs to be near the basket to be effective, and Tobias Harris is already more of a midrange shooter than a 3 point shooter. Adding DeMar just means that their 3 best players will still be at their best inside of the 3pt line. He can space more than Simmons and can actually drive to the basket and hit free throws so it’d be a big improvement, but he’s still not a great fit.   Also they already have Seth Curry who’s a liability on defense. Swapping Ben for DeMar on defense would be a big step down on that end"
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
Sadly one obvious one was trading 2 firsts and a promising rookie Shamet for half a season of Tobias Harris and having the privlidge to then pay him 5 years 180 million the following offseason.
"I mean, on our end it's Marcus Smart and Horford for Tobias Harris and 2 firsts, I don't hate it that much. We'd just need to find a PG."
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
Khris “Thank God He’s Not Tobias Harris” Middleton
"I know its all jokes and everything. But Im sure another team wants him. They see some value that us as fans dont see. Obv its not going to be for Dame, Malcolm Brogdon, or even Tobias Harris. But Im sure some teams probably see something in. They most likely dont see him as some kind of all stat. But maybe as a role player or what not."
r/nba: 3rd worst contract in the league behind Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons.
Kemba Walker  Tobias Harris  Jerami Grant  Pascal Siakham  Wendell Carter
“Pride is the devil”- Tobias Harris
My point isn't that players are never going to want to leave it's that teams are going to have a hard time trading because everyone will have max or near max money dedicated to the Tobias Harris or Pascal Siakams of the world.
"I can agree with that. If you've watched the last dance it's actually pretty incredible how little guys like Pippen were getting paid compared to Jordan. The salary cap is certainly weird, especially with the max contract. I think I'd enjoy a league with a higher cap but with the max contract abolished. Pay guys like LeBron 50% of the cap if that's what the market commands. It'd be much better than guys like Tobias Harris getting maxed just because there's a max slot available."
"Tobias Harris, I honestly think we should look to trade him before moving on from Ben"
"It's absolutely fair. There's literally nothing more you could ask of a second option. There's guys being underpaid to be better but Khris has 100% earned his salary.   He's making around what Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Tobias Harris, and CJ McCollum are making, I'd put him at the same level as all of them."
Um Tobias Harris is the 7th highest paid player in the history of professional Basketball   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_sports_contracts
"Dame isn't dumb, there's no point in requesting a trade to a team in a slightly better situation than Portland, if you are going to leave, leave to somewhere that's actually much better.  Put Dame with Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris or with Steph and Klay and that's a superteam."
"Grant can prolly be a second option on a contending team tbh. He’s basically Tobias Harris, and he’s the Sixers’ second option."
Ben Simmons &amp; Tobias Harris for Lillard anyone anyone
"If we are talking about keeping him in Portland, KAT for Nurkic/Simons and a ton of picks. Then see if there is a bite on McCollum for Tobias Harris. Starting lineup of Dame, Powell, Harris, RoCo, and KAT.   I'm guessing though Minnesota isn't looking to trade KAT so it's probably fantasy land. But the bigger wings closer to 20th and that offense would be absolutely bananas."
"Joel embiid, maybe Tobias Harris."
"If Dame actually demands a trade, and gives a list of teams he wants to play for, it’s not like the Blazers are going to have a ton of options. If Philly is on that list, the deal would be as much about the picks and additional players as it would be about Simmons. Even if it took the Blazers five years to rebuild, Simmons will be 30, not 50, and they’d probably still be able to squeeze a few good years out of him as a vet on a mostly younger team. Salaries have to at least come close to matching in a trade, and Dame is getting paid a pretty decent amount of money; Embiid is clearly off the table for the 6ers, and I don’t think they’d move Tobias over Ben (not to mention that if age is a factor, Tobias is four years older than Ben). Nobody else on Philly is on the books for more than ~$10M next year, and even if you include money that’s not fully guaranteed, like George Hill’s $10M and Paul Reed’s $1.5M, the 6ers roster outside of their top 3 is scheduled to make $20.4M as of right now. Dame is schedule to make $39.3M. A deal doesn’t get done without Embiid, Harris, or Simmons included, and the latter is the most likely to be available for Portland."
"I mean without Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris, the Sixers are lucky to get the 6 or 7 seed"
"He probably lands in Philly.  Ben, thybulle, picks and/or maxey.  Would be even better if Philly could move tobias Harris for value, because they’re gonna need defense if that is the case. But they probably wouldn’t be able to. None of the teams that can afford Dame are in a position where getting him is the smartest move except Philly."
"Team USA: Too many iso scorers, not enough play making or defense  Also Team USA: Beal cant play...lets try for Tobias Harris"
"Please don't be a delusional Dubs fan spouting superlatives like this...  I'd take KD, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, OG Anunuby, Khris Middleton and Jaylen Brown immediately, as well as a healthy Kawhi and Lebron, but it's unlikely any of them are available. I'd also highly consider Nic Batum, Tobias Harris, Micheal Porter, and Harry Barnes  Wiggs is good enough and important to fill a specific role on the GSW, and he's vital to holding on to that max salary slot for trade purposes.  But he'll always be an overpaid #1 pick with significant limitations. The lack of ball handling and passing vision/BBIQ, poor FT shooting, poor rebounding, and generally bad shot selection all contribute to being an average player who has always been net-negative by BPM, RPM, RAPTOR, etc."
"I like DeMar but nah, he's average on defense, a mid range guy who won't help their spacing and not a great passer.  They need a defensive stud or playmaking point guard.  Tobias Harris would actually help them defensively.  They have enough scorers."
Tobias Harris?!? But they already have jayson Tatum!
"Kevin Love, Jerami Grant, Darius Garland, yea sure why not Tobias Harris too in the same vein."
"Ah yes, the max contract guard, Tobias Harris."
In 2018 and early 2019 I thought kuzma was on par with Tobias Harris lol
he’s saying jj redick was traded *from* the magic in 2014 to get tobias harris
Right now? Embiid Simmons..Harris about the same. Tobias 5 years younger better scorer and rebounder. Granted never been an all star but neither will Lowry ever again.
"I feel like Khris is a 1.5 - He's definitely not in that KD/Kawhi realm where you can count on him playing well every single game, but I feel like he's a level above the traditional #2 like Tobias Harris or CJ McCollum. Guys like Jamal Murray, Booker, Westbrook, and *maybe* PG (who may be a legit #1 after this post-season) fall into  this category. I don't think any of these guys could be the #1 option on a championship team, but they're more valuable than a lot of the guys most often thought of as #2s"
"Sixers have been built up to be the Bucks stopper for 3 years now, and each season they disappoint. I think the Sixers are really just in purgatory now until they find a way to trade Simmons and Tobias Harris for someone who can help Embiid. Honesty the Sixers make the ECF this year if the would've kept Butler"
"Duuude me and my buddies just talked about this like two days ago lol  Happy birthday, Tobias Harris!"
Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons take a look at how a real second star handles his business. Bums.
"He’s a great player man, regardless of inconsistencies.  I personally always thought Khris was a tier or two better. He’s not even just a scorer, he’s a really good playmaker with great defense. Tobias isn’t giving you all that, and he couldn’t even score effectively to beat the Hawks. Not a big Harris fan if you couldn’t tell lol"
Hield and Bagley for Tobias Harris and we call it good
"Yeah completely agree which is why it would be crazy to give up 3 firsts for Ben Simmons. I think if they are willing to trade 3 firsts they should explore the market for those picks.   What the 76ers have that the Kings don't are other pieces like Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and Danny Green that could be packaged with those picks. So if 3 picks isn't enough, they might be able to make a package that is"
A bad contract say you? Like Tobias Harris? 😈
"Have they really though? Overpaying Horford was a bad move, but they were able to dump him after one year.  They got Jimmy Butler for peanuts and that very nearly led to them winning the title. It was worth the gamble.  The Tobias Harris trade worked well, and while his contract initially was an overpay, it's looking to be a fair deal and he pairs well next to Embiid.  They also have Seth Curry on a great contract, Thybulle and Maxey were great picks, Dwight on a minimum made sense, and unfortunately Danny Green got hurt, but he made sense for this team.  It's not the GM's fault Simmons cratered so hard in the playoffs.   What specific assets have been ""squandered"" and what other options were available since Hinkie's departure? Maybe Paul George, but what else? Hinkie didn't necessarily leave them with that great of assets besides the core of Simmons/Embiid, as most other picks were bad to average players."
At the very least he wouldn't have made the Fultz trade. He probably also wouldn't have gone all in for Tobias Harris and a Jimmy Butler rental.
"I think the 76ers would make an error to trade him. He's such a unique player, but he's not ""the second superstar""of a contender. More like a Super Boris Diaw.  The 76ers should try to acquire a bigger star (guard) by trading Tobias Harris and young assets, and let Simmons play a lesser role on offense (as a forward, don't let him run the whole offense on halfcourt). A role where it is ok to finish the game with 6 points.   Like, try something like Harris+Thybulle+picks for Lilliard. Or for Donovan Mitchell if he can't stand anymore to play in Utah ;-)  It's a pity that they couldn't keep Jimmy Butler.  I mean, I really like how Harris is playing this year, but he has reached his ceiling and it's probably not good enough to be the second superstar.  With less pressure, Simmons would probably do fine. Even if he misses his free throws (but he won't have the ball in his hands so often). And yes, for the 76ers it's an awful contract for this kind of role, but yeah, it's sunk cost, just live with it."
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."
"Against the NBA champions, they were the only team to push them that far  Correct me if im wrong but it’s possible for a team to have 3 max players and solid supporting players. The problem is giving a max to Tobias Harris   You’re never gonna quantify Simmons impact by counting his PPG, you wouldn’t be able to with Draymond Green or even Bam Adebayo. Without Simmons defense on Kawhi, his ability to push the ball in transition and play make for others i promise you its would have been over in 5"
They could get a Tobias Harris level player
"Why? They honestly seem like terrible trade partners. Fox is a terrible fit with Simmons, and I don’t see Sacramento trading Fox for Simmons. Haliburton seems unlikely to be moved (and I’m not sure he’s a perfect fit in Philly either), and the only other pieces left are Hield (who kind of sucks) and Barnes (who is super redundant with Tobias Harris) or bigs (who make no sense next to Embiid)."
Can you clarify how Simmons didn't fit with Embiid?  Just genuinely asking; it's not every day you have a point guard who can't mesh well with a legendary big man.  I mean wasn't Tobias Harris supposed to help with their shooting needs?
"Chill bro, you're coming in too hot over nothing.  You guys can't get Lowry without a S&amp;T.    We have not reason to help you guys on that front.  If he walks it frees up cap space which is a lot better than taking on useless salary like George Hill who you guys opted for on deadline day.  Not keen on a ""Tobias Harris"" era in Toronto either.  But in truth, Lowry's got respect for the Toronto front office for overpaying to keep him in Toronto, winning a championship, and giving his family ""generational wealth (his comments)"". He might walk but more likely he'll go via S&amp;T.  He completely understood not moving at the trade deadline and fully supported Masai's decision to not give him away for scraps.  I wouldn't be surprised if we re-sign him and in a worst case scenario, trade I'm to a contender at the deadline."
Spurs don’t have any pieces that would help the Sixers more than Simmons.  Magic have the 5th pick but the 76ers want to win now not develop a rookie.  The Thunder have Shai but I don’t think they view Simmons as the better player in that trade.    Bulls have no assets that can help the 76ers win now.  Pacers have tried to get Ben already supposedly and I can’t see them giving better offers than what was leaked.  Ben on the Bulls with LaVine and Vucevic would be the best place for him with the Thunder building a team of shooters around him being the second best option for him but I don’t think those trades happen.  76ers should try to move Tobias Harris instead of Simmons.
I mean the 76ers 4 is Tobias Harris who is a better shooter than George Hill and Maxey so yea
"Yup Toppin looked super nervous and raw early on, but since then he's produced really well in the time he gets. It's a good sign when a rookie starts playing their best basketball in the postseason too. IMO without Randle in front of him and playoff aspirations he would've had a good shot at the all-rookie team and at least been a reasonably efficient 15/8.  The big thing is that he was borderline average on D by the end of the season (usual rookie fouls and brain farts mixed in), and that his mobility looked more like a Tobias Harris type than a pure big man."
Overpaying for Tobias Harris and Al Hortford?
Kenyon Martin----Aaron Gordon(there isnt a great one for this)  Keith Van Horn---Bojan Bogdanovic/Tobias Harris   Kerry Kittles----Will Barton  Richard Jefferson----yeah I guess Bridges isnt bad
"They have the ammunition and motivation but there's no such thing as inevitable. Plenty of teams in that position never actually make the big move. And they have potentially stiff competition for any such trade considering teams like New Orleans.  Look at Boston when they were getting all those great Nets picks. I guess they got Kyrie for a bit, but the long-rumored trades for AD etc never materialized. Philly had a huge war chest at one point and only really got Tobias Harris.   Trading for a superstar isn't the easiest thing in the world, they're not always available."
So is Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons
"Wiggins is a nice piece. Every team in the league would want a 6'6"" wing who can play defense and get you 16-18 points every night. Athletic wings are probably the most in-demand commodity in the NBA these days, which is why people like Tobias Harris and Andrew Wiggins are on huge contracts, and why some team will probably overpay for Kelly Oubre. Basically every team in the league wants this type of player, even if only for the bench rotation. So yeah, Wiggins is a solid get who can help almost any team in the league. Only issue is the contract, which is going to be restrictive for some teams."

"Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz + Firsts for a shooting wing please"
"Adding Love means the team that trades for Sexton gets to dump their own hideously overpaid player. Like, Philly trading Tobias Harris for Love would be a big win for them since Love (when healthy) would shoot lots of threes and his contract would be shorter (not saying that trade is going to happen)."
"Hell, look at Jacque Vaughn on the Magic a few years ago, he looks like a decent coach now but he only got three years with them when their best player was . . . old Al Harrington? Young Oladipo or Tobias Harris? Arron Afflalo? Mo Harkless?"
"De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, and Tyrese Haliburton for Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, and 28 overall."
Sixers sign trade for Tobias Harris?  Lowry comes home to Philly with his boy DeRozan.
"And the first round pick was used to acquire Tobias Harris.  So while Mikal would have been perfect for the 76ers, if they hasn't been able to acquire Harris, they maybe worse off."
"Let me break it down for your dumb ass.  The Sixers have existed for 70 years  They have been to the Conference Finals only NINE of those 70 years.  Pistons went to the conference Finals 6 years in a row, back to back Finals, and took down Shaq and Kobe preventing the 3peat and breaking up the Lakers while changing the landscape of the league literally changed the rules to prevent low scoring games since the Pistons held teams under 70 pts for 11 out of 82 regular season games.  Your Sixers team was the butt of all jokes and still is.  Tobias Harris is due 40M until 2024. Ben Simmons is due 40M until 2025. LMFAO. Good luck finding any takers for those albatross deals.  You think Embiid wants to stay in Philly?  How did Fultz work out for you? Seems like he carved himself a nice niche in Orlando. Really could have used his scoring in yet another flame out in this year's playoffs. Even a new coach couldnt save you.  Your team tanks, doesnt develop players, and has ZERO to show for decades of shitty play except a loss in the Conference Finals. This was their year and they blew it.  I get why that leaves you feeling bitter. Hope you feel better and are able to get out of that shit hole and actually see and experience other parts of the world to know that ""Philly #1 DURRRR"" is not always the case lol"
In the playoffs:  22/9/4 on 49/37/88  12/4/2 on 46/36/92  Yet one is considered useless and the other a rising star.  Give Tobias Harris Chris Paul as his PG instead of a player that cannot score and see how he looks.
I think the Harris contract is a little absurd but this comment is foolish. Harris averaged 20/7/3 on nearly 50/40/90 splits during the regular season and 22/8/3 on 48/37/87 splits during the playoffs. This year especially I feel Tobias really stepped up for the Sixers and showed a killer instinct
Tobias Harris gets paid 36-40 mill a year to be useless in playoff games.
And you can argue jerami grant is a better player than Tobias Harris
"Not near the worst, but one trade that never gets brought up anywhere is when Milwaukee traded Tobias Harris in his second season to Orlando at the 2013 trade deadline for half a season of JJ Redick. Lucky for them they drafted Giannis that same year, so it's largely forgotten."
Jerami Grant makes 20m a year.   Tobias Harris makes 37m a year.   Jerami is not close to a max.
Tobias Harris conundrum
"So what I’m hearing is that you don’t believe DeAaron Fox is a top 40 NBA player, and you’d rather have current Westbrook, McCollum, DeRozan, Duncan Robinson, or Tobias Harris over him?"
"There aren’t better players than Duncan Robinson, CJ McCollum, Tobias Harris getting cut from this league?"
Ah yes the Tobias Harris experience
"But not from a 15 win team to a number 1 team right ?    Giannis does that  Also just want to add I don’t want to hear about he didn’t have players around him.  I’m on Warriors sub and watched almost every game.  You still had good players in Oubre, Wiggins and Dray.  Big believer that Wiggins is as equal if not better at times this year to Middleton or a Tobias Harris. No reason they shouldn’t have been in the playoffs. The inexperience and lack of big man was def a big factor."
"It's capitalism. The owners like Mark Cuban worked their ass off, took risks etc. and became rich. And if it's hereditary wealth, that changes nothing. They're the ones that created that value, they can decide their kids become billionaires when they pass. It's not easy to organize the league and if the worst player in the league is a millionaire, than that is a decent system. I do believe that you are worth what you're paid, ""don't deserve max"" is maybe not worded properly. But if Kevin Durant is getting the same money as Tobias Harris, or Wiggins gets paid as much as Embiid and so on, then somebody is not being paid fairly here."
They don’t. The Suns own their pick. It was the Heat pick that was traded for Bridges that the sixers traded for Tobias Harris.
Embiid is a freak of nature. I agree 100%.  I still think Sixers have a descent team and good coach to take them farther than a Bucks team - Giannis.  Like replace Tobias Harris with Middleton and they probably win that game tn
Because Middleton isn’t Paul George.  He’s a solid 3rd option and poor 2nd.  See: Tobias Harris
lol no. He's a more athletic Tobias Harris. Also his defense is terrible.
Mentioned it in another thread but TIL Tobias Harris’ father is Oubre’s agent.  Dad is looking for some more $$$.
TIL Tobias Harris’ father is Kelly Oubre’s agent.
Middleton is much better than Tobias Harris
The broke man’s Tobias Harris
Yes that's a fantastic deal for 50m. Thats a little more than 1 year of tobias harris for example.
"Idk I do think there was a scenario where the 76ers were real title contenders this year if the $34M spent on Tobias Harris was allocated to an elite guard.  Not alleviating any blame on him because if he would shoot at all he would fix a lot of these issues, but the previous FO having cornerstones of Embiid and Simmons and then allocating the next $60M of the payroll to another PF and Center is next level, franchise-crippling shit.  A team could build a roster with his $33M or whatever. It's not impossible, but would be hard to do I agree."
 Brook Lopez has had a surprisingly solid career. Good starter in the first half of his career and now a solid contributor in the latter half.   John Collin's ceiling might be higher but I'll be surprised if it is by much.  You  have to hope his upside is a better version of Julius Randle? Tobias Harris?  How many players make a leap after 4-5 years in the league? You kind of get what you get after years 2-3 especially when you start on a lottery team.. Only guy I recall making a leap from good player to superstar after year 4 is Kawhi. A large difference there is opportunity.   I dont have a horse in this race just looking at it objectively...I think lol.
Thats cuz guys like Tobias Harris were putting up the same numbers on similar efficiency
"I hated that move so much man. Reminded me of the trade SVG made for Blake Griffin for win-now results, giving up both Tobias Harris and a 1st that ended up becoming Shai Gilgeous Alexander, and reaching a ceiling of an 8th seed and a first round sweep"
Tobias Harris?  Lol
"I think if the offer was K Love and Sexton for Tobias Harris, the Sixers take it."
The bucks got clowned when we maxed Middleton—Collins is good but he’s not gonna be a Middleton level/Tobias Harris level player
Tobias Harris
"I wish we could somehow acquire Lou if we really have to lose CJ for an asset. Lou would be perfect next to Dame as a closer and 6th man. And if we could leverage it to trade up for someone like Tobias Harris, even better. Imagine a lineup of Dame, Powell, Harris, Roco, Nurk with Ant, Lou, Melo, and Kanter off the bench.   With a new coach? That’s a fuckin squad."
Yeah he is. He's fringe all star tier with guys like tobias harris.
Bucks beat that 6er's team with how bad Embiid was hobbled.  No way Simmons or Tobias Harris carries them to the Finals.
And here I was thinking Tobias Harris and Middleton were on the same tier. I wish Tobi was able to show up when it mattered most like him
"Dude I 100% guarantee you okc isn’t trading SGA so please please don’t think of that ever again lol like fr. That realistically makes no damn sense for okc to make a trade with the bulls for pat, coby and some picks as if we aren’t building the team around sga right now and don’t already have 18 picks frp over the next 6 years lol we’re set. I do in a way agree with your post though not fully but in some areas yes. For example philly already has 3 stars Tobias Harris just isn’t consistent enough and Ben Simmons is Ben Simmons lol. Gsw have just been plagued with injuries klay will be back next season next to dray and Steph. Dray being the playmaker obviously. NOP def needs a third scorer/shot creator, Por is out of luck Dame is ready to go imo. Etc etc."
There's no way any team views him as a neutral asset. Tobias Harris is making top 20 money but is around a top 40-50 player. He's making 38M/year over the next 3 seasons. It's clearly a bad asset.
"Tobias Harris is a negative contract, how would they be selling high on him? He's a part of the reason they lost to the hawks, putting up 4 points in 11 shots in a close loss to them."
Tobias Harris stats make him look like a winning player. In reality he couldn't be further from that. Passes up open 3s. Beats someone off the dribble once or twice a season it seems like. Wastes possessions by backing down shorter guards for 15 seconds and missing fade away jumpers. On paper he looks like a solid scorer. In reality he's a very mediocre scorer who makes his team worse
Also Tobias harris is terrible at scoring for someone who is supposed to be a scorer. I think he's more to blame then ben
"I think the idea that Lebron would have had Ben traded is revisionist. I just can't see Philly moving him at that time, although who knows how it might unfold over the course of several seasons.  &gt; Does this team possibly 3 peat?  The fuck?  &gt; Do they still get Jimmy Butler &amp; Tobias Harris?  No"
Probably still whiff on Fultz or possibly take Lonzo first. I bet the Tobias trade doesn’t happen because Ingram is there and improving. I think Butler would be 50-50 but for the sake of argument let’s say they still make it.  Fultz/Butler/x/Ingram/Embiid  Core of Butler/Ingram/Embiid. Likely still keep Butler because you don’t have to choose between him and Harris. Would be a very different NBA landscape
* Tobias Harris  * Malcolm Brogdon  * Nikola Vucevic  * Robert Covington
Sixers haven’t done anything good other than draft Embiid. They’ve done a terrible job surrounding a top 10 player with players that actually fit his play style. 2 first overall picks and both end up not knowing how to shoot. Them giving Tobias Harris like 50 millions dollars a year. They’re still a poverty franchise and probably still would be tanking if they hadn’t hit on Embiid. Morey could definitely turn it around tho.
Tobias Harris
"I think Siakam makes a bit more sense, but I still have issues with that. I had a huge thread on the Blazers sub and most people tended to agree with me.  ""Siakam is interesting because he seems more available (I guess the Raptors are really taking this ""retool"" thing to heart). My issue with them though is that they're seriously looking for a haul. As I previously said, I don't think there's any player available that actually moves the needle. Because of this, I don't think it's worthwhile for the Blazers to fork over their entire future's worth of draft capital along with CJ for Siakam if that'll just result in a second-round exit.""  My TLDR was I'd try to arrange a 3-team trade for Harrison Barnes instead of Siakam. Barnes production isn't that far away from Siakam or Tobias Harris (the two major guys I've seen get thrown around) and most importantly I think Barnes could be obtained for substantially cheaper.  If there's no guy available that truly moves the needle, then don't mortgage your draft future for them. You can still make trades to field a better roster without breaking the bank. And if fielding a more competent roster still isn't enough to satisfy Dame then getting off CJ's contract makes your entire starting roster easier to move for more picks."
PG: Delon Wright   SG: Tyrese Haliburton   SF: Brandon Ingram   PF Tobias Harris   C: Nikola Vucevic
Would still have Tobias Harris also
tobias harris and j cole are basically twins
"Rozier, Tobias Harris, Derozan, Sexton, or Brogdon?"
"Going to ignore Tobias Harris, and Embiid at the cup as well?"
"Hunter *can* play the 4 but that’s not how the Hawks use him or really want to. He gets the #1 perimeter creator as his defensive assignment and with Capela back in the paint and not really being a super switchable center, that leaves a gaping mismatch against guys like a Tobias Harris or Siakam if one of Bogi/Huerter has to guard them most nights."
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
* ben simmons * seth curry * tobias harris * danny green * andre drummond  They would beat the Sacramento Kings when they'd play them in Philly.
"Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum type of piece."
Rondo's career earnings (110) is less than what Tobias Harris has left for the final 3 years of his contract (115)
"Fox, McCollum, OG or Wiggins, Tobias Harris, and Ayton"
PG: Fox  SG: CJ McCollum  SF: Tobias Harris  PF: Wood  C: Ayton
This is it. Maybe Tobias Harris at PF
Apparently MPJ doesn’t play the 4 much so he has an argument. Maybe OG or Tobias Harris as well.
Pg. Jamal Murray  Sg: Shai  Sf: MPJ  Pf: Tobias Harris  C: Ayton
Maybe MPJ or Tobias Harris over Wiggins.
PG: de'aaron fox  SG: SGA  SF: Og anunoby  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Deandre ayton
**G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** SGA  **F:** Jerami Grant  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Clint Capela
"Would have saved them from trading for Tobias Harris too, probably."
"Not trade for Tobias Harris or sign him to a 5 year max , and not drafting Fultz and instead drafting Tatum or Mitchell"
"Deaaron fox/Christian wood in west.  I like fox more than morant for next year and a big has a better chance of making it but I don’t think phx gets 3 all stars so tough for ayton.  West I’ll go Tobias Harris or brogdon,  Tobias will get more credit next year with the Simmons stuff and I think Indiana is going be competitive and brogdon will be one of their best players"
"It all stems back to Fultz busting IMO. He was supposed to be the third star in their young core they could compete with for 5+ years. Perfect fit next to Embiid and Simmons as a pick and roll point guard who could take pull-up 3’s and create his own offense in isolation. Basically a better offense and worse defense but much younger version of Jimmy Butler.  Fultz busting led to panic trades for Butler and Tobias Harris, which didn’t work out."
"They cut their tank short when Hinkie was replaced by Colangelo.   He’s the one who got tricked by Ainge for Fultz.   Their next GM, Elton Brand is the one who traded for veterans like Butler, Tobias Harris, etc.  We didn’t get to see them finish the process"
"Tobias Harris, my man, enjoy your money!"
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn’t even close y’all got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven’t seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
Kemba was coming off an All-NBA season when he signed with the Celtics. He's not at all comparable to Tobias Harris at the times they signed their contracts. Kemba only became an overpay in hindsight.
"It's pretty clear that Simmons will stay in Philly if those are the options though, aka what has happened so far. I'd rather trade Tobias Harris for CJ McCollum."
Tobias Harris available. Praise Odin
And half per year of what Tobias Harris is making
"Yup, it comes from a weird mentality because people think athletes are just playing a game, but not understanding that the business side of the game literally wouldn't exist if not for the players.  Superstars are underpaid in a system with max contracts. Steph is, at worst, fairly compensated, but he's probably underpaid when you look at the value he brings to the franchise. LeBron has been underpaid his entire career compared to the money he brings in for any of his teams. The only max players who are actually overpaid are guys like Tobias Harris (who due to salary cap limitations had leverage when he signed his deal) or John Wall (who will never be healthy enough to play at the level that earned him his deal, but that's not really his fault)."
"Thank god you've got Ben Simmons anchoring your defense with such notable liabilities as *Danny Green*, *Tobias Harris*, *Matisse Thybulle*, and horrible defensive center *Joel Embiid*. Without Simmons those guys would be lost on the defensive end."
"Tobias Harris might work. Salaries match and the 6ers wouldn't mind the extra wing depth and shooting.   Tobias is a good swiss army knife type 2-way player with passing instincts and a decent outside shot and should fit in well in the Jazz system. He's a bigger player too, their starting roster lacks size with 2 6'1 guards and Royce at 6'4."
Honestly it makes sense. If you are an automatic super max player you don't need one. All the in between guys like Tobias Harris or Sabonis it makes sense because sometimes you can get the same amount of compensation in a way that helps your team. But Embiid is getting all of his money no matter what.
A few years ago a Tobias Harris/Khris Middleton comp was commendable
Philly did essentially pull Tobias Harris. I’d say he’s on par with Hayward kemba etc.
Not sure why Tobias Harris is on the market only a few trades are realistic with his contract.
"Wasn't a rumor running that D'Lo was a personal request from KAT? You don't want to disgruntle your only superstar for Tobias Harris, I think."
"Not a star, but Tobias Harris' dad is his agent. Kyrie fired his agent a couple weeks back, but I don't think we know if he is going to hire another one."
Would either team say yes to a D'Angelo Russell and a protected first for Tobias Harris trade
JJ reddick over Tobias harris
Because they REALLLLLLY love what Tobias Harris has to offer...: like really really love it.
Or Tobias Harris
"I hate the eras argument. Honestly. It's low hanging fruit and at most half right.  The league had seen efficient perimeter offense exist in these slow, grimy, slugfest eras the league went through. The problem was people just didn't believe in it nowhere near as much as they should have. Larry Bird, Mitch Richmond, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Steve Nash even all were efficient perimeter shooters that had grown up and been coached away from the most efficient shot in their arsenal instead of being told to lean into it. There was an aura of purity to the game for the longest time, a rigid approach ""play the game the right way,"" so on and so forth. But these guys were prototypical modern superstars coached into decreased efficiency. I think it's fair to hold it against the prior generations that they just didn't do math. Because that's what it boils down to. They didn't like the math telling them to play the game a different way than what felt *correct*. We didnt fundamentally change how we measured efficiency in basketball. We figured out how to quantify it more thoroughly, but basketball has more or less the same baseline metrics for efficiency that it always has.  Do we have a higher volume of efficient perimeter superstars than weve ever had in our league? Sure. But I'd argue we're at a better understanding of the game for that to help inform who (and what) we should be looking for to set the baseline of efficiency. There are still guys with older games in the league today that fit that older ideation of the game, guys like DeMar DeRozan, DeAaron Fox, Russ is a great one for this category, Embiid without a doubt (though he's retrofit his game to live up to a modern standard of efficiency himself) all would be killing it if we were as rigid on our view of basketball in this age as we were in the 2000s.  I mean hell, look at guys like Kyle Korver, or Peja Stojakovic, or Chauncey Billups (even though he won a ring and is one of the most obvious Hall of Fame cases among retired players. I just learned that hes the only player in NBA history with a winning record against MJ, Kobe *and* LeBron). In their time they fulfilled very desired archetypes that exist today that I can directly correlate to a player currently playing that is seen as signficantly better than they were seen as when they were at their peaks. (Chauncey &lt;-&gt; Dame ; Peak Peja (I'm talkin '03-'04 Peja who put up 25 ppg on 48/40/92 splits)&lt;-&gt; Paul George, but mean of his prime Peja was probably more Tobias Harris; Korver &lt;-&gt; Duncan Robinson).  The variety of talent has always been there. And the fact that preferences have changed from the 2000s to today isn't some kind of counterweight that should devalue today's production and efficiency to spot older generations some slack. If they believed the game could be played the way it is today they'd have leaned just as hard into it in the mid 90s as they lean into it in this day and age. Hell, David Stern spent most of the 2000s praying for the league to produce a level of offense we see as routine today"
"Tobias Harris turned down 4/80 from the Clippers and basically said, ""fuck you, either pay me or trade me/let me go.""  &gt;According to David Aldridge of NBA.com, Harris turned down an $80 million contract extension from the Clippers in ""amicable discussions."" That means he will play the one remaining season on his current contract and then be eligible for a significant max deal next offseason. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787367-nba-rumors-tobias-harris-rejects-80-million-contract-extension-from-clippers  Then he gets traded to the 76ers, and they immediately re-signed him for 5/180.  LOL  &gt;The Sixers will retain free agent Tobias Harris on a five year, $180 million contract, a source confirmed to PhillyVoice on Sunday evening. It is a small discount underneath the max, but not much of one, and Harris will be paid handsomely to play alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons for years to come.  https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-free-agency-tobias-harris-sixers-philadelphia-76ers-sign-five-year-180-million-contract/"
Tobias Harris
"Joel embied, jj reddick, jimmy butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons  and al holford all on the same team and still could reach finals??!?! How?!?!!?!"
"Ben Simmons, on his current contract, is untradeable - he's an overpaid defensive specialist and a negative asset on his max contract.  Likewise, Tobias Harris is horribly overpaid, and a negative asset.  Philly doesnt have an effective half-court point guard. It relies on Embiid for rim protection. Their outside shooting is shaky.  Their offseason saw them tread water. They are $8m into the luxury tax. Harris and Simmons are getting raises next year.  The team is just what you describe as the upside for anyone making the mistake of taking on Ben Simmons' contract - you get to make the finals, cheer a bit and then bow out when it's all good teams all the time.  Get better or Embiid's gone."
"Norman Powell, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Hayward, Randle, Jarrett Allen, Hield, Norman Powell, etc you gotta overpay your key rotation guys a lot of the time, even if they're not your traditional superstars / All-Stars."
Tobias Harris for hield and bagley
He's good but overpaid. And I could see him having a Tobias Harris-like drop the further he goes in the playoffs.
He might as well not even run to that end of the court...Tobias Harris was garbage that series as well and Embiid was trash offensively outside of 1 game. It was really just Jimmy trying to force the issue and JJ Redick hitting open shots
I’m a Toronto fan and that 76ers team was no joke. Embiid Butler Tobias Harris JJ yes even Ben.
"Besides Wall, Tobias Harris' contract is pretty bad. Three more years at between $35-40 million a year for a player who is...good, I guess.   Porzingis' contract is pretty terrible with three years to go, an injury history, and a bad fit in Dallas.   Kevin Love's contract stinks as does Hayward's."
Tobias Harris
"tobias’ and ben’s aren’t even close. tobias is barely even worth half his contract lol. you can get harrison barnes for less than half his deal and he’s like 90% of the player.   i get it, everyone hates ben now, i’m not a big fan of him either. but he’s easily a more impactful player than harris, is a lot younger and on a better fitting team would probably be less exploitable than he is on the sixers"
Tobias harris
It’s John Wall we’ve been over this. Love close 2nd. If we aren’t taking injury stricken guys it is probably Tobias Harris/Ben Simmons.
"Just current players:  Fox, Jamal Murray, MPJ, Tobias Harris, Ayton"
"Fox, SGA, Jamal Murray, Tobias Harris, Clint Capella maybe?  It's tough, it's so stacked at guard  edit: looking at everyone else's list, I see that more people went ""all time"" rather than current. I just thought ""all-nba"" implied this past season."
5 x Tobias Harris.
Unpopular but sure let’s do it:   Lower end stars:  5 Jimmy Butlers could make some noise.  5 Luka’s don’t even think I have to explain  5 all star level Julius Randle’s would lose but fight  5 Kris Middleton’s would get shredded on defense  High End Role players:  5 Harrison Barnes  5 Tobias Harris 5 SGA
"it's even possible for [3 teams](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft2011/news/story?id=6697545) to lose a trade at once  &gt;Milwaukee acquires Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, Beno Udrih and Tobias Harris  &gt;Charlotte gets Bismack Biyombo and Corey Maggette  &gt;The Kings get John Salmons, Jimmer Fredette  before anyone is tempted to argue any of these names look good, i'll suggest you look up their stats and payouts around that time and get back to me"
Tobias Harris is a poor mans Prime Melo
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris had 28 against the Kings in the 19-20 season with Simmons and Embiid out.   Horford was a +41 in 36 minutes that game though yeesh
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jrue Holiday"
"PG-Luka Doncic  SG-Jamal Murry  SF-Jerami Grant  PF-Tobias Harris  C-Deandre Ayton  Bench-Malcom Brogdan, CJ McCollum,Mikale Bridges,Aaron Gordan,Clint Capela"
"Malcolm Brogdon Luka Doncic Mikael Bridges Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  No all stars, but a really good team imo"
So we not gonna act like Embiid doesn’t have Tobias Harris as well? Lol Embiid has had more help than AD before AD joined Bron
Tobias Harris mvp of this coming
Tobias Harris man LMAO
Tobias harris
"Getting rid of those guys all happened under Elton Brand, not Colangelo.   * Brand took over on September 18th, 2018  * Brand traded RoCo &amp; Saric for Jimmy Butler on November 12th, 2018  * Brand traded Wilson Chandler &amp; Landry Shamet for Tobias Harris on February 6, 2019  * JJ Redick signed with New Orleans on July 15th, 2019"
"Fultz was the perfect fit next to Simmons and Embiid. If he pans out, they don't trade all of their assets for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris."
"Besides one year, the roster around Embiid is so overrated. Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris have proven they can't be depended on in the playoffs and the one year Embiid had a second guy that did, Butler, they just barely lost to the team that went on to win the east.  If I'm picking between Embiid or AD, I'm taking Embiid as my number 1 guy even though I thin AD is a better fit with other stars. And with Dame, I'd rather have my PG, the guy who's going to have the ball in his hands the most, be a top option."

"I like Tobias, I just like to point out that he wasn't exactly Kobe Bryant in the Hawks series either. Everyone blamed Ben (and I think he is definitely worth a lion's share of the blame, along with Doc), but Harris scored four points in the pivotal Game 5 and that's just unacceptable. Doesn't mean I don't still like him and think he fits well on this team.   The irony is that that's not the only thing that Ben gets criticized for that could also be applied to Harris. While everyone begs Ben to shoot threes and he never does for one reason or another, it goes under the radar that Sixers fans and coaching begs Harris to shoot more threes also. The main difference between him and Middleton (and most on this sub know how remarkably close their percentages are) is that Middleton shoots *way more* threes than him. Around 40% more. He's a line-hugger for sure, but even still we need him to shoot more threes and he rarely ever shoots more than three or four a game."

"hard to find good enough justification to leave him out of the game when Tobias Harris is a hot-and-cold guy and Ben Simmons is, well…"
"Dude, not every post needs to be about Tobias Harris' field goal percentage versus the Pacers. Or trade rumours about a role player who's contract will be bought out.  It's a public forum, I'm allowed to post."
Tobias Harris is worse khris Middleton at this point so that’s worth whatever you think it’s worth
You’re not going to the Finals with Tobias Harris as the 3rd option.  Who’s the 2nd option in Philly anyways?
"Jimmy said several times that he wanted to stay in Philly. I'm saying that keeping Butler and Embiid together was a championship duo and I excluded Simmons on purpose in that scenario. Ben's value was much higher in 2019 because people were more willing to say that the fit for him isn't ideal but after many mental gymnastics and Embiid literally playing 30-40% of his possessions on the perimeter albeit being a generational low and highpost talent it's hard to find more excuses for Ben's supbar playoff performances once he faces an elite team.   Trading Ben would have gotten a massive haul back then, he was thought of as a franchise player, a lite version of LeBron with league-best defensive potential. And ftr I've said that Simmons and Embiid are a very questionable fit in 2018 already but the player Ben could be lead to the Sixers franchise and fans holding onto him for too long. Simmons is a very good, even great player. But he's nowhere close to being Embiid and Embiid benefits from a halfcourt creator like Jimmy much more than a transition and low-post creator like Simmons. His defense and ""theoretical vision"" (because Ben's vision rarely manifests because he's no scoring threat and can't initiate plays and create due to this) were too much of an exciting prospect but a lot of fans from other franchises saw the writing on the wall back then but were seen as haters, dumb or people that didn't watch Philly.   To conclude to something different I still think Philly will get a good haul for Simmons and I also believe the trade for Damian has a good chance of happening. Philly has been one of the best drafting teams so despite bad trades and roster composition they can offer a great young core to build around and if push comes to shove they can still add Tobias Harris to the package as well and then Damian Lillard will definitely be a sixer. After missing out on Harden for no real reason Damian Lillard is a good consolation price. If things had gone a bit differently under Elton Brand the Sixers could maybe have assembled an Embiid/Butler/Lillard core in 2022 or Embiid Harden Butler, surefire championship teams with potential to repeat and stay competitive over a 3-5 year window. I felt keeping Ben because he aligns nicely with Embiids age was a big mistake because Embiid's timeline is moreso a veteran timeline due to his demanding playstyle and health concerns. Pairing him with 30 year old prime Superstars was always the play imo."
"No, not necessarily. Just so many big moves that didn't work out. Trading up for the consensus best prospect in Fultz who completely busted in Philly, trading a ton for Tobias Harris and then signing him to a massive contract, trading for Jimmy Butler who then leaves, Zhaire Smith's allergic reaction, signing Horford and having to dump him, and probably many other moves 76ers fans could bring up.  If Hinkie is still the GM, I'm not sure how many of those moves happen or what would happen instead. A lot of those were terrible even in the moment."
Brogdon - Jalen Brown - Tobias Harris - John Collins - Gobert
Agree with all but number 1. Tobias Harris’ contract is absolutely ridiculous.   I think Kyrie Irving is more overrated than Sabonis as well. He’s a scoring machine but he’s not even close to the level of superstar status he seems to have. He’s not physically big enough to make many plays on his own and will always need a guy like KD with him to make it to the Finals.
"All of these aren't that hot for me, but they're still unpopular enough.  For #2, Embiid is more important and Thybulle is more impactful as a help defender. Spending time with Embiid, Tobias Harris, and Danny Green on the floor allows Ben Simmons a lot of freedom to hound his man, with a lot of help to cover up his mistakes.  For #5, the whole team made a huge step up, but having a strong veteran presence at point guard does do wonders for an offense. Still, improvements from the whole roster (Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Payne, Johnson), solid veteran role players, and really good depth made the Suns team strong.  For #7, a quick qualifier. Gobert's offense down low is not good (we know this all too well), but Conley's injury really hurt him on that end too. The guys were just not finding him anymore once Conley sat out. Possession after possession, you'd see Gobert get solid position down low with plenty of space around him so he can turn and do a quick dunk or finger roll and he just would not get the ball. The Suns experienced this a bit too, where Ayton got a bit frozen out against the Clippers despite having strong games initially.  Also, Gobert is actually quite good at perimeter defense and iso defense, but the 5 out scheme really messed with the Jazz roster, since we have only undersized guards and unathletic wings. Clarkson and a hobbled Mitchell were blown past on too many possessions and having unathletic wings means that they can't help with rim protection (aren't much of a force in the paint because of minimal verticality and too slow to close out after helping). It's a sacrifice the team made, considering they knew they could count on Rudy to force bad shots in the paint, but it's still a team shortcoming."
Stopped reading after “I would even argue that Tobias Harris is better than any player on the Bulls”.
"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"
"What was the biggest tell that I am a nephew? Was it:    * Tobias is better than Lavine take * My username * My inability to spell a weird European name * The fact that I think Zach Lavine is Stephen Marbury 2.0  In all seriousness, I wish I had a do over. Because I still think there is interesting conversation about  what the Bulls have done since last years deadline. Unfortunately it was masked by my disdain of Bulls fans overeating Lavine and my Tobias Harris take. Could have worded it a lot better, instead I posted the most toxic thread of the day on this sub. Guess that counts for something? Ehh whatever. We can chalk it up as Bulls are the 7th best team in the East and some guy was baked on the internet."
"Yeah, I'm not saying he wasn't a part of the issue, but he was frequently the only non-shooter on the floor. The spacing issues are massively overblown.   Ben obviously deserves some criticism, but boiling down losing multiple massive leads at home to one guy bring afraid to shoot is insanely silly.   The wasn't some foundational issue that made the Sixers lose, they just collectively sucked, especially down the stretch of games. Ben was afraid to shoot, Embiid was tired and either bricking or turning the ball over, Doc was running random full-bench lineups that hemorrhaged points, and Tobias Harris didn't step up whatsoever.   Ben gave Trae by far the most trouble of any defender in the playoffs, and that includes Jrue Holiday. Ben was also the best playmaker, and arguably the only meaningful playmaker the 6ers had.   The guy could've played better, but the lack of accountability for anyone else while dumping everything on Ben is nuts."
"So, their second scoring option then? Which would be Tobias Harris...."
"KAT for Tobias Harris, who says no?"
Coaches *help win playoff series. They definitely deserve some credit. But the players are the biggest reason by far. I’d take a team of LeBron and AD coached by Luke Walton over a team of DeMar derozan and Tobias Harris coached by Greg Popovich.
alls i'm saying is it doesn't matter if tobias harris averages 19 points a game if he's shooting 8/24 and 2/11 in two big losses in a series
"No one else failed in the same way.  Who else would you like held accountable? Seth Curry? Tobias Harris? Doc Rivers?  Tobias gets crucified by the fans all the time, but even he isn't SO BAD at any part of the game that he gets played off the court.  Seth Curry's offense was the only thing that was consistent outside of Embiid. His defensive burden was an issue but considering he was our second most important offensive player he can have a pass.  Doc Rivers? Literally, everyone holds him accountable and shits on him relentlessly.   Ben Simmons is the common denominator of issues for 3 consecutive years. Ben Simmons is great on one side of the court, and was such a burden on the other end and to the team as a whole that he had to be benched because he can't even manage to shoot 50% from the FT line. Ben Simmons passed up a wide open dunk out of fear that Trae ""Rudy Gobert"" Young would block him. Ben Simmons deserved to be held accountable."
&gt;Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  19 ppg for the series right on line with his season averages. Nobody’s saying a player can’t have a bad game.   &gt;Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Joel Embiid averaged 30 ppg over 7 games.   &gt;Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Curry - 21 ppg on **78.8 TS%**  Huerter - 13.1 ppg on 57.9 TS%  Just factually wrong. Curry’s offensive production heavily outweighed his defensive shortcomings.
"Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Losing a series is a team effort. And yeah Ben was awful, and Embiid was a monster playing through a real injury, but Ben was crucified"
76ers just kind of take a gap year. Embiid rests a lot. Simmons holds out until the trade deadline. Morey trades Tobias Harris for someone that we all think is washed up or not that great but then they turn out to be really fucking great. Ben Simmons gets traded at the deadline for Bradley Beal and the 2022-23 76ers are stacked.
They can trade Steph and Klay for Embiid and Tobias Harris
"Last year was by far a career high for Wiggins as far as 3-point %. Tobias still had a higher TS% than  Wiggins, and in previous years Tobias has taken 5+ threes a game. I hope Wiggins shoots .380 for the rest of his career, but it's highly unlikely he does so. Harris has proven to be a better shooter and offensive player over their careers.   &gt;Tobias makes more money than Wiggins and his overvalued contract is a year longer  The year longer thing is why it would never happen. The tax is killing this team."
"But we still have Tobias Harris who is ***substantially*** better when played as a PF.   Roster desperately needs a playmaking ball handler, not another injury prone big."
"If only they traded for Kyle Lowry, Sixers just need a main playmaker, Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons and Embiid will make it work easily."
"The best offers were Ingram, 1 pick, and a bad contract or Tobias Harris with one year on his contract and two late lottery picks. The sixers and celtics only offered role players. Kawhi completely destroyed his trade value."
This was just a ridiculous trade for everyone involved.  • Bobcats receive: No. 7 overall pick Bismack Biyombo (from Sacramento); Corey Maggette (from Milwaukee)  • Bucks receive: No. 19 overall pick Tobias Harris (from Charlotte); Stephen Jackson (from Charlotte); Shaun Livingston (from Charlotte); Beno Udrih (from Sacramento)  • Kings receive: No. 10 overall pick Jimmer Fredette and guard John Salmons (from Milwaukee).
"Eh, I’m of the opinion he’s earned going to somewhere he can win. Obviously would rather it be here but I can’t blame him at all at this point if he wants out.   His best teammate has been a guy that is about as good as Tobias Harris lol"
"&gt; It's a popular opinion now but nobody questioned it at the time.  Eh, I think a lot of people questioned it. I'm not talking about Simmons over Butler. But Tobias Harris and Brett Brown over Jimmy was considered a questionable move after their run that ended on an insane shot. I know it ended up being Simmons over Butler eventually, but giving Harris a 5 year max, and not offering the same to Butler feels like it's choosing one over the other. At least from my uneducated perspective.  They could have easily run it back with that team too. I thought Philly would absolutely dominate the east if they kept them all, even with Simmons, especially after Kawhi left. But time makes fools of us all."
"They like Elton brand because of tremendous handling of Jimmy Butler and the massive over pay off a trade and a contract for Tobias Harris. The moves that year to go into win now way too soon we pretty great, they took a Philly team looking to compete for years and hamstrung them."
Don’t know what Tobias Harris does in this scenario but don’t care. Would be hilarious
"I agree with you that it is a silly way to look at it to a point. But there are many parameters to look at. Skills aside, what has KAT done? Not much. Yeah. Wiggins hasn't done much either but because of the scarcity of talent at the Center position, ALL teams would value KAT much higher than Wiggins. But I would argue it's not the skillset. It's because Wiggins could be easily replaced with an above average small forward like Tobias Harris or Trevor Ariza. You can't do that at Center. There's only a handful of Centers better than KAT. So I would argue it's less about talent and more about scarcity. IOW - I think KAT is just an above average NBA player who happens to be big at a position that is short on skill. And yes, that is a talent in itself."
"They would have won the championship if they got past the Raptors. too bad bum ass Tobias Harris put up 2-13 from three in Game 4 at home when they were up 2-1, and Brett Brown refusing to bench Ben Simmons in Game 7 when they couldn't get a shot up because of how clogged the paint was. Butler was on fire that playoffs."
"Hinkie wouldn’t have traded up to draft Fultz in the first place, it was abysmal asset management   I’m not talking about the draft picks, the draft is a crap shoot and the whole philosophy is built around asset management and having as many attempts as possible to hit on that lotto while maximizing your chances  Post-Hinkie the sixers shot themselves in the foot over and over again with the fultz trade up, the outrageous overpay for an aging horford, the butler trade, the Tobias Harris trade. Giving nerlens away for peanuts when he had value. All of these moves had huge impacts on the direction of the franchise and we’re giant blunders by sixers management, and I’m pretty sure I’m missing a few here"
There’s more to the game than shooting threes.   Butler / Embiid / Simmons could lock down other teams in a playoff series and turn anything into a slugfest. Put two shooters around them and their offense is fine. Defenses tend to collapse on Butler and Embiid.  The biggest problem against the Raptors was Tobias Harris being left wide open for three all series long and shooting 28% from there.
Did the Lakers offer AD for Tobias harris too?
Tbh I think butler could have fixed Simmons lol. It’s keeping brett brown and then Tobias Harris that fucked it up
It literally cannot happen. Too much money for Philly to take on without sending one of them somewhere else or also trading Tobias Harris
"Tobias Harris brought less to the table on an even bigger contract. Mavs had Porzingis doing less for more money, not to mention all the ""stars"" who make more money but didn't even make the playoffs. The Sixers fanbase keeps whining about why he doesn't become a player more suited to pair with Embiid which is an idiotic demand. He's worth around a max in the open market even after his playoff embarrassment. Unless he feels some burning passion for the Sixers' success which he evidently does not, he has as much reason to work on what their team needs as Gobert does to work on his ball handling."
"I don’t think it’s single digit percentage at all. You won’t always get the same caliber of a player but I’m pretty sure I can name one or two star players that were available on the market for the last 5. Last year, Harden and Vucevic became available. The year before D’angelo Russell became available. The year before that Kawhi Leonard, Kristaps Porzingis, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris became available. Year before that it was an all-star level Blake Griffin. You see where I’m going with this? Literally every player I just named when added to this roster would keep them contending at a high level if they received them at the level they played at the time to today (other than maybe Vucevic since he plays the same position as Embiid). These happen far more often than you think and in recent times, rather than being a single digit percent chance of happening on a season by season basis, over the last 5 years it has happened 100% of the time."
"If they got an all-star for Simmons I could see them as better than the Clippers. It's kind of hard to say though since they could've probably traded Ben for someone like Jrue or Kyrie which would change the trajectory of the other teams. I think it also depends on what happens with Tobias Harris. If they still pay him then they're gonna be hamstrung no matter what. But it's unclear if they paid him so much because they lost Jimmy and got desperate, or what"
I remember when they first traded for Jimmy I was fucking sweating thinking about dealing with that team for 4 years.  Then they traded for tobias harris later that year and I was like okay weird move but lets see how it plays out
"Ben Simmons was 2nd in DPOY voting, finished 1st team all defensive and has made multiple all star games. Tobias Harris was considered a snub for the all star game this past year. Matisse Thybulle was 2nd team all defensive last season. Danny Green and Seth Curry are above average role players/starters. To say that Embiid was surrounded by ""a gang of useless scrubs"" is absurd."
"Thank you Doc for publicly ruining his stock. Ben Simmons might not know how to shoot, but he does well in every other facet of the game, and elite in defending. If he goes to a team that uses him well, then he will be an all star, you guys can downvote all you want. Tobias Harris and Embiid won’t get 1st seed without Ben Simmons."
"The Bucks traded Tobias Harris for a two month rental of Redick so we could get steamrolled by the Heat in the playoffs.  I understand this was not Redicks fault, but he was also god awful for us, and cost a guy who turned out to be pretty good.  So always and forever, fuck JJ Redick.  And sure maybe there's some ""trading Tobias opened up things for Giannis"" butterfly effect here, but I am choosing to ignore it for the sake of the fuck JJ Redick argument."
"They weren't capped out at the time, Embiid was the only real money on the books heading into that summer, with pretty low cap holds on Harris and Butler. Simmons' contract hadn't kicked in yet; they either had two max slots available or could get there very painlessly if they chose not to run it back with the team that came so close against Toronto. They panicked after Butler left, it wasn't until swapping his cap hold for Horford and Richardson's contracts that they became ""stuck"" with Harris via the cap mechanics you reference. Even then, *I think if I remember correctly* they still could have relinquished him at that point and had some $15-18 million under the cap to spend on a replacement rather than going over to lock Tobias in at 5/$180."
So your plan is to get rid of Simmons so you can sign another Tobias Harris? Interesting
Imo I don't think so. Trae young shot 39% and 32% from 3 that series.  Cj McCollum would get eaten base off the switches the hawks do. Their front court is 6'9 plus and their guard is 6'8. He did his part but somehow Tobias Harris shooting 38% game 7 and below 30% game 5 at home. Embid did great but 8tos in a crucial win or go home hurts too.
"I think Brown got too much criticism for ""failing to get through to Simmons"". Clearly, no one gets through to Simmons, and the roster construction was pretty poor for maximizing the stars' talent. The Tobias Harris trade imo was the one that killed the Sixers because they basically outbid themselves into trading for the right to overpay Tobi.  It could have been salvaged by keeping Butler instead of Simmons, and if that meant Brown had to go too, that's an acceptable loss. But I don't think that Brown was a terrible coach."
"Lets not forget that Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid ALSO make 30 mil + a year on that team. I really like Ben Simmons and fuck all the hate. Where were they?"
"Think the other issue is that Philly couldn’t pay him because of the Tobias Harris MAX. IIRC reporters have mentioned that Embiid was disappointed that they couldn’t retain JJ.  Regardless, this is just another example of the league screwing Philly by forcing Hinkie out IMO"
"&gt;To go through all those ""process"" years and come out only with Embiid?  And Tobias Harris!"
"First, Simmons can't change his mind. Maybe in a different city, but Philly fans will eat him alive if he ever sets foot on the court again after this. He officially crossed the rubicon with this report.  Second, the Sixers don't have infinite time to waste. Embiid's window is shrinking and they need to do something. The market is dictating their options, but burying their heads and hoping Simmons's value rebounds to where it was when they failed to sell high on him is not going to work.   They have a good team right now, but with or without Simmons it's not good enough to surpass the Nets or Bucks, so what's the point of all the drama? Rather than coming to the conclusion in six months or a year that they need to bundle depth and assets to get some more top-end talent, they should take assets from a Simmons deal, bundle with Tobias Harris and look for a 1B player to Embiid plus a few average-to-above-average starters. Rebuild the bench through buyouts and free agency.   This is the Process they wanted. No sense in pretending it's at a different stage than it is. Gotta turn things over to find the winning formula because this ain't it."
"Joel doesn't deserve any hate for his comments but Doc absolutely does. ""Coddling"" when defending a player to the media isn't really a thing. If he didn't hold him accountable in practice leading up to that point, that is a failure as a coach just as much as it would be on Simmons as a player. Not sticking up for your player after the end to a series is just brutal. There is a huge difference between when coaches call out effort or issues during a regular season game, but to do it right after the season ends? Doc is a master of saving his own ass - it's ALL Ben Simmons fault that the team lost in the playoffs and has nothing to do with the terrible rotations or failure to execute down the stretch. Doc leaves path of fault behind him at every stop. Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, hell - he even scared Tim Duncan away from joining the Magic. And once Simmons is gone, he will need to work quickly to find the new punching bag of the team. Tobias Harris better be careful!"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"At least the dude succeeded in shifting all the blame to Ben.  I know Simmons and his atrocious 4th quarters are the biggest reason for the loss, but Doc, Embiid and Tobias Harris also played their parts. That 0-12 FG 2nd half in game 4 I believe was terrible for a center and really costly.  It’s also just bad business. Don’t depreciate your asset’s value if you plan to trade him."
"Managed a GameStop in Orlando for several years, met Darko Milicic, Hedo Turkoglu, Aaron Afflalo, Glenn Davis, Victor Oladipo, Tobias Harris. Tobias was genuinely one of the coolest guys. I would see him from time to time and he recognized me and we would shoot the shit. Let's Go Magic!!!"
"And Tobias Harris, Sabonis and Vic got them back… Ibaka and B Jennings… that’s terrible return 3 fringe all-star/high level starter players"
Gotta blame Doc on that one. Should have made an adjustment. Imagine if Nate Mcmillian had Trae guarding Tobias Harris.
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
"FO really chose Fournier over Oladipo because they wanted better shooting next to Elfrid Payton and Aaron Gordon… we also gave up on Tobias Harris. With Oladipo, Harris and Vuc we could’ve had a decent team that would atleast be fun to watch"
"KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Javalle McGee  Andre Iguodala, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris, Thybulle"
"The one time Embiid had a good backup big, the Lakers take him back and left us to sign their toxic stat-padding big.   &amp;nbsp;  Simmons playing for us with 100% effort or even at all to the playoffs is a big if and so is whatever we get for him.  &amp;nbsp;  Tobias Harris will probably need to have another pseudo 50/40/90 type season again for the regular season and step up more in the postseason.  &amp;nbsp;  We still don't have a closer. We don't have the playmaker we need- Simmons isn't it.  &amp;nbsp;  Strangely enough I still think the Sixers will have a weirdly successful regular season. Even that one season with Al Horford- we were godlike at home and absolute scrubs on the road."
"It's not that weird. Like, yeah, it's weird for fans to trash Simmons while expecting a good trade return...that's just bad business. However, it's blatantly obvious that the relationship is over and the Sixers have no means of recouping his value.  One thing to note as funny is that this has all started because the Sixers lost a game where Simmons went 2/4. They demand his head because he won't shoot. No one considers G2, where Philly won by 16 on the road while Simmons went 2/3. Philly won big on the road while Simmons had next to no scoring to provide. Maybe a little more blame should be placed on the 16 missed shots by Tobias Harris?"
"Not really, our all-star PG doesn't want to play for us anymore and tobias Harris will either shoot 10/10 from 3 and 20/21 from the field or 0/10 from 3 and 2/21 for the game, there is no in between.   Also we have no fucking clue how many games embiid will play"
"Nah, he can do it. For Tobias Harris."
"Superstars: KD &amp; Curry All-stars: Dame &amp; Zion Role players: Tobias Harris, Jamaal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas, Myles Turner, Deandre Ayton, Joe ingles, P.J. Tucker, Ja morant (who I consider a star but technically isn’t an all star yet)"
"You need guys who can play almost every game, so Kawhi, LeBron, and AD are out for me. I think the logical two superstars to build around are Giannis and Jokic. They both cover each other's weaknesses, and the league is deep with guards so I feel better not taking a superstar there.   I need time to think about my other picks. I'll edit this post when I do.  Ok, here's my depth chart:  PG: DeAaron Fox, Jamal Murray  SG: Beal, Mikal Bridges, Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Kris Middleton, Tobias Harris  Pf: Giannis, Thad Young  Center: Jokic, Valanciunas,  Jarret Allen  This lineup has offensive and defensive versatility,  veteran leadership, and the ability to put floor spacing lineups out that don't sacrifice athletecism and defense.   I don't think any team could go 82-0 in today's NBA.   Superstars: Jokic, Giannis  All Stars: Middleton,  Beal. I chose two guys who could space the floor and move around Jokic.   Edit: Dropped FVV for Jamal Murray."
Tobias Harris is most certainly not an All-Star caliber player when it really matters lol
I mean the Sixers were willing to do that with him AND Tobias Harris so I don't doubt some team out there will be willing to as well.
Tobias Harris
Mashburn was more of a Paul Pierce than a Tobias Harris. As you mentioned he could handle and create for others. Also had one of the best post game in his era for a wing player.
"Maybe a slightly better version of Tobias Harris.  Both are PFs (well, Mash played the 3 but would be a small ball 4 today) that can shoot and create their own shot.  Both are also average defenders, although Mashburn is a better facilitator."
"This post was built for me.   1. Robin Lopez has the looks to replace BJ but he’s way better than him.  2. Edwards as Tyrus Thomas size wise makes sense, but give me MKG for game fit.  3. Tobias Harris is my Boris replacement 4. Why not go Bismack to Bismack. I’d also be interested in Gafford as a replacement 5. I love Ish for DJ  Bench:  1. Cole Anthony (Kemba) 2. I wouldn’t trade anyone else they were all perfect because they were the Bobcats. May they Rest In Peace"
Pascal is not overpaid when guys like Tobias Harris are making even more than him.
Him and Tobias Harris will share a pic of Brady and Gronk in a month and it’ll all go quiet
"Don't. Just enjoy the trainwreck live. I'm from the future and wanted to let you know that they fire Ben after the third season and replace him with Zac Efron. It was the best portrayal of Ben Simmons yet, and it was good to see Zac back in a basketball uniform again.   There are currently rumors that Corbin Bleu is going to be portraying the role of Tobias Harris next season, so I'm interested to see how that will turn out."
Two Tobias Harris’s &gt; One Tobias Harris?
His per minute three point shooting volume is mediocre but not outright bad. It’s comparable to tobias harris.
"Everyone on big contracts, because their poor value contract causes them to get shit on a lot.  1) Ben Simmons  2) John Wall  3) John Collins  4) Kristaps Porzingis  5) Tobias Harris  Other than the contract guys, De’aaron Fox and Christian Wood would(wood) be my takes."
"&gt;Just cut bait and wait for another star to want to play with Embiid meanwhile Embiid will go on to have probably his best season while you wait.   And then what? Trade Tobias Harris for the star player who doesn't exist? Nobody wants to come to Philly lol our best path to that is trading Ben Simmons. He was the DPOY runner up last year lol he was chosen by coaches as the best defender in the league. He's not at all a net negative lmao.  And you're telling me to be worried about losing Embiid, a month after he signed a 4 year extension?? Goodbye"
That’d be pretty terrible. You can’t have Shake Milton or Tobias Harris running the offense
"It's probably not tradeable for a couple years, but he's still very young and a great defender who can switch on most guys; with cap space increases this contract will probably be an asset in 2 years, which is a lot different than the Tobias Harris contract everyone is comparing it to."
I'd trade Tobias Harris for Wall and a pick or something
Tobias Harris is the name people should probably focus more on when talking Wall to Philly.  But that just sort of feels like something Philly wouldn't even bother exploring while the Simmons stuff is still in the air.
Marcus Smart   Tobias Harris   Aaron Gordon  Julius Randle   Robert Williams
This dude Tobias Harris
"Wall for Tobias Harris and Danny Green, would be a better deal, IMO.   Wall could allow the Sixers to play Simmons more like a mobile big/point-forward hybrid.    And once they get out of Wall's contract, they would potentially have space to add a key free agent. Or they could trade him again in his last year at hte deadline for some help.  At this point, why not?"
He already is Tobias Harris level player. The guy's efficiency is incredible.
"I don’t think Gordon is worth this money in any other franchise, but as you’ve summed up. He is here.   It’s like Tobias Harris in Philly. He got his max because they at the time thought they were keeping Butler.   Sometimes you gotta pay slight overs on a guy when you’re in a championship window. I don’t know why people struggle to comprehend that"
"I like the fit, but he's still a question mark for me right now as a #2 guy. Gonna have to see how he develops, I could see him as like a Tobias Harris level player."
&gt; We lacked creative scoring at a forward spot  By gawd thats tobias harris’ music
Misleading we all know Tobias Harris isn’t a 33% 3 point shooter. Take data from the last 3 years
"Aaron ""Tobias Harris"" Gordon"
"This contract has Tobias Harris vibes. A very good player but in no way worth the contract he received. Like, the team who signed him feels obligated to given that they traded for him in the first place."
This contract is also half the size of Tobias Harris’ contract
"Trading Wall will be next to impossible...but who says no?  PHI gets:  John Wall, Caris Lavert, TJ Warren, Chris Duarte, and picks from HOU  HOU gets: Kristaps Porzingis   DAL gets: Tobias Harris   IND gets: Ben Simmons"
"Less than I was expecting honestly. When a contender trades for a player like that, the player has so much leverage (see: Harris, Tobias)."
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
Only trade I can see is Wall for Tobias Harris.
Is there a contract in the league that can match that lol. Maybe Tobias Harris if Houston throws a protected 1st?
"barnes last 2 years: 5.3 FG/11.0 FGA and 1.0 3P/4.0 3PA on 48/39/82 shooting  Tobias last 2 years: 7.7 FG/15.6 FGA and 1.6 3P/4.2 3PA on 49/38/85 shooting  Barnes shoots less and on a garbage team. even if you got by total field goals made or 3 pt made,  it's so close between them the last 2 years.     Seems like the only major difference is the contract. hardly enough to say ""god i would so much rather have Barnes than Tobias Harris"" like he's so much better."
"honestly that would be a good trade. CP3 has two years left in him max, you could see how gassed he was in the last two rounds of the playoffs. Simmons would fit Phoenix perfectly since they effectively play 3 out and Ayton has shown an improving middy game. Plus, unlike in Philly, they have Devin Booker to take over as lead ballhandler in the playoffs ala 2019 Butler. In Philly's perspective, all CP3 needs to do is run the half court offense and control tempo. He does not need to be taking over on offense with Embiid and Tobias Harris (when he's aggressive)."
I'm a Tobias Harris defender but yeah I'd rather take Barnes who provides a slight dip in production but at half of the cost.
god i would so much rather have Barnes than Tobias Harris
"I wouldn't do that deal, even if Simmons is promising to not play for the Sixers ever again.  Paul will be 37 in the playoffs next year and I have little faith that he will ever be really healthy when it matters again, to the extent he ever was.  Morey isn't the type to sell low on Simmons and buy high on CP3, who just miracled his way into the finals by beating the Lakers without AD, the Nuggets without Murray and then the Clips without Kawhi.    I'd trade Harris for CP3 but for some reason he gets a pass for, let's say shooting 38% and scoring 15 a game vs the Celtics in 2020, or for shooting 38% and scoring 13 a game vs the Raptors in 2019, despite bringing little to the table besides scoring.  I'd trade Tobias for Paul but Simmons is still a positive asset, paying CP3 star money until he's forty is a tough pill to swallow."
Tobias Harris is the worst value player in the league. Literally anyone who watches the game including 76ers fans would swap him for Khris Middleton in a heartbeat.
A used garbage can &gt; Tobias Harris
John Collins &gt; Tobias Harris
I think it’s time to stop referring to Simmons even as a secondary star and Tobias Harris is certainly not a player that warranting that label
"I mean, Trae beat Embiid with Simmons and Tobias Harris and no one thinks he's close to Embiid ranking-wise."
"Because they have the Stephen A’s of all NBA teams. Loudmouths. All show, no go. Fans and media have been trying to sell this team as a championship contenders. Ben is too much of a fuck up, Joel is injury prone and is a loudmouth fake tough guy, otherwise, he’s a great player. Doc and Brett Brown have been overrated for a long time. Daryl Morey overhyping Ben’s value is a clown show in itself. Tobias Harris is inconsistent.   I guess all that “process” BS was for nothing but a second round exit.   Not to mention the fans. Among the worst. Up there with Jazz fans."
"Except that’s not the case.  Most players were bad or did nothing before Orlando.  Tobias Harris before he got here wasn’t much.  Vuc became an All Star in Orlando.  Fournier became a starter.  AG became a great defensive player.  Markelle Fultz became an actual player.  Cole Anthony has I,proved in year 2.  Mo Bamba finally has developed this year.  Wendell Carter has been way better in Orlando than he ever was in Chicago.  Going further back than that.  Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando finally broke out. T-Mac became a superstar.  Really only Oladipo and Elfrid Payton are the only players I can think who didn’t work out in Orlando and in Oladipo’s case he was traded too early.  So you’re kinda speaking out your ass here."
Tobias Harris : Am I a joke to you?
"I swear that, if there's a murder attempt on Luka, my first suspect will be Tobias Harris. Luka stole his BFF with a cold grin in his chubby face."
"Magic traded Tobias Harris to the Pistons for Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova (both off the team by the next season) and the next year traded Oladipo plus a 1st (who would become Sabonis) for Ibaka, who who wouldn’t even last a year with the team.  But they did make up for that cascade of bad moves by trading Ibaka for Terrance Ross and a 1st and using that 1st to get Fultz."
&gt; Bucks gave away Tobias Harris for 2 months of JJ Redick  would they have been able to get jrue without this
"Except Morey/Rivers caused the problem by not just kissing Ben's ass.  A really great coach or GM has more tools than just analytics and beating players over the head with the money stick.  The NBA is full of player's with big egos, if you treat every player like a slab of meat instead of a person things aren't going to work out well.  Fact is that Ben has some issues in his game that need working out but calling him the only reason that the 76ers lost vs ATL last  year in the playoffs is unfair.  If Tobias Harris had made more of his shots or Embiid didn't have 8 turnovers the game result would have been different as well.  Then that jackass Doc Rivers made the problem worse and Philadelphia fans piled on.  NBA is a team sport, Simmons carries his weight.  He isn't a perfect player but there are plenty of other guys in the NBA that produce less for their teams than he does vs. their salary.  I put 75% of the blame for the situation on the coach, GM, and Philadelphia fans (who are generally acknowledged as being among the worst in the US in every sport).  I'd want a change of scenery myself if I were Simmons."
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get ..

Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
Trading Tobias Harris for Jennings and Ilyasova is worse
"One that's kind of interesting is really anything to do with the 16th pick last year.  The Heat gave it up to get Goran Dragic from PHX, Phoenix used it to trade Zhaire Smith and it up for Mikal Bridges from PHI, Philly used it to trade for Tobias Harris from LAC, and LAC used it as the premier pick with Shai and Danilo for PG.   Also, the Gerald Wallace deal for Dame"
"there were 4 other guys on the floor while the hawks scrambled for a comeback, why do embiid and curry get off the hook for vanishing late in those games.   tobias harris played OK in game 7 but he was very hot and cold that series.   thybulle had a terrible foul on huerter on a 3 point attempt that pretty much sealed game 7 for the hawks  nobody could get a bucket for the last 5 minutes, nobody could defend"
Tobias cant create for himself that well and is overpaid imo. I think if they move Simmons they should try and get from underneath the Harris contract as well.
Bucks gave away Tobias Harris for 2 months of JJ Redick
Did you completely forget Jimmy Butler &amp; Tobias Harris? And Embiid playing in the East going up against first round opponents like the Heat led by 36 yo D Wade?   While AD played in the toughest period of the Western conference maybe ever with his teams always dealing with bad injuries?
???  They made it to Game 7 of the finals with a guy who's worse than an average bench player. Wouldn't replacing this dude with Tobias Harris or something make this a title team?
"In this scenario, isn't it extremely likely that even a Tobias Harris type guy in that dude's place is also enough to win the title?"

My favorite Tobias Harris memory is from the 2010 NYS final four.  I have been to every NY final four since 2002 and have only seen one player get booed and it was Harris.   HHH West lost in the final to CBA Albany in a game where Harris fouled out.  He chucked his runner's up medal on the floor and stormed off the court which prompted the whole arena to boo him.

tobias harris getting frustrated with drummond
Why is doc only capable of coaching Tobias Harris
Doesn’t make him an all star. CJ more of an all star player than him n he’ll probably never make one. Tobias Harris is not an all star. He’s a good player though.
Tobias Harris never has and never will be an all star. People gotta stop cappin.
Tobias Harris is allergic to making lightly contested layups.  Maxey has very very good starter potential

Can I introduce you to Mr Tobias Harris
"Said it a while ago. I'll repeat. I don't like the Simmons for CJ trade for the blazers.   We've all seen that team in the playoffs in the Aminu/Harkless days. They don't need another non shooter making it easier to to send hard doubles to Dame and probably Norman Powell at that rate if CJ is gone. This is despite how much they'll improve defensively. Immeasurably so considering I feel like in that situation, it might allow Simmons to be in a more Giannis like role as a help defender plus how good he is already as a man defender.   Would rather Tobias Harris in addition to Dame &amp; CJ. Not that the sixers would ever do that."
Tobias Harris?
"I mean, ignoring Simmons mental health for a second (which is the most important part here whether people believe Simmons or not), the Sixers went from thinking Simmons would play or they'd save his salary if he held out to where we're at now. That's definitely worse.  And this can definitely get worse in a few ways. Imagine Tobias Harris gets hurt and you can't tank because Embiid is hurt but you're not winning anything either because half your team salary now isn't playing. Or imagine Embiid realizes the implication of Morey saying that he needs another superstar to actually have a chance at winning a title when Kawhi and Giannis have two of the last three titles."
"Pre-draft Fultz was also the *perfect* player for the Embiid-Simmons Sixers.   I didn’t like Colangeo but that’s an explicable trade. You have a team you think is a player away and Fultz is there. Also, the Sixers were salvageable when he left, Brand really fucked the team by using every asset we had for Tobias Harris."
every time tobias harris talks im like damn this dude has it together
"Good guy Tobias Harris.  Throughout all this I have been loving the drama and laughing my ass off. But with the recent comments coming out of the Simmons camp, something seems very off. It could all be a play to get him out of Philadelphia, but it could also be that he is going through some serious mental health issues. If that’s the case, I hope he takes his time and gets the help he needs."
"People look at Embiid as the leader since he's the MVP candidate, All NBA, and franchise star of the 76ers, but Tobias Harris might actually have been the team's best voice all along. Embiid is never going to let this Ben Simmons thing go, he is who he is. Tobias Harris is being very mature with this and might be the Sixers one true hope at quality leadership moving forward."
&gt;I never knew anything about Tobias Harris before the bubble aside from that fact that he was friends with Boban  Bring back Bobi&amp;Tobi 😢
Tobias “J. Cole” Harris keeping it real as usual
I never knew anything about Tobias Harris before the bubble aside from that fact that he was friends with Boban. But in those Matisse videos it was pretty clear he’s a really thoughtful and compassionate dude.
"Yeah but they had these same end of game problems with Brett Brown. Tobias Harris is a terrible end of game, go to perimeter scorer and a back to the basket Embiid iso is 200% less effective when defenses clamp down. This team has always been desperate for a legit guard at the end of games."
"Then it’s just a weird list.    How is curry a more complete scorer than kawhi?    Sure curry is better.   But kawhi can face up, post up, drive and play above the rim.      Curry can just face up and drive.       If you’re just looking for the “most complete player” it might be someone like doncic or even Tobias harris.     They have all the moves and the versatility to score in so many different ways."

"if he misses 10 games, those are 10 games they're probably not winning. without Simmons or embiid it's Tobias Harris and assorted role players"
Tobias Harris blew like 4 layups in the 2nd half. Danny Green airballs 3 straight field goals. Doc decides he needs to save up his challenges for the end of the season. And the refs take control of the game.  I have no business being this mad but this was an extremely frustrating game I can’t believe what I say and watched.
Sick and tired of tobias Harris blowing fucking layups bro wow
 Is that one of the best passes Tobias Harris has ever thrown as a Sixer(bar is not high)
"Who is a better player, Tobias Harris or Jerami Grant? Is it clearly Jerami Grant?"
"So...Is Joel playing? Or is this just going to be KD,Harden and the Nets vs Tobias Harris and Maxey and the Sixers?    Honestly...I’m more interested in the coach off. Nash is still learning stuff and Doc Rivers is...well Doc Rivers."
"Also, take a look at what Tobias Harris said regarding Ben. Interesting how his own teammates, the ones actually being affected, can be more of an adult than you."
4 is definitely Tobias Harris
"Without thinking too much about it I feel like the Suns have a number of guys you could slot into it.  CP3 (About as pure PG as you get)  Tyler Hero (Not really big enough for the 3, lacks the handle to be a 1)  Mikal Bridges (Can't really play the 4 much, not really a 2 either)  Tobias Harris (Would struggle to slot up or down for too often)  Deandre Ayton (Can't really play him anywhere but center)  It would be a good team. While no 1 guy is super versatile positionally they fit the molds really well and would mesh well together. SF/PF is really tough because they're so swappable these days. I'm sure there's probably some better picks for this that I'm not thinking of."
"Well that started with Burnergate, which might be the most insane thing to have happened. The trade with the Suns to get Zhaire Smith and the Miami pick, Buttler trade, Tobias Harris Trade, Zahire Smith allergic reaction, more Fultz and ended with the Triple donk elimination."
"Nothing beats that offseason though. I know Harden demanded a trade, but who thought they could create a package around Tobias Harris to get him?"
"How is it impossible for you to see that it's not out of the realm of possibility?  Has someone hurt you so bad you're always overtly-skeptical and non-trusting to the point you're not showing empathy at all?  Besides, that's not even the main point. He said he needs to take responsibility as well. He had a heart to heart with Doc and the rest of the team. Time will tell, but I'm gonna trust him on this barring some refutation. But even Tobias Harris put out a statement of support.  So I'm not really inclined to believe you."
"Sorry that the Sixers don’t want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That’s definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn’t taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he’s an good young prospect but his ceiling isn’t that high and we have Tobias Harris and George’s Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Mikal Bridges  SF: Tobias Harris  PF: Draymond Green  C: Nikola Jokic  This team can switch on anyone for defense and almost everyone is a spot up shooter.
"I honestly think it's that midrange/post/iso player mindset, it's not that he's slow to process but more that he's just always got an eye open for a chance to do the Tobias Harris thing"
only tobias harris highlight i can think of is when he dunked a buzzer beater for the win when he was in the magic
"I suppose... If tobias harris can create a shot and make a three and does it efficiently and tobias harris is what uour team needs and Paul george is completely one dimensional and can't make a shot more than 8 feet from the rim if his life depended on it and has a terrible attitude and effort problem as well as big baby syndrome. Yes, very much like that."
CJ and Ben are not remotely the same caliber of player. That’s like trading Tobias Harris for Paul George.
It’s gonna be awesome. I can’t wait to hear what vets like Tobias Harris has to say when he’s not worried about repercussions for talking to the media.
This sub thinks Tobias is an AS but yeah an obvious win for Philly if it happened. Dumping Harris salary would me a monumental win.
"The tanking seasons were a reward in themselves. I had loads of fun rooting for the Hollis Thompsons of this world, a lot more than watching Tobias Harris playing basketball."
Your defence will suffer drastically and Tobias Harris has consistently underperformed in the playoffs. Without the attention Simmons gets I would expect Tobias to get it and get worse as well. Without Simmons I’m not even sure you get out the first round especially since you guys won’t be at the top of the standings playing an 8 seed in the first round again. Big men with lack luster supporting cast don’t make it far in the playoffs. No matter what way you look at it not reading Simmons only has negative outcomes.
"He has been a really good defensive player since he entered the league. That's the issue, he doesn't put in work/show improvement on the weak parts of his game. Nobody is expecting him to become a sharpshooter, just someone who can hit an open 3 once in a while. We've seen plenty of players with non existent jumpers develop SOMETHING. He hasn't developed anything.   I don't think Philly fans or the front office expect him to be a 1-2 scoring option. That's why they gave Tobias Harris a big contract (who also has his issues in the playoffs). But someone like Draymond Green has shown you can be a productive offensive player despite being a bad shooter/scorer. Simmons was unplayable in the 4th quarters in last years playoffs. That's unacceptable and fans have the right to be upset when again, this is largely due to him not getting better at the weak parts of his game"
Pg= Ben Simmons Sg= Jimmy Butler SF= Josh Richardson Pf= Tobias Harris C= Porzingis
"After that playoff series all sixers fans and media alike had plenty of blame to pass around. Tobias harris nor embiid were hitting everything they needed to, rivers had some awful rotations going. Not to shit on the hawks, but its the entire sixers fault that the series even got to game 7.   But ben literally faded out. Choked. Didnt even try. He was absolutely terrified. It was even just that passed dunk, he didnt shoot once in the 4th qt of game 7.  The rest of the team was generous when it came to commenting on the situation."
"I honestly think ""royally fucked up"" undersells it. He put the cherry on the shit sundae of a series where he shrank from the enormity of the situation. His reaction afterwards made it even worse. People expect you to fall on your sword if you fucked up and vow to get better. Maybe it's just words, but he couldn't even do that. Add all the backstory about his petulant failure to develop the obvious and likely fixable parts of his games, it's way worse than Tobias Harris trying but sucking."
"It’s not 1v1. Giannis would have a primary defender, say Tobias Harris, and then once he got past tobi Embiid would be there as the help defender on the inside.  I’m not saying giannis would get clamped up. But he wouldn’t have the historic finals series he had against Phoenix"
Tobias Harris
"If i had wheels id be a wagon.  I heard a lot of you have to pay you have to pay but im not hearing a lot of ""lets trade for Tobias Harris""  Fact is that teams need to be mindful of what their contracts look like, and giving Ayton a max extension is not being mindful. They have his RFA rights and can match any deal. He is not taking the QO, that is fantasyland.  Maybe he becomes some crazy no doubt superstar, but this famous"
"Lemme take a crack at writing the opening, but it might sound pretty similar to their moment on kawaiis shot:  2019 was a big year for the NBA's eastern conference. LeBron had dominated the conference for almost a decade, having taken his team to the Finals from 2011-2018. However, in the summer of 2019, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference, making the title of Eastern Conference Champion suddenly available to teams that didnt have a LeBron James on the roster for the first time in eight years.   One of the teams with the best shot at that title, and a shot at the 2019 NBA championship? The Philidalphia 76ers.   Two of the men who led them in 2019 were home picked. Grabbed with the number 3 and 1 pick in 2014 and 2016 respectively by General Manager Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were a lethal, towering duo (slap player stickers on here). While the league was spared initially as Embiid sat out his first two years with a foot injury, his dominant, physical game brought back memories of transcedent big men of yore, and when Simmons debuted after his own year spent recovering from foot injury, it took him just four games to notch his first triple double. His dazzling passes and imposing drives drew comparissons to Magic Johnson and Lebron James, and Philidalphia fans everwhere salivated at the prospect of this duo leading their long suffering city to glory.   Then in 2018, with Lebron James and his Eastern Conference Champion hogging ways off in the West, 76ers management pulled the trigger. Recent #1 pick Markelle Fultz was swapped for Clippers star Tobias Harris, and a disgruntled Jimmy Butler was aquired from the Timberwolves after he politely and calmly asked for a trade, coach Brett Brown had perhaps the most lethal starting five in the East, winning 10 of their last 15 games to go into the playoffs determined to complete the Process and bring glory to the City of Brotherly Love.   Through the first round of the playoffs, it looked like they would do just that, finishing off the Brooklyn Nets in a gentlemans sweep 4-1, blowing them out in 3 of their 4 wins by double digits or more.   They went up 2-1 in the second round against the Raptors, before losing a tight game 4 where Philly had chances to take the lead down the stretch. They would get blown out in game 5, but showed life in game 6 where a balanced attack by all four of Phillys stars helped force a decisive game 7.  While game 7 was in Toronto, the 76ers definitely brought the spirit of Philidalphia with them north of the border, with all four stars once again scoring in the double digits, though Toronto's superstar acquisition in Kawhi Leonard went absolutely supernova to keep the game tied down the stetch, with Toronto having only 4.2 seconds on the likely last posession of the game.   Still, with the most dominant big man in the game in Embiid, a lethal closer in Jimmy, a steady distributing hand in Simmons, and a lethal terrtiary gunner in Harris, and a somewhat hobbled Toronto roster, the 76ers liked their chances in OT. All they had to do was get a stop and-   (Clip of kawhis shot)   Oh no. Who knew a basketball could bounce that many times and still go in?   And just like that, the fruit that was so carefully nurtured by Sam Hinkie from the manure of the early and mid 2010s Sixers rotted on the vine, then all the vermin in Philly descended and tore the fruit to pieces. And probably pooped on it some more.   Collapse music."
Considering what Brand gave up for an expiring Tobias Harris I can only imagine what he would have given for Harden lol
Nah they’ve got the next scapegoat lined up perfectly. It’s gonna be Tobias Harris.
Too bad they decided Tobias Harris was worth a max and that Simmons' future was more valuable than Butler's present despite the franchise centerpiece being a dominant but injury prone big man.
"it's absurd to think embiid and role players can't beat harden + kd? or any team with giannis on it? lest we forget luka is going to be staking his claim to titles within a couple years?  embiid will probably leave philly if the sixers get a mediocre return for ben anyway, there's no way embiid + cj + tobias harris competes for a title. the entire point is to help embiid win a title **in philly**, why would we trade him now?"
Fucking Tobias Harris lol.
"He averaged 14 ppg in the regular season, he is not the focal point of their offense nor they should expect him to score a ton. You know what they should've expected from him? Elite all-time great defense on the opposing point guard, which he did and held Trae Young to 39/32/85 splits and a 5-23 performance in Game 7.  They all acted like he was the only reason they lost, why they didn't bring up the fact that Tobias Harris went 2-11 in Game 5? or that Embiid's EIGHT turnovers in Game 7 cost them the game?  Ben Simmons was one of the reasons they lost? Absolutely, but the way the Sixers acted over the media after that series was ridiculous, they threw all the blame on him (which he clearly didn't deserve) and now are acting shocked that he doesn't wanna associate with them anymore."
"Emiid, Tobias, etc did their job. You're telling me they would have still lost if Simmons didn't play how he can play, how hes supposed to play? The man shot 34 percent on 6FT attempts per game. Harris and Embiid putting up career playoff highs... Simmons scared to do a layup. Simmons reaction to it all is the proof in the pudding, not people calling a spade a spade."
That could change in a hurry if Tobias Harris and Maxey aren't able to keep the offense running since it doesn't look like Simmons will be playing anytime soon.
Yeah they offered contracts to 2 homegrown stars and one of those wants a trade the other has a bad injury history and couldn’t take a gamble leaving for a different deal. Then you have the Tobias Harris overpay.
"Any team looking to make a run into the playoffs aren't going to trade for Ben imo.  And the sole reason I think 76ers should trade earlier, BUT NOT FOR Peanuts, is to create chemistry. Also, Tobias Harris also needs more scrutiny.  Hope you guys sort your shit out, Embiid deserves better."
Do you see the Portland roster ? I much rather think he’d join Embiid and Tobias Harris than cj mccollum and nurk
"""We are all adults"" - Tobias Harris, a few days ago."
so was Tobias Harris but since he’s always bad nobody cares
"&gt;Exactly it's not that these players are getting overpaid it's that the best players of the league get way underpaid because their actual value is astronomical.  I actually think it's both.  Obviously guys like Steph and LeBron are WAY underpaid. But the number of guys with Messi-like value is TINY.   And my guess is that someone like Klay (healthy) is probably pretty close to properly valued.   But Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins, Kristaps, CJ McCollum etc are overpaid. The Mavs overpaid Harrison Barnes when they signed him from the Warriors. And you look at those guys, and, generally, their contact is set by (or relative to) the max.   One point of reference might be shoe deals. There are three players with shoe deals worth over $20m annually: LeBron, KD, and Steph. (Steph was over $30m, but I saw something that suggests it's only $20m now.) Nobody else is over $15m."
"Hard to say since Embiid has struggled  largely with his gas tank in seasons past. Again, this isn't exactly a new issue for him, and even Capela on the Hawks was saying their general gameplan was to wear him down because he didn't have the tank to go a full playoff game.  Not to mention, it's not like Embiid was the only one struggling in those 4th quarter collapses, they got no offensive contributions from anyone on the team during those stretches, while the hawks were getting big contributions from guys up and down the roster the entire series.  The sixers are exactly who they've always been in the last few years, which is a team that isn't set up to be successful in the postseason. Partly due to Ben's shortcomings partly due to Embiids health and conditioning concerns, partly due to roster construction that is overly reliant on Embiid to do everything which likely heavily contributed to the 2nd point, and bad coaching to top it off. Tobias Harris was invisible. Curry was shooting the lights out but there's only so much a spot up shooter can do(and he about maximized it), but having him our there gave the hawks a huge mismatch on the other end of the floor."
"If Tobias was a legit max player, the Sixers probably beat the Hawks . So on one hand, I get it, you make the most of what you have. On the other hand, you gotta be able to accurately assess the value you're getting out of your max slots.  Maxing both Simmons and Harris gave the team a really solid floor while also giving them a pretty hard ceiling unless they have a lucky break run to the finals"
I keep saying that about the Tobias Harris contract but somehow no one takes me seriously
"If he signed an extension and didn't improve a lick this season, then he'd quickly fall into the untradeable camp.    Think of it like a Tobias Harris deal.  Still a good player, just not one anybody is itching to pay that kind of money to."
Tobias Harris’ contract is one of the worst in the league.
he doesn’t have to be a franchise player doesn’t tobias harris have a max contract right now?
Tobias Harris is extremely overrated and the only reason for that is is that people hate ben Simmons so much they desperately want to see that he’s not the sixers second option.
"Of course you can, throw in a first and you got Tobias Harris."
Why the fuck did brown trade mikal bridges.  Beat part is the pick from that trade turned into... Tobias Harris. The most mediocre max player in the history of Max players
Lol  they really put Tobias Harris in that graphic
Bucks traded Tobias Harris in a bad deal too.  Can't remember the exact details but he was in like his second season and he was part of a trade to the Magic for I think half a season of JJ Reddick so the Bucks could be an 8 seed.  It was frustrating because as a small market team I don't know why you trade a 20 year old player that was a high pick when you know your team isn't any good.
"Time will tell who's better?  Trae young just came off a conference finals battle with the nba Champs while luka couldn't win a home game against a team he verse two years in a row. I'm calling who's better as of right now. I can't predict the future.   Simmons didn't run from any moment. There was 3mintues left in the game after his iconic play. Embid got a turnover right after.  No blame ? The team was up by -&gt;&gt;&gt;25&lt;&lt;&lt;- gm7 before he had to sub back in. No blame?   Only casual fans would think the third option on a team, who played his role should be held accountable and not Tobias Harris who wanted to be an all star shot below 40% in critical gm5 and 7 at home"
Did you not just see what happened to embiid and Tobias Harris who are both vaccinated? Why spread it to more players?
"We got an unprotected Miami pick in 2021 which was supposed to be a stacked draft class to move down 6 spots. I don't hate the trade I just hate that we traded that pick to get Tobias Harris. I don't know who they were bidding against.        If we had kept Butler and not traded that pick, we probably have another lottery pick.  The guy we really missed out on was SGA.       Elton Brand trading for Matisse and Butler were good moves. His decisions to draft Zhaire, trade for Harris, give Harris a monster extension, and sign Horford really set this team back."
"They wouldn't have cap space for Randle if KD and Kyrie went to the Knicks.  The trade package would've probably been RJ, Knox, Ntilikina, Mitchell Robinson and a ton of future first round picks.  Randle would've probably been a Net haha, that off-season most realistic Nets fans thought the guys we were most likely gonna get were either Tobias Harris or Randle."
"Probably is only probable, doesn’t mean it would happen. Joel Embiid at Center, Jimmy Butler that mercy swept MIL, Tobias Harris, JJ Spot up shooter Reddick, and Ben Simmons is different than Kyle Lowry, FVV, DG, Pascal, Kawhi, and Gasol. Different teams, different play styles. Sixers were stacked but Kawhi was better. Let’s bot forget the Bucks were perennial chokers until the Nets, Hawks, Lakers/Clippers/Warriors injuries"
"The Blake Griffin trade holy shit man.   Traded away Tobias Harris, filler and a first round pick that became SGA for a guy that had 1 good season, and paid not to play his last 2 years.   Pistons were below .500, clearly needed to rebuild, and so they decided to mortgage their future to barely scrape for the 8th seed and then get railed by deer on live TV. Just soooooo useless, gotta be one of the worst trades of all time.   That trade also set up the Clippers to create a contender, since they got PG with SGA and trading away Blake’s max freed up cap to sign Kawhi"
"Morant, Dejounte Murray, OG, Tobias Harris, Turner.  Bench: Herro, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, John Collins, Ayton.  I don't know if that's a contender but I think that's about as balanced as I can get on offense and defense."
they should trade for elite defensive wing Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris. That is all.
Yeah Morey would demand dame for that package.  I actually think Tobias Harris for CJ is a great deal for both teams . The blazers get a plus defender that should also be tightly guarded and the sixers get a good scorer that they can hide better
"tobias harris, thybulle and a pick for CJ"
tobias harris and harrison barnes!
"Tobias Harris was very sick with it and when Embiid first got it, about 2 weeks ago, Doc said Embiid had it very bad like Tobias then"
"**Location**  When the other 3 teams in the state are in cities with national and even global significance AND are coastal it's hard to compete for free agents or even players worth trading down the line.  **History**  With the longest current absence from the playoffs and only one coach in franchise history with a winning record, it must be hard to build a coaching staff in 2021 when every other team gives coaches a better chance to build their careers without building a losing reputation.   **Draft misses/luck**  There's the obvious draft miss we all know but it's not even just misses. They just haven't drafted an all-time great, which is how a lot of other teams have won championships after long droughts or never winning before: Giannis with the Bucks, Steph with the Warriors, LeBron with the Cavs, Duncan with the Spurs, Wade with the Heat, Dirk with the Mavs, Kobe with the Lakers, Jordan with the Bulls, Hakeem with the Rockets, Isiah with the Pistons, Magic with the Lakers, Bird with the Celtics.  The notable exceptions in the last 40ish years are the 2020 Lakers, 2019 Raptors, 2008 Celtics (they still had Pierce but I wouldn't put him in the same category as the others I mentioned), and 2004 Pistons. Too lazy to check that 76ers title from the 80s but that's a 10 to 12% success rate of building a contender without drafting a Hall of Famer. Even then the 2020 Lakers traded Ingram and Lonzo for a 2nd option and the 2019 Raptors obviously traded DeRozan for a 1st option.  Meanwhile I think Cousins was the last all-star the Kings drafted, and that never led to any playoff appearances. They fucked up their pick in 2018. They don't have serious draft assets like the Pelicans or Thunder. I really think their best bet is selling high on players like Fox, Barnes, and Hield to build up draft capital while trying to develop guys like Mitchell and Halliburton.  - Hield+TT for Tobias Harris+2022 1st Rounder  - Barnes for Fournier+2023 1st Rounder+another 2nd rounder  - and fuck it Fox for Kyrie straight up lol"
"KAT, “I’m gonna tell Dlo we’re playing the Sixers before every game. I’m gonna scream Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris’ names every time he shoots a 3”"
Tobias Harris is the definition of empty calories. My god. His contract is theft.
Tobias “Snubbed All Star” Harris stinking it up like always lmao
"Lol OK sure. Try Ben simmons (!) tobias Harris, Danny Green all missing major time. Seth curry has missed games as well. We essentially played without any of last seasons starters a few nights ago (and actually won). Also missed thybulle and Joe for 2 weeks. I guess operating with only 7/8 players for half the games this season is a better situation? You must only have abojt 3 players left then"
"Ingram and Zion played the same amount of games (61) last season. Zion was better (in just his sophomore season, or redshirt freshman season if you’re a philly fan). Ben Simmons is your best player until Embiid can… oh wait Tobias Harris is your best er… Seth Curry is your best player his jumper is always healthy!"
Tobias Harris for Lebron. Who says no?  Bwahaha
"Kawhi ""in between Tobias Harris and Gordon Hayward in career points"" Leonard?"
how about john wall + tobias harris + khris middleton?
"He's basically Tobias Harris, which is ok, but not as the #1 scorer."
Tobias Harris
"He has a loser mindset! He's only an empty stats player! : Booker, Westbrook, AD, Z. Lavine, Tobias Harris, D. Howard etc.   Narrative is a funny thing like spin, you can spin it any you want to fit what you believe"
Tobias Harris
I mean trade him for Tobias Harris if you want but your team is instantly worse.
Low Energy Tobias Harris
We tanked four years to have Tobias harris as our second best player
"I'll take it further. In July, I was saying they needed to trade him for a huge expiring with immediate contributions and trade capital. My suggestion was that mpj goes to the blazers, cj + roco go to the sixers, and Tobias Harris and 2 sixers picks + 1 portland pick goes to the nuggets.  This would allow the nuggets to pick up a super star with the single best offer any condenser could make (up to 6 picks, and a huge expiring contract) while still having a great pairing of tobi, Gordan, Jokic, and Murray."
"Obviously Simmons but lowkey a lot of Sixers fans hate Shake Milton too. He takes dumb shots and has a very low bball iq. He also takes away possessions from better younger players like Maxey and Furkan.   Part of this is Sixers fans love Embiid, Furkan, Niang, Maxey, Seth, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe to a borderline irrational extent so anybody else is viewed as lower than them. Even Tobias Harris gets some undeserved hate online."
Tobias Harris is awfully similar size/style and slightly better.  Not sure where they'd fit him.
Tobias Harris not becoming anything more has really messed with the teams makeup. He should be that guy yet his handles are still too trash to elevate to that next level.
"Yeah, it's really JTA/Lee/Poole who ""developed"" over the last 2-3 years.  Can't blame another team's fan for not knowing that when my dumb ass bet the Sixers to cover the spread last night because I thought Embiid would feast on GSW's lack of bigs.  About five minutes into turning on the game I start asking myself, ""Where is Embiid? Where is Tobias Harris?"""
Man Tobias Harris has been invisible tonight.
JTA better than Tobias Harris
Franz Wagner has been a real pleasant surprise to me. I think he can be a starter for a long time. Probably never a superstar but he's a solid starter imo. Maybe Tobias Harris level of a guy.
"&gt; As I've repeatedly said, I think Ingram is a great player who could help out plenty of teams, but to me he operates in the same way that Tobias Harris does. He's a better shooter and that may be the fit people see next to Embiid. But I think the Sixers biggest need is an actual play maker.  I don't see whats wrong with having another Tobias Harris on the team, he serves the purpose of making space for Embiid and can do a little playmaking + is on the same timeline as Embiid unlike Harris.  &gt; If the Kings are open to trading for Simmons, I personally think Haliburton and Hield are the optimal pieces. Hield for shooting and his contract, but Haliburton is a better point guard for what the Sixers need.  Obviously Haliburton and Hield would be better fits for the Sixers but the Kings aren't gonna trade Haliburton and Hield isn't the type of player Morey is looking for.  &gt; If they want to keep Haliburton but are open to trading Fox, than I think we would do well with him also.  Sure that could work but I was exploring the 3 team trade possibility but if the Kings offered a straight swap I have no doubt the Sixers would jump on that chance as well"
"I normally don't mind it, but it's been brought up repeatedly like it's such a great trade. Ignoring what the Sixers need and the fit.  As I've repeatedly said, I think Ingram is a great player who could help out plenty of teams, but to me he operates in the same way that Tobias Harris does. He's a better shooter and that may be the fit people see next to Embiid. But I think the Sixers biggest need is an actual play maker.   Maxey and Fox seem to be in the same mold, where as Maxey is playing better right now. But that doesn't mean we can't have both on the squad but....  If the Kings are open to trading for Simmons, I personally think Haliburton and Hield are the optimal pieces. Hield for shooting and his contract, but Haliburton is a better point guard for what the Sixers need.   If they want to keep Haliburton but are open to trading Fox, than I think we would do well with him also. His shot is not great this year so far, but we don't need him to be a shoot first point guard. He can use his quickness to drive and kick out to waiting players. Or just facilitate with Embiid."
We had already traded away the heat pick by then for Tobias Harris
"The Sixers, for most of a season, started Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid. Please don't ask us questions like this."
"It amounted to us trading both our picks in that draft for Tobias Harris.  At the time we made the Harris trade, Landry Shamet was looking like he'd turn out better than Mikal Bridges, and we were still holding out hope on Zhaire.  Things change. Most players improve. Some don't. It's really hard to predict who's going to make a jump.  I will say, at the time of the draft, Mikal was billed as a ""high floor, low ceiling"" guy, mostly because he had played 3 years already, and I for sure called bullshit on that. A good player is a good player, it's tough to say who's going to improve, but it's impossible to say ""oh yeah, this guy's good, but he won't improve"""
it was a good looking trade at the time because they got the miami pick which at one point was a valuable asset. Then they traded that pick for Tobias Harris
"It was a bad bad move. For some reason they thought an extra first round draft pick and Zhaire Smith (another pick who could dribble or shoot) could be parlayed into a bigger “piece”. What they got was someone with a nut allergy and a follow-on trade for Tobias Harris, who is great at making the stat sheet look good, but that’s about it."
"Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Curry and all their picks 76ers-   Only trade of a team that has legit all star caliber players to trade without giving up their own superstar."
"76ers won't win a title while Tobias Harris is on the roster.  His ball stopping tendencies kill momentum. He puts up tons of empty numbers, but that's it. If we move Simmons, our next priority should be to offload Harris for role players."
Granger is more like a tobias harris
Ok let’s say they’ll have one max contract. So then it would be who is the best max contract we can get? You think Tobias Harris would be the guy? I see what you’re saying for sure.
"Also can't forget Al's primary offensive skillset is all based around setting screens and making plays out of screens.   Ben Simmons isn't really a PnR PG. Brett Brown wasn't really a PnR coach. They also didn't really have any PnR guards coming off the bench. The only capable PnR ball-handler you had was Tobias Harris and it took a while for the team to figure that out, you weren't really using him in PnRs that year.   I've always said, signing Al Horford and not letting him set screens is like signing JJ Redick and not letting him shoot 3s."
"al horford and robert williams sharing the floor (110 minutes): +6.39, including a 95.45 defensive rating  He can still play PF. The problem was, embiid and simmons were basically both centers offensively, tobias harris was a power forward, and josh richardson was bad. Adding a big man in horford to that mess of a lineup just made it even worse."
Joel Embiid   Tyrese Maxey   Tobias Harris   Ben Simmons   Seth Curry   Danny Green   Mattisse Thybulle   Furkan Korkmaz
"Tobias Harris isn’t as good as Ja, but I think Ja makes it this year and Tobi doesnt"
"I suggested a mpj trade for Tobias Harris and 3-4 first round picks, where mpj ended up at the blazers. Damn, I wished that happened."
I’d trade them Tobias Harris if they had anything worth a damn

tyrese maxey &gt; tobias harris
Tobias Harris still playing fam
Not Tobias Harris that I can tell you
Too much positional overlap with Tobias Harris? Grant played with Michael Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic and was an absolute stud. I’m sure he could coexist with another great shooter and another great center
"But there is no asset the Pistons hold *besides Cade* that Morey values as a centerpiece of a deal. Understandably so. Grant is not a great passer or great shooter. His best position is the 4 spot, where Tobias Harris is simply better than him.   Morey would *probably* do Ben+things for Cade+salary filler.  But the Pistons have no reason to do that. Morey won't accept a package of dogshit, and the Pistons have no reason to trade Cade."
Why would a team that has Tobias Harris do a Simmons for Grant trade?
"Could be wrong but I've read from people that watch more than me that jerami's D isn't as good as before, just because he shoulders a big offensive load now. I'd imagine if he took a smaller role next to embiid he'd be able to put in more effort on D tho.   The problem with tobi is that he's not good enough to actually lead an offense, so he's best offball next to embiid, playing within the flow of the offense. So you have two guys next to embiid who are low volume three point shooters. If the sixers could trade tobias harris + something extra for CJ, and they could swap ben for grant, then cj/grant/embiid would be a great trio."
"LeBron with Embiid, Tobias Harris and Seth Curry would honestly be very interesting. Thybulle is already your defensive anchor and Furkan can turn into a sniper at any moment."
Remember when people were comparing him to Tobias Harris?  :-)
"No Embiid for all 6, no Tobias Harris for 3 of those, and no Matisse Thybulle for all 6 kinda hurts more than you'd expect"
"&gt;you want 3 picks, here is tobias harris take it or leave it  Fucking lmao."

"I know we don't care about Jokic's defense, but man it's tough watching him just let Tobias Harris go right by him in the paint."
"[Harris was in the 86th percentile of ISO scorers,](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Tobias%20harris&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;SeasonYear=2020-21) hitting 1.08 points per possession and only taking on 1.5 ISO possessions per game last year.   [Middleton was in the 66th percentile of ISO scorers,](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;SeasonYear=2020-21&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Middleton) and only scored 0.96 points per possession but actually took on 2.6 ISO possessions per game last year.   So not only does Middleton score less in ISO, he also ISOs 75% more...   ISO scoring is also really important in the playoffs, and Middleton had to do quite a bit in order to carry some possessions, especially when Giannis was on the bench. Harris is even better, and nowhere near being a black hole or ball hog.   &gt;he doesn't like shooting 3s.  Middleton only averaged 1.4 more 3p attempts/game. They had almost the exact same TS% and eFG%, so it's not really a more efficient way for him to score, and isn't adding to spacing when they're both 40% 3p shooters on moderate volume.   Like I said, you guys don't even deserve your team."
"We just played Utah. Now we are again in altitude in Denver.   Drummond is gonna be on Jokic lol.   We are out Thybulle, Embiid and more.   We have to play Tobias Harris now.   This is going to be tough for the Sixers."
We don't even want to trade Maxey &amp; Thybulle honestly. They both have so much upside. We'd rather trade Tobias Harris &amp; Danny Green.
"Tobias harris is a ghost in the playoffs, hes nowhere to be found down the stretch"
"&gt;I can send you 2m for a picture of a cartoon monkey  ...Tobias Harris, that you my dude?"
"Even if they trade Simmons for literally zero salary, they're at $112 million next year - right at the salary cap.   Even without Ben, they won't have the option of making a run at a free agent until 2024, when Tobias Harris and others come off the books."
Tobias Harris is literally a better playoff contributor than simmons
"Tobias Harris is still there. Maxey looks good to great so far. And they have good role players.  It’s not perfect, but I do not believe their ceiling is really that different with Simmons or without him. And they obviously aren’t getting good offers for Simmons."
"You don’t think the Sixers lost because they were giving heavy minutes to Danny Green and Tobias Harris was their third best player?  Nah, must be because the 3x all star was actually just bad the whole time!"
"Ingram is a natural PF and can't play defence well enough to be a SF. And tobias Harris is also a PF, playing him at SF clearly doesn't work as shown with the horford experiment.  And KAT is great sure and offensively him and Embiid would be amazing together. It's just you would have to play KAT PF next to embiid and he's not exactly suited to that. Defensively it would be fairly comparable too Indiana around 10th or so in the league. And whilst the offence would proabnyl be better, you still don't have anyone to initiate the offence and Tobias is still being played out of position."
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."
Seeing all this movement on offense reminds me of the glorious days of the previous two weeks of sixers basketball before Tobias Harris ripped them out of my cold dead hands.
"He is redundant unless we are dumping Tobias Harris, too."
"i dont think so if your goal is to contend for championships  Tobias harris is already one of the most empty calorie players in the league and would still be your 2nd best player.  His only arguable above average skills compared to other wings is his mid range shooting and his post up game.  Basically the worst fit possible for Embiid because those are his two best skills.  He has proven throughout his career that he is not a needle mover and chas not proven he can be a third option much less a 2nd option.  He is on a max contract for the next 3 years  Now enter CJ McCollum.  Another similar type of impact player, he feels like the Tobias Harris of guards.  Another guy who has not proven to be a 2nd or 3rd option also on a near max contract for multiple years.  Once you make this deal you have both of these players that are slightly below all star level that do not move the needle and probably cannot be traded.  You are locked into this core of three guys.  I understand that as this situation deteriorates these deals start to look better but theres a reason this hasnt been done yet."
Lol garland mobley juluis randle Tobias Harris lol ok
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"How was he the only GM in the league that wasn’t a coward? The Raptors traded their franchise player for Kawhi and later traded for Gasol in a win now move, this was obviously before any injuries to the Warriors.  OKC traded for PG13 and Melo. Sure it didn’t work out but that’s certainly not being a coward.   Boston traded for Kyrie and signed Hayward, they definitely made moves to try and win. Shit just didn’t work out.   76ers traded for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in order to win.   Cavs made moves to try and win. They wanted to trade for PG13 and Bledsoe but the deal fell through. Even after the whole Kyrie fiasco they made moves to attempt to win, even if it wasn’t the right moves.   Spurs tried to win too with Kawhi until all that went down. Even after that they traded for a win-now player rather than for the future, he just wasn’t good enough.   Lakers tried to get AD at the deadline in 2019, giving up damn near the same exact package as they did in the Summer.   How was it only Morey who wasn’t a coward???? Please explain."
"In honor of the Staples center name change, here’s the All Ugly-Ass NFT Ape Twitter Avatar Team, or the Right-Click Save-As Superstars.   PG: Steph Curry SG: Seth Curry SF: Tyrese Halliburton  PF: Josh Hart C: Rudy Gobert  GM’ed by Daryl Morey.   All these players have NFT avatars on Twitter.  Obviously this team is incredibly small, but that’s only fitting for such a forward-looking group. I could’ve used Tobias Harris at the 4 but I wanted to take them from all different teams for varieties sake."
"But why would they?   Before Embiid went out with COVID, they were doing just fine without him.  They don't need role players, they already have a fuckton of good ones, they need a real 2nd star, not Seth Curry or Tobias Harris doing their best impression of one."

I swear Tobias Harris is so underrated. Every time I watch Philly games I notice he’s the one player on the floor that’s more often than not making the right decisions
KP for Tobias Harris is fascinating tbh. I can’t decide if I love it or hate it
Now tell me would you trade Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons? Would you trade Aaron Gordon for Tobias Harris? How about Danny Green for MPJ?
We already have Tobias Harris. Does Barnes come off the bench?
"is it me or is Tobias Harris a bit of a boring player like u see it at the end of the game ""oh wow Tobias has 32"" but u can never remember them. can u remember a single Tobias layup? but try Embiid...u can see the fade i remember a Embiid fadeaway"
"I can see it working pretty well on offense, but he’d be a major liability guarding smaller players on defense. Modern 4s are usually, at least, semi-capable ball handlers (e.g. Tobias Harris), so even if teams didn’t deliberately go small to pick on him, I could see it becoming a problem, especially in the playoffs.  It would be interesting though."
"I've been saying this from the start. Ben Simmons has not handled the situation well at all, but he does have every reason to be upset with the organization. They did him dirty. Straight up scapegoated him for losing the series, when there was plenty of blame to pass around up and down.   When you blow a lead like that in game 5, it's always a team effort. Doc Rivers and Embiid stood to gain nothing from throwing Ben Simmons under the bus, they were just deflecting blame. If they truly wanted him gone, it would've been easier to trade him if they shut their goddamn mouths.  Sixers are basically writing the book on how *not* to handle these situations. Morey and the organization effectively forcing him to comply does nothing but burn down the bridge further. The only adult in the organization is Tobias Harris from what I can tell. Absolute shit show."
"Tobias Harris... Highest paid player at philly and I think top 10 or 15 in the whole NBA. Last year played as a 3rd option behind embiid and Simmons, this year even with Simmons out the ball goes through Maxey and Curry more than him and he just continually throws up highly contested mid range pull ups and it feels like the only time the ball does hit hoop when it leaves his hands is when he airballs"
Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid?? Unless the min is 10 games or something
"Kawhi screwed the spurs harder than any star has since Vince Carter. Our amazing offers included Tobias harris and picks 12 and 13 from the clippers, Marcus Smart and picks from the Celtics, Covington, Saric, and a pick or two from the sixers, Ingram and one pick from the lakers, etc."
Agreed. At the end of tight playoff games their best choice for a bucket would be Tobias Harris or a gassed Embiid post-up.
"Tobias Harris, Thybulle and a pick should get it done, right sixers fans?"
"I feel like you have to be trolling in order to seriously have this opinion.  &gt; Harden who will take shots away from Embiid, Simmons and Tobias.   Harden is a more efficient scorer than all three of these guys.  He *should* be taking shots away from those guys outside of Embiid, who he could definitely split shots with.  I can't believe you actually typed that out for Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons."
"Tobias Harris + Thybulle + 3 FRP for LeBron and THT, is this a win win trade?"
"You should know. You sucked intentionally for YEARS only to get dicked by the Celtics and Raptors. And all you have to show for it is Ben ""I'm afraid to shoot the ball"" Simmons and Embiid who is injured half the time.  Have fun paying Tobias Harris 200 million lol"
I’m just imagining Kyrie/harden/kd picking seth and tobias Harris apart on isos
"That Tobias Harris slander, how could you leave him off your list?"
&gt; Tobias Harris  Comparing Harden to this guy?
"Maybe Ben would be looked at as a better player if he had shooters around him. Besides Seth Curry, the best spot up shooter on his team is Tobias Harris."
Seth Curry and Tobias Harris will unironically outscore Ben Simmons
Morey said youll take tobias harris and ull like it
Sorry your team chose Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler.
All of these threads are reminiscent of when the Sixers traded for Tobias Harris. We don’t know how the team will fit and they look to be worse than that Philly team when considering defense. Their offense was already great without Harden and their defense just got a lot worse.
We’ll trade you Tobias Harris for him.
Kyrie for Tobias Harris? High risk high reward play for the Sixers
Tobias Harris will be included in this deal
"We gave up Shamet and 2 first to give Tobias Harris $65mill a year, let us be a little wary for a few years."
Nah they’d have Tobias Harris guard Gasol like the Sixers did in the Raptors series.  Gasol is too limited to take advantage of that matchup at this point in his career.
"I think if PJ Tucker is involved in this I would side with you on this. If he isnt.........man that's hard.   The perimeter/wing defense becomes an issue with this trade(of course you still do it but doesnt mean this isnt true). Lakers had to put AD on Jimmy Butler last year because Danny Green couldnt do it. Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Tobias Harris, James Harden, Danny Green, those are your realistic perimeter defensive options  It's close. If the cost of PJ Tucker is it requires me to give up Maxey instead of Thybulle I would do that though."
How does this affect Tobias Harris?
In no world would anyone take Harris over Simmons other than you. This ‘argument’ isn’t worth my time. Simmons is a 24 year old who is 6th in assist and a DPOY candidate. Tobias is an overpaid 28 year old. If the sixers can trade Tobias for harden (they can’t) they would do it in a heartbeat. The suggestion you are making is preposterous
I have a feeling we'll win this trade by giving up Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris franchise cornerstone
"&gt; At the end of the day, a team can’t win a championship with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer and Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz as the secondary ball handlers.  Why not?   Our team this year actually built around Simmons strengths and Embiid's influence on the defense.   If Seth Curry and Danny Green get hot at the right time we are one of the best teams in the league.  Great defense and 3 pt shot making/creating with a dominant interior presence.  Meme all you want but Simmons is arguably the best player at getting his teammates good looks from 3.  The problem has always been we werent able to spread the floor enough for him to do it especially in the playoffs because him and Embiid arent a great fit.     Outside of shooting a tad bit better, Simmons is similar to Giannis.  The difference being one team has a top 3 center and the other doesnt so they were able to build a more functional team around what Giannis does."
"I dont think you **can** add him to a team with other stars...plural.  Stars are exactly who the Rockets are gonna want in return for him. Rockets arent looking for Ben Simmons and scraps. It'll be like Simmons, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and multiple future draft picks..leaving them with Embiid/Harden and a pile of present and future shit..."
"You should checkout my podcast “Ball Talk” wherever you find podcasts we talked about a lot of potential Harden destinations at the end of our most recent episode.   You could almost definitely get any 2 players you want from a team like the Raptors, or you could probably get someone like Tobias Harris, or CJ McCollum with picks. And even though none of those guys are better than Kyrie, none of them are head cases, you’re probably getting more and better picks, and the fit on the Rockets would be much easier (Fertitta seems to still want to win games form what I’ve heard)."
"Yeah sure however you have to also realize the Sixers were without some of their key players like Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, and Matisse Thuybulle."
No Tobias Harris just got better this year apparently
He would be our best player. To trade for Tobias Harris I am pretty sure we would have to send out Julius Randle in order to fit his salary. Flipping Randle  for Harris would help with the spacing but right now Randle is our best passer and our offense goes through him. We would rely more on Payton to set players up.
on the knicks he i would be overpaid and is a negative for us is my whole point.  A Team were Tobias Harris is your best player is not a positive.
Tobias is overpaid and we are in a rebuild. We would also have to trade Randle out  who is playing at an all star level to take back Harris. Randle is making half what he is making and posting better numbers.  Only way I take him if there were picks attached. His contract is trash.
"If you think you're getting James Harden for Tobias Harris you are out of your damn mind. If he's going to the Sixers, Simmons is 100% coming back in return."
"That roster is really bad. They don't have shooters and they don't have size and they don't have shot creators outside of Harden and Wall. And Wall isn't an elite one right now or anything, he's kind of like a third star at this point, like Tobias Harris or something.   I think it would be a minor miracle if they made the playoffs. Like that first year for LeBron on the Lakers, LBJ kind of went into carry mode but then got injured and the team just showed how worthless they were. Then they acted all sad that LeBron wanted to trade them for AD. But LeBron was right."
We will take Simmons and Tobias Harris. Y'all can have Harden and PJ.
Tobias Harris has been balling this season though hasn’t he?
Tobias Harris can Fix it.
We don’t want Simmons over Harden. We want Simmons over Tobias Harris.
They’re getting Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris
I mean I get that you guys got screwed over the last two games but losing Seth Curry and Tobias Harris isn't the same as losing your best 3 players
Danny Green  Kyle Lowry  Joel Embiid   Tobias Harris   Boban Marjanovic
"hmmm, that's interesting. I wonder if they'd want to get rid of all of their guard depth for a 34 year old Lowry, who's obviously still a beast, but... not sure. Scott would for sure make any deal. I'm not sure you're getting Maxey AND Thybulle in a package for Lowry, probably just one of them. I think they like Green too and pursued him pretty heavily in that Horford trade (gave up a first).   I also imagine Morey wants to get out of the Tobias contract as much as possible. It's like top 10 worst in the league from a value standpoint, even though he's looked a lot better under Doc so far. Just way too much money to pay that dude.   You're kind of right though, besides Philly I really have no idea who would want to trade for Lowry. Maybe the Nuggets? A package around Harris, RJ Hampton, draft picks, maybe like Montae Morris.   The league is so weird this season"
"It so clearly demonstrates the fickle nature of the r/nba user to see how many people are listing tobias harris here.  This time last year you'd run the risk of getting banned from reddit for even breathing that suggestion.    Also lotta kemba votes for a guy who may or may not have a totally cooked knee, doesn't play defense, and is no longer a 26 yr old fire breather offensively. Just saying.  Can't wait for the moment next season when this question is asked again and wiggins is being included.  That'll be a sweet sweet tonic."
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
That’s former Eastern Conference Player of the Week Tobias Harris to you
"Kemba, Jrue, MPJ, Tobias Harris, Ayton"
Great one! PF is definitely the hardest to fill in my opinion. Could possibly slide Tobias Harris in at the 4.

"Lowry to the Sixers? I think he would be down for that, but Tobias Harris’ contract is kinda yikes"
Because he was overpaid so therefore he’s a scrub. Same reason a lot of people act like tobias harris is pretty much nic batum getting 30 million a year
Tobias Harris contract was awful
"To play devil's advocate at least Westbrook can fill in more seats and TV viewers relative to his pay than say a guy like Wiggins, Tobias Harris, etc."
Last person on the east who can stop Embiid is Tobias Harris.
"If you go up and down any thread that invokes Jokic number on /nba you will find the most negative comments come from 76er fans. I get it, Jokic and Embiid came in at the same time, Embiid has missed almost 2 full seasons of combined games over Jokic. And that includes a full season where Jokic was playing overseas. But at some point you guys have to accept that you guys have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and it doesn’t have to come down to this Jokic v Embiid mind game y’all are playing. It’s ok to accept an opposing player is better than yours, it’s just disappointing that every Positive Jokic /nba post is filled with 76 fans trying to drag Jokic."
"lmao if Tobias Harris is being paid 36 million a year, Dort deserves that too because his offensive game gets better and better while locking down the other team’s best player."
"Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Danny Green are all starters along with Embiid and Simmons."
Tobias Harris
"Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, and Tobias Harris were all in the same draft. Harris hit his 10,000th point a few days ago, Kawhi today, and Jimmy most likely would have got to 10,000 today too had the Heat game not been cancelled."
Sabonis wont make first team east this year.  Giannis and embid with his monster year are getting it. Other forward spot is Durant which screws Tatum..  East is deep this year for bigs and forwards.  Tobias harris the big i feel is most likely to be deserving but get left off.
On-Off basef on 10 games is pretty dumb  Jokic has a +28 on/off. You can also find stuff like:  * Cameron payne having +30 on/off net rating  * Both Tobias Harris and Embiid having +27  * Nico Batum having +28  * Willy Cauley-Stein +27
Tobias Harris
"What is he good at? Last year: 18.5 ppg, 45.6 fg%, 34.6 3p%, 55.9 ts%. For comparison Tobias Harris: 19.6 ppg, 47.1 fg%, 36.7 3p%, 55.6 ts%.  Everyone considered Tobias the worst contract in the league last year and he's better than Murray is. Guy simply isn't good. He's a volume scorer."
Because that 35 y/o PG would become their 2nd best player in the playoffs lmao you gonna rely on Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons to be your 2 and 3 in the ECF? Good luck
RIP my fantasy team matchup this week and next.  I have Tobias Harris as well :(
"That's not how all star selections work though. ""Frontcourt"" players get 6 slots, and the potential for 2 more with wildcards. Grant isn't just competing with small forwards. He's competing with power forwards and centers.   That's KD, Giannis, Butler, Tatum, maybe Jaylen, Middleton, Hayward, Sabonis, Embiid, Adebayo, Vucevic, and guys more on the fringe like julius Randle, siakam, OG, Jared Allen, tobias Harris, hell even Drummond maybe.   That's a lot of guys competing for MAX 8 spots, more likely 7 or even 6, and even now he's behind at least 7 of them. Considering there are 12-15 guards fighting for 4 spots plus the wild cards, it's a solid bet guards get both wildcards, leaving only 6 frontcourt spots.   So you're saying grant is currently a lock over KD, giannis, Tatum, Embiid, Middleton, vucevic, adebayo, and Sabonis, who are all really good bets to get in? All former all stars, all off to good starts?"
Tobias Harris deserves some love/respect for his current evolution into an NBA MVP
"I'd rather have Tobias Harris, the version thats fresh off a max contract and looks awful 80% of the time"
Tobias Harris on the bench?  (trade for Blake)
Tobias Harris
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
Hawks get finessed badly if this is a straight up deal. I would rather trade for Oubre or Tobias “fresh off a max contract” Harris over the dollar tree version of Kuzma
Tobias Harris the reboot
No one wants him. I'd rather endure the pain and frustration of having Tobias Harris fresh off a max contract on my team
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."
Tobias Harris straight up
"Rudy is a hell of a player. The covid thing was a terrible look, but I’m not going to hold a single mistake against someone forever. He seems truly sorry, owned his mistake, and made substantial donations. That’s enough for me.   The other thing a lot of people love to ignore is location. Utah isn’t getting a free agent center close to as good as Rudy. Same reason Sixers overlaid Tobias Harris and Bucks maxed Middleton (that one looks better with how well he’s played since the deal). Unfortunately most organizations can’t even get the time of day from top tier free agents, so they’re forced to overpay their own players. When considering all that, it’s hard to say it was the wrong move."
"Demar, tobias harris, pg13"
Didn't your team give Tobias Harris a max contract?
It's wild to me that Philly ever had possessions where Tobias Harris is the only player that touches the ball
Tobias Harris is unguardable
Whoa do you think Tobias Harris and Joe Harris are related?
Shake Milton and Tobias Harris seem way better than last season
Tobias Harris is elite
"I know this sub likes to meme on Paul George, but come on. Tobias Harris has never been anywhere close to the caliber of player PG is. Harris has never been an All-Star or an All-NBA selection."
I’d say it’s a much better version than that team tbh. Simmons and Embiid are much more experienced and have gotten better since then. Also Tobias Harris provides another dimension to the offense that wasn’t on that 17-18 team. Not to mention the better coach and true backup 5.
Yes if they can do the following  1. Joel Embiid stays healthy  2. Ben Simmons cancels out one of the Jays 3. Seth Curry/Tobias Harris can play at 80% of their current levels.
I think Tobias Harris was the first option he was dealt that  year I believe
Tobias Harris for player A?
The Wall/Westbrook trade of PFs. I’m calling it in a couple years Tobias Harris for Paul George is gonna be a thing too
"Clearly he's from the year 2024, and is talking about Tobias Harris"
Yeah we need to trade Lowry for the missing piece: Tobias Harris and draft picks.
"Joel has always been pretty solid defensively, and yes it's a small sample size, but coming into tonight Embiid was only trailing Drummond in defensive rating.  Simmons and Tobias Harris are/were 3rd and 4th, respectively."
"Beal’s a choker only 3 points in the fourth, Tobias Harris better.   &gt;!this is a joke, maybe!&lt;"
"Off hand : Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Gary Harris, D’Angelo Russell,"
Fact: Doc Rivers has never blown a 3-1 lead when Tobias Harris is on his team.
Tobias Harris and lots of picks would do it
Tobias Harris.
"hi-  i mean i’m not 76ers forward Tobias Harris, i am a simple reddit user. mhmm no go along young one, nothing of importance here"
"LeBron realised that he fucked up at the moment when he's sagged off, let Tobias Harris getting Caruso (4 inch taller and 50 lbs heavier, it's too much for him) and iso 1vs1 on Caruso. He left Seth Curry wide open and tried to double Tobias Harris but it's too late. To be honest, 76ers drawing up a play is pretty good and it's much better than Brett Brown"
The Lakers would take that play defensively 10/10. Their best perimeter defender Caruso on Tobias Harris. Hell of a shot by Harris
"Never once, as a lifelong sixer fan, have I complained about tobias harris being over paid... I always said ""just wait til Doc rivers is coach, then you'll see!!!!"""
Tobias Harris with the 30 million dollar shot.
THANK YOU TOBIAS HARRIS
17m/year is absolutely not a massive contract for a starter and Adams is still a solid NBA player   Tobias Harris literally makes double that
"anybody who accuses me of having ever doubted the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers in general, and Tobias Harris in particular, will be hearing from my lawyer"
"TOBIAS ""UNDERPAID ""WHO'S JIMMY BUCKETS"" HARRIS."
Rivers was able to get the best version of Tobias Harris on the Clippers as well.
That time out did end up allowing them to move the ball to the frontcourt to set up the Tobias Harris game winner.
"His grace Tobias Harris has a plan for all of us, child."

Tobias Harris has the worst contract in the league
Tobias Harris
"Dont forget Tobias Harris, Jaylen, Grant, Middleton, heck even Annouby, DeAndre Hunter, Collins, and Markkenan easily have cases.."
Tobias Harris campaign starts Thursday
He’s way younger than Tobias Harris and has lots of time to improve. Therefore I think he will get a max
"In the past, probably. But when Tobias Harris is scoring 20 consistently and Seth is contributing 15, the 12 is entirely acceptable"
Tobias Harris ain't here to help you boban!
"One of the first things he said in media availability when working with the team was ""he hesitates sometimes, he wants to get in what we call his bag of tricks, but I love Tobias going downhill and making quick decisions, quick shots, quick first step down the hill."" From that moment I loved the Doc hire because that's a perfect diagnosis of what was ailing Tobias' game. Tobias ""The Patient"" Harris getting fixed up by doc"
"Just looking at the box score, Tobias Harris shooting in this game like he's a Laker"
"tobias harris has to figure out how to get to the line, cause you're going to have those 5/16 shooting nights, but if you're going to be the second scoring option you still need to figure out how to get points up. you can't be 6/17 for 12 points or whatever, it has to be 6/17 and like 7/9 at the line"
Tobias Harris aint shit
doesn't work when tobias harris been playing the way he has this season tho
"Irving is already a starter  So already locked was Embiid, Giannis, KD, Kyrie and Beal  Yet to be called out but very likely would be Tatum and Brown, Simmons or Tobias Harris, Bam Adebayo, Gordon Hayward, Trae Young, Vucevic, Middleton, Sabonis, Randle, Vanvleet/Lowry/Siakam, oh and of course James Harden has gotta be a lock.   Of that full list the guys that probably won't make it would be Randle, maybe Vuc or Bam so there is a ton of competition still and I didn't even throw LaVine into the list.   But basically of that list the following teams will have to have an all star just because of their standings and success and those would be Boston, Indiana, Charlotte, Toronto. So that's 4 spots completely locked up with Boston likely being 2 all stars so really 5 spots. Then Harden will very likely get a spot. That leaves 1 spot left now which will be fought for between Middleton, LaVine, Bam, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Vucevic, Julius Randle. I can see LaVine making it over all those guys just cause of the season he is having but then again the way Beal didn't make the roster last year and Beal was clearly a better player than Trae Young but still Trae got the spotlight at the time. But still LaVine is on a better team and is having a more efficient season from a numbers perspective than Beal was at the time."
20/6/6 on 50/40/90 with good defense isn't honorary. He still scores slightly more efficiently and way better playmaking then Tobias. I like Harris but he isn't better or having a better season then Khris. Both shouldn't be all-stars.
"If it was just a few fans, there would be less obsession. Tobias Harris didn't get that much hate last season despite his contract because Harris stans were basically non-existent last year."
No they haven’t been as good as Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons.  Tatum has league average offensive efficiency.  Brown 59% is good not all-star level. Defense down for both.
Honest question: is Middleton even having a better season than Tobias Harris?
it's hard to decide between   The rights to Dirk Nowitzki for the rights to Tractor Tractor Traylor  Ray Allen in his prime and a 1st round pick for a 34 year old Gary Payton who didn't want to come here and Desmond Mason   Or sending a 20 year old Tobias Harris to Orlando for JJ Reddick so we could lose in 5 games in the first round as the 7 or 8th seed for the 6th year in a row  Honorable mention trading up in the 1st round to draft Jordan Love
"Tobias Harris, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, wait, we dont have anyone named dinwiddie."
"Having watched good amount of sixers games this season I would have to disagree. Yes he could have improved more , and there's alot of room for improvement, saying that he hasn't gotten better at all is a bit extreme. On post up's alone this season, he has taken a massive step forward. I believer this season he's in the 78th percentile for post up's (Ill try to link the source if I can find it, but I believe that stat was from a YouTube video) . He also has pretty good right hook that he goes to often (but given his total  attempts per game doesn't seem as much if you casually watch his games). Also he's his touch near the rim has seen constant improvment this season alone. He's also a hell of alot better finishing with both hands, in seasons prior he would almost exclusively finish with his right now. Yeah he hasn't take a  massive leap offensively but he has seen steady improvement. But with embiid, Tobias Harris, and seth curry in the lineup, it would be foolish to have ben be a focal point in terms of scoring when he can better put his energy everything else he does on court. If you look at the games he's out, you can tell that  alot  of the things that Ben brings to the table, Philly lasts elsewhere on the squad. People want him to be lebron, but he's filling the mold of a super draymond with hints of magic."
Tobias Harris is like a silent assassin.  Hes scoring the quietest 20 point games ive seen.
"Did you fuck up the quote that bad or did ESPN?  Tobias Harris said he would tell his kids he played with Joel Embiid.  If his kids asked who was the best player he ever played with, Tobi said he would say Joel Embiid."
"Millsap was not good defensively last year, Barton was playing out of position and getting mauled a lot by guys way bigger, grant was really really bad defensively through the regular season, Craig tries but really only succeeds against one specific player type, and Harris I already mentioned.   Not one of them is anywhere close to Simmons, and frankly tobias and Thybulle are better than everyone but Gary.   Yes obviously a great center makes the perimeter look better, but an atrocious perimeter D will fuck over most centers. It hurt Utah last year, it hurt Embiid in the playoffs without Simmons (obviously he was still great defensively but again, only so much can be done),"
"I saw Tobias Harris at a grocery store in Los Angeles 2 years ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Just occurred to me I don't think I have ever heard Tobias Harris' voice before
"Wrong again. Embiid had a much better roster than Jokic had. Dude had Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons. It’s not Jokics fault that he can’t elevate his team to a higher level. And again how do you lose to Kawahi? You had Simmons, Butler, Harris and Embiid and you still lost lmao. Meanwhile Jokic has shown that he steps it up in the playoffs and dominates every year. That’s something that Joel can’t attest to. Last year was the 2nd time we made it to the playoffs and we still made it farther than you guys ever have. So please stick to the regular season where you have any chance of a argument lmao."
"Wait wait wait ur comparing those guys with... ANTHONY DAVIS? When we play without JoJo we are at best a 7-8th seed. AD carried his Pelicans team to the playoffs with some Cardi B rap snacks playing with him. Shroeder was an integral part of the playoff team last year, and so on. Ben Simmons is a great defender yes, Tobias Harris is a good 3rd piece, but if u compare teams and you take out Lebron vs taking out JoJo it’s not a question to who’s team suffers most."
Well nobody else is on here posting bulls highlights lol...but seriously up until a good 4 possession run by Tobias Harris late in the third no 76er was in double figures besides Embiid
Tobias Harris is my home.
Tobias Harris looks like The Weeknd if he got in peak physical shape
"I feel like this has been a great season for the all-overpaid squad. Wiggins, Tobias Harris, and Horford are all playing pretty solid basketball, and Conley’s having an awesome season after an inconsistent one last year."
"Well unless the Sixers manage to conjure up a competent half court ball handler/off the dribble scorer like Kyle Lowry, they’re out of real contention. A team with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer is going nowhere."
"If only the sixers had an efficient, high quality scorer at 3 levels who can make his own shot and play really good defense... then they would be set.... they should see if they could swing trading for a guy like Tobias Harris"
"Most All-Stars are usually the MVP(s) for the team they represent.  Young is just as much an MVP as Simmons is for his own team, albeit Simmons is second fiddle to Embiid. Harris is having a fine scoring season, yes. But the Sixers are not as overwhelming to have 3, much less 2 All-Stars compared to Durant, Harden, and Irving. They are all future HOFers. Not saying Simmons cant be, he just isnt at that point yet. This has arguably been his best year and it has been Tobias' best as well, but Tobias is not someone that is a superb leader on both sides of the ball. He is the 3rd best player on that team. You take away like 3 points a game and dip his 3pt shooting by 3% and no one is going to really notice. All he does is score on good shooting and haul in boards Embiid doesnt get.  By comparison with the likes of Adebayo, Sabonis and Randle, ala his All-Star competition...Adebayo is the Heats best player through and through. They are struggling a bit due to injuries and covid, but he is leading them in scoring, rebounds and second in assists per game and has the most assists on the team overall.  Sabonis is also what is keeping Indiana in the playoff race. He alongside Brogdon and Turner have been fantastic. I would put Brogdon in here too if Harden didnt get traded.  Randle along Coach Thibs is carrying the Knicks to the playoffs as we speak. He is having a breakout year and is very likely to win MIP. Knicks are in playoff position by fan voting time for the first time in like a decade."
"He is relegated to the dunkers spot for a lot of their half court sets and isn't even the primary initiator for a lot of them. It's pretty funny to see. If people think this isn't a problem, I don't know what to say. Their best half court creators are Shake Milton and Tobias Harris."
Ernie thinks Tobias Harris is getting in over Simmons?
"If mouthguard chewing is Steph’s “knock” I’d put him on the list pretty easily.  Boban for sure, and Tobias Harris too in my opinion."
Simmons has been the best defensive player in the NBA by a big margin and yes Tobias Harris averaging 21/8/3 in 52/42/90 with decent defense is more all star worthy than Randle Trae or Sabonis
Tobias Harris saved Embiid's legacy on that game winner
"Really tho. Everyone on that list is better than Ben Simmons. Trae, Butler and Bam better too. So are Lowry, Siakam and FVV. Tobias Harris and Hayward better too."
I think Tobias Harris is too
Tobias Harris should be higher he’s  consistent as a MFer
Tobias Harris &gt; Khris Middleton this season?
"Lol, maybe for his standards he's much better this year than AD is for his own standards, but I'd still take a hobbled AD over Tobias Harris"
Tobias Harris is having a better season than AD. That isn't that hot of a take
That’s a totally unnecessary condescending response. I’d like to see how well the 76ers defense looked if Simmons and Tobias Harris were swapped with Murray and Barton/MPJ. I bet it would slide pretty far no matter how well Embiid played.
"Tobias Harris maybe. Both fringe all-star candidates, gives Portland more size, defense and boards, with only slightly less (but more efficient) scoring. Sixers get that extra playmaker they need with slightly more scoring and better spacing around Embiid and Ben (we need a volume shooter and extra ballhandler). It definitely does make some sense. I love how Tobi has been doing this year, and I'm sure Portland loves that CJ made a step too, but it's not the worst trade idea."
"Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Mike Conley, Kemba Walker, Andrew Wiggins ... list goes on"
Tobias Harris dropped 39 in a loss to the Blazers while he was with the Clips
Also this thing where Embiid's 2nd and 3rd best players are Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and Dame's are Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr.  And he's in the west.
He’s a very solid scorer but I’m thinking of a guy with a more diverse offensive game. For example a guy like Tobias Harris would be a great fit.
"Who knew you only needed the clippers to blow a 3-1 lead to get Doc fired and then have him come in and fix Tobias Harris.   It’s that easy wow, why did nobody think of that?"
I went back to the 2007 draft to try and figure out who OP is confusing Tobias Harris with and the only player that even comes close to fitting the bill is Mike Conley.  OP please check the carbon monoxide levels in your house.
"This is Year 10 of Tobias Harris' career, you are counting him being traded to different teams as seasons. His games per season  Year 1: 42  2: 55  3: 61  4: 68  5: 76  6: 82  7: 80  8: 82  9: 72  10: 25 (so far)"
All star. Plain and simple. And idc who disagrees. Bam plays way better defense but isn’t a better number 1 option to carry a franchise. Better than Tobias Harris &amp; I’m taking him over Randle too.
Did you just say Tobias Harris has played 14 seasons in the NBA? He’s 28.
I disagree with a few. Here's my opinion  1 - Kawhi  2 - Kyrie  3 - Thompson (Could be 4)  4 - Butler (Could be 3)  5 - Vucecic  6 - Walker  7 - IT  8 - Tobias Harris  9 - Kanter  10 - Burks
"...because they had Tobias Harris, who they traded away before the playoffs."
You have tobias Harris and danny green 💀💀 cant wait for when you get second rounded again
"I feel the same way about Tobias Harris right now. Never doubted the man could play. Just like the Jazz. Both have exceeded my expectations so far this season and impressed me. Still, i need to see them have success in the playoffs before I'll be fully convinced."
"This was a thrilling game. Ben Simmons had a career high 42 points. Jordan Clarkson had a season high 40 points. Tobias Harris had a season high 36 points. Both teams were shooting lights out and it was some good basketball.  Ben Simmons is pretty unstoppable when he’s driving to the basket. With Embiid out for the game, that opened up the paint for Ben to drive more. This is the aggressiveness that people want to see from him. After the game he said he’s been working on his mental approach. Per espn, he said “Honestly, I’ve been working on my mentality and my mental (approach) a lot these past few weeks. It’s not easy to do that, change the way you play. Certain things in the game come natural to certain people. I feel like I’m figuring it out.”  Jordan Clarkson hit 8 three pointers. And missed only his second free throw of the entire season. Him coming off the bench and immediately hitting his 3’s, including that fast break 3 pointer, brought the Jazz back into the game from being down 14. I think Jordan Clarkson is an extremely valuable piece of this team, definitely the 6MOTY frontrunner in my eyes."
"&gt;Wasn’t expecting a Ben Simmons vs Jordan Clarkson 1v1 but I’ll take it.    Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris was insane.. They had their best games of the season, just to have Jordan fuckin Clarkson off the bench ruin their night with a 40 bomb.  &gt;  Seems like the Jazz just can't stop winning at the moment.. 2021 is wild"
"Ben Simmons very good  Tobias Harris also pretty good  Joel Embiid injured  Rest of Sixers not good   Sixers lose  In all seriousness, whenever Ben or Tobi didn’t have the ball I was in pain, meanwhile Jazz are really good man and Conley is out rn, hopefully both teams are full strength for round 2"
Fuck *that’s* who Tobias Harris looks like!! It’s been bugging me
What if we trade you this game for Tobias Harris?
"I know they are winning, but that Tobias Harris contract is still not great."
Randle has played really well. He deserves it. Tobias Harris is the real answer though.
Don't let Ben Simmons 19 pts distract you from Tobias Harris with 14 pts already
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris have a combined 33 pts on 75% shooting in the first quarter 👀
"No it’s not, only the starters get a fan vote and now the fan vote is only 50% of the overall selection vote. Ja isn’t a starter, and coaches pick the reserves.  And let’s see: Giannis Embiid Beal KD Irving Tatum Jaylen Brown Sabonis Harden Randle Trae  Zach Lavine  Honorable mention: Middleton, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Lowry, Sexton, Siakam, Simmons, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Brogdon  So right now, I’d say bam doesn’t make it"
"Yes, sixers will be relying on Tobias harris to play perfectly to beat the nets and bucks aint shit"
"Tobias Harris and a first for an All-NBA guy in his first full season with the team is not a bad trade. He was injury prone, we took the chance on him, he got us to the playoffs and got injured."
"Curious what your standards are. The guy who traded for him was fired soon after. He never provided meaningful value on the basketball court and now he’s is by far the worst contract in the league. They gave up tobias Harris (later traded for Landry shamet, 2 firsts and 2 seconds), a first, and a second for him.   It would’ve worked out better for them if they would’ve cut tobias and got caught cheating the salary cap and lost those picks lol. Atleast then they wouldn’t have his albatross."

A poor man's Tobias Harris although I think we got Tobi for good now.
I’m not saying it was a good trade but you guys only gave up Tobias Harris and a first
If you’re trading for Lowry the goal would be to play him *with* Tobias. Losing Harris and getting Lowry may be an upgrade but it’s pretty marginal.
Wow not a single Tobias Harris. How times have changed
Yea cuz Kyrie and harden are playing a lot better than Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons
"Was really lucky to have the chance to play soccer with Steve Nash, Larry Nance Jr., Joel Embid and a few other NBA players.  Being around them was eye opening in that they were just hard working dudes who loved the game and were really focused and talented.  Seeing them in that light and taking the work ethic and love for the game really had an influence on me.  Well maybe not Embid he seemed lazy, lol.  Everyone else though was cool and Larry Nance Jr. is one of the nicest and funniest people I've ever met.  Also Luel Deng is chill and Tobias Harris."
Next by OP:      Why are people so unwilling to admit that Tobias Harris is a better scorer than Durant?
"That's one side of the floor, and? Dame would not make the Sixers the team to beat also because they would more than likely lose Tobias Harris in the deal and again......Simmons cannot shoot"
"CJ Mccollum, Conley, De'Aaron Fox, Jamal Murray, Brogdan, Tobias Harris, DeRozan, Ja Morant, Zion, KP, etc. Guys like that, even if some of these guys will prob make a team this year"
Tobias Harris
"Never said Kembas was better, both are bad but alot of people have been acting lately as Tobias Harris contract is justifiably"

10 bradley beals. 10 ben simmon. 10 tobias Harris. 10 brandon ingram.
Worst might be Jaylen Brown or Tobias Harris?
Tobias Harris is the definition of a dude who has decent stats but doesn't pass the eye test at all (in relation to his contract). He doesn't scare anybody
"Yeah, how did Tobias Harris not take a single 3??? He really can't do that with Ben being Ben &amp; Embiid dominating down low."
"Someone who can actually create half court offense, Tobias Harris as the half court initiator does not work and Simmons is in Dunker spot mode at the end of games.  I also think they need more wing defense to deal with secondary players like Jaylen Brown or Kyrie Irving. Danny Green ain’t it at this point in his career"
"Tobias Harris? 2nd, 3rd, and 4th seed both gave 2 players each and Sixers have one?"
"Joe Ingles, Tobias Harris, Jermani Grant, Mikal Bridges and more are way better than DeAndre Hunter."
What’s Tobias Harris? I always thought he was a 3
It’s hilarious to hear Lakers fans flip at supersonic speed between saying that Anthony Davis is a top 5 player or that Lebron is hard carrying and Davis is being outplayed this year by Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris
Oh cool I didn't think the bot would make a game thread since the time is wack on the sidebar.    Tobias Harris scores 60 today.
"Seriously. The trade offers the spurs received were garbage for a player of Kawhi's level. Tobias Harris and two mid firsts. Marcus Smart on a 20M/year contract and picks. Covington, Saric, and picks. Those are not trades for an MVP level player."
"Exactly, thanks for making my point. Tobias Harris had some of the best efficiency of his career against AD and clamped him. AD is far from being anywhere near DPOY"
LOL Tobias Harris need i say more
Just like Embiid bosses and clamps AD every time they meet? Bro your guy got rekt by Tobias Harris on both ends of the floor hard last game
Tobias Harris
Why should it preclude you? Should Tobias Harris get in over Kyrie Irving just because the Sixers have a better record than the Nets even though Kyrie is a way better player than Tobias? Why not just call it the Best Record Game instead other All Star Game at that point? The All Star Game is for the best players in the league.
"You’re correct to a degree, but good management matters way more than lottery position. The Miami Heat were stuck in the 9th seed purgatory position you’re describing, many people were writing off their future the past few years, however because of their great organization they were able to get the big FA they needed to take the next step.  On the other hand, going with your Orlando example, they have actually had lots of good draft picks recently that would push them up from their current level of mediocrity, but they traded lots of them away. They have had Sabonis, Oladipo, Saric, and Tobias Harris on their team, but they traded them away in stupid win now moves. If they had the organizational pedigree of the Heat they wouldn’t be stuck in purgatory as they are now."
"A lot of their success is based on unsustainable play from Joel Embiid. I can't believe people are falling for the ""Sixers are real contenders!"" shit yet again. At the end of the day, either Tobias Harris or Seth Curry is their second best half court threats and that's not enough."
"https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/8/22/12595868/tobias-harris-debunks-conspiracy-theory-that-he-and-j-cole-are-the  Obviously, it's fake."
I’m all for hot takes but that Tobias Harris take isn’t hot it’s just incorrect lmao
"1. The Jazz have the best roster in the NBA  2. Tobias Harris is the most important player on the Sixers  3. Kristaps Porzingis was the worst value of that trade.  4. Bubble Jamal Murray was, in fact, a fluke.  5. Bradley Beal is a bad team stat padder."
"Current? I'd put CJ and Ibaka up there, same with Tobias Harris. All three have put up borderline all-star numbers in the past.   Ibaka has a chip and 3 all defensive selections as well. He'll probably never make an all star game at this point though."

Noel with a nastier block on Tobias Harris. A top 10 block of the season!
Tobias Harris is my father in all senses of the word.
I wouldn’t call Tobias Harris a DPOY candidate
Tobias Harris DPOY
Tobias Harris before this year would’ve fit but yeah it’s pretty rare
I would say MKE has just as much star power as Philly has. I dont think Tobias Harris is the first thing that jumps to mind around star power
"Because they'll take a phone call, who cares  Although I remember around the end of Lob City when people said they would compete again for years and years becauelse they had no assets, then they quickly flipped Blake for Tobias Harris and it was on"
"76ers had: Ben Simmoms (6'10), Jimmy Butler (6'7), Tobias Harris (6'8), Al Hordford (6'9), Joel Embiid (7'1)"
"Book plus Ben and some high level role players like Tobias Harris, OG, Norm Powell and Matisse and a decent rim protector like Jarrett Allen? Yeah, I could see that being a solid contender in the east."
"Yeah I agree, I like Kevin Love as a player and a person, and I certainly won't rag on anyone for accepting $120 million. But for some reason it's really controversial to call him out for doing stupid stuff on the court. Like who purposely turns the ball over cause he didn't have the opportunity to post up Tobias Harris?  I remember Rondo intentionally getting that 8 sec violation during his short Mavs stint and getting shit on for it - and rightfully so. Not sure how that stuff helps anyone except the opposing team."
"Offensively, he’s a better player. Overall? It’s close, but Tobias Harris has been rough in the playoffs. His production dips massively in the post-season."
Embiid = AD. LeBron &gt; Simmons of Ben. The rest of 76ers supporting casts better. Whos better than Harris of Tobias on the lakers?
PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Baron Davis  SF: Kobe Bryant (don’t care I’m counting him)  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Alonzo Mourning  Coach: Tony Bennett
"I still don’t get why they drafted Fultz after he missed every shot during his workout. Should have swerved hard and taken Tatum.  Booker is less realistic of a timeline change.   Even if you don’t change any draft picks, if you just prevent them from their stupid trades, they could probably have a Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Mikal Bridges, and Joel Embiid starting lineup."
"Can I be the devil's advocate for another point of view? As far as bone-headed moves by young point guards go, that was rough but not all that bad. he missed his guy and was more forcused on running down the clock. in the other example ppl always use, love had great position on tobias harris, but al horford was lurking, waiting to steal the ball. they're not that egregious imo.  on the other hand, the way love handled both situations sucked ass. he's getting paid handsomely to be a vet to these young guys. it's bad enough that he's hurt all the time, so to me it sucks when he handles this shit in such an unproductive way. whatever issues you have with sexton, he's a good fucking player and a huge part of the cavs' future. your job is to nurture him. period."
It's hard to imagine a worse possible scenario then the one we ended up with. Even maxing Tobias Harris and keeping our draft pick (that could very well have been SGA) is arguably a better alternative. Literally the only positive is that the franchise completely crashed and burned and had no choice but to finally rebuild for real.

He is overpaid because of the sixers situation... We had to give him the max or be a worse team overall. If we didnt and we let him walk we are still in cap hell with no tobias harris out there to fill the void. We signed Ben and then gave him his max because all it did was cost the organization in lunury tax... He is overpaid but it was the right move by alot because if we didnt we had limited avenues to improve.
"First off, I want you guys to have Lowry. I like the Sixers. I think  Embiid is one of the best big men ever to touch a basketball. Danny Green is my boy and I'm a big fan of Tobias Harris. The Sixers logo with the bell is cool AF and I grew up on the VC/Iverson rivalry.  Secondly, Ben Simmons is ass. The mans averages are ass. He's a homeless mans Giannis and is probably the easiest ""star"" to plan for come playoff time. Once they can hide him behind Lowry, the Sixers will have a legit shot at a chip, until then, I don't think Philly gets out of the second round."
"We have a Tatum, his name is Tobias Harris"
"He's good, but their half court offence is still trash overall. After Embiid, they're relying on Tobias fucking Harris to score consistently. He has a pretty abysmal playoff track record and isn't the type of player to inspire terror in opposing defences."
Tobias Harris the guy is cool as can be and serious when it’s game time he’s literally doesn’t smile during the game he’s amazing and awesome
Tobias Harris
"Don’t forget, 16 points on .514 TS% Tobias Harris is going to bail them out"
"ctrl+f  ""Tobias Harris""  *no results found*  this pleases me immensely"
Is tobias harris the most polarizing player on a contender this year? I feel like half the Sixers fanbase feel like hes an overpaid role player and the other half feels like he is a super star.
"It’s working out rather well. Was a near all star snub.   Tell me you don’t watch basketball without telling me you don’t watch basketball.  I’ll take my second best scorer averaging 20pts per game.  And just for your own reference since you clearly don’t watch basketball,  Khris Middleton’s Averages: 20.3pts/6.1r 49%fg 56.7efg  Tobias Harris: 20.2pts/7.5r 51.5fg 56.7efg   You’re obtuse. You don’t watch the sixers. You don’t follow any games.   Stop it. At this point you look ridiculous.  The future is now old man.   The raptors may not make the playoffs."
"Nah, I clearly explained earlier that your team’s point guard is useless outside of 6 feet in the half court and that Tobias Harris is your second best half court scorer. You ignored those facts because you don’t like them lmao."
"It means that the Sixers are better than the Raptors. You keep deflecting to the Raptors though, I wonder why. Probably because you can’t actually refute what I’m saying. Enjoy relying on Tobias Harris as your second best scorer LMAO."
Jazz fans have no gripe they shot 40 threes.  We have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris driving and getting hacked.  No calls and still up 8.
The Sixers are gonna need him to learn how to shoot if they ever want a realistic chance at real contention with this core. Tobias Harris as the team's second best half court scoring option is not gonna cut it.
His defense in the playoffs will be ultra important. Embiid at another level and a more consistent Tobias Harris plus signing of a Curry will help y’all offense a ton
"Sixers have Tobias Harris, they don't need 2 Tobias Harrii"
Tobias Harris
"What would Murray do that Tobias Harris can’t, (apart from the obvious play making but Simmons takes care of that).  That’s the main problem with this idea imo.  Not worth the loss of someone who can guard literally anyone except some 7 footers and whose shown the ability to score regularly when needed (when Embiid is injured Simmons has averaged 20+ throughout his entire career)."
"1.1 field goal is a big difference lol. It looks small in text but that’s the difference between RJ Barrett and Tobias Harris in terms of scoring output. And like I said, Jokic has way more FGM made than Embiid, we don’t know that if Embiid were to play more that those per game stats would be sustained"
"He's not Woj or Shams, but Mike Scotto isn't bad. Like he's a serious NBA media person - he's been around for years and has broken smaller stuff, always has legit people on his podcast.  I *think* he broke the Tobias Harris to Detroit deal years ago."
"He wasn't great with the Sixers but it makes me wonder how he would be with this year's roster and Doc. Just look at Tobias Harris last year vs this year, it unfortunately seems like Brett was halting the development of some players.   That being said I still like Josh a lot and wish him success in Dallas. He's got the personality and hustle that every team wants"
I don’t hate Tobias Harris lmao. I actually don’t hate any players and try to analyze them as objectively as possible.  The argument for Bridges being the better player is being by far one of the best wing defenders in the league while still being a huge positive on the offensive end
And got Tobias Harris because of it lmao
"He can quote stat lines all he wants, but if you ask any half-intelligent nba fan, fuck ask any casual fan, and 10 times out of 10 they’re picking Ben over Tobias “overpaid as fuck” Harris."
"It wasn't really ""random"" he was trying to make a case for Tobias Harris being in the all-stars instead of Simmons (Which is stupid imo) but he didn't just randomly blurt that out because he was salty lol"
"To be fair, it’s more nuanced than PPG. Tobias Harris provides floor spacing which is a net positive to his teammates in the half court."
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Mattese Thybold SF: Tobias Harris PF: Al Horford C: Joel Embiid  Nah that’s fine /s
"This is incorrect i believe. Sixers operated as an under the cap team that year.  Harris was not resigned using bird rights.   He was re-signed using cap space, but his cap hold was lower than what he was signed for.   Horford was signed using cap space as well.   The alternative was like 31 million cap space, rather than the 38 Tobias signed for"
"I am comparing the game of basketball to the game of basketball. I'm not a Hawks fan and not a 76ers fan. As I said, Hawks over 76ers was my hot take, and I gave reasons to back it up. You may disagree and that is your prerogative. I have great respect for Embiid but I have seen Capela is the only defender in the league who can stop him. Matchups mean everything. Reddish is a good enough perimeter defender to limit Curry's scoring and 76ers dont have anyone to stop Collins. I think it would be a very even series and would most likely come down to how well Tobias Harris plays and how well John Collins plays"
And Tobias Harris missed two games with a bone bruise. It depends on the actual facts of the specific injury.
Ben Simmons is easily a more impactful player than tobias Harris the only argument for Tobias is PPG. Even zach lowe said on his podcast like 25 games into the season when he told some people around the league Tobias might be a better all star candidate than Ben he said he got a lot of pushback from people in the nba on that. And that was just for this season
Tobias Harris beats Norman Powell in just about every advanced stats category.  Tobias Harris:   2.3 OWS 1.5 DWS 3.8 WS 2.7 OBPM 0.1 DBPM 2.9 BPM 7.5 NETRTG  Norman Powell:  2.0 OWS 0.7 DWS 2.7 WS 1.5 OBPM -0.5 DBPM 1.0 BPM 2.4 NETRTG
I mean he was saying it as an argument that Tobias Harris should have been an all star instead ... don't see how it's salty ..
"The All-Star Team is too stacked. Many players are All-Star caliber and ""deserve"" to make the team. Remember, Booker wasn't going to make it. Mike Conley has never won one except on a technicality this year. Tobias may deserve one, but so do BI, Simmons, Tobias Harris, SGA, Bam, Butler, Sabonis, etc."
"I’m gonna say that Tobias Harris is able to create his own shot better, is a better defender, and has been better for longer. I also do not think Tobias is worth a max contract, but that’s largely been because of his playoff performances."
tobias harris is a lot better
Tobias Harris isn’t max contract worthy.
Tobias Harris can drop 25 points a game but this is the first season I’ve seen people love him
Maybe Reputational defence but this isn't necessarily true. The good teams can pull it out. Tobias Harris iced it earlier this year.
"""The call is coming from inside the house."" - Tobias Harris"
"He was making an argument that Tobias Harris should have been an all-star. Because they wouldn't select 3 players from one team, he just basically said Simmons didn't deserve over Harris and ended it with this."
"They were basically trying to say Tobias Harris has been better than Ben Simmons this year, and he should have made the all star team."
He was trying to make the case that Tobias Harris deserved all-star over Simmons.
Tobias “BDN” Harris bout to win you a chip
At some point that Tobias Harris contract is gonna come calling.
Who even exists with Hortford type contracts anymore?  There was Blake Griffin but he's bought out. Tobias Harris is living up to his contract. Westbrook seems to be doing decent now. Wall seems to be doing decent.  I don't see many bad long-term contracts out there right now tbh.
If he had stayed he probably would have been traded for Tobias Harris
"I disagree. You have dudes like Giannis, Tobias Harris, Zion, AD (who spends more minutes at power forward than center by far), Bam sometimes, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Draymond Green, Jerami Grant.  I get your argument about there not being a ton of natural power forwards, but i'd just argue the skill sets for that position has just improved to the point where theyre more capable of doing things like guarding wing players or big men. Lots of these dudes still get buckets in the paint and are athletic, but many also shoot or playmake."
He’s played 6 games with KD and 0 with Blake (who isnt good by the way). Joe Harris is a good player but should never be a needle mover in an MVP race.  Meanwhile the Sixers also have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris (and Seth Curry since apparently those guys matter too) who people conveniently leave out in these conversations

The Nets without Harden and KD are not as good as the Sixers without Embiid.  Philly fans argued Tobias Harris shouldve been the 3rd All-Star this season.   You cant have it both ways.

tobias harris going crazy with the awards rn
I'm putting $150k on Tobias Harris scoring 80+ tonight
"Not really related, but Corey maggette is a dude that I always thought would be great in a modern system. He was utilized as a high volume scorer and took a ton of terrible shots, but if he had like the Tobias Harris role, I think he would be fantastic. Not a great 3pt shooter, but solid and would prob shoot a better % in a system designed to generate those looks, and he was just so fucking strong you couldn’t stop him once he got downhill   Those maggette/brand clippers teams basically ran an offense of “run at the fucking rim as hard as you can”."
2011 Orlando was definitely a better team than last years Sixers sans Simmons lol.   JRich/Hedo/Rasheed Lewis/Jameer Nelson/Vince Carter was an absolutely great supporting cast compared to Tobias Harris and old ass Al Horford. The fact that you think it was a “much worse team than Embiid has ever played with” is a horrible take. I should be the one asking YOU if you were watching basketball back then.
Tobias Harris al horford josh Richardson shake Milton I think jj reddick? Or did he leave? Do you not know the roster last year or what?
"Tobias ""Tobias Harris"" Harris"
"**TEAM KESAVAHRAJ**  New expansion team owner G_Kesavahraj immediately earns the support of his fan base after adding a star laden roster that appears to fit very well together. Wings Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler highlight the group, while BFFs Tobias Harris and Boban earn the fan love on social immediately.  After a 3-3 start to the year, the team finds their rhythm and chemistry. Beal and Butler prove to be an ideal yin/yang, as Beal provides the shooting and spacing while Butler focused on crashing to the line, dishing, and bothering every other wing on defense. Both players average 20 PPG as the team swells up to a 28-20 record midway through the year. Both Beal and Butler make the All-Star team.  At times, the presence of Boban as a starter slows the team's pace down, but with Beal and Tobias Harris the club still feels like they have enough shooting to play a half court game if need be. The club finishes the regular season as the # 3 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the team turns up the gas even more, crushing the feel-good story Knicks 4-1 in round one. Goran Dragic showcases his own scoring prowess in the series with 21 PPG, perhaps having saved up his energy for the playoffs. At this point, the team truly feels like a title threat.  But in round two, the group matches up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis, who may prove a handful for them. Sure enough, Tobias Harris struggles with the matchup, and switching over Jimmy Butler leaves some open holes on the perimeter. Khris Middleton hits 5 threes in game 2, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Bucks.  Now down in the series, all the good vibes start turning sour. Jimmy Butler gives a press conference, blasting the team's defensive effort (and making indirect shots at Beal in the process.) The group responds with a strong Game 3 win, but falls back into old habits in a Game 4 loss. Butler puts the team on his back and scores 31 in Game 5 to pull off another win and take the series back to 3-2. Still, the Bucks' hot shooting ends up carrying them in Game 6, leading to a bitter defeat.   The team licks its wounds and pride after the loss. Surely, they had the talent to compete for a title, but it just wasn't in the cards this season."
"Tobias Harris is also close with 51.3, 40.2, and 88.7."
Tobias Harris
"Great game by KAT. But also, have you considered Tobias Harris?"
Tobias Harris is a different monster this year.   Sheeeesh
"I think we can still take them in a 7 game series, and as said, I think in the top heavy east we are the only team that can match up against them.  In reality we have 3 DPOY level defenders (Simmons, Embiid and Thybulle). Green looks a shadow of his former self but is still a plus defender, and Tobias has taken massive strides on defence.  With Simmons on Harden, Thybulle on Kyrie and Harris on KD, we are the only team defensively that can match up with them, not many teams run deep defensively. Green will probably start in for Thybulle tho."
yeah and that mavs team ran a train through the west. Lebron was still giving like mid tier all star contributions but he was playing the Tobias Harris role
When Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making max money than yeah it’s a pretty dumb take
"sorry tobias harris doesnt fit your bill  “3 all stars, 1 all star calibre player, and a top 10 shooter in the league.” There. I also editted my comment for u"
"He has to score at least 23 a game to have a shot. Otherwise he's Tobias harris...probably good enough to be an all star, but doesn't quite have the numbers"
Really I agree with this one 100 percent. He would be great in a more advanced tobias Harris role
"Tobias Harris since embiid has been out, 21.6/6.9/4.5/1.3/0.9 60.2% TS this guy really should be looked at potentially as the sixers second best player"
"No one can stop Embiid. I’m more concerned with what we do against everyone else. Stopping Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth Curry etc is what’s important here."
Bah god is that Tobias Harris music?
"Yeah but they cant play any full defensive lineups without dying offensively. Every time they need a seth curry or tobias harris who whilst they will give their all, are going to get exposed   Thats the issue, the nets have two of the best offensive players of all time to go along with an all nba point guard, two of the most experienced and accoladed offensive big men in the modern game and a lights out shooter who will shut down the gym if left open.  If you have one weak defender in crunch time they will make you pay, and pay dearly."
"Simmons on whichever of harden or kyrie is hot, thybulle on the other, Tobias Harris guards KD. Embiid stays near Aldridge and griffin unless they’re shooting 3s. If they’re out that far he lets them shoot unless they’re hot."
Tobias Harris from Orlando to Detroit
Tobias Harris from Orlando to Detroit
Orlando trading Tobias Harris for Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova.
"Honestly as a Clips fan... I'm not sure what to think. I liked this team a little bit more before they traded off Shai and had his old core of Tobias Harris, Beverly, Harrell, LouWill, etc.  Ever since PG and Kawhi came in, it's been successful but feels disjointed. This team never looks or feels like a fun team anymore, the only guy who keeps a smile on his face now is Mann.  Anyway we'll see where it goes. But if Kawhi walks, I don't think it's disaster. Just a wasted opportunity."
tobias harris of basketball
Also Simmons would probably average like 11-8-3  If anything Tobias Harris legacy would increase
"You think all the guys just decided to play better on their own?  Tobias Harris went from being great with Rivers, to being bad with the sixers without Rivers, to being great with him again, what a coincidence lol"
"Will it go up? Kawhi’s gonna get a few more great years before he starts declining for sure, but Pascal and Freddy might settle into fringe all-star territory like the Tobias Harris’ of the world. Kyle’s likely played his last all-star game, OG might not get to that level. Beyond that I really don’t see where that Raps team adds all-star selections."
"I feel like this hinges a lot on Lebrons status. If he comes back in time to play ~50 games for the season (which I think he will) then he’s a lock. In which case, I think the forwards would be:   1st: Giannis, Lebron  2nd: Kawhi, Butler  3rd: Zion, INSERT_PLAYER_HERE   But if they hold Bron out even longer for the playoffs, he might slip outside of the convo. That would open up a second spot on 3rd team, and I think it’ll be a fight between PG (assuming they don’t call him a guard), Tatum, Tobias Harris, Middleton, and Randle (with Sabonis and Grant having an outside shot).   Ultimately I think they’re gonna call PG a forward just because the guard position is so stacked (Dame Steph Luka Harden Kyrie Trae Lavine Beal) that it just becomes an easier place to put him. So depending on how much time Lebron misses, they might drop him entirely in favor of Randle or one of the other players listed. Out of that group tho, Randle is my favorite so long as the Knicks keep winning."
We live in a world where Tobias Harris has a national ad campaign. Good for him.
"Yeah, trades never happened before.      You also forgot the historically great market of Cleveland. In recent years it's also ""small market"" Philly trading for Butler and Tobias Harris, forming what was basically a 4 all-stars roster."

"Russell has 85 mil guaranteed and is averaging a triple double this season.John Wall is also guaranteed 85 and is considerably worse. Kevin love has 91 guaranteed, Tobias Harris has 148.   His shot selection is the same as its ever been and his attempts per game are actually down.  I don't watch the Wizards let's be honest most people don't, but I've watched a lot of Rockets games and I watched every Thunder game of the PG/Melo/Russ season. I'm familiar with Russ's playstyle and would take him on the celtics in a heartbeat."
"So the reason that Randle is all-nba over Zion is that Randle's team has a better record than Zion's, despite Zion's team playing more difficult opponents and all-nba being an individual award not a team one  Why isn't Middleton therefore on the team over Randle? How about Demar Derozan, Tobias Harris?"
How the hell is Tobias Harris a prolific scorer?
"I mean, Tobias Harris’s career high is 39 and I would say Harris is a prolific scorer. Using career highs doesn’t really say how good you are as a scorer"
"I agree his help defense on the weak side has improved, but 1v1 defense still looks very raw. As you can see tonight, a smaller Tobias Harris was cooking him in the post and shot 100% when isolated with him.   Fastforward to the finals, if AG gets Harden, Murray gets Kyrie, then MPJ gets KD, and that is very worrisome."
I have to belive an athletic dude like rui has a higher defensive ceiling than Tobias Harris
I could imagine his ceiling could be something like Kawhi on offense and an average defender like Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris comes to mind
Tobias Harris
I'm looking foward to a Jamal Murray and Tobias Harris duel tonight
That’s cool Tobias Harris! Now recite “*G.O.M.D. by J.Cole*” for me. I’ll make it as awkward as possible
Ok as always with these conversations who does he deserve to replace? Is he playing better than tobias Harris or trae young? Both more deserving than Hayward
Gotta be Tobias Harris for any Clips fan
Otto porter along with tobias harris
Tobias Harris
"Probably. Build a team with lots of good shooting and a decent center and I don’t see why they couldn’t be serious contenders with his playmaking. He can’t be the best scorer on your team, but he could be the best player.   For example:  Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Rudy Gobert.  Simmons is probably the best player on a team like this because Beal sucks so bad at defense, but a team like that could win the championship.  Some of this depends on era too. Are they winning a championship against healthy Brooklyn? No. Could a team like this win absent of a super team (like if the super team gets injured like in 2019, or 2020) sure."
Tobias Harris baby
1. Won’t make playoffs  2. We saw this last year  4. might as well switch Simmons for Tobias Harris
"Eh this has far more to do with a team that is over the cap trading for a player or needing to re-sign one. Happened before with Tristan Thompson. The clippers did the same thing with Morris and Kennard. Shit, Tobias Harris got a max contract solely because they couldn’t afford to lose him and still be over the cap. Hitting free agency with a team over the cap is probably the single best way to get paiddddd as a role player"
sure but Tobias Harris has averaged more points in that stretch... are you really the number one scoring option if you don’t consistently score the most points on your team (in that stretch)?
which one will rise above the other and become the next....Tobias Harris
"I agree with you, I just think Blake is being annoying here and excluding the most important reason people's minds changed about his value. It'd be like if Tobias Harris was on a $5M contract. Great production for that value. Tobi on $30M? Terrible."
"https://youtu.be/L-EPx-v1XIY  Guarding Giannis was very much a team effort   Guarding a regular player with Ben Simmons vs Tobias Harris is a big difference. Like D’angelo Russell on the nets got wrecked by Simmons defensively in the playoffs. But it won’t make a big difference when it comes to guys like Kawhi, Harden, and Lebron etc"
"There is a massive difference, in fact 90% of the time a perimeter defender wins DPOY is due to how insane his impact is with his iso defense, i.e Kawhi in 2015 and 2016.  People love to shit on iso perimeter defense, but just in 2019 everyone was calling Kawhi the best for his two-way play, dropping 30 on offense and shutting down Giannis on defense. There's a GIGANTIC difference between being guarded by Ben Simmons and being guarded by Tobias Harris, it's just not seen very often in the regular season due to players not trying as hard as they do in the playoffs."
"I mean, the fundamental issue in the NBA is pretty self apparent: max contracts. LeBron and Tobias Harris are both max players, yet LeBron is worth at least double (and probably more) Harris. That artificial ceiling and the economic structure of the NBA (which basically allows a team to have two, maybe three, such contracts) is the first domino that leads to everything else. If the NBA had an open market like the NFL or MLB, or even set the percentage to be high enough to actually limit it to the most elite players (as in the NHL where, IIRC, less than 10 players have ever hit the max salary), teams would be forced to make vastly different decisions in constructing your roster. Do you pay LeBron $75 million, knowing he basically is your team, or do sign three guys for $30 million each?   So long as the max contract exists in its current form, the NBA will continue to work exactly the way it does now."
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
"You just named 3 guys who are well ahead of him. That’s not counting Donovan Mitchell, Book, Dame, Kawhi &amp; PG who are well ahead of Randle if we want to extrapolate the conversation. Heck Tobias Harris is ahead of him if we want to go that far.  I know you guys are excited and all but the Knicks are like 2 games above .500. Nobody is giving you an MVP for that."
We have Tobias Harris and we had Tony Bradley? I guess that half counts
"Bigs have dominated teams before and still lost. Embiid is one man. I’m more concerned actually about how we address Curry, Simmons, Tobias Harris etc. there is no big that’s stopping Embiid.  And he has embarrassed Drummond before, even mocked him about it."

"Kawhi killed his value far more than any other star in recent years. Some of our other offers included Marcus Smart and picks, Tobias Harris and 2 picks in the teens, Covington, Saric, and picks. For a top 5 player in the league. What KD has done is far less bullshit than what Kawhi did to the spurs."
"No. At 21 ppg, it’s entirely possible that he may not be the leading scoring on his team. Jamal Murray is close to 21 ppg, but Jokic is the MVP candidate. Middleton is averaging more ppg, yet Giannis is the MVP candidate . Tobias Harris is around 21 ppg, yet Embiid is the MVP candidate.   The player you described could possibly be DeAngelo Russell. If the T’wolves were 52-30, KAT would be the MVP candidate.   Or it could be Malcolm Brogdon. If the pacers were 52-30, how many people would say it was because of Sabonis?  When the Raptors were a top seed... Kyle Lowry didn’t get much consideration as an MVP candidate. They looked toward Derozen/Leonard/Siakim as the MVP candidates.   Your player would need to do more...essentially they would HAVE to win the conference with inferior talent... aka CP3 with the hornets, Derrick Rose with the Bulls, Iverson with the 76ers, etc."
i think borderline means you’re right there with the allstars but just didn’t make it. maybe like Tobias Harris this season.
"When was the last time a ball dominant center was the best player on a playoff team? Embiid can probably get a bucket at will against the nets but he isn't a big playmaker, and having Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons as his next two options isn't a recipe for playoff success. I think Jokic has a better playoff game in that regard"
"Didn't y'all have a team of Embiid, Simmons, Harris and Butler? Also had Reddick, Cov and Sham off the bench? It's not comparing to us, but thats a super team. 4 all stars, a defensive lockdown and 2 lights out shooters? I don't get your point. I never excused it, but I also know they won't stop and that vets will always be attracted to them  &gt; Damn usually people try to hype up their own players  2019-2020 Tobias Harris  At least don't be a hypocrite"
"The future pick can be traded before the draft.   Look at 2021 Miami pick as an example.  Heat used it to get Dragic in 2015. Suns used it to get Mikal Bridges in 2018. Sixers used it to get Tobias Harris in 2019, and then the Clippers used it to get Paul George in 2019."
Tobias Harris was a Piston!
You forgot Tobias Harris
1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven’t seen George Hill yet but I’d imagine he slides in right under Seth
What makes it worst is they didn’t resign Jimmy butler or J.J Reddick for Tobias Harris and Al horford.

"Not really Julius randle is just a Fat Tobias Harris. So you are saying Zion is a fat Tobias Harris with hop, which is not accurate"
"He had a good shot. KD out for too many, Bron could be too, now locks are Giannis (1st team) and Kawhi (most likely 2nd team or 1st if Bron/KD out). Think Butler also deserved a 3rd team too. It's between Zion, Randle, Tobias Harris, Middleton and Sabonis for whatever left"
"Stan Van Gasbag trying to will a 39 win Pistons team into glory by trading away Tobias Harris and 1st round picks for washed Blake Griffin to build around flakes Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson.  As Paul Harvey used to say...""and NOW we know the REST of the story""."
"is he good in second halves now? when he was a clippers, 20 points in the first half, 2 in the second was the Tobias Harris classic"
"No doubt that the Clippers have been the better team tonight and deserve the win. But holy shit the refs have made this game unwatchable and killed the game as a contest.   19 fouls in the 3rd quarter with both teams in the penalty within 5 minutes. Simmons fouling out was absurd, Dwight with the ejection and Tobias Harris - possibly the nicest and calm guys in the league - with the technical? I’m watching the Philly broadcast and they had no idea why he got the technical, did they show what happened on a different broadcast??"
"Tobias Harris is one of the most soft spoken guys in the league, so you know these refs are shit when hes complaining"
We have always respected and cherished Tobias Harris.
If Tobias Harris is gonna start sensing defenders coming from behind make the right reads and shred doubles teams....
"Well hopefully the sixers can meet us in the Eastern conference finals, LOL btw didn't Tobias harris shoot 28% last year in the playoffs?"
"It's Tobias Harris not LeBron James, doesn't have to be that good to lock him down"
Projected starting lineup    Ben Simmons  Khris Middleton  Tobias Harris  Giannis  Joel Embiid   Sounds pretty sexy ngl
"Max contracts are precisely the problem. Tobias Harris and Anthony Davis got basically the same contract lol. Same with Embiid and Wiggins, Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray, etc."
Jrue is averaging 16 points 4 rebounds and 5 assists on 48/38/80  Harris is averaging 20 points 7 rebounds and 3.6 assists on 51/41/90  Tobias is better this season

Right. Philly never gets who they want. Unless it’s Jimmy Butler. Or Tobias Harris.
I mean tobias harris.

Stu got more hype for the Tobias Harris game winner than the national TV crew too when the Sixers faced the Lakers at WFC
I feel like Randle slots in around Tobias Harris. Up or down a few.
"Crickets? Siakam deserved it over Tatum. I’ve written that in previous comments. I’m not gonna keep repeating it for you lmao  &gt; it’s just an objective observation that Harris as scoring option &gt; Siakam as scoring option  It’s a stupid opinion and you’re gonna be laughed at every time you say it lmao  You don’t even have knowledge to see how one is a 3rd option and the other actually is the 1st option and has had much better success than Tobias. Siakam even won a title as 2nd option   You are a clown bro. I’ve seen you before crying about raptors and I bet you don’t even believe the dumb shit you’re typing, you just trolling lol. Done wasting time."
Tobias Harris is the Lebron James of Jeff Greens
"Is that crickets I hear about Siakam vs Tatum?.... yes I think it is.   You’re a clown man lol I’m not crying about anything, nothing about this conversation directly relates to my team or players, it’s just an objective observation that Harris as scoring option &gt; Siakam as scoring option, and Tatum &gt; Siakam overall.   I think you might want to gain a little more self awareness before accusing others of crying lol I can literally feel your tears from here.  PS: half this thread said Tobias, learn to read. There are arguments for each but don’t like it’s that hot of a take...Harris is better this season, simple as that."
Yeah see but pascal without kawhi was also an All-star and second team All-NBA so you’re just talking out your ass tbh meanwhile tobias harris has underperformed in all three of his playoff appearances
Tobias Harris in shambles
And besides that point i also just said that he contributes so who cares if you feel we has second or third most important what has Tobias harris done in the playoffs?
"Tobias ""Patriot"" Harris"
Okay so its not about fame its about basketball so we can put that aside.   Obviously Russel is better than Draymond I chose an extreme example. So you think it should be some combination of where they rank as overall players and where they rank as offensive options. I'm still not sure I get what the point of treating it this way instead of saying Draymond was a bigger driver of the Warriors success than Klay that you so he is the 2nd best player and 2nd banana.   I think a lot of 2nd bananas have been great defensive players. If you thought Donavon Mitchell was the best player on the Jazz would Mike Conley be the 2nd banana? That just seems odd to me. Is Tobias Harris the 2nd banana on the 6ers?
"I mean no need to be defensive, I understand its a player on your team and you have to be blindly loyal, but no Siakam doesn't have the skill set to be the #1 option, where have you been these last two seasons?  You can argue Tobias isn't a better overall player because I still think Siakam is a better defender...but he is a much more well rounded shooter and doesn't have the same limitations that Siakam does..I mean how many times he does he have to force that same spin move that everyone knows is coming before he starts adding new moves to his bag? He is a negative 3 point shooter too, where as Harris is a very strong 3 point shooter.  I don't see how this is that hot of a take...to a non-homer that is"
"&gt; .Siakam doesn't have the skillset to be the number 1 option, Harris is a versatile enough offensive player where he could be   dumbest shit I've ever heard  tobias has the skills to be the #1 option lmao"
"If he’s trying to prove it’s devoid of context, fine. Knowing the flair, it’s probably the opposite.  “I would take the guy who’s been the 2nd best player on a championship team over Tobias Harris” ≠ “I would take every 2nd best player on a championship team over someone that can’t claim that”"
What has Tobias Harris ever done?
I don’t think any of those guys are over/underrated.   I.e. I think they get the proper amount of love and attention.   Westbrook is Westbrook. He’s had a stellar past few games but has been inconsistent this year and the early part of the year wasn’t doing so hot.  Kleber has intangibles but it doesn’t matter what you provide if it doesn’t show up on a stat sheet.. his 3p% is great on decent attempts per game. His defensive rating is ok-ish and his offensive rating is alright. His per 36 is worse this year than last year so take that for what you will.  Rudy Gobert is neither over or underrated. He’s a prototypical big that puts up DPOY level interior defense... that’s what he does not much else to say about it.   Demar Derozan.. if he added a 3 pointer to his repertoire he would be a killer. His draw foul on the drive game is incredible and he’s got the mid range down. But he’s not all nba.. yet.. he is too small and not a tank like Zion so he has to be crafty to get to the rim.. it would help him to be able to hit a 3 on 35% 3-4 attempts a game.   I agree with Tobias harris...  I think the most under appreciated players are almost always role players or borderline all star players on small market teams...  I.e. Brandon Ingram put up all star numbers this year but didn’t make the all star game. Same with de Aaron fox who got snubbed for all star reserves this year.
I don't really think anyone is planning schemes for Tobias Harris when MVP candidate Embiid is on the same team.
"FATE OF THE UNIVERSE ON THE LINE, I WANT **TOBIAS HARRIS**"
"&gt;Tobias has actually seemed like a really solid defender  This is true, and I can see your logic, but I'd rather have Ben than Tobi if I had to pick one. Three All Stars vs none for Harris, last year was a dumpster fire anyway but we were terrible against you guys in the playoffs without Ben."
"Bro you litterally maxed out Tobias Harris,Ben Simmons and Al Horford why you talking?"
Tobias Harris feeling some type of way. Been leaving Boban on read all day.

"The sixers were in such a great position to make them serious contenders every year for the next decade but they were so poorly managed that they ultimately turned all of those extra assets into tobias harris, thybulle, maxey, and seth curry.  They are one of the biggest ""what if"" teams ever."
Is that u Tobias Harris?
"Tobias Harris should have been an All-Star, should be All-NBA, and with Embiid’s absences he’s been the most important player on the 76ers."
"The Bucks actually could/should have had Klay too. They traded the 10th pick that draft and Corey Maggette for Steph Jackson and 19th pick (drafted Tobias Harris, whole different Bucks fck up). Bucks were rumored to be targeting Klay before the trade.   They probably don't get Giannis. Atlanta and Danny Ferry would have taken him 2 picks later. Bucks are likely better than Atlanta."
We ain’t trading Dame for anything less than Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and 2 -3 FRPS
Not zero chance but I wouldn't be surprised if they got swept. You need more than Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris as your best players in the playoffs.
I think it's unlikely that the Clippers trade Tobias Harris to the Sixers if LeBron is there. If they get Kawhi (which honestly is pretty realistic) then that team has a case as the GOAT but honestly just LeBron and Embiid doesn't sound better to me than LeBron and AD.
Tobias Harris is 20/7/3 on 55/40/88 shooting. Not sure if he is considered low key.

"They had jimmy and jj then who's gonna be jimmy for them this year? Seth curry? Tobias Harris? They still would have lost to the celtics even if they had Ben. Ben is trash in the playoffs, offensively anyway."
"If Simmons can actually score (&gt;22 ppg) against the relatively bad nets defense, then I think sixers have a good chance of winning. If he scores like 12 ppg I could see them losing in 5   Everybody talks about embiid dominating the nets but I really think it’ll largely come down to whether Tobias Harris and Simmons can actually score efficiently in the playoffs"
Dray is not the lead ball handler on the warriors and played with the two greatest shooters of all time. Simmons is the sixers lead ball handler and in the playoffs that becomes an issue. If you then change his role who handles the ball? They don't have jimmy anymore so who else is there? Seth curry? Tobias Harris? If thats your other options then you have a problem.
"PG-13 does for sure, he's at 46 games played right now so he's probably in that Butler/Tatum territory.  It'll depend on how these last 10-15 games go for the final couple spots.  I could see Randle &amp; Zion as the 2nd team forwards when it's all said &amp; done, with Bron/Tatum/Butler/PG-13/Tobias Harris in the mix for 3rd team."
"26/11/9 as the core of the offensive system, with staggering injuries to core teammates including his main partner out for the rest of the season, same record as the Sixers, played all games and in the West.  30/11/3 with All D 1st team is nice but 19 missed games, with a DPOY candidate as a teammate and arguably the best non-Nets offseason team changes. Whether people like it or not, Glenn Rivers is a good coach, DG Seth Dwight are good acquisitions and Tobias Harris has been a beast this season.    Sixers are winning a lot but it's not as much of a carry job by Embiid as it is by Joker."
Of course  Now what we can get for him is a question. Absolute best case scenario is KP or Tobias Harris.
Tobias Harris is the obvious one for both sides if philly flames out
Tobias Harris 😈
"Tobias Harris. Add in a first or something if you want  76ers have always needed a guard so they can run a proper PnR, Blazers need a SF that isn't trash on one end or the other"
"I count AD, Sabonis and KP as 5s, Tatum as a 3.     Giannis   Durant   Randle   Zion   Hard one - it's either Siakam or Tobias Harris. Probably Harris because he's more efficent and I am a 76ers fan lol"
Why don't I see Tobias the muthafuckin closer Harris
"Tobias Harris on teams choosing not to double him down the stretch: “If you want to stay on the island with me, I’m going to be the one to get Boban's heart first … whatever hell that means.”"
"Westbrook. Dude has been in bottom five playoff ""stars"" (including guys like Tobias harris) for the past 2 years. Don't see it changing."
"Nets will grab the first seed. Everybody gets healthy by the playoffs and they will coast to the finals.  Hilarious the delusional kids here trying tp hype up Philly as real threats.  Like they didnt learn last year after downplaying Lakers all year and Lebron dicked the league.  Picking Embiid, Tobias fucking Harris and ghost Simmons over KD, Harden and Kyrie LMFAO"
Congrats on smoking our world beating lineup of Tobias Harris and Danny Green lol. You funny bro
"Don't let the lack of Embiid and Simmons distract you from the fact that Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard are all playing in this game."
tobias harris is incredibly limited as a no. 1 option
How has tobias harris regressed towards the mean when he hasn't been playing?
Cj for tobias harris straight up
"Tobias Harris. never was the man on a team, bounced around the Magic, Bucks, Clips, 76ers, Pistons, never an all star"
"Assuming Harden doesn’t go the 76ers, they’re a tough matchup. Allen/buyouts aren’t really slowing down Embiid.   Simmons, Thybulle, Danny Green, Tobias Harris is an excellent lineup against solid role players. I don’t have that much faith in LeVert to be the difference maker  If the 76ers got Harden, I would favor them. Harden surrounded with shooters and an Embiid down low is a very scary team because they’d have no weaknesses at all"
Tobias Harris isn’t the MIP?! Absolute disrespect
"Okay hes not top 10 either doesn't change my point, you're trying to argue the lead ball handler on a middling offense for every season he's played his a top 10 playmaker (including this season).  He's playing with one of the best scorers and an extremely efficient floor spacer in tobias harris.  He's got shooting at all positions and 6ers have a worse offrtg than the Raptors...    Yeah no I'm not buying this ""Simmons is a top 10 playmaker"" non-sense."
"Jokic is the MVP but they were being a bit disingenuous by not mentioning Tobias Harris, the Sixers second leading scorer, was out for two of the 3 games they lost.   You also need to consider quality of opponent. Suns and Bucks are both better than any team the Nuggets have beaten during their stretch without Murray."
"2 of the last 3 games were without Tobias Harris and Simmons, and the Sixers were integrating new players (George Hill, Anthony Tolliver) playing against Nuclear Curry, the Suns, and the Bucks on the 2nd half of a back-to-back. As someone who watches every Sixers game I can tell you that without a doubt Embiid is our most valuable player."

is tobias harris playing
"His haters expect him to play on Kawhi's tier because he got paid, but he still makes less than Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love, and &lt;$1m more than Steven Adams."
"I'm really not sure, but you'd wanna be looking at this list of forwards - the goal is tobias Harris  The plan would be to trade CJ for a forward and re-sign Norm back and have him be the 2 instead, as hes a much better fit next to Dame  I'd honestly be down for wiggins and Wiseman, though that's controversial and riskier"
"A forward would be the idea. Tobias harris was the name always thrown out, but he's been great this season"
"And let's just say you get by them, you've got Joel waiting for you in the middle. Sheesh.   That being said, Tobias Harris gonna have a loooooooong playoffs on that end cause teams are targeting him 24/7"
"Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Fred VanVleet, Gordon Hayward, Jerami Grant, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler  There were a lot of really good snubs. Tobias Harris isn't clearly ahead of that pack. Trae Young should have been next up if anything."
If FVV can’t make it there’s no way a bum like Tobias Harris can
If you pair him with Ben Simmons they’d be unstoppable defensively.   Then they could try to get Tobias Harris to add 3pt shooting and shot creation.
"When has Joel showed up more than Giannis lmao? He had Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons and couldn’t beat the Raps."
"&gt;When Thompson played earlier this year, Embiid put up 42 and 38.   And both games were still within 3 points in the final 5 minutes despite Boston not having Tatum for either.  ""Who will guard Embiid?"" has always been the Philly question. Boston is 8-1 in the playoffs without ever providing an answer.   Embiid will do Embiid's thing. We have no one who can stop him, he's incredible.   Our approach has never been about stopping Embiid it's about playing well against a team that really has no one else besides Embiid. Ben and Tobias can be slowed in the playoffs. Danny and Seth are mostly C&amp;S guys scoring single digits atm.   A big step in that direction is being able to play certified NBA talent like Thompson over guys like:  * Kornet - An okay 3rd stringer * Wagner - We just waived him  * Tacko - A G-League player who's legitimately had 1 good game in 2 seasons    Does playing Danny Green over Dakota Mathias mean you can suddenly lock down James Harden?   No, but having a capable player on the floor who understands his role does help your team play a lot better overall. Which is why the earlier games with Thompson were closer even though we were missing Tatum.     &gt;And sure Fournier is a good bench scorer but do you really think adding him would have made much of a difference  Minus the rebounds, he's pretty much averaging Tobias Harris' numbers for the season on a similar efficiency.  Yeah, I think once he's brought into the roster properly (which should be soon) he'll be a pretty big addition."
Randle improving is related to the coaching though. That's like saying Tobias harris improved this year which is why Doc isn't better than Brett brown  - it's because Doc was there that he improved that much.   Also they had Morris and Portis last year who are pretty good players
"Let me gets this straight, you think Embiid was better 3 years ago, that Tobias Harris now is worse than Dario Saric back then, that JJ Redick is a better ball handler than Seth Curry, and that Amir Johnson is better than Dwight Howard? I have more questions, but those stood out the most"
"yeah, TJ’s a good one. without looking at specificstats, tobias harris and brook lopez also come to mind."
True but I think the sixers think Embiid is a bit of a timebomb with all his injuries so I wouldn't be suprised if they were willing to do it. It's a shame too cause I think Simmons could be useful next to Embiid if they had another high level guard to handle half court creation but instead that money went to Tobias Harris (who is a good player but not really what they need imo) who they almost certainly won't be able to move unless they attach a bunch of picks
"Haha yea of course, I’m talking about a championship team though ;) that’s what you want the Nuggets to be right?                                                Look at Philly. They have two all stars (like y’all) and then they maxed Tobias Harris, but I’ve only heard bad things about that move. They’re still hardly in contention and then they couldn’t win with Butler and lost him.                                                       Imagine if they’d had Simmons, Embiid, Butler, and then all that cap space to sign someone else. Would Butler have still left for the Heat?                                        Flexibility is important. If you sign MPJ to 4 years and it turns into an overpay you won’t be able to move on from him until Jokic is 30. He would make or break you. Denver medical staff would need to have no concerns."
"&gt; he'll have a cap hit of $38m in 2023/2024  With the cap in '23-'24 being predicted to be around $119.2 million, $38m for a good second guy is really not a problem. He'll still be on the right side of 30. I'd be more worried about guys like Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Tobias Harris, Draymond Green, Gordon Hayward, etc. who all have big contracts the same lenght as Siakam's but who are older."
"Sixers strategy works when you have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. Those two are big, long, and fast enough to fight over the screen and guard the shooter.  Durant, Harris, Harden, Irving, and Shamet are all good shooters but no Steph Curry. Their release is slower compared to Curry, so Simmons and Harris will get there in time."
"Defended by ***just*** Kevon Looney though?  It seemed like he was aggressively double-teamed every single time he touched the ball.  Embiid did his best to pass out but without Tobias Harris and Simmons he had force some offense of his own that he normally wouldn't, and the players around him weren't quite in sync in terms of getting to the right spots when the double team came."
What do you want him to say there? I could be Tobias Harris if I'm lucky?
"The Sixers sat Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris yesterday against the Warriors for an undisclosed illness and knee soreness, respectively.  I fail to see the difference."
"What? Sixers in 2019 got Jimmy Buttler, Tobias Harris and were overall a way better team than in 2018.  2018 east was wack."
Imagine they had Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons.
Tobias Harris*
[A warriors broadcaster is saying](https://twitter.com/warriorsvox/status/1384275128452669445) Simmons is also inactive. [Doc has already said](https://twitter.com/KyleNeubeck/status/1384262403240562701) no Tobias Harris tonight.
"But Seth is [questionable](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-tobias-harris-seth-curry-dwight-howard-questionable-warriors).  C'mon basketball, Gods. Give us the sibling rivalry matchup we need."
Lol Joel Embiid alone is not gonna be enough to beat such a powerhouse Nets team. Your second best scorer is Tobias Harris and your second best overall player would be the fourth best player on the Nets.
Also just had Danny Green and Tobias Harris vs Jeff Green and Joe Harris
"That's how the financials of the NBA work though, if they let him walk there is no way to replace his value (other than if they happen to draft someone just as good).    That's why the Sixers are paying Tobias Harris, or the Lakers will probably have to overpay Dennis Schroder."
"Sixers missed Tobias Harris, Dwight, Seth Curry and George Hill in these games. Embiid willed the team to win"
That’s true but neither did Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton. Denver’s not a big market so he’s likely getting maxed
Tobias Harris
Jrue Holiday or Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris
"3 things. Ja just needs to keep being Ja and also get better in a couple areas. Get JJJ back and cooking. And then the last one and this is the tough one, I think they need one more scorer that is a clear upgrade over their current wings like Brooks/Anderson/Allen etc.   Don’t get me wrong I like all three of those players. They are good pieces for Memphis. But they are a notch below the caliber of player that I think they need to go to the next level. Like i keep picturing Memphis with Ja, a healthy JJJ, and plug in this 2021 version of Tobias Harris. That’s a team that can contend. That’s the type of caliber guy they need to find."
All that for Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons to turn into Chandler Hutchinson and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson in the playoffs
"We're more down on Terry Stotts than any individual player right now. I'd probably have a better opinion of Melo and Kanter if we had a coach that would limit them to the match-up dependent role players that they are instead of making them a featured part of our rotation.   I've never been a trade CJ guy (unless a great trade comes along obviously) but now that we've acquired Norman Powell, it just doesn't make sense to have CJ anymore. Re-sign Norman for 20-25M per year next season (CJ for reference makes fucking 30M+), and trade CJ for something else. Whether it's a Tobias Harris/Harrison Barnes swap, or a young dude (Deandre Hunter would be a dream) + expiring's/draft picks, it just doesn't make sense to have him anymore now that we have Norm (who has plus plus measurables as a defensive 2).  In an ideal world we trade CJ for some kind of a forward, fire Terry, let Melo/Kanter expire into the sunset, Zach Collins accepts his QO, DJJ opts into his 2nd year and we re-sign Norman Powell to a 4 year 20-ish million dollar long term deal."
"Ignoring Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, the Nets, either Lowry or Siakam, and the fact that Suns, and Jazz aren't considered contenders by anyone."
"Schroder isn’t in the top 10 lol so idk where you got that  He’s been a good defender but the top ten are Gobert (100.9), Simmons (105.6), Capela (105.8), Giannis (106.4), Jimmy (106.9), Randle (106.9), Ayton (107.1), Danny Green (107.2), Tobias Harris (107.3), and Kuzma (107.4)  I’ve said that he is comparable to Rose &amp; Clarkson in terms of the spark plug role. He is a better defender than I thought but no need to gas it up more than it is"
Brandon Ingram plays really similar to Tobias Harris
Harris don’t diss Tobias like that
"I am a die hard fan of Porzingis. I hope he doesn't get injured before the playoffs ends for the Mavs. I just kind of want him to work on his game. Been a fan since 2015, never miss his game and here we are, watching him with 2 knee surgeries already at the age of 25. I still believe in the guy, when he has a healthy off season, he switch into another gear the following season. Back in 2017, when KP was a little bit chubby, I thought that was his best body type and add a little bit more weight and he will bully everyone. But yeah acl tear happened. I had hope last year that he's going to be very good this season but another major knee injury happened. I don't know why people are too reactionary, the Mavs didn't made a mistake trading for him, everything was going right until the meniscus tear. Anyways, I am still going to root for my favourite players even if they become the subject on social media.   Story aside, Tobias Harris. But maybe KP soon let's see after this season, still have hopes for him."
I do not want to invest 1/3 of my cap into Tobias Harris and I’d bet you anything Oubre does not get a 20 m + contract
Tobias Harris.
Embiid or Tobias Harris   hmm
Yeah I’ll take Nikola jokic or AD or Embiid over khris Middleton or tobias Harris... 25/10 isn’t exactly mvp big numbers
I’ll take current Luka over Simmons with a jump shot let alone Luka with great defense    Assuming the jump shot Simmons is getting is  like Tobias Harris level and not Stephen Curry level
"What about Simmons, Milton, Maxey and Seth Curry? Possibly even Tobias Harris."
"Makes sense. Seen this before with Tristan Thompson and the Cavs, and with Tobias Harris and the Sixers."
"If I'm the FO, I don't think I want to risk ending up with another Wiggins/Tobias Harris for years. Maybe figure out a way to save that cap space for future allstar free agents."
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
You don't have to put much effort into slowing down Ben Simmons. Tobias Harris is the Sixers' second best scorer. The Nets are just gonna torch them. Joel Embiid post-ups aren't gonna beat the Nets lmao.
"Keep in mind, the wizards are missing 2 starters in Thomas Bryant and Deni Advija.     If Beal wants to be a Wizard for life .. you can just wait out Westbrook's contract.    - Next 2 years you make the playoffs to build a winning culture.  - Summer 2023 Westbrook's contract is up and Hachimura would be due for an extension. You have the cap space the sign a max player.   - Beal will be 30 going in the 23-24 Season, so still in his prime.   - Hachimura would 25 with a couple more years to develop. His offense is decent right now, and his 3pt shot has been improving. He can make a Tobias Harris like leap. His defense does need a lot of work.   - Advija will be 22. He showed glimpses of being a solid role player this year, he was in his rookie year with a terrible coach. With a decent coach he will develop into a good player. He's got good fundamentals and just needs to work on his 3pt shot.    - Thomas Bryant will be 26. He's a really good offensive center. He's shot 40% from 3 the last couple years. His defense is bad though and something he'll need to work on. Gafford is the opposite of Bryant .. good at everything Bryant is bad at ... but both play with high energy.     - The big question would be whether or no they could get another big piece with the max contract slot. Last time it didn't work when Beal got his first extension ( spent a max slot on Ian Mahinmi, Andrew Nicholson, and  Jason Smith)."
"I think it's definitely fair to have an abstract feeling that players should work hard to try to live up to their contracts - having a responsibility towards their team to not chew up so much cap and tank the team's hopes of being competitive. I think Tobias Harris definitely looked in the mirror this off-season and decided that he wasn't gonna hold the team back, and I really respect him for that. But on the flip side, I think it's a lot of external pressure on a player and it's not necessarily their fault if they don't live up to it. I mean, if a team pays a player 50% more than they've ever made before, is it fair to expect them to play 150% better?"
Give me Tobias Harris &gt; Thaddeus Young
"I love Jimmy buckets but he played out of his mind in the bubble. He wasn't going to repeat that. He couldn't get a 76ers team in 2019 with Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, JJ Reddick and himself past the Raptors. That team was absolutely stacked and Jimmy was a force but he's not a guy who can lead championship teams."

There’s no bias involved. There’s no doubt that Tobias Harris has been a better overall player the past 2 seapns
"The last 2 seasons, Tobias Harris has absolutely been a better player than Siakam.   Would still take Siakam long term, but Harris just had a .512/.394/.892 season. I’d be shocked if Siakam ever sniffs that efficiently while scoring at the same level."
"You better shatter those records against the Celtics.  It'll be a little tougher against Simmons, Embiid, Thybulle and Green.  Even Tobias Harris has turned himself into an above avg defender."
Tobias Harris &gt; Pascal Siakam
"Ben has scored more every single season than Rondo has in his best season. Not sure what the point of including that line is lol  Alongside Embiid, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, etc"
Dwight Howard is a 5 and Tobias Harris is a 4
Tobias harris is better then jimmy butler lmao
Tobias Harris about to poop on the court against the nets
Tobias Harris with doc is just different
Why do I feel like Tobias Harris has been on the 76ers for at least 4 years? He fits so well. It just feels right.
Y'all would have won a title if Tobias Harris didn't go 2-13 from three in Game 4 when y'all were up 2-1. Dude was fucking selling that series.
This is such a comedic level of bias. When the 76ers sweep the Wizards does that somehow become proof that Tobias Harris is a better player than Bradley Beal?
Tobias harris has scored two points less then jimmy even tho jimmy has played four games and Tobias has played two. Clearly a bubble fraud and I rather have Tobias over jimmy
Tobias harris is better then Jimmy but no one wants to say it
uhh...this is certainly bad but tobias harris isn’t leading a team anywhere lol
Imagine this sixers starting lineup:  Ben Simmons  Seth Curry  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  Would be unbeatable
"If people consider guys like Tobias Harris or CJ stars he's a straight up star, not a borderline star."
He's so good. Can't believe people thought Cj McCollum and Tobias Harris were better than him
No they aren’t lmao. No team with Ben Simmons as its only good ball handler and Tobias Harris as its second best half court offensive player is a legitimate contender.
I mean yeah Tobias Harris and guys like him went off vs us. Embiid vs Jokic always been dominated by Jokic
"Rondo’s a solid bench option in the playoffs as shown last year, but compared to others contenders whose third best player is Kyrie, Middleton/Jrue, Schroeder, Kyrie, Tobias Harris... it just absolutely does not compare.  I think it’s crazy that people have championship expectations for the Clippers based on their roster construction. Kawhi is incredible but his team of Lowry, Siakam, FVV, younger Ibaka, younger Gasol was just so much better and deeper."
People sleepin on Tobias Harris.  Smdh
Think doc is a great fit in philly solely for the fact that he can bring the star out of Tobias Harris. Has he learned his lesson of post season adjustments? We shall see
Is the KP contract the new Tobias Harris contract? He just fucking disappears
50-Piece McNugget - Tobias Harris
CJ for Tobias Harris
i think a better trade is cj for tobias harris
"Kawhi has been riding his defensive reputation for a long time now. He’s still incredible one on one but he routinely falls asleep off ball, makes poor defensive reads, and generally plays with pretty low effort on the defensive end these days.  Even in Toronto we would actually hide him a lot during the playoff run. He was guarding JJ Reddick down the stretch against the Sixers, when the other 4 guys were Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and Joel Embiid.  I really don’t think he has it in him to be a stopper for an entire game"
Lol and Tobias Harris is a Long Island native
I'm not sure Tobias Harris is clearly better than Bam but agree with your overall point.
"Sixers won't trade Tobias Harris, PG is probably the best player that you can trade if Clippers lost in 1st round"
Trade cj for any similar contracts like tobias Harris or pg. they need a proper 2nd option who can defend. Get a fucking backup for nurkic.. what a dumb move to let kanter be the backup. Absolutely destroyed by Jokic
"&gt; he's on one of the worst contracts in the league.   Dude's overpaid, but he's at least productive.  But yeah, that contract's massive, and is going to be tough to move for anything resembling equivalent value.    I guess in theory you could try and dump it, but even then I don't think it's open up that much cap space.    &gt;I've always wanted a Tobias Harris trade  Yeah, dude would be nice on your roster.  Obviously would be a huge risk, but someone like Otto Porter would probably be worth the risk for you guys.    I guess you guys are just down to hoping Kawhi opts out and decides he wants a S&amp;T to Portland for whatever reason lol"
"I actually don't think CJ has positive value; he's on one of the worst contracts in the league. One of the most overrated guys league wide - just hoping other teams don't know that lol.  I've always wanted a Tobias Harris trade, but he had to play super well this season and make that tough"
"Tho we all didn't realize it at the time, it was a good move that the Sixers maxed out Tobias over Jimmy.  Butler is looking like all those minutes and injuries are finally slowing him down while Harris is balling out all season and is just lethal so far in the playoffs."
"If you morph ben simmons and tobias harris into one human being, that's kinda like lebron"
Middleton and Tobias Harris both super nice and underrated second options
"What am I hating on? The fact that the 76ers achieved literally nothing? Y’all have Tobias Harris, Embiid and Ben Simmons. No reason why that roster shouldn’t have already won a chip lmao"
"I mean, that's kinda over-looking the small detail that EVERYBODY on the Heat was out while Jimmy was out. So was Dragic. We were playing the likes of Gabe Vincent and Max Strus gigantic minutes. It's harsh to just fault Bam, as I don't think Simmons would have won a lot if Tobias Harris and Seth were also out.   I don't think Bam will ever be a superstar OR capable of leading an offense. But he can be a DPOY-caliber player who can get you 18-20PPG with the right offense. We don't have that offense at the moment."
Yeah for like.   Tobias Harris type best case.  We don’t really have picks.    So unless there is a type of player that has skills more needed as a third in the jrue/giannis convo I’m not sure it’s be really worth it.    The three and d on Middleton as a second/third best player is kinda ideal I feel like
Tobias Harris ain't no joke either.
i didn’t think tobias harris was capable of making quick decisions
I think anyone with eyes can see that Tobias Harris is a much better basketball player than Jae Crowder is.
"I mean I guess if instead of putting Joel Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Tobias Harris (all great shooters) we just put five Ben Simmons' out there."
Pretenders. They just can’t score well enough to keep up with better teams. They have no good half court ball handlers and I don’t trust Tobias Harris to be the best perimeter scoring threat.
"&gt; “It didn’t motivate me because what I did in the first game, my guys are feeling it,” Simmons added. “Tobias (Harris) was scoring, Joel’s (Embiid) scoring. That’s the point of basketball right? People who have it going, you got to give them the ball. I’m not surprised Doc said that because Doc knows the game. A lot of these people who are saying that have never even touched a basketball or never played the game at a high level.”"
lmao you're acting like brooks will make any adjustments at all... we'll continue to start raul neto on tobias harris and alex len on joel embiid.
what kinda odds do you think i can get on a Tobias Harris Finals MVP
"And what’s worse is that the Wizards start 3 guards (Neto, Russ and Beal) so he has to guard 6’9 Tobias Harris all game"
"Wdym, yall got tobias harris right?"
"I agree that the Clips kind of sold their soul to get Kawhi and PG. They had such a promising mix of young talent and good veterans like Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and JaMychal Green. I was so disappointed they traded away Tobias Harris, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Landry Shamet. That 2018 team was awesome to see, it felt like those young OKC and Warriors teams before they found real postseason success.   They technically replaced them all pretty well on paper, but they lost a lot of chemistry in the process and I don't think Kawhi and PG have been a great fit in personality or leadership.  If things blow up this year which I'm kind of hoping they do, I'd be excited to see how they can refresh with Mann, Kennard, Zubac and others. They have pieces where they won't be a dumpster fire like the post-LeBron Cavs, but who knows what happens."
I mean can you imagine Steph playing alongside Jrue and Khris? Or Simmons and Tobias Harris? Or AD and Caruso? Or Durant and Kyrie? My man is playing with Wiggins and Looney.
"I don’t think Kemba is bad, I just don’t think he’s a star. He’s overpaid but you had to do something, similar to Tobias Harris prior to this season.   fwiw I always talk smack about Tatum, I genuinely don’t think he has ‘it’. A damn good player, but he will never be the guy on a championship team, which is fine, but I get tired of the constant dick sucking when he has a good game vs the lack of criticism when he has a bad game. Either treat him like a superstar on both occasions with the compliments and criticism or never."
"u underestimate the power of role players.  if they can find solid role players like tim hardaway jr type people, hell ya.  PG is a good player but he’s not a team player no is he great anymore as he gets older.  they will dump him like blake for solid pieces  blake fetched tobias harris , boban, avery, and picks — u don’t think clippers won that trade in the end?  clippers just need to find a desperate team (kings) willing to part pieces like Fox and some role players for PG lol  teams desperate want superstars to fill seats and PG can still fill seats"
"PG for Tobias Harris and a 1st, who says no"
He’s worth having around just for being a Tobias Harris whisperer. Sixers are just stupid nasty when Tobias is on his game.
Clippers can I interest you in a properly paid and underrated Tobias Harris for Kawhi?
I'm used to Tobias Harris being referred to as J Cole and got very confused.
"Harris is mentioned on the front page twice. We know about him, well, it's Tobias and Shaq - and then a user has Gary Harris flair. So, yeah, we all know about this Harris character...."
"Sixers and I don’t think it’s even close, there defense will take a hit, but an offense featuring one of the best young scoring point guards and arguably the best center in the league along with Tobias Harris coaches by Doc Rivers? That team would be *very* good."
If we kept that 2018 team + made the correct draft choices:  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Donovan Mitchell - Devin Booker - Tobias Harris - Andre Drummond
neither give me tobias harris over both
"Butler was the best player on the 76ers when he played for them  That raptors series they lost, jimmy was the only 76ers player who could score down the stretch in games.  Simmons didn't want to shoot of course, Embiid wasn't that great offensively, Tobias Harris was OK but he was scared of shooting and also he got a lot better since butler left  The only reason kawhi could even hit that miracle game 7 shot was because butler kept the 76ers in the game and the series"
Didn't everyone in /r/NBA call Tobias Harris the worst contract in the league a few months ago? What changed? Is he now suddenly worth his contract?
"Incoming "" Is Tobias Harris the new Micheal Conley?"" threads"
You have one too Scott Brooks and his name is Beal. 76ers will trade Harris for Beal in a heart beat if they can they will do it so fast Morey probably dress like a uber driver to give Tobias a ride to the airport
"How bad the sixers were in the playoffs last year should back up every aspect of my claim. Embiid was a beast, Brown didn’t know how to use Harris at all and Simmons was out.  I always tell the Celtics fans that the real key to defeating the sixers is never letting Ben into the game. If you can suppress him and just let Embiid eat, you can win. It’s a lot harder now that Doc has got Tobias going so well so he’s the second priority. Don’t even bother trying to stop Embiid. Let him feast.  When Simmons is passive and shut out, the ball stops flowing well, the defense is still stout but not producing as many turnovers (Thybulle is good but disadvantages you on offense a bit) and there isn’t as much of a transition game because of the lack of turnovers and having someone like Simmons to run it. I think they are a good fit if the players around them are correct, I’ve never been someone who said to break them up. If the players around them are wrong, then it’s a disaster but that’s true of a lot of stars. In Boston and last year with the clippers, a lack of facilitation causes stagnation in our offenses because we don’t have the right people around our wings like we used to (Horford, Hayward)."
"As long as Tobias is scoring, the Sixers don’t really need Ben to be what r/nba thinks he should be. He facilitates, creates offense from defense and is a monster in transition. That’s great when the other two (Embiid, Harris) are doing what they do."
"His loyalty to Cj is seriously a bummer.. if 76ers wants to trade Tobias Harris, blazers really need to do it. Even with a pick involved."
"Well we average the least turn overs per game, so not really sure how that's predictable. The reason why we are so low in turnovers is cause we play an iso heavy offense that keeps the ball in our best players hands. Teams that play motion heavy offenses with lots of ball movement tend to average more turn overs because you have players that aren't as skilled passers making passes more often. I do agree our defense has been trash and I think stotts shoulders most of that blame and we should split up CJ and Lillard. Lillard doesn't want them too though. Really was hoping we would try and trade CJ for Tobias Harris last year when he was having a bad year."
At least there was some logic to it by hoping A 23 year old Brandon Jennings could reach another level.   Opposite of the Tobias Harris for Blake Griffin trade the Pistons made a few years later.
"Bojan Bogdonavic, Tobias Harris, maybe even Gallo before he got a little washed?   Any 20 ppg scorer that can consistently hit 3’s really"
tobias harris
"Not Young, but shoutout to Tobias Harris shutting up the haters in Game 1 yesterday as well. With the right coaching staff and players around him, he can absolutely play at an all-star level, and live up to his contract. Tobi had 37 points yesterday, I think that topped everyone for game 1 round 1 unless I am forgetting someone."
"I mean true we cant assume he'd be worse or better than draymond  But I think its fair to assume hes probably worse than Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid right?  Becauze those are the guys whos shots he'd be taking"

... Tobias Harris lit up the Wizards and Dillon Brooks was the leading scorer for the Griz... But your point still stands.
Tobias harris
Tobias Harris has been terrible in the playoffs throughout his entire career outside of his most recent game. That game is most likely an outlier as well.  The game being very close was a pretty good sign.
Neither Simmons or Tobias are particularly tough playoff covers. Simmons' 6 points is a lot more repeatable than Harris' 37.  I'd favour the 76ers in this series but the Wiz will win a game or two.
You think Ben Simmons or Tobias Harris could lead this team to the playoffs without Embiid? I don’t think that’s even Emma question. They absolutely could.
That must mean Tobias Harris is a superstar too😳
This knicks team reminds me of our 2019 team before we traded Tobias Harris.
TOBIAS HARRIS   LOL
Been a tough one for Tobias “I’m an All Star” Harris
"DOC YOU ARE A HORRIBLE COACH! YOU HAVE TOBIAS HARRIS CAMPED IN THE FUCKING CORNER AND HAVNT FIGURE OUT HOW TO CALL A PICKNROLL WITH BEN/TOBI/EMBIID, YOU ARE TRASH, SIR."
I’m issuing an amber alert for Tobias Harris. He is missing and I am worried!!!!
also that tobias harris isn't gonna be reliable in the playoffs. 70 million in cap space going to 12 points on 4/14 shooting lmao
But you need Tobias Harris plus bench lineup.  You have to have it.  No other options.  It needs to exist.  Two all stars.  Can't stagger them.   That makes sense.
"""Tobias Harris signed a 5 year / $180,000,000 contract with the Philadelphia 76ers, including $180,000,000 guaranteed, and an annual average salary"""
They chose Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler
Is Tobias Harris ok?
Tobias Harris blows
Tobias Harris is sabotaging the 76ers.
"For all the complaints about Simmons, how does Tobias Harris only have 4 points?"
how does thybulle have more points than tobias harris
Ingles vs (Tobias) Harris
If John Collins is 6'9 then I'm about 6'2. He's smaller than Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons. Harris is listed at 6'8 and Simmons at 6'9. I can see now why he slid to the 19th pick.
Tobias Harris with 4 pts seems random af
"Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Clint Capela, John Collins, and Bogdan have all collided while diving for a loose ball at center court, exploding in a giant mushroom cloud. Wells Fargo Center has been reduced to rubble."
Tobias Harris has been so shit lately
Tobias Harris looks bigger than John Collins.
No  Edit: the Tobias Harris game
"Tobias Harris is kind of both of these. When he was playing on the Clippers people saw him as a 50/40/90 guy and thought he was a crazy shooter. Problem is he’s not really a high volume 3 point shooter and barely gets to the line. He gets a lot of his buckets in the mid range and post, he’s more of a traditional 4 that can step out from time to time.   On the flip he’s a terrific leader and has been pretty clutch for us this year. He also plays great team defense and is a great rebounder. Which usually gets overshadowed by the defense of our other guys and rebounding of Joel and Ben.   Bottom line he’s not really the player you think he is if you just see his stat line"
Seems like NBA Finals MVP will be between Joe Ingles or Tobias Harris.
collins is 23 in his 4th season and tobias harris is 28 is his 8th season and he is only a slightly better player. Speaking of Joel Embiid you know how many games he has missed due to injury?
"Arguably more important than Collins yes. Hunter can create his own shot and is an excellent wing defender. If he plays in this 76ers series things probably look much different since he can defend Tobias Harris, which no one else can do."
"CJ was playing at an all-star level before his injury, came back and immediately regressed into iso-heavy, mid-range contested jump shots. When his shot is falling, his ability to relieve pressure on your main guys and open the floor is great. When it's not falling, he is utterly useless. He'll continue to jack shots and his defense isn't all that great.  I think a 1:1 trade for Tobias Harris is the fairest trade for him. Maybe the Blazers throw in a pick."
Isnt def RTG based off stats and shot pct And HEAVILY Decided by who you guard stats can be misleading especially if Cam Reddish is Guarding Tobias Harris and Trae is Guarding Shake Milton :/  Put Cams DRTG around other wing defenders and actually watch some film and make a Informed decision
"Massively disagree and i'm a sixers fan. I havent missed a single game since well before tobias was acquired. You arent taking his contract into account. Tobias cannot be the highest paid player on the team while being ""the 3rd guy"". He's making top 15 player money. That nearly $40m contract couldve went to a bucket getting guard. That money wasnt given out by a single competent front office mind. If i'm doing anything, i'm trading tobias harris first. Properly surround your star big men with a star guard before keeping the higher priced/lower tier player aka tobias. His role is to score. He should be scoring 30points a night with that type of price tag. Say what you will about ben, but at least we philadelphians know hes giving us creation, length, defense, and the little intangibles."
"I think it depends on what your expectations are of Simmons.  We all knew coming out of college that he couldn't (or wouldn't) shoot, so the question becomes, what is a fair expectation of Simmons at this point of his career?  Personally, while I think if he developed a mid range jump shot and could shoot even &gt;70% from the line he'd be one of the five best players in the game, I'm satisfied with the skills he brings to the table.  I think a lot of the disconnect comes from the fact that 2nd best player does NOT always mean 2nd best scorer.  He's an exceptional playmaker and is able to create open looks for his teammates.  He's arguably the best perimeter defender in the NBA and can defend multiple positions.  He can get to the basket with ease (although his weak foul shooting often leads to him passing the ball back out).  He's just not who you want to count on as your #2 scorer.  In my opinion, Tobias Harris is borderline as your #2 scorer as he can get you a pretty consistent 20 points, but he'll very rarely get you that 30-35 point game.  I wish they would have kept Butler (honestly I wish they would have never traded for Butler in the first place, but that's another issue), and if the rumors of a disconnect between Butler and Brown are true, it was a huge mistake to choose Brown only to fire him a year later.  Anyways, I think it's fair stance to be disappointed in Simmons, but I also think that we need to value what he does contribute to the team.  I do strongly disagree with your last point though.  We don't award ROY based on how we think the player's career will turn out."
"I know you still have Tobias Harris, but last game, when Embiid was struggling. Isn't that the time Simmons at least take some pressure off Embiid? But since the Sixers know Simmons can't score, you're basically asking Harris to play like KD or Kawhi. lol."
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would’ve definitely made it on if he didn’t get injured, maybe he’d have replaced Beal"
The problem with Ben simmons as your second highest paid player is that Tobias Harris is your highest paid player.
"&gt;	Did he have Joel Embiid next to him to score for him? Or Tobias Harris averaging over 20?  You’re not getting the point which is that Embiid had an off night (and he’s injured) while ben had 10 **shot attempts**, made half of em and fucked up crucial free throws.   He’s a poor man’s Draymond green but a lot worse"
"Remember guys, don't let the highs get you too high or the lows too low.  For example, I thought I was disgusted with Tobias Harris. Then he had a good half and I thought he was ok.  But then he did Tobias Harris stuff ie nothing for the 4th quarter.  So the moral is Tobias Harris fucking sucks.  Wait what were we talking about?"
"That's not a problem for Tobias, he's the 3rd guy he's not supposed to step up and take over. Harris does exactly his job and does it well"
Did he have Joel Embiid next to him to score for him? Or Tobias Harris averaging over 20?
"Tobias Harris is as good as Middleton. Simmons is on the same tier as Holiday. What are you getting at?  Yeah, because you know you have no rebuttal to what I said because you lost the argument. Imagine defending Ben Simmons for his own offensive struggles, when he has great shooters all around him and the most dominant big man in the game to boot as well."
tobias harris!
I don't think either benefits. Ben Simmons and Zion won't fit well together. I hate to be the guy but the spacing would not be great. Also the Pels seem to want to make Zion more of a playmaker and Ben would kind of ruin that. And Brandon Ingram would be like another Tobias Harris on the 76ers. He can get buckets but they lose their best playmaker.
"If they manage to get passed the Hawks (which is no guarantee right now), I'd have them as the underdog against the Bucks as well as whoever emerges out of the west honestly, whether its Suns, Clips or Jazz. Not huge underdogs, but still not the favorite. Of course health is a major factor, and I always feel a bit queasy about Embiid with what they're asking him to do right now.   But yeah if they flop to the Hawks or even in the ECF I have a hard time seeing them not making some big changes this offseason. As things currently stand, with Simmons not improving, their best hope for winning is other teams getting worse. They can shift role players around and stuff, but with Embiid at 30 mil, Simmons at 33, and Tobias Harris (UGH) at 35 next year, they aren't going to be moving the needle enough to be a favorite next year, and need Embiid healthy and producing at an MVP level to even be a contender"
"Why do people say if a team were built around Ben and put in a Giannis-like role, he would thrive more? Ben this year has a near 50/40/90 shooter in Tobias Harris who can give you 20+ ppg. Seth Curry, an elite 3 point shooter shooting 45 percent from 3. Danny Green, who has revived himself back into a 40+ percent 3 point shooter on over 6 attempts a game. He also has Kormaz and George Hill, who are both near 40 percent 3 point shooters (Hill lead the league last year at 46 percent shooting). You say he needs a stretch 5, but Embiid is one of the best shooting big men in the league, as he is one of the best mid range scorers and shoots 38 percent from 3. Simmons has great shooters all around him. Better than Giannis. But even with an ideal roster built around him, and great shooters all around him , he still can't dominate a game or thrive in a Giannis-like role, because he lacks aggression and he is not skilled enough to consistently score.    The thing is, when Embiid misses long stretches during the regular season, Ben has the opportunity to shine and maximize his offense, but he never does. When Embiid was out for that stretch of games in the regular season, it was Tobias Harris who played out of his mind and mostly carried the 76ers. Ben, more or less, had the same offensive output he has always had."
At this point you can make a decent argument for Tobias harris being the second best player on the team.
"most want to win down the line  1. Atlanta Hawks 2. Los Angeles Clippers 3. Philadelphia 76ers 4. Milwaukee Bucks 5. Phoenix Suns 6. Brooklyn Nets 7. Utah Jazz  From the Southeast, then it's basically by players, I enjoy Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid/Tobias Harris more than the others."
"That pass was disgusting. But also, Collins pushed the fucc out of Tobias Harris on that offensive board."
What happen to Tobias Harris as their 2nd scorer if Embiid doesn't have his legs?
"I think JC could really thrive on a different team, he was playing well before Trae got there as well. Now, he's not a superstar talent, but he's probably something like a Tobias Harris-level piece, nice player who can bring the juice sometimes. Biggest thing John Collins does is bring energy and leadership."
"&gt;all players above him are PGs / SGs  Dillon Brooks is iffy so I'll give you that, but you think Tatum, Kawhi, and Tobias Harris are guards?"

Tobias Harris should be like Middleton is for the bucks.
Did Tobias Harris get stage fright or some shit??
Tobias Harris
"Tobias Harris is still a very good and very versatile offensive player. Curry isn’t a hack, either. They have options."
"No matter how the series ends, I never wanna see Tobias Harris and Seth Curry again holy shit."
"Trae and Bogdan only shot a combined 17-50, but still outscored Philly's star duo of ~~Embiid and Simmons~~ Tobias Harris and Seth Curry."
I’m hella surprised you don’t go to Tobias for that one. Embiid is pretty much exhausted and playing like shit and Simmons shouldn’t be touching the ball. Tobias and Seth are the only pure shot creators on the court rn and I’m living and dying by Harris and his ability
The a milk cart with Tobias Harris’ picture on it. He’s worse than playoff P. Hope he proves me wrong.
Tobias Harris had 16 pts in the first half. 4 pts in the second half. His lack of aggressiveness killing then sixers. Can’t count how many times he kicked it to thybulle a non shooter rather than taking it himself.
Sixers need Tobias Harris to get the ball and play.
Tobias Harris not in?
Prime Melo was like a poor mans version of Tobias Harris.
"Trash is awfully strong don't ya think? They're literally guarding him with 2 of the 5 best perimeter defenders in the league, and he still led you in points and assists in Game 2 and 3. Where's Capela? He is letting Embiid score at will and has missed approximately 500 layups this series. Where's Bogdanovic? If they're throwing Simmons at Trae defensively he should be able to score much easier. Tony Snell? He led the league in 3P% and has scored 0 points on 0/5 shooting in 21 minutes. Hunter and Reddish are hurt so Tobias Harris is scoring literally every time he touches the ball. His worst shooting performance so far is 58%.  To me Trae is the ONLY Hawk actually living up to his talent. Gallo and Collins are playing pretty good too."
Hi. My name is Tobias Harris and I am getting coached by Doc Rivers.  Hi. My name is Tobias Harris and I am not getting coached by Doc Rivers
TOBIAS JOHN HARRIS
"Tobias Harris is just so confident this season, look at his touch compared to last season  Even his jumpers look so casual and they hit, pure confidence shooting"
God those Tobi and Bobi goldfish ads had me thinking Tobias Harris was like 5’10” lmfao I’m an idiot
Tobias Harris a bucket
Deandre Hunter is the equivalent of Tobias Harris for y’all. Except he plays defense too
30+ for Embiid and Tobias Harris 20+ fanduel super boost is one of the easier decisions of the night. Hate the 50 limit.
"If you let Embiid stare at the rim and Capela on an island, Embiid is going to drop 50-60 points while foul Capela, Collins and Okongwu out of the game. Then the Hawks won't have any lob threats and rim protection. Single cover Embiid is suicide unless you have a player who can semi handle with Embiid so you have to make a plan or smart double team. Also, they don't have anyone who can guard Tobias Harris and he's cooking anyone who guards him. Hawks just have too many mismatches to deal with but Embiid is a much bigger threat than anyone so you need to send smart double team him anyway"
"When it comes to a guy who’s role it is is score, and he’s not a good playmaker or excellent defender.. yes. I’m talkin bout Tobias Harris, not Rudy Gobert"
Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris come close. Tobias only had 19 points in game 2 against the Wizards where he only played 23 minutes because the Sixers won by 25 and Joel got hurt in 4 of the Wizards series.
"This joke has been dead for a couple of years now lol Knicks haven’t made an awful signing since 2016 and all the ‘they’re gonna max Tobias Harris’ jokes turned out to be wrong, so yeah best to let this joke rest"
Tobias Harris is a better scorer than Ben and that’s it. Tobias doesn’t even think he’s a better player than Simmons lol
"It's a lesson I thought everyone learned after that WCW Sid Viscous Tin Foil Leg Crumple. But this NBA playoffs have been doing it relentlessly. Tobias Harris fell into a cameraman headfirst and was in some pain. So the cameraman who didn't get out of his way and keep him from hitting his head then ZOOMS IN ON HIS FACE. Tobias looks at the lens with a ""wtf"" and a teammate then steps inbetween him and the camera. Then the director switches cameras.  Fucking inhuman."
"Yeah the truth is no team is building a better roster.   Lakers, Bucks and Clippers already went all in and are out of assets.  Sixers could trade Tobias Harris I guess, and Warriros have a decent package but... Who they gonna get? Only stars that could be available are Beal and Lillard (pretty unlikely), and I don't think that puts anyone over the nets.   Curry and Lillard would be filthy tho"
"Lol relax. If Sixers get to the finals with any sort of Embiid on the floor it's 100% theirs to lose to the Suns.   They haven't come up against a legit top defense yet, Lakers don't count, they didn't have AD and when they did, the Suns were down 2-1.   Ben Simmon, Tobias Harris, and Mattisse are a different level to anything the Nuggets possess on that end of the floor."
"An interesting twist of fate that after starting his career with the Bucks, Tobias Harris could end up playing against them in the ECF. And vice versa for Jrue Holiday."
Deja vu: [Through 8 games in the playoffs Tobias Harris is averaging 24/9/4 on 60% true shooting](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ny9agq/through_8_games_in_the_playoffs_tobias_harris_is/)
Bro I get that but there’s teams when pippen is a 88 bens not a 88. Bens not even better than Tobias Harris.
"Probably Kyrie if all of the Nets are healthy. Simmons on Harden, Tobias Harris and the prayers of everyone in the Philly area would probably try to slow down Durant."
And tobias Harris. Also Toronto won it all with gasol and ibaka playing big minutes together.
Definitely needs to work on his on ball skills. His dribbling is subpar at best. He has no moves inside the arch outside of that little jump-hook and is at most able to take one dribble before initializing the shooting motion.   On defense he’s been pretty much late on every help and isn’t able to contain Tobias Harris at all. Right now I’d give him a &lt;20 mil. offer after the season.
I don’t. I’m already over the schticky horse shit.  I have been for awhile. We get it. You are tall and you are friends with Tobias Harris.
"It’s coaching. Look at Philly, specifically the improvement of Tobias Harris under Doc vs Brett Brown."
Right now he is not better than the following players imo: Embiid Jokic Cp3 Lebron Ad Kawhi Dbook Luka Trae Mitchell Gobert Tatum Kat Giannis Kd Kyrie Harden Butler Curry Dame Zion Beal Paul george is way closer to tobias harris than to kawhi rn and people dont realise that. He is not mvpg he was some years ago. He is also not playing defense at the level he played in his best seasons. Still a great player tho.
“If you broke and clownin a millionaire the joke is on you”- Tobias Harris
"Right so to summarize just hit shots, stop Embiid from getting to the line, scoring, and finding the open man, stop Tobias Harris, and stop Ben Simmons from doing the thing that he is best at.   But yea they're not getting shut down lmao"
trade for Tobias Harris
"2011 draft 3 team trade between CHA/MIL/SAC  https://www.espn.com/nba/draft2011/news/story?id=6697545  Nobody won this, when you factor in Milwaukee got nothing trading Tobias Harris"
"Doc Rivers just knows how to use Tobias Harris. Always catches the ball in the middle of the play now, rather than having to either take a late shot or create by himself like under Brett Brown."
He isn't the number 2 option. Tobias Harris is. Ben is the engine and facilitater.
"I'm probably biased but based purely on matchups I think the Sixers are the worst possible matchup for the Nets. Mainly because:  - We have two all-NBA level exterior defenders to hang with Kyrie and Durant. Of course those two are just so talented that they may go off anyway, specially KD  - The Nets have no possible answer for Embiid except throwing multiple guys at him, and Embiid has been punishing double teams with great passing in the playoffs.   - If the Nets decide to put Griffin on Embiid like they do with Giannis, Tobias Harris will exploit the fuck out of his matchup against a smaller Joe Harris or Brown  If Harden is out I guess we have a decent chance. If he plays then idk, just a very slim one praying that they choke"
"Took Reggie, Kennard, Tobias Harris, and Boban. Gave them Blake who swindled them a bit.   They got Saddiq Bey outta the deal though."
"You know, I thought jerami grant was nbd last year, but he was number one option every time he played for pistons. He would miss time, immediately come back and be featured as if he were Tobias Harris. That's where I think his trajectory is, and yes the nuggets are missing him."
"I was hiking the mountains when none other than LeFraud shows up. As I’m hiking up a cliff LeFlagrant PUSHES ME OFF THE FUCKING EDGE😾 He starts laughing while flashing his fraudulent Mickey Mouse rings. Luckily Tobias Harris saved me at the last second, defeating LeBootyCramps"
"Shoutout to Tobias Harris. We saw a glimpse of it when he was on the Clippers, but it seems like he finally put it all together now. Goes to show you have to give some players time"
Steady-ass Tobias Harris probably going for 20 again.
What is Tobias harris doing? He had young on him and wanted no part in shooting the ball smh
"Tbf it was Bey and he was literally a first team rookie. Hell half the last 19th picks in the last decade are prolly better picks than bagley. Huerter, Collins, Tobias Harris, Gary Harris, malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley."
"For the Tobias Harris trade, that pick turned into Shai Gilgeous Alexander, so yall still would’ve been fine  Hindsight is absolutely 20/20 tho"
"The best options were Tobias Harris and a late lottery pick or Ingram, a first ,and a bad contract. No matter what we were getting fucked with that trade."
"&gt;A better question would be “Jimmy Butler or Tobias Harris”   I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd actually legit take Tobias Harris over JB.   Actually, I take it back, I did meet one person. But they were convinced that last year, Butler's best days were behind him... He had his best career this season lol."
Tobias Harris for sexton would help both teams but sixers probably have to throw in something else
You didn’t even include tobias Harris..his own teammate  Idk why doc didn’t play shake in the playoffs. I might include shake Milton on this list
"The thing is:  Maxing Collins is a bad deal. Like Tobias Harris e.g. Anyone whos not a perennial allstar is a bad deal on a max. Im not saying Collins cant be, but I dont see it right now.  But not maxing Collins means we wont have anyone, since we're almost capped out. So Id rather max Collins and keep him, than not have anyone."
"Yeah I think Reddit is still on some 2019-2020 Tobias Harris shit.  Harris was great this year in the playoffs.  He afforded himself a couple rough games, and I personally have no qualms with the contract he has on his current production."
"**we are going to pay him**. hawks fans keep saying they dont think hes a max player... but that doesnt matter. if we werent going to sign him to an extension he would have been traded by the deadline.   also people on here seem to have little understanding of the salary cap and what contracts players get. theres people in this thread saying Gobert isnt worth a max. like wtf are you talking about. there is about 40 players who have 25+ million/yr deals. JC just outplayed tobias harris, and ben simmons and julius randle. He will get a 25+ million offer"
"That's like every team in the NBA since you're able to go over the cap to retain your current players, wether it's smaller market teams not wanting to let their stars go that they drafted and developed, or major market contenders who could have their pick of trade partners and free agents but still overpay to keep the guys who are currently up for extensions.   The Lakers tried to give Schroeder $84 million even though he's not remotely worth that, the Sixers gave Tobias Harris a max to be a 3rd option and average 19 points. There's maybe 20-30 guys in this league actually worth a max deal in a vacuum, but sometimes you have to overpay to keep a good player you can't live without. And I think the Hawks need Collins enough to overpay for him."
"When they had literal Blake Griffin on the roster? When they had Reggie Jackson, Tobias Harris, and Andre Drummond???  Yes. Absolutely. They just were really bad at it."
Tobias Harris is a perfect fit for the Cavs.  Sexton and Love perfect fit for the sixers.
What about Simmons and Tobias Harris for Lillard?
How do they feel about Tobias Harris? Lol
"I’m not sold on anybody on your roster not named Joel embiid. Ben Simmons is done dude, stick a fork in him, are you old enough to remember nick Anderson my nephew. Go back and look at those missed free throws and look how it affected his career after. Simmons is junk at this point. You guys rolled out to money for Tobias Harris and sometimes he looks good but he’s not gonna crack more than 20 pt avg the rest of his career. Nobody wants to play for Daryl morrey after that fiasco in Houston anymore.  You had a Chance at James harden but wanted to keep Simmons? Why hasn’t shake Milton blown up yet btw. Isn’t he suppose to be your best player off to bench.  Dude I’m sorry to tell you but embiid ain’t sticking around, he’s gonna leave just watch.   Best thing to do is trade Simmons and parts for CJ from Portland"
Maybe cause you have guys like Tobias Harris and possibly Curry depending on if the trade includes him.
"The Sixers could have brought back Harris, Butler, and Redick, no issue. They would have just had to pay the luxury tax at some point.  They also could have not traded for Harris and signed him in free agency while still keeping Butler and Redick.   The Sixers messed up a perfectly setup cap situation and lost all their best assets only to keep Tobias Harris after all of it."
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
Trading an unprotected first for the right to give Tobias Harris $190 mil is not some positive move to be bragging about. And hardly as if they couldnt have made that trade without that pick using something else instead.
Is Tobias Harris nothing?  I mean cause that’s who we traded that MIA pick for. Don’t know if you knew that
"“The Sixers are real contenders”  Yeah bro, the team with zero high level half court ball handlers and Tobias Harris as effectively their second what postseason player is a contender. Good one."
"I dont think it is  If they could unload tobias harris for CJ mccollum then we are cooking, but that seems less likely"
"I didn't say he was a scrub. He's probably been one of the best performers in these playoffs. Ignoring Trae, Durant etc. I've actually become a fan of him. But that doesn't change the point of discussion. Players like Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Khris Middleton, and Drue Holiday are proven stars across the league. Collins isn't. So they're under-performing while he is over-performing. Just because a guy puts up 20 points in the regular season, doesn't mean he's going to show up in the playoffs. Most guys don't. Espcially their first one."

"Yeah but DeAndre Hunter is gonna have the same argument in two years, having 3 max guys isn't ideal. And then the year after that Okongwu needs to be resigned and he's looked really promising so who knows there. This is the main reason why star power is better than depth in this league, Kevin Durant and Tobias Harris take up approximately the same cap space. If the minimum ability level to deserve a max contract is too low, superteams get easier to build because there isn't a financial difference between a superstar and a star. That favors big market teams that can attract superstar free agents."
"Kemba for John wall and a pick, kemba and a pick for Tobias Harris, kemba for Ben Simmons, kemba for porzingis and a pick. Reasons, -houston just want to save money this would be substantial before they transition out of tanking - Philly could either trade Tobias or Simmons depending on whether they believe Simmons can ever gain a jump shot and some killer instinct - Dallas could use kemba as a lower usage sidekick to remove some pressure off of doncic. None of these will happen this summer in my opinion but there aren't really better options for OKC at the moment. They'll likely keep him for a season before flipping his expiring contract for another rehabilitation project."
He's the Tobias Harris of coaches
There is this guy at Orlando that plays like Tobias Harris.. can’t remember his name
portland isn't doing tobias harris + some pick(s) for cj + roco lol
"Nah, they were always frauds. They have no real half court ball handlers and Tobias Harris is their second best scorer. They really should’ve beat the Hawks but lost, further exemplifying their fraudulence.   Nice inferiority complex though. “Nobody believes in us!!!” LOOOOL"
"I dunno, the goal posts get moved every series. Suddenly Ben Simmons is absolute trash, Tobias Harris is a volume shooter scrub, Thybulle and Maxey are young and inexperienced, and Seth Curry is back to being a role player. And the Hawks team of 0 all-stars or all-nba players is suddenly a superteam."
"&gt; 2009 has Harden/Curry/Rubio  Did you just put *Rubio* ahead of Blake, Jrue, and Demar DeRozan?  '11 should be mentioned, too. (Kawhi, Kyrie, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Vuc, Klay)   '12 was AD/Dame/Draymond/Beal/Middleton which ain't bad, either."
"You should be enjoying the playoffs right now then. You’ve got guys like Kyrie, KD, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, CP3, Jokic, Embiid, Tobias Harris all making a killing in the mid range this postseason. It may not be in the regular season but this postseason has seen the return of the mid range game. And it’s awesome."
Its their Tobias Harris.
Sounds a lot like the opinion “I would take Tobias Harris over Embiid”
Wouldn't he be 3rd after Tobias Harris?
I think about current MPJ or Middleton swapping with Tobias Harris all the time hell even Jerami coming back for Harris.
"Not sure how Tobias Harris has missed all the Sixers hate, 24 inefficient points in G7"
Westbrook  Gobert  Tobias Harris?  Ben Simmons
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
"John Wall, Klay Thompson, Tobias Harris, Kristaps"
Given number of years remaining on the deal it might actually be close to that range already.  Lots of the incredibly bad deals are getting close  to the point where they aren’t as nasty because they will be done in two years.  In fact most of the usual suspects for worst contract in league outside of Tobias Harris fit this situation.
"Ummm, Middleton is far better than Tobias Harris at doing what they are paid to do. Harris fucking choked hard."
"Role players are probably a lot cheaper with stars taking up more of the cap. Tobias Harris and Embiid are set to make $67.5 million next year. In my scenario they are probably still close to that number, just with Embiid making substantially more."
Process itself was fine it’s just they did basically the worst job you could’ve done. Drafted multiple busts relative to their position (noel/fultz/Simmons/Okafor) traded big assets for Jimmy Butler who left them. Signed horford and then had to trade to get rid of him.    Traded a lot of assets for just mediocre guys in Tobias Harris. They basically fucked up everything outside of Embiid and are still a pretty good contender.
"I thought Bogi actually did a better job on Harris than anyone. He surprisingly stood his ground in the post against a much stronger player, and he had active hands to make him feel uncomfortable putting the ball on the floor. Solo, on the other hand, got absolutely cooked by Tobias, and that’s why he went from starting to getting DNPd by the end of the series."
Tobias Harris had one on the magic I think
Tobias Harris with the Magic
tobias harris magic vs thunder in 2014. no idea why i remember this
Tobias Harris vs OKC in 2014
"Tobias Harris was balling this season, Danny Green and Seth Curry are top level role players. They have a great team besides Ben and Doc."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22. Giannis Antetokounpo 23. Khris Middleton 24. Jrue Holiday 25. Trae Young 26. Clint Capela 27. Lamelo Ball 28. Jimmy Butler 29. Bam Abedayo 30. Russel Westbrook 31. Bradley Beal 32. Nikola Jokic 33.

John Wall 55. Dearon Fox 56. Ja Morant 57. Dillon Brooks 58. Zion Williamson 59. Brandon Ingram 60. Demar Derozen  And that list really minimizes controversial choices.
That also means you automatically get Luka Doncic and Tobias Harris.
No way lol. Tatum and Brown are only 23 and 24 and have shown consistent growth and compliment each other. Tatum and Brown have made the ECF together twice already and and Brown made it three times. The sixers have made it 0.   Embiid is obviously great but Simmons is a negative paired with him out there. Also Tobias Harris and Simmons together are owed 300mil and neither are worth their money.
"Firstly, your English is great. Secondly, thank you for this write up. It makes sense thinking back and reading your post. This quality analysis will probably lost in all the crazy upvoted Ben hate posts but I at least appreciated it.   The fact is Doc is to blame for a lot of the issues and there's no excuse for not being able to recognize what's happening and counter when you're up 26 to finish out that win. But he was dealing with a lot of limiting factors:  -No Danny Green for most of the series.   -Ben absolutely cratered midway through the series.   -No stretch 5 on the roster, which means that Ben can't effectively run a bench unit where he just goes to work with shooters.   -Ben and Dwight absolutely cannot play together.   -Milton and Maxey take turns being unplayable, sometimes both of them. Doc has no idea what he'll get from game to game from them in this series.   -*Tobias Harris was not able to take advantage of a slower, less quick PF* (your analysis)  -Hobbled Embiid.   -The only reliable shooter after Green went down was Seth, who got absolutely roasted in this series, especially Game 7.   -He's forced to play Dwight Howard and basically live with the two to three ridiculous fouls or flagrants that he gets that are completely unforced errors.   These are just the major ones."
"Tobias Harris does not suck. He is just the Groundhog Day guy: 20pts this game, 20pts next game, and 20pts the game after next game."
Basically: Tobias Harris sucks
"sources lol. this is just BS played up for clicks.   Ben is one of the top 100 players in the world at his sport, with immense skill as a passer, ball handler and defender. you don’t get that by being lazy. his jumper got messed up when he was younger, muscle memory is a stubborn thing and he was in his head this playoffs.  Doc Rivers threw him under the bus and this is likely not a story if Tobias Harris was even below average in game 5 and Thybulle doesn’t foul a 3 point shooter in clutch time in game 5 and 7."
He’s about the same size as Tobias Harris for whatever that’s worth.
"This is interesting ideas, undermined by saying that high 30s% for 3PT% is below average. For whom? Steph Curry? Joe Harris had the highest 3 point percentage of qualified players and he shot 47.5%.  According to Basketball Reference, among all players in the NBA, league median is halfway between Dylan Windler (33.8%) and Terrance Ross (33.7%). Embiid is 70th percentile and Harris is 78th percentile. Among ""qualified"" players, it's a little different, but they're still above the median for qualified players.  It's an interesting idea to sell high, especially since they have 5 years of team control on Simmons. I don't think it's interesting enough to entertain offers other than KD &amp; Harden or LeBron &amp; AD for Embiid because they haven't exhausted all of their options with Embiid yet. They can load-manage him super hard like Raptors Kawhi, eat the fines, still make the playoffs since they've shown they can still get the 1 seed missing Embiid for a lot of the time anyway, and give it a go that way.  As for the idea of selling high, now that Tobias Harris's contract looks a lot less bad, maybe they should sell on him to try to get a couple of players, especially decent bigs that can eat up minutes while Embiid rests. Idk how possible that is."
"Game 7, I don't exactly remember the lineup, but he had Tobias harris in their with pretty much all defensive players, no scorers. We're talking about thybulle, howard, and some other parts of the rotations I don't remember. It was 1 on 5 on the offensive end. It was really bad."
Tobias Harris was 22 a game with 48/39/89 shooting splits and a legit all star case in the West when they extended him after trading for him from the Clippers.   Someone was gonna look stupid maxing him.
"As a rookie it was just Simmons and Embiid and a bunch of spot up shooters. Since then he's played with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, even Josh Richardson and Seth Curry don't need to just sit on the 3 point line to score points."
"I think there’s no blanket right answer for this. I think situation and context really matter. BPA I believe is a smart approach when your cupboard is bare and you’re searching for THE guy. But look at the Hawks. Once they got their guy in Trae Young, Atlanta drafted BPA at positions they needed to fill around Trae, and now they’re in the ECF way ahead of schedule. I think Orlando is a better example than Philly of BPA gone wrong, actually. Oladipo and Elfrid Payton in B2B drafts, taking Aaron Gordon while they’re investing in Tobias Harris, and then tanking another raw wing in Hezonjia in 2015, all while playing often through the slower, more methodical Vucevic down low. Channing Frye compared all those pieces to “rats climbing a ladder.”"
"True, but I also think Philly being a 2 man show before Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris arrived plays a role in this."
I'll give him credit for reviving Tobias Harris but that's about it. Luke Walton went 39-4 with the '15-'16 warriors
"He's never been that good of a coach.  He's solid with certain players, Tobias Harris plays much better under him than basically anyone else.  But he's terrible at adjustments, refuses to bench vets even if they're underperforming and regularly chokes when the lights are the brightest.  Real talk if not for the one title he won with the Big 3 Celtics (and it's an outright crime he only won one title with them) I don't even know if he's in the League right now unless he became fine with being a pump up for bad teams before getting tossed when they got good."
Joel showed the hell up. Having Lowry to space the floor and let Embiid dominate inside even more would really have wrecked whatever the Hawks wanted to do defensively. Especially with how great Seth Curry and Tobias Harris (minus game 5 and 7)
"Yes really. Danny Green shoots 41% from 3, Tobias Harris shoots 39%, Embiid shoots 38%. As a team they are 10th in 3PT%"
Bet Tobias Harris loving all this Simmons slander hiding how much of a fraud he is.
We just made the ECF ahead of the 76ers winning 3 games on their own floor with a team that largely relies on guys who are 24 or younger. Why would we want to be in their position paying 30m+ a year to a guy that can't even be on the floor to close out playoff games? And another max tied up until Tobias Harris.   Sure. Having embiid is sick. Curry and thybule are on good value deals. But that's about it lol.
And 300 million tied up to Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris if you want to start adding some more details
ya his numbers were basically identical to Tobias Harris on that team (https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2019.html)  actually come to think of it he's fairly similar to Tobias - defense + clutch
This is so weird because Kyrie was also born overseas in Australia but still plays for USA.  I guess I'll replace him with Tobias Harris
They would have to move Tobias Harris along with a pick to open up cap space.
2nd round exit realistically. Tobias Harris not a big playoff performer and Danny Green too old.
"G- Russell Westbrook   G- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  F- Danny Green  F- Tobias Harris   C- Joël Embiid   Westbrook would relish in feeding these players. He’s still a consistent scoring threat. He can pass the ball to shooters, drive to the rim, or throw it to Embiid down low"
"The conversation should be team wide. Tobias Harris and his inefficient 24 points, 35mil a year contract needs to be getting more than that. Simmons can't shoot, we all know that, so he's going to be dogshit in half court sets. Tobias Harris is a ""scorer"", brought in and paid to get points."
This is the correct answer. It was a huge failure on the sixers’ part. They should have known him and sold on him sooner. This is where the previous management failed and not just that they also gave up the whole bank for Tobias Harris and maxed him out and let Butler go because they wanted to pay Harris
Good thing that group of players can put up points a bit easier then embiid and tobias Harris can
"It really isn’t just Ben Simmons. This narrative excludes Tobias Harris for his role in playing like crap. 4 points on 2-11 in game 4, and shooting 8-24 in game 7. Same shit as 2019 when Harris would get wide open shot after wide open shot and just brick them."
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Seth Curry F: Danny Green F: Tobias Harris C: Dwight Howard
"Yeah I’ve thought that for a while too and thought the Tobias trade/contract plus the fultz absolutely destroyed any chance they had of getting that guy who could make both work. But after watching this Atlanta series, I think it’s worth it to move on from Simmons (and Harris if they can) cause he was comeptlely scared to do anything and idk if having a playmaking guard would fix that.   I never really believed in Simmons in the playoffs but he was truly horrendous this series on offense. Usually you see guys struggle to perform cause they get tired in the 4th (doncic, harden in the past) or their moves get figured out (siakam) but I can’t remember seeing a player as visibly shook as Simmons. He wasn’t even looking at the basket in transition even if trae young was the only one back, like what NBA player have you ever seen just look like they dread being on offense"
"It gave the sixers Embiid, but it also cultivated a culture of losing and a revolving door of frauds, losers and desperation.  From ownership, all the way down to players.  It was supposed to develop home grown talent...(1 player)  It was supposed to help recruit FA/trade superstars... (Tobias Harris)  It was supposed to result in long term success... (Not even a conference finals appearance)  ...and still, half of sixers reddit would sell their souls to suck hinkie's nutts.     Pathetic."
"3 first round picks, 3 swaps, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris pls"
"Maybe the issue is the sixers are using him as one of their main offensive guys when he needs to be like a 4th option on offense and be on the court mainly for defense.   Like the sixers have embiid who is an obvious big talent and then they have seth curry and Tobias harris as their only other really scoring options which, let’s be real, aren’t the best options for your 2 and 3 scoring guys.   Embiid needs someone that’s on his level offensively. Maybe seth curry will be there next year but they need a huge rework. It’s obvious how much they need embiid to bail them out on possessions. It just isn’t sustainable for four quarters. Sure isn’t sustainable over a 7 game series. You can forget about making a finals run with that kind of game plane."
"Contracts like Ben Simmons, Kemba Walkers, Tobias Harris, Siakam and Andrew Wiggins will be the reason why the amnesty clause returns."
"Sound a lot like Tobias Harris lol.   Sixers need a ball handler/playmaker 2 3&amp;D guys, and stretch 4 around Embiid to maximize his potential. If we do that I think you see an even better version of Embiid next year. I could be wrong about DeMar but I don't think he provides anything Tobias Harris doesn't already cover."
Where’s Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris stats feel so empty feels like he was bricking mad shots throughout the series so idk he’s also another highly paid guy
"&gt;Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris aren't worth the max lol  Ben Simmons until 3 weeks ago was still a positive value on his contract, and he likely still is now. And Tobias Harris was signed post-process  &gt;I believe it is possible to get to the second round three times and the first round one time  It's possible to have the assets and team the 76ers have right now, but it's hard. Besides, those losses were the point of the process. The question isn't if we enjoy watching it, the question is if it's an effective strategy to become a high level team, which I think the answer is clearly true  The 76ers made pretty much every wrong move between the process and last offseason, yet they still have a strong team moving forward"
"Well that softer approach didnt work so how about a tougher one? Ben needs to take responsibility for getting to that point despite being babies and given patience  Philly arent a bad team, doc lead them to the 1 seed, ben isn’t necessarily the wrong piece but what hes being asked to do he’s technically or mentally not built for it, if im philly im keeping ben and just looking for a point guard who can shoot, id be shopping tobias harris rather than ben because sympathy is at an all time low with him, dont think teams trust he can be as useful as they thought before"
"Even with the friction, winning fixes most ailments.   Still amazed they let Elton Brand give Tobias Harris a max, then let Butler &amp; Redick walk."
"Anyone blaming Embiid needs to shut the fuck up. Series loss is 75% Ben, 20% Doc and 5% Harris. Tobias had that one for awful game but he at least put up 20+ most nights and shot. Ben the om the other hand couldn’t put up 10 and couldn’t stay on the floor because he was so bad"
"If Ben Simmons shoots just 60% from the line they most likely win that series. Sure embiid needs to work on his conditioning but it’s kind of tough when he’s already averaging 30 in that series ona torn minsicus having to do literally everything else because the supposed 2 best player on the team didn’t attempt a field goal in the 4th quarter for the last 4 games. If anything I will say Tobias sucked a fat rock this series as well. But if we’re handing blame in the form of percentages, more than half falls on Simmons with rest falling on Doc and Harris"
"Honestly I find this whole narrative that this was all Ben's fault kind of gross.  The narrative should be that a team that match the 76ers in win percentage post All star break proved they were just as good as a 1 seed.   The hawks won game 5 &amp; 7 b\\c Seth Curry was a match up they hunted for.  The Hawks won b\\c Joel had 8 turnovers in game 7. The Hawks won b\\c Tobias Harris is a volume shooter and for most of the series was having an abysmal time finding the net. The Hawks won b\\c Docs line ups were really bad. Doc killed his floor spacing having Ben and Dwight out on the floor at the same time. No one should be counting on Ben to win a game. His role is similar to Draymond's right now. We don't count on Draymond to win the game for Golden State, so why do we expect Ben to blow up the scoreboard?  Anyways Rant over."
"Them Lightskins gotta stick together. I’ll be awaiting the Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and George Hill statements defending Simmons shortly."
He's not s star player because of his shooting and he didnt get a max contract because of shooting either. I actually dislike Simmons a lot but I'm not sure how 8-24 Tobias Harris and no adjustment Doc Rivers are escaping blame.   No doubt Simmons had a terrible series and a terrible game - but Atlanta had no business winning this series and the only reason they did is because the 76ers as a whole ain't it.
I know Seth had some good stat lines but I think Tobias Harris is clearly their second best player.
Jimmy was terrifying that series.   I remember being so relieved when a possession ended with a Tobias Harris shot. And I just completely forgot that Simmons existed for large stretches
"he is tobias harris. nice player, but doesnt move the needle. no way"
Whoever gives Collins a max will have one of the worst contracts in the NBA. It'll be an albatross just like Tobias Harris.
"If Tobias Harris can get a max, Collins absolutely can"
"You’ve probably watched them more than me and know better, I only watched some games in the regular season and the ‘yoffs vs the Sixers and Bucks.  Is Collins that mediocre? I feel like it’s a Tobias Harris / Otto Porter situation, he may not be entirely worth it but it’s what you have to pay to keep him"

"Hey, they turned Jennings into a borderline all-star in Tobias Harris so honestly it wasn't a huge deal. Even if Middleton stays he probably gets dealt to the Clippers in that same deal and is a Sixer now."
"&gt;	Tobias Harris is a good player, but nowhere close to a star.  His band account would suggest otherwise."
"Nah the priority should have been to **not** give Harris a max contract and then fired Brett well before they had the final discussion with Jimmy. I would've preferred signing jimmy, keeping Ben, and letting Harris walk. There was no reason whatsoever to pay Tobias that money because nobody else would have."
"Simmons and Butler don’t fit great, but you could always trade Simmons for a lot, and they can play together okay. The defense is actually great with them both on the court, and Simmons got out of the way enough to not be a detriment to Butler/Embiid on offense, even if he didn’t add value to the offense.   An underrated culprit of their failure against the Raptors is Tobias Harris. Jimmy created him so many wide open threes and he was just bricking wide open shots all series."
"I don't know why people don't understand this.   They'll say the Process/Hinkie were failures and a sham, but the average redditor could have done a better job than Colangelo/Brand.      Just a couple lowlights during the Brand/Colangelo era.          * Getting a fake first round pick for Noel, who was almost immediately offered a 70 million dollar contract.   * **Giving** a 2nd round pick to trade Okafor and Sauce to Brooklyn for Trevor Booker (who was cut shortly after). Colangelo refused to trade Okafor when he still had trade value.     * Trading 2 firsts and Shamet (perfect fit for the Sixers) for Tobias Harris who was expiring and the Clippers clearly did not want to re-sign. And then of course giving him the massive contract.      *  Giving an aging Horford a massive contract while he clearly does not fit with the team.      And that's not including the Fultz/Butler moves which probably deserve more context."
It's just mind-boggling that they didn't offer him a max but gave Tobias Harris the wealth of Mansa Musa
"The Process is as much a marketing slogan as it is a team-building strategy. And it's genius as far as PR/marketing is concerned is that it can't fundamentally fail, it can only be failed.   Like even look at this thread and see how many people claiming that like Tobias Harris is an example of the Process working, when the original logic of the whole model was that guys like Harris (and more directly, Jrue Holiday, who btw is now a key piece of a possible title team) aren't worth having on your roster because they're not true superstars. But if you keep changing the goals and you've already made your fans accept that losing doesn't prove anything negative about your strategy, you can ultimately get them to eat as much shit as you want, and on that point the Process is and will continue to be a resounding success."
"The goal was to win the championship, or more accurately to build a team that could win the championship. Embiid played MVP caliber this year and Butler led a team to the finals last year, there is no doubt that should be a big time championship contender every year, especially with the extra two Top 50 caliber players they had to add to their two All NBA guys.  The process is a success in that it built them a championship roster, even with the blunders of the Colangelo/Brown years, which are a series of pissing away all the wealth gathered during the process. From getting rid of a draft pick to move up 2 picks in the draft, wasting a No. 1 pick on Fultz, trading Mikal Bridges, and then losing Jimmy Butler because you decided you should build around guys that played worse than him in the 2019 playoffs.  The failure of the Sixers is from what happened after The Process / Hinkie. The Tobias Harris trade is generally marked as the end of the process as that’s when the Sixers had cashed in all their major trade chips, but the decay was already there with the 2017 and 2018 draft blunders.   The process is such a success that they were so asset rich that they are still a fringe contender after pissing away an All NBA player."
"&gt; The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time  They should hang this in the rafters"
"I know bro we had SVG for 5 years too. Except it was worse cause he was also the GM and did the stupidest shit like trading a pick that became SGA + Tobias Harris for the corpse of Blake Griffin  Alll i can say is - eventually you guys will rebuild and get out of mediocre purgatory, you’ll draft a star, and everything will be looking up in DC :)"
"The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time. The process was a resounding success. That was even after burning assets like Mikal Bridges and the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft.  Getting rid of Butler is the big mistake (in addition to the Fultz pick), but that happened post process. If they kept Butler, you have Butler, Harris, and Embiid which is a great big 3, and could have used Ben Simmons in trades more aggressively."
This is the same organization that paid a 0 time all-star player 5 years 180 million in Tobias Harris and paid a fundamentally flawed player 5 years 177 million in Ben Simmons.   I think he has them over a barrell in negotiations. They either pay him or are forced to trade him. The supermax gives all parties clarity.   No one stays once the team refuses to pony up the supermax. See Jimmy Butler and Demarcus Cousins.
I'll say he's worthy of a max contract that Tobias Harris got
Well then you have to throw in Tobias Harris as well
"Pre season I got eviscerated on this sub by 76ers fans when I said the GM was insane and that i would trade Simmons, Tobias Harris (to make the money work), and whoever the fuck the Rockets wanted from the bench: Maxey, Thybulle, etc   For Harden  76er fans thought that was stupid, all those players for Harden?! That’s a championship roster!   NOT IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF THE COURT AT THE END OF THE GAME BECAUSE THEY CANT SHOOT"
"When Tobias Harris is on his shots and movement is basically exactly what is needed and not extra, kinda gives me that vibe. At his best he is taking what the defense leaves open after Embiid has caused something, puts his head down, goes, lays it in with touch, back up the court.            I think that is also why when he is off he's missing short or rimming out constantly cause he isn't putting enough on it or going up high enough."
"You don't get what you deserve, you get what you can leverage   See: Harris, Tobias and Middleton, Khris  Collins getting maxed"
Things Doc Rivers has done well.  Utilise Seth Curry in a more effective way than other teams.  Run Tobias Harris at his ideal position  Make adjustments with Tyrese Maxey/Shake Milton to help swing games.  The issue with the sixers is that they don't have a real pg who can properly run a half court offense (unless you count an old George Hill who didn't cut it as a starting PG in 2018 let alone now).  Doc Rivers isn't the best coach ever but just two seasons ago he lead one of the most star-starved teams to the West playoffs in a decade+. He's not the greatest coach but overall he has more positives than negatives.  Also Scott Brooks made the playoffs lol
"Beginning of the year I thought this was going to be the best playoffs in awhile. Lebron vs time, bron vs CP, luka vs kawhi, the plight of playoff p. Clippers vs nuggets. Murray vs Mitchell.  We get to find out how the suns young players act in the playoffs. Trae young, ben simmons, Tobias Harris vs embiid and curry. Can doc exorcise his playoff demons? I feel like there are still so many questions on the table that we won’t get answered this year. Injuries suck. Hope the nba learned their lesson, the ratings are about to be shit"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"Damn, that's actually a much worse than it looks initially when you reexamine draft... when Kawhi, Klay, Butler, Kemba and Vucevic were still on the board. Hell even Tobias Harris or Isaiah Thomas. That was actually a great draft, a ton of role players that could contribute to championship level teams - the Morris twins, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, Bogdanovic. The odds were actually in your favour that year to get something worthwhile. Sorry that sucks."
"Embiid, KAT, Jokic, AD are all inarguable.  I'd take Bam, Vuc, and Gobert above him as well, but even being generous and saying he's like the 6th or 7th best center instead of the 8th - 18th overall is nuts lol.   If this was based on a complete league re-draft (snake format) and you're picking Ayton at 18, you'd have like Ayton and D Lo or Tobias Harris    Instead of Paul George / Booker /Tatum (at least one drops) and Nurkic"
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
"This alone wouldnt change anything.  They need to trade all their future and current draft picks with some young players like Anfernee Simons for a 3rd Star.  Then we can talk also about trading CJ for another Star. If Tobias Harris is the right one, i dont know."
It’s honestly a very lateral move. Tobias is the better player but his price tag is a bit heftier and the Blazers don’t win a chip. I’d move Simmons way before I move Harris if I’m the Sixers as well.
Difference is that the Suns are actually well coached and CP3 and Booker won’t be afraid to take over in the big moment unlike Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris
"I started watching seriously around like late 00s early 2010s but even back then I didn't hear many people ""overrate"" him like that. Never heard his name being around guys like kd,melo,wade,etc but I wasnt around message boards around that time either  People said he was overrated for his contract I do remember this but I chalk that up to be like a tobias harris deal and nobody really thinks he's an elite player"
&gt; The Bucks screwed up by letting Brogdon go.  Just my .02 on this but keeping Brogdon over Middleton would have been optimal. Brogdon was probably the better player and better fit for that team...especially at what Brogdon is getting paid.  Middleton feels like Tobias Harris' deal in a lot of respects - good player that shouldn't warrant a max deal but got one.
Tobias Harris..? Embiid..?
like a khris middleton/gordon hayward/tobias harris? his off the dribble shot creation is very good for his age.
"This sub is full of haters that's why, you have people who talk shit to players that take care of their health like kawhi ( we saw what happened to KD and Isiah) and people who bet on themselfs like Tobias Harris. It is what it is"
So Middleton and Tobias Harris really are the exact same player
"Who does this guy think he is, Tobias Harris?"
The inverse Tobias Harris
Got that Tobias Harris energy
"They could have not been forced to get Hinkey out. No way he makes the Tobias Harris, Horford and  other moves.  The NBA was lame that way."
"Tobias Harris. I don’t know why. Seems like a likeable guy, but fuck ‘em. Could be the fact he makes bank and doesn’t deliver idk"
*Tobias Harris has left the chat*
"By saying he'd become a smaller Tobias Harris I mean that he'd be a promising third option who rarely gets his moments and doesn't show up when you want him to. I don't think that's the player type that the Sixers should be looking for. I also don't expect Ingram to ""step up"" his game all of a sudden like some people do I feel like we're basically already looking at him at his best."
I see Ingram becoming a smaller Tobias Harris next to Embiid.
"&gt; Demar plays the 4 for one season, and now he’s a 4 his entire career? Once again, calling me an idiot for no reason. &gt;  &gt;   He's too slow and can't shoot therefore he's not a wing anymore. How is this so hard for you to understand?   &gt; Tobias is most clearly a wing. 50/40/90, main perimeter threat and can drive to basket.  https://i.imgur.com/UsJrIpP.png  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tobias-harris-didnt-change-his-game-the-sixers-changed-around-him/  You have no idea what you are talking about.  &gt; Grant was playing the wing role in Denver.  He doesn't in Detroit. You love talking about what players were, not what they are. Which is the only fucking thing that matters.  It's very, very obvious you don't watch any of the games or players you claim to know something about. And it's painful to talk to someone so delusional."
"To do what exactly? Flip CJ McCollum for Tobias Harris at best? Blazers will only get a similar piece back for whoever they trade. They just lost to an injured Nuggets team in the first round, the writings on the wall."
"Coangelo may have not been a good GM, but the brain trust &amp; Elton Brand were the ones that accelerated the timeline with the Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris trades."
"I thought his ceiling would be a fringe all-star, like Tobias Harris."
"76ers-Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Andre Iguodala, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid,"
Yea that's why I started to love the Clippers a couple years ago. Had two of my favorite players in Tobias Harris and Lou Will and it was just a team that was truly like a collection and each night somebody would step up
"Thats not true, we used the pick to acquire the rights to pay Tobias Harris $180M  End me"
Tobias Harris
"[Article](https://in.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-ben-simmons-fourth-quarter-philadelphia-76ers-toronto-raptors/guoi3q2vrg7n10qxtl63rvdv4) from 2019, Simmons even skipped the FIBA tourney to ""work on his game""      Tobias Harris is quoted saying that  made big improvements in his game,” Harris said. ""His jump shot is really good, he has confidence to shoot it, and I just kept telling him there in his workouts to have the confidence to shoot it and don’t get discouraged if you miss. This is where you build that type of confidence. It was a good sight to see.”     Simmons has not improved at all, and is giving the same lip service. How many kicks in the ass does he need? His offensive game has regressed even."
He is overpaid by like $5-10 million. It is pretty similar to the Tobias Harris situation.
"They are the third team. They’re there to take draft picks/young players and make salaries work.   E.g.   Simmons goes to timberwolves  DLo and Kemba goes to sixers  Tobias Harris goes to OKC with x number of picks.   Or if Sixers don’t want Kemba, okc can absorb Harris contract"
Tobias Harris.  If you’re willing to move Wiggins + Wiseman.
"The Tobias Harris special, until Philly maxed him"
"Penny, T-Mac, rashard Lewis, Dwight Howard, Shaq.  Bench has Steve Francis, grant hill, Horace grant, Tobias Harris, terkaglu"
"Nah. Love Kha$h, but swap him for any almost all star SF (eg Tobias Harris)  and Bucks do pretty much the same."
"Can’t believe we traded this man for Brandon Jennings. Who then was traded for Tobias Harris, who was then traded for Blake Griffin."
"&gt;If he was on the Wolves he would not need to carry ANY offensive load   That's true only if the Sixers don't get anything of value from the Wolves back, which isn't a realistic trade to begin with. You gotta remember this dude was the 4th option on Philly... behind Tobias Harris and Seth Curry lol."
Are you telling me Kuzma is better than Ingram? Or are you just butthurt that your team has to pay Tobias Harris a max contract for 3 more years?
Tobias Harris. He’s not a bad player; but no one is taking on that contract and giving you anything worthwhile in return. It’s insane.
Let's make an All-Former Pistons team for this year's playoffs.   Khris Middleton Blake Griffin Reggie Jackson Tobias Harris Marcus Morris
"Tobias was good? Last 3 games in the playoffs he shot 2/11, 9/20, and 8/24 with average at best defensive performances. I get hating on Simmons is cool, but Harris is 29, a good 3rd guy on a championship team at best with 115M guaranteed over the next 3 years"
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
Smh the disrespect to two-timer Benny boy and all time all star snub great Tobias Harris
And Tobias got maxed too.   The difference is that Tobias Harris has better players and disappointed once after he signed the contract
"Wow, surprisingly close to Tobias Harris numbers"
"I know everyone is down and Simmons and deservedly so, but has Ingram made the playoffs once even as a second or third option?  Jeremi Grant and Tobias Harris averaged close to those numbers."
"Dame and Embiid alone would be scary enough. The sixers would have a decent supporting cast on top of that with players like Tobias Harris and Seth Curry. I don't know that it would be quite enough for guaranteed contender status, considering how stacked some of the other teams are if they manage to avoid injuries, but that would be a sixers team I'd love to watch."
"Yeah I mean at that point you just throw in whatever else see if you can get Covington back also. Then idk what a Tobias Harris swap looks like, but if you can get back some package where you get a wing who can be your main on ball defender and hit some 3s that's what you would look for. Not super easy coming up with such a trade though lol, maybe the Spurs would have interest idk"
"8 points difference dude. That’s the same as the difference between Giannis and Tobias Harris  You mentioning that he was the 1st seed after I already mention that that’s why he won, doesnt really prove anything"
unless you're tobias harris
"That’s not whataboutism at all. The question is whether Ayton is “worth” the max, and one of the best ways to determine worth in a market is to look at similar transactions. It’s true that players can be overpaid and the market isn’t perfect, but it’s still relevant to the conversation to look at other players.   Fox got the max, Tobias Harris got a max, Simmons, Murray, Middleton, Conley all got max contracts. A lot of people would say those guys aren’t “worth” a max, but if guys like that are all getting max deals then people need to rethink what they consider “worth” it"
"Sure, why not? If Kevin Love and Tobias Harris are max players, Ayton probably deserves that."
"Not to mention the players they acquired during Simmons and Embiid’s rookie deals with the war chest of picks Hinkie acquired did not turn out well. They could have had 2 max players next to Embiid and Simmons for years, but they ended up squandering all the assets and only getting Tobias Harris on an overpaid contract to show for practically being in the best long term position a team could possibly be in in the NBA"
Imagine Tobias Harris having a higher salary than Joel Embiid.
That would apply to Ben Simmons as well. Tobias Harris ain’t it.
Blazers can only trade or draft well. All their key players are drafted.. right now still no free agents want to go to Portland. The only way is blazers play their first round picks. (Nassir/zach Collins/ simons). Or trade big for someone like Ben simmons or tobias Harris who has a long term contract.
"Sixers cap situation is pretty bad considering Tobias Harris is currently your highest paid player. You also have 30+ M/year going to a guy who can't be on the court late in the 4th, but also is responsible for helping to facilitate the offense.  You're also Year 1 with Doc Rivers as your HC so you're probs going to waste 1-2 more years with him until you fire him. Meanwhile, Brooklyn will only be getting better. You just got beat by a younger Hawks team."
"Sixers give up Ben Simmons (who's trade value isn't as low as people think) and  Tobias Harris and probably 3 picks.  That said, you're probably right. Maybe need to drop a pick and throw in Thybulle as well."
...and will land Tobias Harris instead.
"&gt; Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick  actually not as it turns out lmfao. 19 is the most loaded non lotto pick spot this decade somehow. Huerter, Collins, Tobias and Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley all 19th overall lmao.  Bey is a gem though, Detroit has a bright future."
I can't believe we traded Jimmy Butler for this guy. I can't believe we traded 2 first round picks and Shamet for Tobias Harris and then gave him a max contract. I can't believe we spent our cap space on a 4 year contract for Al Horford. Wtf was Elton Brand thinking?
"Out of curiosity, why? It really seems like he didn’t do anything that wrong, he wasn’t the one who spent a billion on Tobias Harris. Hot take but I think the sixers would be in a better place right now if that ringer article never came out"
Can I interest you in a Tobias harris?
"He’s tall and long in the sense that Tobias Harris is tall and long. Good offensive player but his size isn’t really an advantage defensively. He’s slow and not versatile.   If they did go after Rui, I guess their hope would be that OG and Barnes make up for his defensive shortcomings"
He projects to be kinda like a Tobias Harris kinda guy. Good all around offensive wing forward but a little slow laterally for defense
"Yeah I don't see it either. Pascal is my dream target for the offseason though, but I hope we can at least get Tobias Harris instead"
"Lmao they were expecting love to be a decent 12th option and he was too out of shape for that  The vet that’s currently on a max and not even in basketball shape when the season just ended  I’ve seen so many players like Tobias Harris, Simmons, Horford, Deng, Mozgov, etc all these overpaid players and love has literally not even had a decent season since he got his max"
"Depending on how the Ben Simmons and Kyle Lowry situations go in Philly, I think a Buddy Hield and Delon Wright for Tobias Harris structure might make some sense."
"That’s debatable, we gave away so many picks for rental rights to Jimmy, moving up for fultz, even the “wins” beside Joel are like Tobias go quiet in the 4th Harris.  We shipped off current rising stars like Christian wood, jerami grant, bridges, saric, etc before they got a chance.   It’s just bad move after bad move besides joel"
Oh I think if you max JC there's a fair chance you get him. It's much more about Ill believe their ownership being willing to pay the luxury tax when I see it. Hawks have also given indications they arent huge on making that kind of investment in him long term.  Beyond that can also use the cap space to trade for guys who arent on great contracts but still pretty good players. I dont think for ex if you made a call on Tobias Harris the Sixers would refuse to take your call(might not accept your offer but guys like that will be available). Other guys like Myles Turner have been floated around for multiple yrs now. Or other options use the cap space to take on bad contracts for assets.
"He’s at the bottom tier of fg% no doubt.  So Dillon Brooks, Christian Wood, Jrue Holiday, Porzingus, are volume shooters?  Edit: is Tobias Harris a volume shooter too?"
"Okay, so:  2018: Sixers draft Khyri Thomas, traded to Pistons for two second rounders  One of those picks is sent to the Clippers as part of the package that gets Tobias Harris to the Sixers  Cippers trade that pick to us in the Marcus Morris trade"
Vegan isn’t really unhealthy it’s when you go to crazy lengths and do raw vegan like MPJ that it gets risky. Tobias Harris is vegan if I remember correctly.
"THIS IS THE DRAFT PICK THAT THE MIAMI HEAT SENT TO THE PHOENIX SUNS FOR GORAN DRAGIC BACK IN 2015  IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS TO CONVEY  Trade Deadline 2015 - Suns trade Goran Dragic to Miami for 2021 Miami 1st  Draft Day 2018 - Suns trade 2021 Miami 1st and Zhaire Smith to Philly for Mikal Bridges  All Star 2019 - Philly trades 2021 Miami 1st and other assets to Clippers for Tobias Harris  Summer 2019 - Clippers trade 2021 Miami 1st, SGA and a million other picks to Thunder for PG13  2021 - The Miami pick conveys as the 18th Overall Draft Pick and is held by OKC"
Tobias Harris on both Clippers and Sixers
Tobias Harris and Seth Curry improved a lot this year and Embiid put up monster numbers so of course his stats are down.  Simmons' defense was at its best this year.
Maybe 15 Tobias Harris clones? Enough of him would be on in a given night that they'd probably be pretty good.
"“But aren’t you 6’10 and supposedly a jump shot away from being the next Lebron, can’t you score some points instead of passing to Tobias Harris”"
"It has to be someone like at least close to all NBA level. Yes, the team will have extreme depth, but they will have serious fit issues, so they have to be extremely talented to overcome that. Its also very difficult to win without all NBA players. A team of Tobias Harris or Siakim isn't going to beat a healthy nets team."
Tobias Harris maybe? He’s tall and can play both ends of the floor.
"DeAngelo Russell, CJ, Wiggins, Tobias Harris, Hayward, hell even Middleton because he's nowhere as near an all around player. Kemba can't guard anyone anymore, definitely Wall, and it's not even close. Then you got guys like Horford at 27 per.  Simmons has been an all-star 3 years running, one of the best defenders for the last 2 years, one of the best transition playmakers in the league and was all-nba a year ago. I don't know how or why this is getting lost in the negativity."
"Knowing how Daryl operates, I would be surprised if he hasn't at least discussed Tobias Harris in some capacity. But Harris' name has not really been mentioned by team sources this week. With Kuminga, if he's still there at 8 and Franz Wagner is not, there seems to be a chance Orlando could take him, yes."
"Hey Jake, thanks for taking the time to do this! Do you think that Daryl Morey has had discussions with other teams regarding the availability of Tobias Harris? Additionally, who do you think it would be wise for the Magic to take a chance on Kuminga? Personally, I think yes to both, but was wondering your thoughts?"
"I disagree, one of his best defensive attributes is his ability to help on weakside rim protection rotations which is often the role of the 4 in zone schemes. More and more we're seeing more ""wings"" at the 4 than ""bigs"" - guys like Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Tobias Harris are the biggest concerns in the East on that side of the ball (outside of Giannis, who, lets be real is a PF in the body of a C), not to mention just defending the corner 3 in general from 4 out teams. 4s in the modern game have to be able to defend the perimeter.  My preference is Cam at the 3, Hunter at the 4 long-term like the Celtics use Brown/Tatum."
Got that Italy flair but I'm assuming this is Tobias Harris??
You can really start to see the Tobias Harris comp taking shape now thats for sure
Pre-draft he was more compared to guys like Jamison &amp; Tobias Harris iirc
"Imagine if they got Siakam for Simmons, Mccolum for Tobias Harris, signed Lowry in FA. Infinitely better team.   (i gotta stop playing 2k)"
"Everybody in this thread is trippin. Simmons is a top 3 defender in the league every year. He is insanely elite at defense. That is rare. Offense can be learned. Confidence will grow with age and he'll only get better. If Jimmy Butler never left, the Sixers would have a championship by now, or soon. They need another top tier scorer yeah but they should keep a great defender. In my opinion they should trade Tobias Harris. He was bad on offense and he's not a great defender."
"Tobias Harris is getting paid 180 million and Kemba  walker is getting 140, id say Siakam is a solid deal."
"Say Simmons ends up going to Portland for CJ McCollum and, I don't know, two firsts?   Philly them have those two picks, their own 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 first round picks (2025 to OKC), and young pieces in Thybulle, Maxey and Milton, along with salary matcher in Tobias Harris, to send to, for example, Washington to get Beal.  CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid is probably a better championship base than Simmons, Harris and Embiid."
That the Sixers were frauds. It was pretty obvious the whole time that a team with Tobias Harris as its secondary scorer and a point guard who LARPs as Timofey Mozgov in the half court was not a contender. I knew it before the season and believed it even when they finished first in the East.
"NBA players are incredibly charitable. If you look around the league, the amount of players with multi-million dollar charitable foundations that you've never heard a word about is astonishing. Posts about that shit get like 10 upvotes here.  Guys like Tobias Harris and Luol Deng don't have an army of New York beat writers working 24/7 to sanitize their reputation after they treated people around them like shit in really public ways for 5 years and told kids the earth was flat, so their charity stuff gets no news traction."
"I think Okonwu at the 5 is better defensively than Randle or Gordon and you need some rim protection. Ingles is at least a nominal point guard, and I think you need more playmaking than those guys provide, except Randle, who I do think you could play at the 4 and go with Ingram over Tobias Harris if you wanted.   Wings are great, but you still need rim protection and playmaking and with George and Tatum out there I think it's diminishing returns to an extent."
Tobias Harris has more career points than Kawhi also
"I think nowadays the term “Tweener” still has a negative connotation in regards to 3/4s. Think players like Tobias Harris and Rui Hachimura who aren’t really that big but are also a bit slow defending the perimeter. Though, as years go by I think the 4 is catering this kind of player more and more (as long as they are a good shooter)"
"I don't think it was just half a season of good play though. He also wasn't just hot while they were out. He was runner-up for 6moy last season and played well in the Houston series. You are right though that his career has not been so favorable. I remember not really liking him in Atlanta.   I just think that he's going to get a contract around what he's looking for, especially since he didn't take the Lakers' extension offer. I think a lot of teams struggle with ball-handling, and there's a need for his skillset even if he's not the best player.  He's probably looking at the contracts of guys like Hield,  Brogdon, Gary Harris, Tobias Harris, Porzingis, Van Vleet,  Runio, Fultz, and Danuel House Jr  (pretty sure that last one's a typo lol) and thinking he can get the bag like them.   http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/\_/seasontype/4"
&gt; Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles &gt;  &gt;   Ingram? Randle? Gordon? All above Okongwu or Ingles imo
"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=PLAYER\_HEIGHT\_INCHES&amp;dir=1  It's definitely a shorter team than this, though it's hard to find interior defense.      I think I'd go with the 6'7 team, would be impossible to stop with that much shooting around Luka and Butler, Kawhi and one of Zion or Anunoby at the 5 could probably do okay at the 5.  6'9 team - Not enough shooting, but Siakam might be able to guard 1s okay and if he can the D should be quite good.  Adebayo - Siakam - John Collins - Kyle Anderson - Lebron   6'8 team - little light on playmaking but Okongwu looked like a decent center   Okongwu-Tobias Harris - Paul George- Tatum - Ingles   6'7 team - Light on interior D, but tons of skill and a proper PG to run the O  Zion/OG - Jimmy Butler - Kawhi - Middleton - Luka Doncic  6'6 team seems too light   Draymond Green - Mikal Bridges - Jaylen Brown - Shai Gilgeous Alexander - Lamelo Ball"
As Listed Height;  6'8 - if you can create a MyTeam on 2K  PG: Jayson Tatum  SG: Indy PG24    SF: Melo7  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Minny Kevin Love
Tobias Harris was pretty useless against LeBron.
"&gt; on a trash team.   Why do people say this like it makes said player *better*? If anything it adds more question marks. Obviously the only shooting option star player is going to be, yknow, the only one scoring points. Same shit happened with Tobias Harris and Zach LaVine up until recently for example.   SGA is for sure an excellent player and the trade makes no sense to me, to be clear"
"In Morey delusional mind he would have the 4th pick as well,                                                so in lala land his starting 5 would be...  Jalen Suggs, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid."
Tobias Harris at 19
"2009 - Brandon Jennings led a terrible roster to the 6th seed in his rookie year and nearly upset the Hawks (losing in 7). He then got hurt. Despite that he still lead them to the the playoffs 2 out of his 4 seasons and then got traded for Khris Middleton. At #10 this was a good pick.   2009 - Jodie Meeks. A ten year NBA career for a 41st pick is incredible. The average NBA career lasts 4.5 seasons. The average length for a 41st pick would be like 1 year. This was a great pick.   2010 - Larry Saunders at 15 in 2010 was another great pick. In 2012 he was a Gobert-esque rim protector, essentially a walking double double with 3 blocks per game.    2011- Jimmer Fredette. The Kings made this pick. The Bucks had no intention of keeping Jimmer and traded back for the 19th pick, which they used to take eventual borderline All Star Tobias Harris. An incredible pick.    2012 - John Henson at 14. Wasn't awful considering who was drafted after him. Pretty much everyone passed on Draymond who went 35.   2013 - Giannis. One of the best draft picks in NBA history.   2014 - Jabari Parker was considered a sure-fire star and was voted by his draft class as being the most likely to win ROY and to have the best career. Sports Illustrated had him on the cover calling him the ""best High School player since Lebron James'. No one was mad at this pick. He was averaging 20ppg in his 3rd season but had shocking luck with injuries.   2014 - Johnny O'Bryant. 5 years from a 36th pick isn't terrible.   2015 - Rashad Vaughn at 17 wasn't a disaster considering who was left on the board.   2016 - Thon Maker at 10. This is the first one I feel they properly messed up because Sabonis went 11. However they made up for it with their next pick.   2016 - Malcolm Brogdon at 36 is an incredible pick. Rookie of the year, 50-40-90 club, borderline All Star.    2018 - Donte DiVincenzo at 17 was a good pick. Find a new slant."
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
"Plus they did pretty well in the 2nd round. I wouldn’t include the players traded on draft night either, those picks are made by the team trading almost always (for example their real draft pick was Tobias Harris, not Jimmer)"
"They traded Jimmer to the Kings for Tobias Harris, not for nothing"
The salary doesn’t even nearly make sense unless they wanted to dump Tobias Harris on Toronto too.
Sorry I think you mean Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson
"Is he worth his contract? Absolutely. You're right absolutely right that he doesn't help his teams much in the playoffs. But a healthy Ben Simmons can get you into the playoffs. He can make players better, he can shut down the best player on the opposing team. Not a lot of players at or around 30 million a year can. Not Kevin Love. Not Tobias Harris. Not Steven Adams. Not Wiggins. Not CJ. Not DeAngelo Russell. Not Otto Porter. I'd argue not even a healthy Kemba Walker because he can't defend. So even if Simmons never improves I'd take him gladly over a lot of the higher paid players."
"&gt;It was a mistake because Ben wasn't the guy pushing the team over the top. Jimmy Buckets and Embiid were the clear key guys and JJ leaving for nothing also hurt the overall balance of the team.  You're conflating our other roster choices with the contract we handed Ben. We would've still given him that contract even if Jimmy wanted to stay. Like, you can't trade Ben in 2019 making 7 million a year for anything of value without also sending out another big contract. You can't offer him less than the max because he could've signed elsewhere. There's no scenario in which Ben is happy about being in Philly for 20-25 million a year. There's a whole list of reasons why trading him would've been difficult too. What we did with JJ is not relevant to how much you signed Ben Simmons for.  You're talking about the larger issue of how the league spreads out its money, especially for non superstars. That's how you end up with Tobias Harris making 36 million, because there's a max market but he's clearly only ever going to be a top 20-30 player best case scenario.  &gt;Gobert is DPOY though, not just all-defence 1st team. Ben hasn't reached that level.   Also you can spare me this one lol he literally came second in DPOY voting, he could win it next year easily. I'm aware of what's valuable on defense in the NBA, but just as Ben has not shown much offense in the playoffs, he has displayed elite defense to a degree that Gobert has not. Ben could never be played off the floor defensively by a small ball lineup."
"I hate when people do these with no research. They *technically* drafted Jimmer in 2011, but when it is a draft day trade it should absolutely not count. He was traded for Tobias Harris + assets, so they essentially drafted Harris in 2011.   They did miss out on the Parker and Maker picks, but it's usually a crapshoot once you get outside the lottery. Giannis at 15, Harris at 19, and Brogdon at 40 is not bad at all."
"This isn't even poor drafting. It's all late picks. They missed on Parker. They got a perennial top-5 NBA player at pick 15. They got insane value out of Brogdon. None of the rest matters at all.  Fredette they turned into Tobias Harris and Beno Udrih anyway, that's great value, they just didn't hold onto Harris long enough. I don't think including guys like Fredette, Hampton make sense. Those guys were not Bucks picks at all. And they both were good trades anyway."
"I was thinking about this the entire finals.. Jabari Parker and DJ Wilson, letting Brogdon walk,   trading Tobias Harris before that.. STILL won a ring bc of one stellar draft pick."
Literally why? Because the entire rest of the squad **played inspired** under Doc. How good was the other Curry? How about Tobias Harris’ season? And Embiid? Like this is people repeating the nonsense of pundits on First Take and Undisputed— **Ben Simmons lazy ass didn’t work on his game and is surrounded by his Mama and family members to make him soft**  And I’m thru pretending for him— you don’t get to be paid $200 million *AND HAVE MY EMPATHY*
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
"Wouldn’t this whole situation be avoided if they kept Butler over Tobias Harris?  They get their lead guard, a strong perimeter defender, and a go to scorer."
Can I offer you one Tobias Harris ;)
"Despite his contract, I always forget Tobias Harris is on the Sixers lol  In my head, it's just Embiid/Simmons/Curry/Green/young dudes"
"It's a tricky spot for sure. We don't *have* to get the person who runs the offense back 1 to 1 in the Simmons trade, that could come from a subsequent Tobias Harris trade or something, but I imagine we'd be gutting our depth at that point. We can't just trade Simmons for a scorer though, that'll be a disaster.  The other issue I have with the CJ rumor specifically is we already have Seth Curry on a crazy good contract at the same position playing the same role. CJ is a better pure scorer than Seth, but I don't think he's $25/mil per year better, not even close. Nothing about the CJ trade makes sense unless it's a 3 team deal and he's going elsewhere.  I also think Maxey has legit potential to grow into a player that can run the offense every night. He showed promising hints of that in the playoffs this year. Him developing ahead of schedule would be a godsend and make all of this easier to manage, but that's a big if. The way he's trending, Maxey is what Fultz should've been for us."
"In the regular season he made that. Also he gets a lot of money for a long time.  &gt; Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot  The playoffs would suggest he would have to. As taking away Simmons has been a easy winning strategy for 4 years now."
"Get Bam, Middleton, and Tobias Harris"
Not “end of bench” but Tobias Harris’ brother was on the Blue Coats a couple years ago.
Who would you replace CJ with? The only players I can think of is middling role players and at that point they would rather have a borderline all star then paying a Duncan Robinson roughly 20 million and spending the rest on some crappy over the hill wing like Ariza. If you do replace CJ with those middling role players then what does that leave you a worse offense and a ever so slightly better defense but you rely on who to score the other I don’t know other 60-80 points to win assuming Dame gives you a 35 points every games? You assume they can do something with the cap CJ occupies but what can they actually do besides replace him with a similar player on the same contract. No the Blazers had opportunities to go after what they really need a third star but decided that Crabbe etc are better then them to the point where their young players have no value because they never play and their picks also have no value unless Dame leaves. So what are they left with Dame is unhappy and CJ is their player worth anything in a trade but they have no other assets besides decent role players and picks that they need to either help Dame now or build when/if Dame request a trade. They didn’t need a bonafide all star they needed a Tobias Harris or Gordon Hayward but they never pulled the trigger of even looked at it till this point.
"It can always get worse and it will probably get worse (confidence and shooting issues don't usually get better). Since you think Simmons is a star and is somehow being held back by Tobias Harris, why don't we place a friendly bet? 30 Bucks to the charity of our choice on whether Simmons can actually a factor deep in the playoffs. Obviously he still has to be on the Sixers for this bet to matter."
"Who cares if he can't shoot? There's plenty of other people on other teams that can shoot. Dude had an all-star season averaging 14/7/7/1.6/.6 and got the all defensive first team. It's ridiculous that people act like he's trash because he doesn't shoot. Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot"
Your right.  Selling low on a 25 year old all star is the key to winning a championship. We should build around Tobias Harris instead.
Tobias Harris just turned 29 like a week ago
Tobias Harris is 6 months older than Buddy Hield
"I love this for us. We’ve talked about getting Tobias Harris earlier in the year, then Simmons’ value cratered and suddenly he’s more gettable for us. Tobi would be great for us. Not as good as Simmons imo, but still great."
I feel like CJ is in the same tier with Tobias Harris. Fringe all star. But to be fair before he got hurt this season he was playing like an AS.
I have always believed Embiid and Simmons together isn't perfect but you can work around it by getting shooters and playmakers around them. Instead our FO's next decisions were to max Tobias Harris and throw $25M at Al Horford. It's a shame we'll never know what an Embiid/Simmons pairing surrounded by shooters and playmakers would look like.
Not when you are paying tobias harris that contract
"&gt;, even if it meant making bad long-term decisions (see Tobias Harris for JJ Reddick). I love t  THIS. I'll give herb credit for keeping the bucks in mke. That's great, he's also the reason the bucks were awful for 29 of his 30 years of ownership."
"Sixers don't trade Ben simmons, but instead move Tobias Harris for CJ MCCollum, and make McCollum the starting PG and move Ben to PF and treat him like a point forward.   McCollum fits way better with Embiid and Simmons (compared to harris), and this is the team's final hurrah in making the Simmons/Embiid pairing work.   Creates a big question mark at SG for the sixers, as they can't responsibly start mccollum and curry together as the backcourt, but i could see this being the move and gives them a point guard that can shoot the 3 ball, spread the floor, and create for others.  For, the blazers, it gives Dame a skilled forward to work with (harris excels at scoring in the paint - where the sixers already have embiid and simmons who both score in the paint), allows them to pay Norman Powell and slot him in at SG. Harris is also a pretty solid rebounder.   Harris/McCollum are both fringe all stars that are similarly overpaid and a swap could benefit sixers and blazers (potentially).     The real hot take here is that the sixers don't trade simmons, but this is the rationale around it."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"Herb Kohl selling the team is a big reason the Bucks won a championship. New ownership really invested in the organization and built a winning culture.   Herb wanted to make the playoffs every year, even if it meant making bad long-term decisions (see Tobias Harris for JJ Reddick). I love the dude for ensuring the franchise stayed in Milwaukee, but he held the organization back for years"
"Okay, but shot creation is still needed. You have Matisse Thybulle, Simmons and Embiid who could easily offset the defensive decencies of Seth and CJ. That would be a pretty lethal lineup. I don’t really want Tobias Harris as number #2 though so it’s not a trade I want, but I think you’re underestimating CJs potential fit."
Lillard for Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris has been my prediction for the last month or so. Probably won’t happen but would be interesting.
May I interest you in one Tobias Harris
"&gt; Okay, so who do you buy low on?   Well it has to be someone with a big contract so they can trade away CJ. Tobias Harris is the only guy that comes to mind.    Harrison Barnes would be great but there's zero reason for the Kings to even entertain such a trade."
Hornets wouldn’t be awful:  Kemba  LaMelo  SGA  Tobias Harris  Washington
This is pretty much the scenario. Unless we can snag Tobias Harris instead but with Simmons on the outs I doubt they consider trading Harris.   Other option maybe is try to add enough picks or simons/little to try and convince NOP to trade us Ingram
Better player unlikely but a better fit should be doable.  CJ seems to be the same level as a Tobias Harris or Hayward who both seem like better fits.
The hate is mostly about what his value is now.  When considering the cap hit from his contract and his currently reduced performance for whatever reason his spot on the roster has one of the most negative values in the league.  His career puts him above someone like Shawn Kemp and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.  The issue is that his current contract puts him in Tobias Harris or John Wall territory.
"NBA should have their very best making insane $$$ relative to their teammates, but they need to do it smarter. they should have ONE slot per team where the team owner can throw the bank at getting a supreme player with a Godfather offer (maybe you set an upper salary limit for this player at like $100-150 million a year), but not have that number count against the regular cap. then the rest of the team is capped as usual, so basically the 2nd best guy can still command a $30-40 mill salary if his production matches expectation and all of the luxury tax/repeater tax/etc. gets applied to the combined salaries of players 2-15, not that alpha player. that way, a small market team can at least bid for Giannis or Lebron if their owner is deep-pocketed and willing to spend, and failing that, not get hamstrung by overpaying to re-sign say Kemba Walker or Tobias Harris (i.e. really good but not great players) to a huge number that almost immediately wrecks the team's flexibility going forward when those guys are getting paid in the neighborhood of Lebron, KD or Steph but clearly not at the same level  i think if you then tie on certain conditions, like once those upper tier guys sign a deal they HAVE TO honor the full years on the deal and not try to bail out for greener pastures prematurely (like AD/Harden), i think there'd be more parity. there'd be less concentrating of the very best players, and there'd be more money for the mid-tier/bench players since the salary cap hit from the main guy is no longer there (e.g. if say the salary cap for Golden State is $120 million and Steph is owed $40 mill, that's $80 mill spread around 14 other guys before luxury tax comes in; but if Steph's $$$ isn't counted, then that's $120 mill to be shared around 14 guys, providing the salary cap stays the same)"
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe for Tobias Harris and a future second
"If they were able to trade Simmons for harden at the start of the season they would probably be champions right now. We all know via capella what harden can do with a competent big, now multiply that by 5 with prime Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Danny green and a good supporting cast"
Yes but league efficiency at that volume for a 22 year old is great to borderline elite that is only trounced by what all nba players or legit all multi time all stars. Yeah that means teams do not want what CJ McCollum oh wait he got maxed or how about Tobias Harris oh wait he got maxed as well. To say teams do not want scorers unless they are steph curry level efficient  or good is dumb there will always be a hole for efficient scorers like Sexton to get maxed or near maxed it’s just how the league works. Plus yeah if league average  efficiency isn’t good enough that’s the same as saying Donovan Mitchell isn’t a good enough scorer.
Tobias Harris.
22/7/6 for Butler vs 18/9/3 for Embiid. Butler also won Game 2 on the road by himself and would have won Game 4 by himself in Embiid put up more than 11 points and Tobias Harris didn’t shoot 2-13 from three in a 5 point loss. Sucks that y’all let your best player in the last 15 years leave for Josh Richardson 😭😭😭
"Sure, but Embiid will (rightfully) demand they trade those picks for win now pieces. The obvious one is moving Tobias and his fat contract for an allstar, since he's unreliable in the playoffs. They arent beating Brooklyn with a core of Embiid, McCollum, and Harris. Maybe not even the Bucks now that they'll have the Championship confidence/chemistry next season."
"Lmao why did you delete your comment?   Here’s my reply to what you deleted  They traded dlo cause they weren’t happy with him. They literally said this. They did not like him. Magic literally went and trashed the dude in the media. It was also a full year before Lebron signed, they didn’t even need to do it then.   Lopez would’ve been amazing next to bron. What are you talking about. Do you see him next to giannis? Lopez can catch lobs. He’d also give you solid defense and can shoot three.   And I agree randle would be a bad fit next to bron. But they just let him go for nothing. I can’t see any team doing that. The clippers got back Tobias harris, Avery Bradley, boban, and a pick which they used on shai. You picked the worst example to make your point. That’s exactly why I’m saying they should’ve re-signed randle lol. You could’ve got back something…anything.    Don’t forget shai is what helped them get PG.   Which clippers signing fell flat this year? Batum, rondo, ibaka were amazing pickups. They got rid of Lou Williams too when they got rondo. Kawhi asked them to get smarter and that’s what they did. Kennard was a 40% shooter too, so idk why you acting like he’s trash. His contract is just ass."
Somewhere between Tobias Harris and Christian Wood
Tobias Harris. who incidentally is another overpaid 'max' player
Tobias Harris
Let's talk about a Tobias Harris - Trae Young swap then
Fuck Tobias Harris. Wish I didnt put that because it's only thing people care about.  I just dont understand sacrificing your future not to have a chance to contend
Clearly not lol you don't even know how to spell vucevic and you think Tobias Harris is better than Lavine. Really shows your depth of knowledge regarding the Bulls.
"""very low end of fringe"" wtf? Vuc and Lavine were both all-stars last season. You clearly don't know jackshit about the Bulls if you think Tobias Harris is better than Lavine. Lavine averaged 28/5/5 last season shooting 42% from 3 on 8 attempts a game. Ask any Sixer fan, they will gladly trade Tobias Harris for Lavine and it would be a runaway steal for the Sixers."
"Other than my Tobias Harris comment, I stand by everything that has been said"
"Aside from the Tobias Harris comment, I still stand by everything I said."
Lol this post has nothing to do with Tobias Harris but that's all everyone cares about
Fuck Tobias Harris its probably the most irrelevant thing about my post.
"&gt; I would even argue that Tobias Harris is better than any player on the Bulls.  This is a really bad take. I'm not saying Zach LaVine is going to go out and win you a Championship, but come on, Harris is like the 3rd (at one point, 4th) best player on the 76ers who can't even make the Conference Finals. Before bouncing around about 10 different teams and made the Playoffs once, on a team that got swept in the first round where he was still probably the third best player (with a closer gap)."
"Lmao this has to be bait.  Lavine just averaged 27 PPG on 63.4% TS. Tobias Harris has never even come close to touching that level of play.   Yeah the team may not win a championship with this roster but it’s about building a winning culture and becoming a legit destination that top players want to play for.   Yes the bulls are a big market, but we don’t have the same type of allure as places like Miami/LA bc well we’re not a tropical beach city. And up until recently we were known to have a penny-pinching toxic FO.   AK and ME are trying to change things and they’ve made a lot of progress in just one year. They’re making good trades, signing big name free agents like Demar. Fans and other players take notice of that type of buzz. I much prefer this than to keep being ass and drafting at #7 hoping for the lucky chance to get a superstar.  I also think you’re vastly underestimating this team. They definitely have weaknesses, but it’s a pretty well constructed roster with a lot of flexibility."
I fucking hate when people can’t tell that Zach Lavine is a significantly better basketball player than Tobias Harris just because Lavine’s team has always been shit. Too many people like u out here talking about basketball when u have no business talking about it
"Come on now, Lavine is better than Tobias Harris."
"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.  Look at the end of the day there's no needle-changing player that Portland can obtain right now. But by competent I mean moving away from an undersized backcourt and giving Dame a proper 2-way forward which he hasn't had since Nic Batum dipped.  Unfortunately trying to find a proper 2-way forward to pair with Dame is extremely difficult right now considering who may or may not be available and the fact that CJ's contract diminishes his actual value.  The big names I've heard are Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam. I don't think Harris is going anywhere; his contract is an albatross but he provides consistent value to Philly who's looking to contend with Embiid right now.  Siakam may be available, but it'd probably take CJ + all of Portland's firsts and I don't think Portland dumping the bank for Pascal is the needle-changing move. It gets them to a second-round exit at best and I'd also be worried about the fit of Siakam and RoCo since I don't trust either of those guys to defend the 3.   Harrison Barnes is the worst of those 3 guys but not by a huge margin and I think with the right trade CJ could be swapped for Barnes without having to fork over a ton of draft picks.  This is allows you to build a competent team around Dame to the best of your abilities and if Dame still decides to dip it's a lot easier to build for the future by owning your own picks and having trade-able assets."

"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.   In a vacuum absolutely, but Barnes is a much better *fit* on the Blazers who haven't had a proper 2-way wing since Nic Batum.

"Is forking over CJ + a warchest of firsts for Pascal Siakam really the right move though? That might get them to a second round exit at best.  Also would you be worried about the fit of RoCo and either Pascal/Tobias Harris? Both of the latter two guys are power forwards and I just see RoCo as a 4 in today's league, especially since he's a better help defender than on-ball guy."
"I understand your point, though, don't necessarily agree I just understand the statement your trying to make. You don't need to be top 10 in the NBA at your position to get paid that kind of money in fact I can think of a few players off top my head that may not be considered top 10 at their position making 100M or well above the avg to hit that with a longer contract: SGA, Tobias Harris, Trae Young (Depending on the list or who is arguing it,) John Wall, DeAaron Fox. Those are just the PGs for the most part I have listed except Tobi.   The real issue for Dennis is timing and positioning and he failed with both! Actually the real statement is he and his agent failed with both, as another redditor mentioned you kinda gotta question what advice was he really given? If timing was aligned for a decent jump in salary cap last year before he was traded and got the chance to be a FA (Aka if he was available) during that time there is a very real scenario where he would get the type of money he was looking for 100M? Maybe not 80M+ woulda have been likely, because, as you can see teams at the time where willing to offer him good money as noted from the Lakers initial contract extension offer. So, 1st the timing was poor and now the positioning is just as poor as the timing because Dennis decided to bet on himself and shit the bed. It is what it is and he must live with it, but, when you go 0 points in a playoff game as a starting PG that will just tank your value unlike any other, this is where we agree with the not top 10 part. We both are essentially saying his value has diminished so much how could he see himself at 84 mil at this point? That is the key at this point, last year coming of a 6 man of the year candidacy much better situation overall to get his money.  The bigger and better question is when the Lakers approached him about his contract extension what visuals were going on in his and his agents head? Did they consider him an All-star? Irreplaceable?Because lemme tell you that is not what 6th men are. What position did he think he could be much better in other than competing for a championship with the Lakers at a higher salary than deserved along with AD and Lebron?"
"Yeah, if you can turn Buddy and Bagley and a pick into a Siakam or Tobias Harris level forward that's a fun 7-10 seed."
Tobias Harris thanking god for the sixers.
Tobias Harris. - this guy shrinks under pressure  Kyle Lowry.  PJ Tucker.  Pat Bev.
Yes because MJ and Pippen were scrawny individuals and can’t take on Tobias Harris…
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
The vibes I get from this post is from that one dude who had irrational hate for Tobias Harris
Announce Tobias Harris to the Mavs.
Oh yeah Dame is ridiculous. That shit ain't happening in a million years. I can see where you coming from their. The most logical deal is one for House and Wall with that package. I'm a refrain from saying why Ben Simmons(or Tobias Harris) COULD happen until the off season gets further along but just gonna say their are options. Mostly very overpaid options but options nether the less.
"Honest question, because I don’t watch that many Kings games when they’re not playing Miami: is Tobias Harris really that much of an improvement over Barnes, before you take the contracts and Bagley into account?"
"Seth Curry(45% 3pt), Danny Green(40% 3pt), Tobias Harris(39% 3pt), Joel Embiid(38% 3pt).  When Green got hurt in the playoffs they replaced him with Korkmaz(37.5% 3pt)  The 76ers had pretty much as perfect of a roster construction as you could ever hope to put around Simmons in the NBA without moving him to Center."
Would you trade Simmons and Tobias Harris for Dame?
"You think Thybulle, Maxey, Tobias Harris + a second rounder gets it done?"
"and Kevin Knox was the next superstar in the making cuz he had a couple amazing dunks.  Good ol days... :(  Side note, I really thought Tobias Harris type was Knox's absolute floor. At this race, the guy might not even have a place int he NBA."
"There was a time where Al Horford and Tobias Harris were the two highest paid 6ers. Yes it was a much different FO, but I don't take anything for granted."
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)).

Who's first? Tobias Harris? Lol
Tobias. Harris.
Tobias Harris would be the first example of an overpaid player. Second would be giving Andre Drummond anything over 2 million
Maybe a decent one like John Collins or Tobias Harris?
"He had a few but our offense was based on the Jackson/Drummond pick and roll surround by KCP, Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris for shooting. I really thought that team had more potential than they showed. Future finally shows some promise now though."
"It's really amazing how being on a winning team has affected the perception of Ben Simmons compared to Fox and Lavine. Simmons is a really good player but he's like the 3rd option on offense and Tobias Harris is better than anyone Lavine has played with in Chicago (not counting Vuc) and better than anyone Fox has played with and that's just Tobias Harris, Simmons also has an MVP caliber player with him as well. If Simmons was the best player on Sacramento or Chicago are they winning much more than they are now? I'm not convinced they would be."
Tobias Harris is a power forward.
"You have to be a nephew to think KP has no value. This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making.  Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Let's not even get into about 10 guy that have straight toxic deals like John Wall, Tobias Harris, (formerly) Kemba or Simmons.  THJ, especially on the new deal, and Kleber have more value than DFS."
"All these dudes are about the same on the level of tier “goodness”.   Tim Thomas = Shitty, but taller, Tobias Harris   Rodney Rodgers = Marvin Williams but more physical   Magloire = Nurk with less of a shot and worse passing   Lafrentz = Lauri, literally but better in the post."
"Woj literally reported the deal was Ingram a first and loul deng (a negative asset who we’d have to take back as a salary filler). Spurs wanted more and the Lakers said no. Sure you can argue that in hindsight Ingram and a first is a good deal, but DeRozan, Poeltl and a first was an even better deal at that time.    Kawhi had no value because he tanked it. The other offers the Spurs had were from the Celtics who didn’t offer sophomore Brown or rookie Tatum. The sixers who wouldn’t even offer Markelle fultz, the Heat whose “god father” offer was centered around Hassan whiteside and Josh Richardson, and the Clippers whose deal was an expiring Tobias Harris and a lottery pick.  Kawhi was out the previous year with a quad and knee injury his team tried to debunk, was on an expiring deal, and had a camp that threatened teams with the possibility of him sitting out another year, and made it known he was going to go to Los Angeles which lead to no teams wanting to give up anything of value."
"&gt; The right move could’ve continued the dynasty and they failed to make it  There was no move the spurs could've made to continue a dynasty lol. Even if we traded for Ingram instead of DeMar, we probably make the playoffs 1 or 0 times since the trade.  Really the best offer was Tobias Harris and 2 very late lottery picks. If we don't trade up for SGA, that trade could easily blow up in the spurs faces as we are then forced to either let Harris walk or overpay him like the sixers did."
The best offer was always going to be Tobias Harris and the 12th and 13th pick in the 2018 draft(back when Tobias was only making $16 mil). That's not what Popovich wanted though he wanted more of a win now timeline.
Tobias Harris
"PG: Lonzo Ball, SG: De'Aaron Fox, SF: OG, PF: Tobias Harris, C: DeAndre Ayton"
"Lamelo Ball SGH OG Anunoby Tobias Harris Deandre Ayton  2nd round exit maybe. Could use Jamal Murray instead of Lamelo, or Jeremi Grant/MPJ instead of Tobias, but I think the spacing and switch ability is at its best with those five.   OG is an absolute must include though, you aren’t getting defence that versatile with serviceable offence from any other non-all star player in the league that I can think of"
"trae young, westbrook, middleton, tobias harris, bam adebayo"
"SGA Mccollum MPJ Tobias Harris Capela  this was a great question btw. I think they would be a finals team, 50/50 to win if they played the nets and over 75% chance to win if they played pretty much anyone else"
"""yea I'll give you tobias harris and *maybe* a pick for kawhi"""
"Just as much, if not more, than Ben Simmons had he been on a team without Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris. Plus, hE mAdE aN AlLsTaR TeAm really falls flat when you look at all-star representation based on market size."
Joel was asked about the game and brought up a specific play where Ben Simmons messed up. Yes pointing out a specific play where a teammate messed up and saying that's when things went wrong is throwing him under the bus lol.  You didn't see any sixers saying that type of thing after Tobias Harris scored 4 points on 11 shots in a 3 point loss.
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris both had 4 point games in the playoffs yet I’ve seen far more people bring up Ben’s and excuse away Tobias’.
"What do you think you're getting for a selfish, inefficient chucker who is okay on defense? I would be a little disappointed if the Kings just signed Oubre for more than the minimum, much less trading one of our best assets for him and a late first lol. Also, to sign and trade for Oubre he'd have to sign for at least 3 years.   Buddy is literally one of the greatest shooters in NBA history. God knows he's flawed, but shooting is extremely valuable in this league, plus he's on a declining deal. There absolutely will be a team willing to give us fair value for him - maybe we package him and other pieces for Tobias Harris, New Orleans is in desperate need of spacing for Zion, Atlanta has too many good young players right now to be in the rotation, the list goes on and on. Trading Buddy for a *significant* downgrade and a late first (I can't imagine your FO giving multiple for Buddy) is just terrible, we should just keep him at that point"
This is going to look bad in 2 years. Reminds me of Tobias Harris swindling the Sixers after 1 good year.
Tobias Harris. He turned down like a $80 million extension for a 5 year $180 million contract.   that one worked out spectacularly
Fun fact Tobias Harris was drafted by the bobcats
I’d love to hear the rationale as to why paying a guy who put up 25/4/7 on 57% TS with solid defense isn’t worth Tobias Harris money
Tobias Harris didn’t show up in the biggest moment either but he’s getting a pass.
Tobias Harris was on the worst contact in the league the minute dipshit duo Elton Brand/Brett Brown signed him to that extension. Great job by the Bullets FO

Never knew Tobias Harris was on the Wizards at one time
And yet you brought up Tobias Harris and Derozan.
Tobias Harris is on a 5 yr 180m contract. Hayward is making more than Julius. 31 yo Derozan is making 4m less
"Idk if you guys realize how huge of a discount this is. Based on this structure he'll be making:  2022-2023: $26,000,000  2023-2024: $28,000,000  2024-2025: $30,000,000  2026-2027: $32,000,000  If he had waited until next year for a 5 year max, his contract would have looked like:  2022-2023: $34,700,000  2023-2024: $37,500,000  2024-2025: $40,200,000  2026-2027: $45,800,000   You can argue whether he was worth it or not, but considering what other players are getting paid, this is huge. He left behind like 8-10 mil per year to stay with us. PLUS the contract only kicks in after next year. I want you to understand that we have locked up an All NBA 2nd Team player whose only 26 through his entire prime in today's NBA for an average of 30 mil a year.    TINGIS PINGIS IS GETTING PAID MORE MONEY TO PLAY LESS BASKETBALL AT A LOWER LEVEL. Per year he's getting paid 6 mil less than Tobias Harris, 5 less than Simmons/Trae/Siakam, 4 less than Jrue, 3 less than CJ, 3 less than Fox, and in the range of many more guys that are younger and not just yet entering their prime.    Don't get me wrong, he likely wouldn't have gotten the max, but his per year number would have been way closer to the max than it would have been to this had he waited until next year to sign. He's been an absolute iron man for us too."
"Ok, ok, we'll send Tobias Harris straight up for Dame to try to help the Blazers out."
I point this out about Tobias Harris when people say he’s better than CJ McCollum and nobody wants to hear it lol.
"A is Middleton, B is Tobias Harris, C is a ghost. Don’t know if OP is doing someone’s first or last 77 games or just made a typo"
Would you say he’s better than Tobias Harris
"Yeah, it's going to get to a point where other teams won't deal with Philly unless they're the clear winner of the Simmons trade.  That roster also happens to consist of the best center in the game right now, the best 3 point shooter, by percentage ever, one of the best 3&amp;D players in the league and Tobias Harris who's good but not easily described in a few words."
"Getting rid of max contracts would he the best route for the NBA from a parity standpoint but the NBPA would never agree and also it turns out superteams get ratings.  Think about this. Bron AD and Westbrook will run you about $110 million a year. Mike Conley, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love is about $100 million. Yes I intentionally chose some terrible contracts but maybe the latter 3 were actually worth that at the time of signing. But by capping salaries for the former 3 you really stifle teams that don't have one of the handful of superstars out there."
If Tobias Harris is playing then it’s 20-0 for the USA
"Tobias Harris for CJ is a fair switch that would genuinely greatly increase both the their defense cieling and offensive diversity. Plus, roco could be shelled out for a top level 3 and d wing. That is a 4 seed level team, which with luck could go pretty far. The west is more open now than it has been in a while.  But Olshey loves the fact that he drafted cj too much."
How bout Tobias Harris? His defense has improved last two years.
yeah but they shipped his ass to Detroit for Tobias Harris and others IIRC
25m a year good deal hes way better than Tobias Harris
"That’s not fair at all. He’s never been one and was never expected to be one. Just because Steph and Dame play the position a certain way, doesn’t mean he has to and the fact is, he was never expected to. That’s why they brought in the likes of Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris."
"It definitely would kill super teams unless the players colluded to take cuts to play with each other. I think Tobias Harris and Wiggins should probably only be making max 20-25 million a year. Lebron should be making 40 or 50 million depending on his prime. John Collins was holding for a max contract. Idk, the whole league is nuts now. Players have a good year and think they need a max."
Tobias Harris is drastically overpaid but at least he actually contributes.
May I introduce you to Tobias Harris?
Good for him. Tobias Harris getting paid 50% more than this
The sad truth is Tobias Harris would probably be the second best player on the Bulls. Sadly he’s also probably the second best Sixer.
"Yeah I agree it would be the death of super teams unless superstars take actual pay cuts  But man that would kill the Tobias Harris and Wiggins of the league. With so much less money available they would go from 30M a year players to like 15M max and so on   Also older players would get a lot less money like imagine paying booker and Chris Paul the same salary for the next 4 years, bookers agent would get him both of those wages  Free Agency would be a million times better too"
Tobias Harris is a very below-average defender.
Derozan and Ball are signings fans get excited about during the offseason but then realize are hardly better than the Tobias Harris-level players of the league once you actually watch them play and the shine wears off
"I see a lot of portland fans suggesting Siakam or Simmons for CJ. Frankly, I doubt Morey would trade Simmons if the only offer is cj + picks. And I really don't see a path to get Pascal given that the Kings have interest, a better offer for the raptors, and cap space. The raptors have no interest in CJ, and I can't think of a team with cap space who wants the near 30 year old guard.  Tobias Harris for CJ is too reasonable of an offer for this to actually happen. It would make both teams significantly better though, imo."
"Harris would fill the humongous lack of SF/PFs the blazers have and provide consistent offense while being less of a hindrance on defense (actually I’m not sure if Toby plays good D, just know a Dame / CJ defense is not able to be good under any circumstance). I dunno, I’d certainly be more excited with a Dame / Norm / Tobias / R Cov / Nurk lineup than just running it back with our 3 guard lineup that puts Norm up against SFs.  But yea, dunno if Philly makes that trade, Tobias had a pretty solid season last year even if he wasn’t very good in the playoffs, and CJ was just horrible in the playoffs in that Austin Rivers was absolutely killing him."
"&gt;Caruso is not a willing shooter he has averaged 2.1 three point attempts in the last 3 years.  He's averaged 20 minutes per game the last three years. He took 5.5 attempts per 100 possessions, which is below average but fine, and in-line with the volume of guys like Tobias Harris, Harrison Barnes, and Chris Paul. He was also more comfortable this year taking shots even when he wasn't wide open, which is important.  &gt;Of course Curry is going to be heavily guarded from three and he’s the best shooter ever so naturally he will make more difficult shots than 37 year old Carmelo Anthony.  This is a total non-sequitur. Nobody disagrees with this.  &gt;It’s not Carmelo’s fault that he has the luxury of more open shots.  My point is that if your best shooter is just above average and can't even play more than 20 minutes per game, and if your second best shooter is LeBron (while sharing the floor with AD and Westbrook), that team is a very very bad shooting team. Not sure how anyone can disagree with this.  &gt;Why are you downplaying other peoples percentages who happen to get more open threes?  Because if you're open, you should have higher percentages. That's the entire point. 38% from three is good on its face. However, league average when you're wide open is 39-40%. If you only take wide open shots but you shoot worse than 39%, that makes you below league average.   If you have a team of 37% shooters, but they only take wide open shots, that would be a team of terrible shooters. A team of shooters that shoots 35% on a mix of attempts on higher volume is more valuable and are better shooters than the first group."
"I love that Brett Brown was made the executive of the 76ers 2 weeks before the draft, and he traded away Mikal Bridges for Zharie Smith and a the 2021 Miami 1st round pick (which was traded for Tobias Harris)"
"Tbf that was post process  That had a clean capsheet, good role players on good contracts, and a bunch of picks. They turned it into half a season of Jimmy Butler, a season of Al Horford who they then had to attach assets to to trade, and Tobias Harris on an oversized contract"
"I think the figures that they put up after the game in our media were something like Argentina's U23 team was worth $200m on the transfer market, Australia's was worth $20m.  You could get the entire victorious team for half a Tobias Harris."
"I don't know about that. There are players that are similarly productive with similarly bad contacts. Tobias Harris, for instance."
"Didn’t the blazers sweep Philly this season? Like Dame is loyal as can be, if he gets to the point of asking out, I promise it will not be to Philly. And what 2 players are you talking about? Because if Philly even had a chance to trade for Dame, they would send out Simmons, whatever young talent there is, and picks… Tobias Harris isn’t anything special if you’re referring to him."
"The timeline would be similar but there a ton of killer mistakes made and some terrible luck.  Having so many busts or underachieving picks. Okafor, Fultz, Zhaire Smith, and to some degree Simmons.  The year we had to sign the right guys we ended up with Tobias Harris and Al Horford.  So many wasted assets. Hinkie built up a war chest and it was squandered completely when it was time to turn it in."
Tobias Harris barely missed it last season as well. Would have been a funny name on that list as well.
yea but you kind of mess it up when you trade a bunch of your assets for the right to give tobias harris a max. Colangelo and Brand could have built a very long term competitive team by just making solid draft picks with the warchest but they tried to expedite it way too quick
"Harris was more efficient than CJ this year and also isn't one of the worst defenders in the league. Shooting splits can be incredibly misleading because they don't look at how much of each shot you take. Tobias has been more efficient each of the last 3 years. That said, it's not a crazy opinion by any means and a very good answer for this post."
CJ McCollum is clearly better than Tobias Harris.  The argument for Tobias I always hear is; “a lot of teams would definitely rather have a PF that isn’t bad on defense and can score so they would take Tobias”....but I just don’t think they are close enough to justify it.  CJ can get taken off his game a bit in the playoffs but as a starter he’s putting up 22.5-4.5-3-1 on 45/40/77 shooting splits.  Tobias is 18-9-4-1 (with less blocks per game than CJ) but I see someone that takes him self out of games and disappears far too often as well as someone whose defense is overrated.  Edit: Tobias’ shooting splits: 45/33/86
Tobias is a good player on a bad contract and thus a net negative. I don't think any realistic trade surrounding Tobias Harris is possible
I would give up Tobias Harris/picks.   I’m very far from a Ben Simmons fan but I wouldn’t give up Simmons to get LaVine
The Sixers already have a stretch 4 that they're paying $30M+ a year to named Tobias Harris.
lol. Why doesnt the Sixers simply make Seth Curry into Steph Curry and Tobias Harris into Klay Thompson?
So is Tobias Harris and Andre Drummond.
"yo Dlo on the 6ers could be great. Goes all in on shooting/scoring around Embiid. Joel by himself is a passable defense + Green and Harris is solid enough and they have some specialists if needed (Thybulle) so I doubt defense will be a huge problem (except when Embiid sits...) and that starting 5 would be INSANE on offense. Dlo/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid. You have 3 guys who can create, all 5 are respectable to great from 3, and you can spread the floor like crazy when Embiid wants to take over + if Dlo also can take over sometimes if Embiid can't for some reason.  Honestly that sounds like a load of fun please Morey do it!"
Didn’t know Tobias Harris was top 5 in 3pt % last season 👍🏽
So a poor man's Tobias Harris is what Philly needs?😂🤣
"&gt; Do you honestly think LeBron would have went to the Lakers had they did not clean up front office?   Yes, of course, he was going to LA regardless.  You go into these super long irrelevant tangents and I don't get it. Jordan, Ballmer, MIKE TYSON? LOL dude this is so irrelevant it's incredible.  You're comparing Wiggins and Tobias Harris to LeBron hahahahahahaha holy shit!  &gt;I'm sure you think that one All-star break where Kyrie and KD spoke to each other is when they decided to team up right?  No I'm sure it was even earlier actually. Probably more like December is when Kyrie decided  Can't wait for a rant about Joe Smith or something next. Dude LeBron does what he wants and others adapt, it's not the other way around."
"LeBron and Wade spoke about it but nothing was [in fruition.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834128-dwyane-wade-lebron-james-prioritized-bulls-looked-at-knicks-in-summer-of-2010)  That is Wade's own words, he did not think they would play together and I'd say every single media fan and analyst thought the same. I acknowledge I should go back to the gym but hey, words are just words.  Do you honestly think LeBron would have went to the Lakers had they did not clean up front office? Kobe told Jeanie Buss well in advanced prior to LeBron's free agency to fix front office.  &gt;“I’ll tell you, when Jeanie Buss came to me and said, ‘I really want to go after [LeBron],’ I said, ‘Jeanie, he’s not coming here until you clean up this s— here.' The last thing LeBron wants to do is come to an organization that has a lot of infighting, a lot of the stuff going on. Jeanie, it’s time for you to take ownership of this franchise. He’s not going to come if you don’t.”  Let's recap what that meant. Long time GM Mitch Kupchak of 17 years was fired and replaced by Kobe's former agent, Rob Pelinka. A person that has never worked the lines but given full trust and chance at a lifetime strictly by Kobe's association.   Jeanie had to fire her own brother Jim Buss from VP of operations for Magic Johnson. Oh did I mention it was a family [court battle?](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/jeanie-jim-buss-rivalry-lakers-family-siblings-jerry-death-ownership-lawsuit) That's not even the bulk of what actually happened, it was a [complete Kardashian episode](https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-jim-jeanie-buss-trust-20170326-story.html) amongst the entire family including filing for restraining orders.  So yeah maybe having Magic Johnson instead of Jim Buss had a huge indirect or even direct influence on LeBron. Magic Johnson already wanted to clear house, he was already wary on Luke Walton but Jeanie wanted him to stay. Johnson also got rid of their second overall pick D'Angelo Russell, remember that noise with Iggy and Swaggy P?  &gt;A miniscule paycut for a guy making the max and who was already on pace to be a potential billionaire is really not a key point  Man ignorance is bliss. I have so many things I could add. Michael Jordan wasn't even a billionaire that time and it was still unheard of any professional athlete could make that. Michael Jordan paid 275M for 97% ownership of the Charlotte Hornets. He only hit that three comma club status because all the teams shot up in value after the Donald Sterling incident. Yes it was that long ago, Steve Ballmer paid record 2 billion dollars which all franchise including the Hornets made Jordan a billionaire for the first time in his career. Fact check it.  So stop that bullshit right now. Mike Tyson squandered 300M, at that time everyone fought for max deals scared of anything sudden that could be career ending. No one GM people for ""future risk/assessment"" like they do now. You think Wiggins, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, or Drummond is anywhere worth the contracts they signed for at the time? People intentionally went out of their way during the last year of the contracts to boast in value. Anyone and everyone at the time fought for each and every penny.  I'm not sure if you're referring to LeBron's decision about Miami or Lakers at this point. I'm sure you think that one All-star break where Kyrie and KD spoke to each other is when they decided to team up right? You do realize shit happens all the time and deals fall apart. You can bullshit your way to anything but at the end of the day, you're still wrong, but hey whatever makes you happy."
Man is a certified Tobias Harris whisperer.
"Your username could be blanked out and I would still be able to guess your posts lmao  He’s pretty good at focusing players on what they’re good at. This worked wonders for tobias harris, doc simplified the game for him and he had a career season. On the flip side, maybe the sixers wouldn’t be in the situation they are now if doc wasn’t whispering in ben’s ear like wormtongue that he doesn’t need to worry about scoring."
"Yeah true. But who would you take, BI or Tobias Harris? Or even Ben Simmons?"
C: Nikola Jokic  F: Tobias Harris  F: Klay Thompson   G: Anthony Edwards   G: Luka Doncic
Naw he wouldn’t have traded Simmons. He just would have never made the Tobias Harris trade
I agree. And not just because we don't want Ben. Ben is an all star player and Wiggins is a great role player. He won't make the Sixers better without Ben there. They need a legitimate #1 or #2 scorer and Wiggins is like Tobias Harris. A great #3.
"Isn't he pretty similar to Tobias Harris in terms of skillset and fit for the Sixers though? Is 2 SFs who don't really create for others really that much more useful than a PG who can't create for himself? I am not trying to argue that Ben is good for the Sixers, but I don't think Wiggins is that much better. Seems like he doesn't fix any of the issues that keeping Ben presents."
"There are teams that would kill for 3 years of bad 2nd round performances. Not every team has the same goals. A bottomfeeder team would absolutely pay him the max just to get them to the playoffs.  Not to mention he could work in the Draymond Green role on a different team. Part of the issue with the 76ers is roster construction. They're built around Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. You've got a center and 2 PF as your 3 best players. That spacing is going to be horrendous. Put him on a team with actual shooters, where he can play some minutes as a small ball 5, and he could shine."
"It just depends how far Morey _and Embiid_ are willing to go.  They have their first this year. And next. They could make up some bullshit injury for Embiid, load manage Tobias Harris and Danny Green, develop Maxey and BBall Paul, and just generally Process it up until Simmons decides he might actually like to have a career."
Tobias Harris when the Sixers get rid of Simmons and still lose.
"I feel like KAT and D’Lo for Embiid would be a more interesting question. Obviously the salaries don’t work, but the whole point of the trade rumors is that Simmons and Embiid don’t work well together.   Would a lineup of KAT, Ben Simmons, DLo, Tobias Harris, and Danny Green contend for a title? I think it would. The 76ers also wouldn’t need to worry about Embiid’s health.   For the Wolves, I feel like they could talk themselves into being able to build a contender around an Embiid + Ant pairing. Embiid is also locked in for another 5 years, so they wouldn’t need to worry about him re-signing, like they will with KAT. A lineup featuring Embiid, Ant, McDaniels, and Beasley has a ton of potential. They’d just need to find a good starting PG."
"&gt;Why would they need defensive help? They have a DPOY caliber center, an All-Defense wing defender and another above average wing defender, along with Tobias Harris who's at least average defensively. A team doesn't need to have elite defenders 1-5 lol.  Because defense is good? They lose a DPOY caliber player here my dude, having 3 good defenders on a roster doesn't exactly scream ""We don't need more defense."" They get CJ here, so they might as well get RoCo on top who can make shots from the 3p line and defend the perimeter, offball and play elite help with his IQ."
"Why would they need defensive help? They have a DPOY caliber center, an All-Defense wing defender and another above average wing defender, along with Tobias Harris who's at least average defensively. A team doesn't need to have elite defenders 1-5 lol.  What they need more than anything is a half court playmaker, because their offense is the problem, not the defense. If it were the defense they wouldn't be trading Simmons in the first place."
Screw shot selection. Give Josh Smith a league average jumper and he’s the best version of Tobias Harris.
"The Queens- Unless Fox takes a big leap this year, I don’t see them going anywhere.   The Timberpups- disappointed that they have that much talent (KAT, DLo, Edwards) but the highest they can do is a first round exit as currently constructed.   Sixers - Even if they do a Ben Simmons trade, the best they can be is a perennial 2nd rd exit. Tobias Harris is straight up untrade-able unless Philly is willing to bite the bullet on that one as well.   I also agree with your picks, OP."
"Ingram, been a long list of quality guards on the market over the past 3 years.  With a wing scorer on the team,  Philly still makes the trade for Butler but pays him and swaps the Tobias Harris assets for a point guard."
"Obvious choices Simmons and Gobert. But I think Jokic came back to earth in the playoffs against the Suns and hasn't won anything significant.   CJ McCollum has come up small a lot, as well. Tobias Harris has to be up there.....essentially anyone involved in Simmons trade talks."
"Dude they put Danny Green and Seth Curry on the team. Plus added Tobias Harris. Forkmas can shoot. They have plenty of shooting. Stop making excuses for Simmons. He’s a point guard. Period. He shouldn’t be playing short corner dunker lol. That should be embarrassing for him. He should be ashamed of the fact that defenders play him 3-4 steps inside of the 3pt line. That he can’t shoot free throws.   Until he learns to shoot and can put appropriate pressure on a defense, he’s going to hamper the offense. Period. Come playoff time teams will play his accordingly and will highlight his inabilities.   He comes off like a prima-Donna who’s insecure about his game. God forbid Rivers and some of his teammates demand more of him and try to hold him accountable. The reports out there seem to indicate he really doesn’t give a shit too. He’s more concerned about living somewhere he can go out at night then becoming the best player he can be.   If that’s his prerogative - fine. Different things are more important to different people. But let’s not give this guy a pass and make excuses for him. It is what it is - dude is a liability in big, important games."
Trade siakam for tobias harris cowards
"Gallinari two years ago. Almost a fringe all star, a star in that Clippers team, but not really a ""star."" Tobias Harris also fits the bill.  By the way, that Clippers team with Gallo and Tobi was pretty fun."
Biggest winner out of all this Drama.... TOBIAS HARRIS.... he didn't earn those max contract dollars man. He also disappeared when it mattered most. It doesn't excuse Simmons poor play in that Atlanta playoff series though.
"I  mean they aren't paying Tobias Harris 34 million a year to average 17 on .345/.308/1.0 on a .438 TS% in games 5-7 either.   Don't get me wrong, Simmons deserves a *ton* of criticism but he's not the singular reason they lost.  Basically all of the stuff that happened last year also happened this year, although Harris overall and Embiid both played better, they still had their own issues, especially Harris."
Much cheaper options than CJ for that that will also not completely blow up the defense.   I’m sorry but I really hope we don’t ever trade for CJ unless you are interested in Tobias Harris. That’s a trade I’d make.
"He probably feels amazing about trading an overpaid streaky scorer on the wrong side of 30 coming out of an injury for a 3 time all star that also happens to be one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.   CJ is a fucking awful option and would destroy our defense, they can keep him because literally nobody else in the league wants him on that contract.   Sad that people from our team can’t learn this easy lesson from our very own Tobias Harris."
What’s worse than 1 Tobias Harris?
"Yeah he acknowledged it, I'm mostly speaking about the media. Tobias Harris played like ass too but Ben Simmons was just so outrageous that's what everyone focuses on."
"Fred VanVleet, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, Tobias Harris"
Tobias Harris
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jordan Clarkson, and Aaron Gordon"
Tobias Harris
"There is truth in this statement but I really think it is mostly on the player. It is just so surprising to see so such a lack of NBA players who one team wasn't able to develop, and then goes to another team and develops anything close to their predraft potential. For example Dragan Bender was still 21 years old when the Suns gave up on him and no other team was able to get him and then develop him the proper way. Are you telling me that is too old to develop? People think of Juluis Randle but he was consistently improving every year by a sizeable amount and the Lakers didn't want to get rid of him. The most recent case I can think of, of a player who was not developed on one team then went to another one and turned it around is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't fit as he just didn't really get minutes with the Bucks before he turned out to be a good player on the Magic so I would he was someone who was just hidden on the bench. Other than would have to go as far back as Chauncey Billups."
"I live in Celtics country and I think it’s a little ridiculous that all these C’s fans try to throw Jaylen in there with Tatum. Jaylen is great and I would definitely want to build a team with him as a wing, but he’s just not a top tier NBA talent. I’d put him in the same bucket as Tobias Harris. They both have diverse skill sets and possess the ability to take over a game on occasion, but they can’t do it consistently.   Also, before you jump down my throat on the Tobi comparison I’m not saying they have the same skill set. Tobi is better off the dribble and Jaylen is a better defender. The are different players, but I’d say they both fit the profile as a fringe all star who can contribute in a variety of ways."
"I agree with this, he’s in the Tobias Harris range."
"Was going to say that nothing changes for Philadelphia with Simmons, then I remembered Tobias Harris makes $36 million a year  Edit: I’m still gonna say nothing changes for Philadelphia"
"Joel Embiid post-up or Tobias Harris post-up, sick!"
"Too much love Curry, he was a finalist for MVp despite being on a sorry team.   Too much hate: Ben Simmons, fans, especially the ignorant ones, only focus on what he can't do, and not the other aspects of his game, like defense, rebounding and setting others up. Blame the Sixers for letting Butler walk, overpaying Tobias Harris and no surrounding Embiid with shooters."
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn’t playing well."
Don’t even know if Dwight was the closest. They gave his 12 to Tobias Harris pretty soon after.
How about Tobias Harris + Thybulle for CJ and RoCo. Sixers can throw in a pick if it's not enough.  Although the ship has probably already sailed on keeping Simmons
"How would siakam help them? They'd lose their pg for a pf when they have Tobias harris. You'd have to but Tobias at the 3, which he struggles at defending.  Then you'd have a backcourt of maxey, and curry which would get destroyed defensively. Also, how is siakam a good fit for embiid. Siakam needs space to attack the rim. Warriors would be a perfect fit for him"
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"Idk their pick situation but if they're looking to contend they should have no problem turning at least 2 picks over as long as they get to keep Maxey. Despite popular belief Tobias Harris can be considerably better alongside Fox, who's a MUCH better playmaker than Ben."
"My wife still has a red and blue shirt that says ‘this girl loves Tobias Harris’ from when he played on the stones. Great shirt, and still relevant lol"
"Kawhi, Kyrie and Klay are pretty much locks for HOF I think. Butler has a chance if he wins a championship before the end of his career. So yeah makes sense. 2018 at this moment is definitely weaker, but then again it’s only been 3 years. Luka is definitely going to be a HOFer, Trae too most likely. Maybe Ayton, but don’t think it’ll surpass 2011, that year also had players with high peaks like IT, Kemba, Vuc and other solid players like Morris twins, Tobias Harris, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas etc. Pretty deep draft with some top talent."
"Tobias Harris actually did go from the Pistons, Clippers, Sixers"
Tobias Harris?
"player from sixers clippers and pistons - tobias harris lol, sadly played a tad bit for the bucks"
You mean milwaukee bucks legend Tobias Harris?
Tobias Harris and Clint Capela
Beal. even if he gets traded- just not that memorable of a player for casuals even though he’s very fucking good  john wall might not get remembered much outside of DC. he was pretty huge for a while though so maybe not  Nobody will remember Al Horford outside of maybe sixers fans. the same could be said about tobias harris. talk about unremarkable.
"How do you think the 76ers would do without Simmons? Embiid is great, but Tobias Harris is a 4th option on a title team."
Some of us were thinking of dlo Tobias Harris future lol
"people:  BEN, DOC, AND TOBIAS HARRIS ALL DESERVE VARYING LEVELS OF EXTREME BLAME. LETS MOBE ON"
"You're acting as if Ben didn't contribute to the Sixers' wins that series.   &gt; Other sixers may have missed free throws  They didn't just miss free throws, but they missed game-tying/lead-taking free-throws. You act as if Embiid didn't go 9/24 and 4/20 in some of their losses.   I know Ben deserves some of the blame, but he doesn't deserve majority of the blame, when Tobias Harris, their secondary scorer, went 8/24, 9/20 and 2/11 in the last 3 games of the series."
"That’s true, but honestly Bertrand and Bryant would probably fit well around Simmons.  It’s not like the Sixers have a great roster when you take Embiid out of the equation. Just Tobias Harris and role players"
"Almost like our problem has consistently been shot creation in the clutch instead of ""spacing"". Good thing our FO went and got really good shot creation players over the last few years like Tobias Harris and Al Horford while alienating Jimmy Butler."
"When a great player isn't having a good game they'll do the following - defense, distribute, draw fouls. Two of the three things Simmons is elite at. But when Simmons is having a bad game, he doesn't have any other skill to neutralize a defensive scheme or just get through a slump.   If he was willing to draw fouls, sure he'd shoot 33% from the line, but there's the added advantages: Embiid gets rest, set up the defense, team fouls and individual fouls add up.   BECAUSE OF SIMMONS' LIMITATIONS OUR CENTER WAS PLAYING THE PG POSITION AT THE TOP OF THE KEY IN THE FINAL MINUTES OF GAME 7!!!!!   And this is the problem with Simmons, his game makes it so the team has no room for error. If he has a bad game everybody else on your team needs to play flawlessly just to have a chance to win.   You can point to all the mistakes and errors Doc, Embiid, Harris, Seth, Thybulle all you want, but they eventually come down to covering for Simmons' weaknesses. We have to let Seth get abused on defense over Thybulle because Simmons won't shoot at all. Thybulle missed his dunk because he wasn't expecting Simmons to pass up an uncontested dunk. Tobias had to keep on shooting when he was snakebit, because Simmons won't score in the half-court. Doc had to go with all-bench lineups because there wouldn't be any shooting with Simmons on the court. Embiid has all the turnovers because your PG is in the paint forcing him to operate on the wings/top of the key."
TOBIAS HARRIS WAS TERRIBLE AND OVER PAID
grant is not exactly what philly looks for  he would overlap with tobias Harris who is a hard contract to move and they still dont have their perimeter playmaker
To be fair at the time Tobi was our highest paid player (before Embiid got extended) so really Simmons should be expected to score as our third. Also Tobi had a more negative impact on the team than Ben did. Ben’s boneheaded plays were more prevent the but goddamn if you want to talk about empty stats look at Tobias fucking Harris.
What? We didnt want Ben Simmons Tobias Harris or Joel Embiid.  What other 3 starters we talking about here
Did we get Tobias Harris from you or was that the magic?  Yeah y’all our trade buddies for sure
What’s funny is Simmons is literally teammates with arguably the best of those 10 centers you mentioned. And then the other 3 positions are Seth Curry (historically great shooter) Danny Green (3 &amp; D) and Tobias Harris (Offensive star that can shoot and play D). He literally has the perfect fit around him in Philly right now and we all saw what happened.
"Cj me a better player but Dlo fits their needs more. They need someone that can orchestrate an offense and run the p&amp;r, not smaller tobias Harris"
"All 3 losses are due to roster construction, or poor coaching mixed with a bunch of other things. Ben's just an exploitable weakness in the team, just like Doc Rivers was as well. It's not ""the sixers haven't gotten out of the second round because of Simmons"". Without his defense Trae and Kawhi probably finish both teams off earlier than 7. Two of those years we've allocated resources for Tobias Harris to score 20 on average efficiency and not much else. It starts from the top, ""specifically caused by"" is strong, they're all team losses"
"I wouldn't trade Tobias Harris for that package, nevermind Simmons."
"these are absurdly small sample sizes, but they hold for the regular season too. ben simmons and tobias harris both need the other on the court while embiid is off, the lineups with only one of ben or tobi has always been bad"
"I've been saying for two years that Tatum for Tobias Harris is the best outcome for the Celtics.   This is a totally unbiased opinion, rooted in utterly objective feelings towards the Celtics"
Not to mention Embiid would be a DPOY candidate if he didn't miss too many games and Thybulle would be more of a DPOY candidate if Simmons weren't in front of him (they can't play together on offense). And don't forget Danny Green is solid and Tobias Harris is average.
Then you’re asking Tobias Harris to be your second best player which I think is a horrible idea. I’ve always thought that dude was way overrated and now he’s way overpaid as well. Philly would be the 6Th seed if they made this trade
Tobias Harris has 0 awards and has been a 20 pt 6 reb guy for like 5 years
The wolves can also offer prince tho. Tobias Harris and Georges Niang are basically the only sixers players with size on the perimeter. The sixers struggled last year with not having size off the bench. Capable wings like prince with size and shooting are not that easy to get in the current trade market.
"Maxey/CJ/Green/Tobias/Embiid  Backup PG/Curry/Thybulle/Nieng/Drummond  We'd need a backup PG if Maxey isn't in the deal, but otherwise I think it would be OK. The fact that it would be a more natural starting lineup could really benefit Embiid and Harris who both had to work around Simmons."
"I brought up the Free throws as just one example of why you could run it back. You can “dig into” it as much as you’d like, but Ben Simmons shot historically bad from the line in the playoffs and it is extremely unlikely that he will shoot 35% from the line in another playoff series.   There are other reasons why you can run it back. Joel Embiid is a year old but has improved every year and I fully expect him to do so this offseason. Tyrese Maxey showed promise and could potentially share some of the ball handling duties with Ben — something most Sixers fans have been asking for since Boston exposed his half court flaws his rookie year. Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. That was quite literally his worse shooting performance of the year in one of the most important games of the year. $36million cannot equal 4 points, and I don’t expect it to again, Tobias played pretty well outside of that game. Danny Green going down with a coach that is NOTORIOUS for not making adjustments was a deadly combination and we saw that when Lou Will was torching George hill and the second unit in the huge comeback win ATL had in Philly or when Huerter was absolutely cooking Seth on the offensive end.   Point being, the team underperformed and I think people focus on Simmons’ shortcomings because they are glaring and have been around since he entered the league. Running back the #1 seed from a year ago retooled with Niang and Drummond could still be a contender."
"any lineup with matisse/dwight/simmons was dogshit the entire season. doc never experimented and ran his stupid all bench lineups the entire season.  then he surprised pikachu face when tobias harris couldn't carry a bench unit in the playoffs.  aside from Ben, doc also chose to put Danny Green on Trae to start the series, essentially throwing game 1 out the window for no fucking reason.  he's an awful coach."
"I'm not sure we'd go for it with RoCo as part of the deal. He is incredibly valuable to our starting lineup defensively, and we need as much defense as possible.  How about Nassir Little instead? He's going to be similar to Tobias Harris with a little play time under his belt,  and far cheaper."
a team led by Lonzo Tobias Harris and Embiid is not beating the bucks lmao
Tobias Harris for Zach LaVine? I feel like that's a fantastic trade because the Sixers can clear lots of cap space by getting rid of that contract and they get Zach LaVine!
"No clue, but he was the 3rd star on a championship team last year.  Last I checked, Simmons couldn't even help Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris get past the 2nd round."
"Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. Doc Rivers left Danny Green stranded on Trae Young island for an entire half, costing us a game. Joel was forcing everything on the offensive end in the second half and his turnovers were brutal down the stretch. Curry was lights out on offense but absolutely BBQ chicken on the defensive end.   Youd think Ben Simmons was out there pulling a Dallas Rondo and was the only reason the Sixers lost the ATL series with how this sub talks about the Sixers."
No thanks Cj is basically Tobias Harris as a sg he can stay there
Thank god! Now what about Buddy and Bagley for Tobias Harris?
"For a dude who had comps coming out like ""Kris Humphries"" from draft outlets.... That is so damn impressive. Tobias Harris is legit someone who is maxing out what he can get out of his body."
"It's too late for this damage control. Doc and Joel threw him under the bus after the series. Well guess what, Jimmy wasn't happy there, Horford underperformed during his Philly stint, Tobias Harris also laid an egg. Was this all Simmons' fault? Maybe, but maybe not"
"So we had Jaylen vs Siakam, Randle vs Siakam, and now it's...Tobias Harris vs Siakam?  OP, just admit that you actually didn't have any sort of conversation and you made up this so called argument because shitting on Siakam is easy upvotes on this sub. To answer your question though, Siakam, as despite his recent struggles he has already shown himself to be capable 2nd/3rd option on a championship team."
Siakam was the 3rd best player of a title team (and honestly close to 2nd in many series).  Tobias Harris is the 3rd best player on 2nd round teams
The choice was between Jimmy and Tobias Harris though and the 6ers decided to max Harris out for whatever reason instead.
I love Bam. Great guy and will be a great player before we know. But a duo of butler and embiid (with or without Tobias Harris too) would be so lethal in the present and either would have already won a ring or have definitely made a finals appearance by this point.
&gt; Feels like teams like the idea of him more than the reality of him.  To be fair... Being traded doesn't mean a team doesn't like you. 76ers were going after a star in Tobias Harris and traded the farm for him. Clips traded him and a pick for a SUPPOSED upgrade in Luke Kennard (he scored real well that last year in detroit). Nets traded him away to avoid paying him.
1972 Lakers  PG: Damian Lillard (Gail Goodrich)  SG: Paul George (Jerry West)  SF: Tobias Harris (Jim McMillian)  PF: Jarrett Allen (Happy Hairston)  C: Rudy Gobert (1972 (not 1962) Wilt Chamberlain)
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"“I’m being told Tobias Harris sneezed, and Ben Simmons did not say bless you.”"
"You think teams are just handing out max contracts left and right? We are not sure if Ayton is a max player or not, he is very limited on offense compared to the top centers in the game and he is not at the defensive level of lets say a Bam or Embiid.   Handing out max contract to players who is not max players are fucking teams up. Imagine what kind of role players 76ers couldve gotten if they didnt give Tobias Harris a $180M contract."
Then Tobias Harris called Joel Embiid a doodiehead!
Agreed. Tobias Harris like yesterday said they weren’t a bunch of 8th graders and would act like men about this. Seems to be the 8th grade route so far
"Honestly...losing Sucks either way but i think not getting past the second round again hurt this year especially because you guys got 1st seed and were able to avoid the real threats of the Eastern conference which were the Bucks and the Net’s.   Like...honestly no disrespect to the Hawks they are a great team but on paper you guys should win the series. It’s one thing to lose to the Raptors in a game 7 buzzer bearer against Kawhi who was the FMVP...you can look back and realize you pushed the FMVP to the limit. They were also 2nd seed. As for the Hawks...they were 5th seed and you went 2-1 against them in the regular season.  Simmons,Joel and Harris are still young but that loss should remind them to never underestimate your opponent in the playoffs. Honestly i think Doc should get some blame as well for not keeping the team focused. Im looking at the game stats and it’s obvious what needs to be fixed.   Game 1-Hawks caught you off guard it happens move on.  Game 2-you guys adjust and blow them out to even the series 1-1  Game 3-first game on the road you guys blow them out agin 2-1  Game 4- Hawks came out aggressive in the 3rd quarter and counter punched you to finish the game. Loss of focus in the 3rd and 4th quarter. Hawks tie it 2-2  Game 5- simmons and Tobias to a lesser extent just choked under the pressure here. It turned into Young vs Embiied. Lost by 3 points and Simmons went 4 for 14 from the FT line and only shot 4 times with zero three’s and went 2/4. You guys  came out strong with a 38 point first quarter but finished with 19 points in the 4th. While letting the Hawks get 40 in the 4th quarter. Everyone besides Joel and Seth took their foot off the gas. Down 2-3 on the road..  Game 6- Hawks choke at home because they are a young team who can’t close out. Harris,Seth and Joel all have 22-24 point games and Maxey has 16 points off the bench. 3-3 even series because the team came together. Hell ben actually shot 6 times and went 2 for 6. Only 2 turnovers.   Game 7-both teams were gassed and exhausted. harris and Joel were the only ones having a good game. But Hawks won at the free throw line...in the 4th quarter. they went 9 for 11 in the final 12 minutes you guys went 3 for 5.  my point is...these werent talent mistakes they were effort and mindset mistakes. honestly Doc deserves some blame along with Simmons. This should have been a 5 game series. Hawks winning Game 4 gave them confidence...you can tell because in game 5 Young went off for 39 points."
Tobias Harris ver 2
"Yes, obviously anyone would take two top 15 guys and Ayton on the same team. It's not that easy to just trade for a top 15 guy though, even with all OKC's picks (or just expect SGA to develop into a top 15 guy). More likely outcome is their third max slot goes to a Tobias Harris-like player."
"No, that's not what I'm saying. If it came across as that then I apologize. I think everyone knows that Wiggins is a solid player. Just that he's not worth max money at all. If Wiggins was 10-15M then he'd be a positive asset imo. Right now, I'd say that he's still a negative asset because of his contract. He's obviously a good player but I don't think he's tradeable for a positive return.   The Warriors are stuck with Wiggins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for them, unless they were to throw in picks/young prospects or take on a worse contract. Tobias Harris is a great player but he isn't worth his contract either."
"The issue with Tobias isn't that he's not a solid third option. It's that he's a solid third option that's paid like the first option. It's the Andrew Wiggins conundrum.  Not saying that Simmons is not also overpaid, but he actually makes less than Harris."
Tobias Harris missed three straight layups in G7 against Atlanta.
Ben Simmons would have been traded in a package with Tobias Harris and Seth Curry just to make the trade balanced.
"Semi-serious/semi-joking ESPN headline  ""Tobias Harris: Overrated locker room presence?"""
"&gt;Sixers forward Tobias Harris: ‘I didn’t ask (Ben Simmons why he came back).’  Mr Krabs, """
"That was the draft immediately following Colangelo's nonsense - they literally didn't have anyone running the front office and called it a ""collaboration"" between Brett Brown, EB, and a couple of other guys. Brushes  Bridges was a perfect fit, his mom even was an HR exec for the teams ownership group, and it was a fucking awful trade which I and most people were rightly furious about at the time and not just with hindsight. The *one* thing I'll say in the interest of full fairness is that they also received a fairly valuable future pick to trade down there, which was then sent to LAC in the Harris/Bobi trade several months later - so that particular butterfly effect also results in no Tobias (whether you think that's for better or for worse is worth another debate for another time)."
"Grown men would absolutely ask their colleague what’s going on. Tobias Harris is 29 and probably hasn’t held a job outside of basketball. STAY OUT OF OUR LAYMEN WORKPLACE DYNAMICS, TOBIAS!"
Nah don’t worry we got… *checks notes*  Tobias Harris on a max contract from trading him
Ben showing up to practice and Tobias Harris saying we’re grown men is not a problem
Tobias Harris looks like J Cole
"Philadelphia 76ers President Daryl Morey proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Joel Embiid and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Tobias Harris yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Danny Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Ben Simmons yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Embiid hit the locker room door, former NBA great Allen Iverson hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"I mean what do you define as role player? To me a role player is a guy whose a defender, or a shooter, not a guy who is elite on defence, and is showing to be a very capable offensive player.  I think his ceiling is a Tobias Harris with better defence, which is a damn good player. But would you call Tobias a role player? I wouldn’t.  He’s already better than Bridges."
"This is the equivalent of saying ""hot take: steph curry is more likely to win MVP than tobias harris"""
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
I like Trae Young.  Not his fault Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris suck shit
"They could ask Tobias Harris to play like the 13th best player in the league, in line with his salary"
"But what if I think a trade like Simmons for McCollum and a pick + pick swap does move the needle for them?  I think McCollum gets very underrated on here and his game meshes incredibly well with Embiid's. If he had been in the east his whole career I think he's a multi-time all-star just like Simmons. Only real thing you'd need to do beyond that is get role playing defenders and a secondary facilitator, which you could either use Tobias Harris for, or trade him with the acquired picks to fill all your needs.  I genuinely believe that team around Embiid is a contender."
"we need to get rid of ""Max contracts""  players shouldn't be limited to how much they can earn or what another team has the ability to pay.  LeBron shouldn't be stuck making the same kind of money as Tobias Harris.  This would actually eliminate Super Teams.  If another team offered AD $45-50 million, he would have to think twice about teaming up with LeBron and only making \~$30 million.  giving up a couple million is a lot easier than giving up $15 million."
"Would’ve been a nice fit but the sign and trade would’ve required getting rid of Ben or Tobias Harris. If you give up Tobias you’d have to trust Ben to be fully committed, which even with Lowry wouldn’t be a certainty. Otherwise other salary matches could’ve been Seth and in an ideal world Danny Green, if his contract weren’t expired. Overall, it’s tough to make it work if the team didn’t want to part with Harris"
So what should they have done? Take Tobias Harris and a late lottery pick?
"Do we have info on Tobias Harris' vax status? I love the guy but he seems like he's super conscious about what he puts in his body, at least based on a lot of his IG posts I remember from when he was a Piston."
"East: rozier, levert, jerami grant, tobias harris, turner .  West: murray, mccollum, harrison barnes, aaron gordon, wood"
"Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and JJ Redick.  I would have slapped you if you told me that team wasn’t going to sweep the Eastern Conference before those playoffs started lol"
"Great 1 on 1 players are overrated by their opponents.   Though, I do think if Carmelo had been turned into a full-time 4 by virtue of having the same coach who was able to convince him to do it, he would be the top 50 all time guy his peers believe him to be. Like how the similar style but not as good Tobias Harris is a top 50 in the league right now guy at the 4 but if he had to move to the 3 he'd drop 20-25 spots."
"I loved that trade and thought EB absolutely killed it that season.  The outcome was awful and running it back and spending would've been the right move, but that was a disgusting roster.  The Sixers were not going to pay Tobias Harris that money in free agency if he weren't already there. They found themselves in the position where they lost everyone else and were left with only Tobi so they overpaid to keep him."
"Tobias Harris is an odd choice, seeing as he's a max player that isn't actually capable of being more than the third option on a title team."
"Those are great points.  I think that non-star, less desirable markets should completely punt on that team-building strategy tho.  Don't accept the second-tier star and pay him a max salary.  That guy doesn't want to be on your team anyway.  Instead, trade that guy while he's on a rookie deal for a king's ransom, get a ton of picks in hopes that one of them becomes a bonafide top-10 player, and use your cap space on a high-character, durable, role-playing veteran (Tobias Harris) or to absorb bad salary for draft picks."
The best team considering fit is probably:  Shai Gilegous Alexander  CJ McCollum  OG Anunoby  Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  6: De'aron Fox  7: Ayton  8: Morant  9: MPJ  10: Sexton  11: Wood  12: Isaac
&gt;while Embiid or Tobias Harris Iso  Fixed that for you
"Jerami Grant is just a slightly better Tobias Harris tho, idk why they’d play both of them together  The best trade is Mccollum without a doubt"
Well if they are sending out Simmons they need both  But I agree with you generally - ideally the big-ticket item they get back is a PG and they get like a serviceable role-player SF so they can play [new PG] / Danny Green / [new SF] / Tobias Harris / Embiid
"Nope.   It’s a poorly constructed roster with 2 horrible max contracts showing it.   The 3 max players on that team are Ben Simmons, Joel embid and Tobias Harris. Absolutely no quality 3 point shooting.  The only way this team wins a championship is if Ben Simmons becomes a competent 3 point shooter. Ben Simmons can’t shoot free throws.  Ben needs a competent all star or borderline shooter to play competitive basketball."
Tobias Harris for Kyrie let's have some fucking fun! Let's fucking goooooooo!
"Well teams that are not in situation Nets are right now - imagine you have player that is a good/decent player but is kinda overpaid. Someone like Wiggins, Horford, maybe Hayward, Westbrook, Klay (if he comes back from injury not quite the same), Tobias Harris, Siakam, Porzingis, McCollum,... If you think your best option to build a team is trough free agency you might want to get rid of such contracts if they are long term.  Now most of players I mentioned are not really worth their contract, but for Nets who are willing to pay tax and are already capped out - they don't really give a shit, they see it as getting a decent player for nothing.   For example Knicks used Porzingis trade to basically clear cap to free up space for free agency, Lakers did similar with Dlo+Mozgov trade when they were gearing up for LeBron free agency."
Yeah u could be the Timberwolves or kings. All things go wrong ship Tobias Harris lol and Ben simmons for a superstar.
I mean they chose Simmons and Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler. Them not going after Lowry isn't that surprising.
Someone's gotta do it. Certainly won't be Simmons or Tobias Harris
By what metric.  Especially if Tobias Harris is going to be brought up 100x in this thread.
Recently?? Ben Simmons.   Prior?  Tobias Harris.  What a coincidence....
Tobias Harris
I’m a pretty big Ben Simmons stan bro lol. You can even find a post I made about him leading Philly to a win streak in his rookie year amidst all the hate.  I was genuinely curious and wanted to see if anyone else thought it was Tobias Harris.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p05ajf/rookie_ben_simmons_goes_on_a_tear_averaging/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
"Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins"
Damn that might be the end of the thread lol.   I still think it’s probably Tobias Harris.
"People shitting on the Clippers make me roll my eyes; they definitely deserve to be in the top 10.  Everyone only looks at AFTER what happened with Kawhi/PG, but ignore the previous 2 years where the FO made amazing yet unpopular decisions, after another, to get themselves in a position to even pitch to Kawhi. They didn't tank a single season like the Lakers, Thunder, or Warriors, and tried to make the playoffs every year.   They turned the team around in a matter of 1.5 years, from the end of Lob City when CP3 was traded, back to a team qualifying for the playoffs.   They traded CP3 for Lou Will, Bev, Harrell, Decker. Harrell was an unknown quantity at that time, Decker was trash, Lou had been traded like 3 times in 2 years, and Bev is Bev.   Then they traded BG on a supermax despite suffering another mid-season injury for Harris, Bradley, Boban, and a 1st (which became SGA).   Then they traded Bradley for Jamychal Green.   Then they traded Tobias Harris mid-season who was due for a new contact extension the next offseason, Boban for Muscala, Shamet, and the Miami FRP.   Then they traded Muscala for Zubac.  And the most annoying thing is when people say Clippers traded all their picks, and then you still see people surprised the Clippers have FRPs. They traded 3 of their own FRPs, which isn't a lot when you trade for a player coming off an MVP season, especially when the Thunder held all the leverage. The other FRPs came from deals that FO made in the past couple years before the PG trade, which is again a testament to how good the FO is. Miami FRP came from Tobias trade, another Miami FRP came simply from helping facilitate the cap situation to get Butler to Miami."
I've been around on various accounts for about the last 7 or so years. The sub always has a certain few players that they just LOVE then completely drop later. Tobias Harris and Andre Drummond were two big ones.
"Draymond is a great player, but I feel like he's a ""multiplier"" star, where he's bad as a first option, okay as a second option, and good as a first option. Draymond is at his best with a full fledged second star.   I haven't watched Jordan Poole in the preseason this year, and I'll definitely pay attention once the season starts. Even then, it sounds like he falls into the fringe all star players that all the teams I've mentioned have as well (Tobias Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Reggie Jackson, hell maybe even THJ).   What I'm trying to say is that all the issues you've resolved (depth, competent role players with solid BBIQ) that the teams above have also ""resolved."" The Warriors may at the top of the ""West Morass"" group and be 4th seed, but I still think it's hard to confidently say they'll knock any of the top 3 down."
My boy Tobias Harris is inquiring about one fella named Boban??? Are you interested in a trade ?
"People down voting you but how will a core of Embiid/Tobias Harris/Whatever they end up getting for big shot Ben gonna be a obvious finals contender? Giannis, Durant, Tatum, Trae... All in the east gunning for the exact same thing"
Westbrook experiment ends with him getting traded or at the back of the rotation  Tyler Herro 6th man of the year  Miami Heat NYK for the ECF   Nets 1st round playoff exit   CP3 traded for Simmons and it some how involves Ayton and Tobias Harris
He’s a pure 4 in today’s league and Tobias Harris is wildly more effective at the 4. I think they’re too redundant.
"I see him as an early 2000s version of Tobias Harris, myself (maybe a little better on offense and def worse in defense)."
"Ok? The post says “you”. Indicating the viewers of the post. So what’s your point?  I’d max Ayton. In today’s era you have to max every player with star potential or someone else will. Just look at guys like MPJ, Tobias Harris, etc"
"Aside from the obvious ones, Tobias Harris bounced around a bit before hitting his stride with the Clippers. He hasn’t made an all star team but last season he was pretty close to making the 50/40/90 club."
&gt;a Tobias Harris lead team can tread water in the East  That is extremely optimistic in my personal opinions.
If Embiid gets hurt badly we have no chance regardless. If he misses time a Tobias Harris lead team can tread water in the East.
"I wish Brown was available, OG looked nice against Tobias Harris but I wanted to see him go up against a real defensive threat"
"We are a league where teams go all-in on second-tier All-Stars just for a shot at staying relevant. Kristaps Porzingis is making $32 mil this season, Paskal Siakam is making $33M, Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making $36M. John Wall is making $44M.  Yes, Westbrook is inefficient, but he is a MVP winner, and so he got paid like one. I don't see anything wrong with that. I certainly don't see him as overpaid. He got paid exactly what he was worth in this league at the time."
"Yes, in the way of it didn’t yield a championship team, but no, in that it still got Embiid, and the goal of The Process was to obtain a true superstar through the draft. The Process still resulted in a team with Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Tobias Harris, and then management fucked that up."
"The Sixers without Ben Simmons are not falling to the play-in. A Tobias Harris led Sixers roster is a play-in type team if Embiid misses most of the season. Barring major injury, this Sixers roster has a floor of like a 6 seed even if it’s a catastrophic season otherwise. There’s only so many good teams in the East"
"76ers players claiming Tobias Harris is the leader over Joel Embiid, is the 76ers franchise imploding?"
Tobias Harris is the 2nd best player on the 76ers
Tobias Harris is more respected in the Sixers locker room than Joel Embiid.  -ESPN
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
"John Stockton, Steve Nash, Tobias Harris (only for 3s, he takes enough other shots), and Ben Simmons obviously"
"Well I put this one in real quick but   To Pacers: danny green, simmons, buddy hield, possible picks   To blazers: Tobias Harris   To 6rs: bagley, levert, CJ , Brogdon possible pick   Kings: sabonis some sort of pick movement"
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
Another one I thought of:  Lonzo Ball  CJ McCollum   Andrew Wiggins   Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid
"The Gallo/Tobias Harris Clippers perfectly show this. He took a tea with no true top tier talent to 48 wins in the West and took Golden State to 6.   No disrepect to Gallo, Tobi, Lou Williams or Montrezl, but they aren't exactly top 20 players in the league. Doc really overachieved with them."
* Tingus though could make arguments about that at the time he was signed. * Simmons though again at the time * Westbrook is questionable * Tobias Harris * Wiggins * D'Angelo Russell  While not exactly mediocre players they are in comparison to other max guys.  Like Tobias Harris is a good player but not a max guy
I’ll run a mean DHO with Tobias Harris while not making any contact on the guy I’m supposed to screen before going to the dunker spot and hope the ball never end up in my hands
Khris Middleton and Tobias Harris have entered the chat
This is the Tobias Harris contract in a nutshell.
Pacers get:  * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum   Blazers get:   * Tobias Harris  Sixers get:   * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris Levert   * Malcom Brogdon
So Tobias Harris is the same height as PG and Kawhi?  Wtf man

Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris is 5 months older than Buddy Hield and was drafted 5 years before Buddy Hield.
"In the 4th quarters of the Hawks playoff series, he was a negative and starlight up bad. That was his most recent showing and that's why you see so many posts and memes about that.   But again he is still considered a star player and clearly better than Tobias (3rd best Sixer).Again you WILL see one or 2 post saying that Harris better than him but that's just hating and you can find that about anything."
"Then the Cavs weren't a super team, because Kevin Love was no better than Tobias Harris has been the last 3 years."
Is Tobias Harris a star?
"remember when tobias harris was 6'10, Pepperidge farm remembers"
Tobias Harris has dropped 2 inches since being on the Magic.  Coincide?  I think not.
I always thought Tobias Harris looked bigger in a jersey than in photos with street clothes. Turns out it could be partially the wonky aspect ratio.
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
"&gt; the 3 years he was GM they had zero success on the court.  By design. Embiid didn’t get to play yet under Hinkie. Then they got Simmons that summer. They hit on 2 of the 6 lotto picks or whatever it was. That’s what Hinkie’s plan was. Then Colangelo and then Brand went and traded for Tobias Harris, traded up for Fultz, let Butler go, and signed Al Horford.  Can’t be too sure what Hinkie would have done if given the chance but it couldn’t have been any worse that’s for sure"
"Brogdon and Hield are the same age right now, but they weren’t born the same year as the other 3. They’re actually a year older and the same age as Tobias Harris. Those two have also played a combined 684 career games, and Tobias has played 680."
seth curry danny green tobias harris joel embiid :(
WTF? The Sixers are consistently contenders despite the following  1. Lit up #1 overall pick on fire  2. Traded multiple 1sts for Tobias Harris.   3. Let go of Jimmy Butler to sign Al Horford  4. Ben Simmons deciding not to ever improve his offense.  Even with all those blunders if even one of those things turned out differently they probably would've already made a finals if not the championship already. Imagine this team with Tatum or Butler the past two years.
"It 100% depends on the system around you. I’m just pointing to the countless attempts at super teams that have flopped while the only outliers I can recall are the Heat, Cavs and Warriors. Let’s point to the Sixers 3 seasons ago against the Raptors. Simmons and Lowry were around the same level at the time, Redick was better than Danny Green, Kawhi was better than Butler, Harris was arguably better than Siakam at the time and Embiid was obviously better than Gasol. The team put together 4 guys who were all star players and put him next to a sniper from range. They still lost though. You could argue they lost by lucky last shot which is fair, but it shouldn’t have got to that point to begin with based on talent on that roster. You’re right in saying good coaching does wonders and I agree, but what if you replaced Jimmy with a guy like Khris Middleton, who can shoot from anywhere, doesn’t always need the ball in his hands, and is great on defence as well. Then have someone like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon at the 4 instead of Tobias. I personally think that team would’ve been way better than the one the Sixers had constructed. Despite the three maybe not being as good of players as the players previously on the team, their fit is better and the coaches job becomes easier."
Why would we want discount Tobias Harris when we already have Tobias Harris
"Yeah I watched Tobias Harris scrub it up in multiple key games and not take any of the shit that Simmons did. Also this argument is stupid, I already acknowledged he was afraid of shooting but he still tried and played well on D was one of the few players with a positive net rating in the Hawks series. Curry got absolutely smoked in the deciding game and will probably be exploited on D in the playoffs again this year. The team lost as a whole. You ESPN hot take motherfuckers are too stupid to ask other people if “we watched the games?” Fuck out of here when you can’t even even type out more than one sentence."
Tobias Harris
I don’t think 76ers are 5th because of Benamin. They were first until the team got wrecked with Covid protocols. Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris missed a good chuck of games last week so that dropped them down.
"Tobias Harris is on a 5 year max $180M deal, should be criminal to say he isnt overpaid bu much…his contract is horrible"
I know they buddies but casuals aren't gonna tune into to watch freakin Tobias Harris 😂
Ingram doesn’t solve any of our problems and him and Tobias Harris are redundant.
"Tobias Harris is absolutely fucking useless when it actually matters. People shit on Westbrook and Walls contracts, they've got nothing on Harris"
"Tobias Harris, Evan Fournier, Vuc, Aaron Gordon and Elf all started together for like three years"
The whole 5-6 year “process” has basically netted the 76ers Embiid and Tobias Harris (on a max deal lol).  Very appropriate a 76ers fan would be talking shit about beating someone IN THE 1ST RD.  Cuz that’s where it has and will continue to end for that shit show/soap opera they got going over there.
"I’m glad to see Randle continues the trend of signing a player to a big contract after only a single standout year preceded by a number mediocre years is a pretty bad idea (D’Lo, Tobias Harris, Siakam)."
"Jeez an obvious statement got to 20 upvotes in a minute.      My turn, I think that Durant is a better scorer than Tobias Harris"
"If Tobias Harris is a ""relatively"" healthy person what does that make me?"
"They won’t say for sure but they say the vaccination rate on the team is “[very, very, very high](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/76ers-nba-training-camp-tobias-harris-vaccine-20210928.html), so I’m thinking there’s like maybe a holdout or two, but that’s it."
"Oh yeah since we’re in an NBA subreddit.   If I’m a 25 year old player in the league - I’m getting that booster 100%.   NBA players have such high exposure. Getting infected, depending on severity, you’re out 5 games minimum. If you get a Tobias Harris type infection, even more, with potential long term effects.   Then there’s your team, even if no one gets infected, you’re putting 2 or 3 players out for safety protocols. Say you’re in a contract year, rookie deal, or 10 day contract - your career is on the line. Generational wealth is on the line. Boost me up!"
"You must not watch the Wizards then. Beal's outside shooting hasn't been great but he has arguably been our best perimeter defender this season.  The real reason we are winning is because last year our only healthy wing was an inexperienced Rui Hachimura. We would get demplished by guys like Tatum, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, Giannis etc because we had no one who could guard them. We had several guys in our rotation who aren't even in the league.  This year we have KCP, Kuzma, Harrell, healthy Deni, and Hachimura who is coming back. We have a lot of versatile wings who can play both ends of the floor and run the court. Not surprisingly our defense has greatly improved."
"Joe ingles is literally memed out of control because he’s white  Jalen Brunson and poetl are nowhere near as good as brogdon and probably just as well known, disagree with those  I’m literally a blazers homer and can say definitively CJ is overrated if anything  Tobias Harris is way more respected than brogdon so to say they’re equal only proves the point brogdon is underrated lol"
"Joe Ingles Jalen Brunson CJ McCollum Poetl   Brogdon is a really good player, but he’s more a Tobias Harris than anything: Really good player who isn’t near elite"

"&gt; Simmons met with Rivers and his teammates on Oct. 22 and informed them that he was not mentally ready to play and needed time to be in the proper state of mind. Multiple teammates publicly and privately supported Simmons, with Tobias Harris saying, “We have to respect his privacy, his space, and we’ve got to be there for him.” Last week, the 76ers became increasingly irritated with Simmons because the organization felt he was not providing further clarity on his process and not working with their team specialists.  Despite the above quote, the Sixers brass are pretty openly challenging his claim of mental illness in this next part:  &gt; Sixers officials emphasized that, to date, the team has yet to receive any information from its team therapist or Simmons’ personal specialists that would preclude him from playing or practicing."
Tobias Harris 5 years $180 million. FVV 4 years $85 million. I don’t know why this fascinates me but it does.
"I was discussing this yesterday but there's way too many exceptions to wingspan and big hands. MJ had big hands and long wingspan. Jerry West was notorious for a long wingspan and was an elite shooter. More examples below:   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.  Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.  Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.  Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.  KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan."
Tobias Harris also isn’t a role player.  High-level starters are not role players.  Role player are mediocre staters to useful rotation players.
What the hell is? He hasn’t made a All-Star game. They don’t need another Tobias Harris.
Tobias Harris going to the cup isn’t necessarily the best basketball play when you need a bucket
"Okay so the argument has gone from Joel embiid is the issue to Tobias Harris is the issue. Now Tobias not being enough of a shooter at 40% on 4 attempts, when Ben, who’s a point guard doesn’t take ANY. It’s pretty clear to see who the issue is and you keep moving the goal posts here. Have a good one."
"The fact you've called tobias Harris a ""40% shooter"" devoid of all context has invalided you're whole argument"
"Feels like you guys could benefit from a consistent scorer with decent to good defense, who grabs boards.   Could we interest you in one Tobias Harris"
"Embiid is taking just as much now possibly more with Ben out  The real killer to the duo was maxing tobias Harris, a player who hurts both Joel and Bens game  And not getting an actual elite perimeter creator to play with them"
And yet embidd is taking more 3s without ben than with him  Also look at the pfs philly have now (niang) compared to the corpse of Mike Scott and tobias Harris  2 terrible fits  And who's the back up 5 been?   No-one that can stretch the floor
"Youd think a team building around ben would get him a decent stretch 5 at any point, that wasn't a max horford  Tobias Harris hurts both his and joels game and they maxed him aswell"
Any time Tobias Harris is the best player on a team it's straight zzzzzs
"Like I said, you're pointing out a correlation.   Okay we can look at the more average joe. Shane Larkin had a wingspan of 5'10, mediocre if not bad shooter.   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.   Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.   Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.   Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.   Wilt despite having Gobert level wingspan and shooting terribly from free throws, had actual reputation for being an elite perimeter player at the time. KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan.   I'm not really seeing a pattern here."
"&gt; My point was that you're being dense if you really believe there are no non-all star players the 6ers could get that help them. They are literally 1 piece away from being a contender RIGHT NOW.  So again, who are these above average pass-first PGs that are available and would work in a deal for Simmons?  &gt; but you can't really act like Jrue was a proven player before he went to the Bucks.   Just because you didn't know anything about Jrue Holiday doesn't mean nobody knew anything about Jrue Holiday, friend.  &gt; You underrate how good Embiid is. He was 2nd in MVP voting last year and if he played more games he may have actually won it.   He would have, but he didn't. Also, when was the last time a team won the championship whose second best player was of the caliber of Seth Curry?  &gt; He doesn't need another superstar, just like how the Suns and Bucks did not.  Your argument is that Giannis/Middleton/Holiday is a similar caliber lineup as Embiid/Seth Curry/Tobias Harris? Or, to your (unrealistic) example, Embiid/Rubio/Curry? Really? Same with CP3/Booker/Ayton?  I don't really care to debate the definition of the term ""superstar"", but I also never said he needed a superstar. I said mediocre role players wouldn't cut it, which is pretty objectively true. Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are both a tier above ""role player"" even if they're a tier or two below ""superstar"".   &gt; If Morey can't find a trade for a non-all star like Jrue or some other player like him, and the 6ers don't win a chip with him doing whatever the fuck he's trying to do, I think we gotta reconsider if he's that good of a GM...  I _again_ ask where these players are that are of the caliber of Jrue Holiday that are available for Simmons? I think you're really underrate Jrue Holiday. Like a lot."
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
Shoutout to Georges Niang and Furkan Korkmaz for saving my fantasy week.   I had Tobias Harris and Embiid on my team and managed to pick up Niang and Furkan Korkmaz as soon as Tobias went out. I would have lost 0-9 without them.
"You win together, you lose together.  It's convenient for everyone to make a boogeyman out of Ben because yall are in  huuuggee denial. Your entire team blew that series, and your #1 seed season. At full strength you've gotten stuck in the 2nd round for what, 3-4 years now?  I guess we'll see this postseason......when yall put it all on Tobias Harris or whoever."
"Sixers were also missing Curry.  Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid would be a very good starting 5.   Donte, Brook, and Thybulle off the bench is not a bad 8 man rotation."
Tobias Harris is an all star
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
Tobias Harris too
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could’ve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo’s, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn’t even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let’s just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? 🤦"
"Hmm let’s see, they drafted Embiid, Then Simmons! One is a 4x all star who is almost impossible to guard, the other is a 3x all star that became a triple double machine, is a top 3 defensive player and won rookie of the year! Then they draft Fultz who turned out to be a bust for them but hey you can’t win em all, next they draft Mikel Brides but they decide to trade him to the suns for Zaire Smith and a future draft pick, Zaire ends up out of the league for good after an injury and Mikel becomes a stud for Phoenix BUT that future draft pick gets sent over to the clippers in a trade for Tobias Harris, a borderline all star! Next up the sixers make a trade with Celtics in the draft and acquired Matisse Thybulle, this guy is ALREADY one of the best defense players in the league and he’s starting to be more involved offensively! And lastly the Sixers end up with the steal of the 2020 draft, Tyrese Maxey, this kid is super quick and can get any basket that he wants ! He put up a career high 39 points in his rookie year in a game where most of our starters were out! Idk bro, it looks to me like they’ve done a good job Drafting since picking Embiid!"
Floor : tobias harris on steroid?
Gg and all but donte divencenzo and brook lopez can’t really be compared with Joel embiid and Tobias Harris
Where's that clip of him doing it on a fast break to Tobias Harris I believe it was lol
If the Sixers did trade for Kawhi in the summer of 2018 I don’t think they’d trade for Jimmy butler later. But if they did that would be an amazing trio. Add in Tobias Harris as a 4th option with JJ Redick that would’ve been scary
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
You just mad that he smelled that bitchness wafting off Simmons and instead of listening to him you sent him packing for Tobias Harris
"you know Tobias Harris,Thybulle and some socialite who eats up 30m in cap missing too."
Low Energy Tobias Harris
"Bledsoe’s contract is an expiring next year with only 3.9 guaranteed. Rockets would be in a position to give them almost 40 million in cap space for 2023 since they could get off Bledsoe and Gordon since Gordon’s last year is non-guaranteed. No way Wood is worth 3 first round picks. Brogdon was traded for a first and 2 seconds, Mike Conley was traded for one first round pick, Tobias Harris was traded for 2 firsts and 2 seconds. Wood needs to make an All-Star game to be worth 3 first round picks"
Tobias harris sends his regards.
"I think this also has to do with Tobias Harris missing games so far this year too. With him out it’s truly all 3 and D players around Embiid and Drummond except for Maxey. I’m not suggesting that we are better without Tobias, but I am suggesting the offense generates more 3s and it helps Joel, especially late in games."
"yeah also ignores the development of our younger guys like maxey, furkan, tisse and even seth  also ignores the fact that ben played a year with 2 centers in the starting line up plus known 3 point marksmen josh richardson and tobias harris, so likely if we didn't get big collared ben's stats would be better"
If Russ didn't win that MVP literally nobody would complain about him. Tobias Harris is getting the same amount of money and nobody says a word. Tobais fucking Harris
pretty much the contract that he got when guy's like Tobias Harris and KP get the max Gordon is getting a max 3/45 in what world is 20/6/4 only getting 3/45 what a stupid post. Only issue with Gordon is when he gets injured when he's healthy he's fantastic.
Tobias Harris' lack of handles really holds back the team imo.
Simmons and Tobias Harris then
"I mean, to be 8-2 rn with a max contract player sitting at home, Tobias Harris and Danny Green out for a few games is impressive enough for me so far. Nobody is acting like the 76ers are winning the title, and Doc himself says it’s early."
Tobias Harris honestly seems like a really cool person and genuine guy
"We also don’t have Mattise Thybulle, Danny Green, and Tobias Harris. This team is playing insanely well"
"And the other untradable deals rn are Klay, Wall, Tobi, Porzingis, Gobert, Simmons and Love.   I’d say Klay’s and Gobert’s teams are quite happy with keeping them.  Morey wants way more than Westbrook for Simmons.  The Rockets would rather have Wall on a 1 year than Westbrook on a possible 2 year deal no doubt.  The Cavs would probably prefer Love as he makes 13 mil less this year and potentially 19 less next year  I don’t think the Mavs would want Westbrook and I don’t think a Porzingis/AD frontcourt is gonna be good.  So that leaves maybe Tobias Harris? He’s been better than Russ but that’s the only possible deal and if I’m Morey id turn that down too."
Looks like the offense is better with Danny Green and Tobias Harris too
"They're so good. Doc Rivers is coaching his ass off, the team has elite ball movement and Embiid is becoming a legit passer. Mind you, Tobias Harris, Danny Green, and of course Ben have all missed time. Embiid has also shown that he is not 100% healthy, although he did look great tonight. So far, they're one of my favorite Sixers teams ever."
Yikes imagine Tobias Harris tryna be the guy with Simmons on him
Don't forget Tobias Harris has missed the last 5 games too and Danny Green missed 3
No doubt about it in my opinion. Not only have the Sixers been working with 35 million in dead cap space they've also been without Tobias Harris for 5 games.
"No Simmons, Tobias Harris, and Matisse and Chicago Bulls still cant get the job done."
Why would the Sixers add another Tobias Harris to their team? they need a ball handler not a wing
"He’s not playing center over Embiid and Drummond. He’s not gonna play PF over Tobias Harris or Niang (who actually is a good shooter). Tell me what minutes he’ll get, smart guy.   He’s not the player people thought he could be back when he was a Knick. People need to stop looking at him like that"
"Because kawhi fucked us over obscenely hard. Some other trade offers we got were Marcus smart and picks. Covington, Saric, and picks. Tobias Harris on a one year contract and one late lottery pick. There's wasn't even word that the blazers would offer McCollum."
"Aaron Gordon? Tobias Harris? Idk, just need a decent upgrade at the 4"
He doesn't have the spine to ride the bench with philly fans ripping him a new one for 4 quarters. That's why he played the mental health card.  He's played all of his cards. He ghosted the team all summer. Sold his house in Philly. Wouldn't participate in practice. And then had Joel and Tobias Harris take his back concerning his mental health issues.  I've never seen a person fuck himself so hard.
"&gt;Well as someone else in that same boat I think it’s frustrating to see people spend months trashing someone, and then when that person says they aren’t ready mentally to play in front of the people trashing them, they get told they’re making it up. You have not met ben simmons or meaningfully interacted with him. Mental health issues are serious, like you said, and can be caused by any number of reasons, including a toxic work environment and day to day life.  Because it's a little different when you yourself caused the environment you're in. Except for blaming the loss on him, Sixers players have seemed either professional or supportive. Quotes like this:  &gt;""If I didn't like playing with him, I'm honest I would say it,"" Embiid said. ""I love playing with him because he adds so much to our team. We've been building this team around us... I'm just disappointed that he's not here."" Sixers forward Tobias echoed Embiid's comments.   &gt;   &gt;""He's a huge part of our team,"" Harris added. ""So him not going to be here, it is disappointing. But like I said to guys on the team, to all of us, he's still part of our team, Ben is still part of our team, he's still got 15 guys in that locker room, probably seven or eight who played with him last year, that's still his brother, and he's still our brother as well. So we hope the situation could get resolved.""  To the extent that you caused people to hate on you by caring only about yourself and throwing your team under the bus, that's on you. I don't give a damn if you got yourself depressed by your own actions."
"Tobias Harris, behind Joel and Seth"
"He was terrible at playing small forward, which is essentially your position (regardless of what the lineup card says) if you're playing next to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. With Tobias Harris at the 2."
"We’re talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
Tobias Harris is already out with Covid.
Butlers history of teams choosing to pay other guys is so confusing to me. Why on earth would anyone be more willing to pay Wiggins or Tobias harris
"Yeah, the players association rep came out in defense of Ben after Morey went on that radio show saying they'll play hardball and wait out Simmons contract if they have to.   Here's her quote: ""Really? Is it so hard to believe that Ben's not mentally at a place to compete? Professional athletes—like the rest of us—have difficult periods in our lives that require time and energy to heal. We have and will continue to provide Ben with the support and resources he needs to work through this. Threatening the prospect of 'another four years' serves no one's interests. Like Tobias [Harris], I say let's respect Ben's space and embrace him while allowing him the time to move forward."""
Facts I don’t know if there’s a single person who actually believes this bull shit lol (except for Tobias Harris) only an idiot would believe Ben
And Tobias Harris just got tested positive for Covid.. yikes
"&gt;[Keith Pompey] #Sixers PF Tobias Harris received a positive COVID-19 test, according to sources. He will miss at least 10 days. This is sad for the vaccinated player, who took all the proper precautions to remain safe...  ...but now that Harris is sitting at home he'll have a lot more time to watch Direct TV!"
Hey hey I’m a mustard guy but there’s nothing wrong with a cheese pretzel now Tobias Harris and his mustard on cheesesteaks is a story
"Tobias Harris reportedly received 11 missed calls from Benjamin Simmons, asking to come over and breathe on each other."
Which is good because cj doesn’t do anything for the sixers he’s short Tobias Harris
"If they can find expendable salary on top of Coby White, a 1st and a 2nd - Tobias Harris can be an option. Otherwise they should look for someone like Jae Crowder."
"Philly is losing 2 efficient scorers and gaining 3 chuckers (Dame has pretty low efficiency this season), that's why their projected wins go down. Tobias Harris has the 2nd highest PER of all the players, so he improves Portland by making shots more efficiently than Dame.  It only looks wrong because it's not accounting for the fact that Dame, Tatum, and Brown are in a temporary shooting slump, it assumes that the slump will continue for the rest of the season"
superstar tobias harris lmao
Possibly because the blazers traded dame and only get Tobias Harris in return
Dumping Dame for Tobias Harris leads to 6 additional wins?
“Superstar Tobias Harris” 😆😆😆😆😆
That “+6 wins” under a lone Tobias Harris while every other team has more players + all stars and are projected to lose fucking sent me
“…superstar Tobias Harris…” 🤦🏻‍♂️
Superstar Tobias Harris? What year is this??
Tobias Harris vibes (and I really like Tobi)
Imagine using Superstar and Tobias Harris in the same sentence
sixers were missing Tobias Harris *and* Grant Riller tonight. big win
"I only have a shirt not a jersey, is that still ok? It’s just a blue and white Tobias Harris t-shirt"
"Even though I’m happy with how well he’s playing right now and still think he’s overall a good player: Tobias Harris is still an overpay. Unless he gets like all NBA this season or wins Fjnals MVP, it will always be an overpay."
"Wall, Wiggins and Gobert are in the top 3.  Last 2 spots are between Tobias Harris, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Horford, Hayward and Klay. Tough call, guess I'd probably go Harris and Westbrook, even though Harris is playing way over his head at the moment."
"Russ, Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Porzingis (if he can't stay healthy) and (gulp) Kemba Walker (also if he can't stay healthy)"
"I know Shaq doesn't necessarily need to be going at heads the way he does, but it is what it is.  The contract comment, well I just see that as an overarching comment for a lot of the contracts that are given, Gobert's contract just happened to be the most recent and yeah if I'm looking Giannis who just got paid and Gobert...I'm not going to say that Gobert deserves $200M like Giannis does or Anthony Davis.  Gobert is legit but he's not elite and if the cap money didn't need to be spent, I don't see anyone giving him a $200M deal.  Shaq does speaks a lot on this, but I'm sure it's a sentiment that plenty of older players share.  Lot of the players getting paid today are nowhere near as good as players from past but they can still get $20M/yr where back in the 80s/90s it would take an elite player like 10yrs to reach that amount. Tobias Harris worth his contract or was Hassan Whiteside when he got paid?  Even Jordan wasn't getting his money until he came back from retirement and he was damn sure much more valuable than just a couple million/yr that he was getting."
Not even talking specifically about Jaylen but Boston fans seem so sensitive about it. Guards in general just aren't getting that high FG% especially not on high volume.   Tobias Harris and Seth Curry aren't going to be shooting 47% and 54% from 3 either.
"Don't entirely agree with Tobias Harris ""improving"".  He's exactly the same guy we saw in LA 3-4 years ago.  This is just the first time he's being utilized in the right role in Philly.  His shooting will come down to earth a bit and then he's statistically right on par."
"There are ways around it, Morey can figure something out. I don’t think fit is the issue with Harris really, Otto is pretty comfortable off the ball  We should’ve traded for Otto in 2019 instead of Tobias"
Tobias Harris
"Embiid, Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey, Shake, Seth, Korkmaz and based on the way he’s been playing recently...... Tobias. Shit, two weeks ago this would have been the best way to try and get rid of Harris. But he’s finally playing well."
we have one gently used tobias harris
probably tobias harris
"Embiid   Simmons  Seth Curry  SM  Maxey  Thybulle  Danny Green  No sense protecting Tobias Harris, no one's touching that contract with a 10-foot pole."
"&gt;I don't disagree, but I do think ""trash"" as a term is being used too liberally.  This is how the internet works. Hyperbole and speaking in absolutes to chase retweets and internet points. Also every conversation about a player is framed relative to expectations, people will shit on a guy like Tobias Harris endlessly(not right now but up until a week ago) while overhyping unheralded role players to try to sound smart who are far worse than Tobias because again its how things are framed."
"Simmons Embiid and Tobias ""Kevin Durant"" Harris"
Tobias Harris winning player of the week over Jaylen Brown
"He didn't even mention signing Al Horford to a 109M deal, even though he needs to play at 5 to be effective. And the Tobias Harris trade and signing to a massive deal (which looks better now that we have spacing admittedly)"
"**Biggest surprises:** Sabonis having a career year, Tobias Harris bouncing back from an awful 1st game to winning EC Player of the Week and looking excellent ever since, John Wall immediately returning to form, Steph immediately returning to form, Kevin Durant looking awesome after the injury, Knicks actually looking good under Thibs, PG13 off to an amazing start without Kawhi, Celtics looking better than I expected. Also the rookies seem to be doing very well despite it being called a weak draft. Got guys popping off all over the league.                **Biggest disappointments:** Siakam falling off a cliff since the bubble, Wizards with a lot of close losses (I had them as a playoff team with Russ, not that they can't turn it around), Nets with a few disappointing losses after looking dominant early on, Raptors in general look bad, Oubre's start. Nothing that can't be fixed though on this list."
Tobias harris for me he playing like he deserves that money i jus hope he can keep it up all season for us

"Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Tobias Harris, Julius Randle  Also I think PG13 will take a small hit as well."
I hope they do not drop at all;  Tobias Harris Collin Sexton Pfizer P Kelly Oubre
Tobias Harris' shooting percentages will drop. Paul George also won't shoot close to 50% from 3 by the end of the season.
"Tobias Harris, Jaylen Brown, and Julius Randle are the top three imo"
"Jaylen Brown is the easiest answer. Tobias Harris will regress somewhat, even PG isn’t this good."
I hate to say it... but I don’t think Tobias Harris is going to shoot 50/48/92 for the entire season.
I genuinely believe the lack of a Philly crowd has contributed to the rejuvenation of Tobias Harris
The fuck did Doc Rivers give Tobias Harris in the offseason.
One gently used tobias harris
I’ll never forget trae literally jumping sideways into Tobias Harris at the buzzer for half and just heaving the ball and the ref calling it a foul.
"Question, does doc do something noticeably different with Tobias Harris or is it just better spacing?"
"I'm not sure I've ever seen Tobias Harris spin, let alone foul out of a game"
"As of right now, Tobias Harris is better than him at least in this season. Not even top 30 in the NBA."
"Tobias Harris, ECPOTW"
Tobias Harris finally balling out. Hope he keeps it up!
I've said that Tobias Harris is unironically the NBA MVP favorite so many times that I can't tell if I'm being serious or not anymore
I've said that Tobias Harris is unironically the NBA MVP favorite so many times that I can't tell if I'm being serious or not anymore
This Tobias Harris dude seems underpaid
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Tobias Harris. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting 3's on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy Tobi. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Idk if its cause of being back under Doc Rivers, but Tobias Harris is done being a joke"
"Forward Tobias Harris yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Seth Curry gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Ben Simmons yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Embiid hit the locker room door, former NBA great Allen Iverson hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Tobias Harris looks like Kevin Durant this year
remember when we hated Tobias Harris?  Pepperidge Farms remembers.
Ben Simmons   JJ reddick   Jimmy butler   Tobias Harris   Joel Embiid
76ers looking really amazing ever since Tobias Harris started to ball again
Wouldn't it just be the players of the month after a week lol  So Tobias Harris
You have Jaylen Brown over Tobias Harris...  Did you even watch basketball this week???
"I believe LeBron last year as well no? He had the 4th highest salary in the league. About $800k away from tying #2. Curry had the highest.   It's weird though, basically because the *timing* and length of contracts often makes the difference between a 30% and a 38% cap hit negligible. If you sign up your guys 3-11 up for 3 year deals. And then you have full Bird Rights to your #1 and #2 guys. You can sign them at any amount you'd like up to the (designated) SuperMax.   Of course if you change the team, yes, the calculus has changed and now it becomes more difficult. But at the same time... not really because all trades have to match with 105% of the value.  So if you want to take on $30M in salary, you have to give up between 28 and 32 or so.   There's also a minimum spend which actually quite high. You cannot spend less than 90% of the cap.   If you HAD to spend 98M and the most you can give to your best player was around $30M, and in general most teams use about $12 M for 5 roster spots.   You now have 56 million dollars to spend on 6 players. You could go straight average across the board around $9.3M a pop. You could kind of bell curve it,   * 2 at $3.5M * 2 at $8.5M  * 2 at $16M  Most FO's try to go with either a 1B or #2 guy, and then do a step-down approach in terms of spending. That would mean losing the majority of that remaining money, or at least a sizable chunk.   But again, this is just the math around a MINIMUM spend.   When you get to maxing out dollars in order to compete especially for titles it's way different.   Harping on the Jazz for Gobert from this perspective seems ridiculous. Mitchell and Gobert account for 47% of the Jazz's Cap Room next years. What's an ideal percentage?  If they are your best players... that's a very good position. Compared to LeBron and Davis who take up 62% of the Cap.   The majority of Cap problems come from paying players who are really $5M players and quite easily swappable with another player and paying them $12M or even more than that.   Rarely do guys like Tobias Harris and Andrew Wiggins enter the mix. They are bad contracts the day they're signed."
You mean the newly annointed Eastern Conference Player of the Week Tobias Harris?
Tobias Harris
Apparently Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris is still overpaid tremendously but it's nice to see him starting to find his groove and hard to imagine he can't keep it up under Doc's tutelage
tobias harris has been a godsend for my fantasy team
"not trying to fight but seriously asking, what has Tobias done to deserve it? Just to reiterate: I'm actually curious, I know what JB has done but other than the stats idk what Harris has done. I'm surprised JB didn't get it so I'm curious what Harris had to do to take it from him."
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris and John Wall
“The resurgence of Tobias Harris” “A bench that is both offensively and defensively sound”  Someone pinch me
"I just don’t feel you can a title nowadays without an elite perimeter shot creator. Tobias Harris is not consistent enough, Ben Simmons isn’t one and Seth Curry isn’t one. If they had been able to keep Jimmy over Tobias I would’ve thought so but they couldn’t."
"Im just picturing the 76ers losing in the conference finals and Tobias Harris in interview is like ""man we could have won but u/Sensitive-Kitchen328 didn't say we could"""
Pretty sure your trolling but if you’re not then talk to me when Tobias Harris gets doubled every time he touches the ball.
Tobias Harris.
Isn't he the Sixers fan that thought Jimmy Butler sucked and wanted the Sixers to re-sign Tobias Harris instead of Butler. (Even though they could re-sign both).
Look no further than what The Clippers got for Tobias Harris. Grant will have a lot of value next season at the trade deadline if we decided to go that direction. 30 million for 1.5 years at that point. Bargain.
"In todays league few digits on the boxscore can make a tens of millions of dollars difference in terms of contracts.    Take for example Bogdan Bogdanovic and Tobias Harris. They are not superstars, they may even not be all stars but they are good at what they do and if they get hot they can take away the game.   Tobias averaged 19p 4a 7r last season, Bogdan averaged 15p 4a 4r last season. Bogdan took 8 threes a game hitting them at 38%, Harris took 5 threes a game hitting them at 36%. Harris took way more other shots and has a decent percentage, Bogdan was not really used as a prime scorer more of a spot up shooter when he really shouldn’t be one.   Tobias is making something like 140 million while Bogdan is making 72. Tobias has basically double the money of Bogdan but the stats show him as marginally better player and more usefull to a team. If Bogdan was given a bigger usage and got more shots he would also improve the numbers on the stats and get even more money."
Yeah but Tobias Harris is more efficient!!!
Yeah but Tobias Harris has 113 points on 86 shots while Tatum has 170 points on 146 shots
It’s like the post I saw yesterday: “Harris with the slam!” Which Harris? There’s like 50 of them? Should’ve put Tobias instead because there’s only 1. Pretty clickbaity
"If trade 3 happens, kill me.  Lavine and otto are the only players stopping us from losing by 50 everynight. I don't want Tobias Harris and his fucking 34mil contract for the next 4 yrs. And ain't no way we trading lavine + otto for Tobias , thybulle and some picks."
&gt; Tobias Harris is playing out of his mind right now  He's playing unsustainably well. I wouldn't count on that at all.
I dont think they need a trade right now. They look balanced right now. Ive watched every game this year and this team doest have any glaring holes right now. Tobias Harris is playing out of his mind right now. Curry is shooting lights out. Embiid is dominating and Simmons looks like the integral guy that gets everyone looks and playing lock down defense. The penultimate glue guy.
It's mostly just one extremely salty Celtics fans who has a deep and emotional hatred for Tobias Harris for some unknown reason
"Think you’re seriously underrating Tobias “Michael Jordan” Harris. Those 19 ppg, got him looking like the league MVP right now."
Aye bruh this sub thinks Tobias Harris is better than Jimmy Butler right now it’s so reactionary over here 😂
Yes Tobias Harris is a role player
Is Tobias Harris a role player?
Tobias Harris 113 points on 86 shots.   Tatum: 146 points on 124 shots.   You look great.
"In the first 2 games of the season:  Time of Possession before shooting for Tobias Harris 0-2 seconds: 5-15 FG (33%, 2.5-7.5 FG per game) 2-6 seconds: 2-9 FG (22%, 1-4.5 FG per game) 6+ seconds: 3-3 FG (100%, 1.5 per game)  Since then (4 games):  0-2 seconds: 19-35 FG (54%, 4.75-8.75 FG per game) 2-6 seconds: 11-19 FG (57%, 2.75-4.75 FG per game) 6+ seconds: 3-5 FG (60%, 0.75-1.25 FG per game)  Quicker decisions, more efficient. Trimming off the fat of his offensive game (and helping us win games, to boot)"

He’s starting to feel like Toronto’s Tobias Harris. A possibly exceptional player that needs to be put into the right position to flourish.
I thought you said we were going to get Tobias Harris for him...?
Tobias Harris?
"Rockets fan here, we want Tobias Harris now!!!"
"Siakam is significantly better than both of them. It wouldn't be weird to say Siakam is a borderline top 10 player. You can't say the same about Middleton, especially Tobias Harris he's pretty ass"
Dude's cheeks bro. Middleton and Tobias Harris are better.
Jokes aside the consensus is TH stands for Tobias Harris right?
"Alternate Title: 180 million dollar man, Tobias Harris gives performance in line with his price tag."
I'll trade Game 1 Tobias Harris for him
Is Tobias Harris underpaid?
Nurse and Masai need to bench him before he ends up nearing Tobias Harris territory. He's our franchise's Bargnani 2.0
"I think it's really close. Some would point to Jokic's recent playoff success, but the Nuggets had Jamal Murray putting up 50 point games while Embiid's best teammate after Simmons went down was Tobias Harris"
Future okc thunder Tobias Harris for you
"I have been clowning on Tobias Harris since his early-season slump last year. Holy shit, outside of game 1, he’s looked really good to start this season.  I think he and Doc link up well. Also helps that we finally have two legit threats from deep in Seth Curry and the continually impressing Shake Milton.  I’m a little worried bc I feel hope right now, hahah"
Man I love Ben Simmons shutting everyone up with his play this year. Shoutout to Tobias Harris for stepping up too.
Tobias Harris is unironically the NBA MVP favorite
THIS is the Tobias Harris we paid for. Other than game 1 he has been fantastic this year. Doc talked about getting him to make quicker decisions and Tobias has really listened and it’s done wonders to open up our offense. That coupled with our added shooters this year and I’m actually excited to watch Sixers basketball.
Tobias Harris under Doc Rivers is goated
Tobias Harris is unironically the NBA MVP favorite
Everyone apologize to Tobias Harris
"Tobias Harris is going to be the NBA MVP, change my mind"
"Tobias ""Hakeem Olajuwon"" Harris"
make it 190 minutes and they’re sizably behind Tobias Harris and Shake Milton 🤷🏻‍♂️
"So trade your third superstar for a much worse player, what’s next? Lakers should trade AD for Gobert and LeBron for Tobias Harris"
Tobias harris wasn't a bad trade his new contract was the bad idea
"If Tobias Harris ever shoots 80%+ against us on 10+ shots ever again, I'll change my flair to him 😷"
"It seems like Doc actually knows how to use Tobias Harris. Have to admit, I liked the sixers more with Brett Brown lol"
"Bruh, it looks like a 6th grader posted that title, keep it simple:  Tobias Harris tonight: 23/8/3 on 10/12 shooting and 3/3 from deep"
Tobias Harris is just a more efficient Kobe who also happens to score a lot less points and plays worse defense so basically the same.
"Pretty damn entertaining game there. What a performance from Embiid and Brown  Has to be one of the best overall performances I’ve seen from Tobias Harris. Dude was lights out on offense and lock down on defense. Love seeing him ball out like that.  Simmons had the best quarter he’s played this year in the 4th.  When the game was tight, Shake led the offense to a nice lead.  Lot to like. Gg Celtics fans. Always a blood pressure riser"

"Tobias Harris under Doc has been fire  Simmons with a sick 4th quarter, Embiid MVP mode   Sixers are well rounded, Green still needs to shoot better but they have found a very good mixture of spacing, defense and low post offense for Embiid"
76ers are completely different team this season compare to last seasons. They aren't blowing the huge lead like Brett Brown. They have much better role players and Tobias Harris is balling.
they could beat us by 50 i refuse to be worried about the sixers until tobias harris scores 20 points in a playoff game
Yeah when Tobias Harris is the first person you can come up with that’s kind of a problem
"Its all in Marcus Smart's, Tobias Harris' and Seth Curry's hands"
2021 Tobias Harris averaged 29 points 8 rebounds and 5 assists - over a 21 game span. 🧐
"Apprantly trading an incosistant Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen for one of the best scorers of all time makes us worse and losing in double overtime when a random player on the cavs goes for 45 points is called getting ""destroyed"". You sixers fans are delusional if you even think you're getting close to the finals when your second best player can't make a jumpshot, and your 3rd best player is Tobias Harris. You aren't getting past Milwaukee or Brooklyn. Deal with it second round exits."
Brilliant. Something to add to the Tobias Harris Corollary: a player who is legitimately promising and legitimately moves the needle for a team upon their acquisition. And a player who fits that “new and promising” role for several teams without ever meeting that mark.
He's worth what teams are willing to throw at him. If guys like Tobias Harris and Rudy Gobert are commanding the max then Lavine is a max guy
"The Tobias Harris Corollary: Good to very good player, but you always feel like you can upgrade from him. See also: Victor Oladipo (high end), Derrick Favors (low end)"
Tobias Harris: below or above the Grant line??
"I hate this claim. People act like KD became Tobias Harris and won free rings. In reality he was the best player on the team in the Finals. When Curry shot like 3/16 from the field in game 3 of the 2018 Finals, Durant put up 43/15/7. They needed him to win their chips."
Cousins could pass brother. Obviously jokic is a better passer but cousins could pass. Cousins can play offense on the same level or higher as these guys his defense was solid and is playmaking was above avg for a big. Also The kings didn’t a second or third All star caliber players like Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons or Tobias Harris.
"PHI is high on my list because of Morey. I worry about long-term future because it seems they really want to compete (see: Tobias Harris trade/resigning, Al Horford signing), but their future is pretty bright."
"it's interesting that there's now a pretty wide advanced stats gulf between him and booker, booker still well below replacement   there's also a phenomenon with zach, if you peruse the team subreddits you will see the most insane trade ideas for him -  nuggets fans think that he's worth gary harris and will barton, in the sixers subreddit they're offering tobias harris, and in the knicks sub they think overpay is ntilikina, knox, bullock and a mavs pick"
"Tobias Harris should be in the conversation at least, if Ben is..."
shoutout Tobias Harris w/ 19.3 PPG on 59.9% TS
"I was talking to my friends about it a bunch during the game. i feel like our best bet would be something like  kyrie / D Green  harden /tobias  joe harris / seth?  durant / simmons  center / embiid  where we try to force drives and pray that harris doesnt get hot from range on seth. but kyrie is way faster than DG and harden is way faster than tobias. Embiid would need to protect the paint like a fucking madman  I mean, would it be crazy to roll out a 2-3 against them in spurts? They just have so much perimeter firepower, we’d have to funnel it into the paint somehow and just try to disrupt as many 3s as possible"
he’s been looking like the tobias we traded for on the clippers this season.  doc rivers just might be the harris whisperer
"2011 is the best established class by far - Kawhi, Kyrie, Butler, Kemba, Klay, IT, Vucevic, Tobias Harris - that's all just the highlights.  Tons of depth too.  2017 could certainly turn out on par, but it's a bit too early to say - Tatum, Mitchell, Bam, Fox, Collins, Allen and a bunch more who are good young players and still developing.  2018 looking great early too, just not as deep as 2017."
"Should get in over Randle: Tatum, Giannis, KD  Similar tier: Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Sabonis+ Bam (if they're not  centers)  Randle currently outperforming: Tobias Harris, Pascal Siakam, Jimmy Butler  I think he should make it if he can keep near his current level of play.  IMO the knicks have shit tier point guards and spacing and his numbers don't even do justice to his full impact.  I'm not a big believer in players earning all-star nods because of past achievements, he's been really good and deserves the nod imo."
Was the Tobias Harris Syndrome too until Philly gave him the bag
Yo this is one of the worst lists I’ve seen here. Idk where to even start so I’ll say something other comments haven’t. Tobias Harris at 31!?!?
Tobias Harris has been a bucket this year.  19PPG/7RPG 50/43/85 splits. They ready.
I swear Tobias Harris gets it called on him twice a game alone.
Thybuille had to bring food for the team too. Theres a hilarious video of Tobias Harris and KOC mocking him for messing up the orders everytime.
What max are you talking about? He signed for 4/100 (this season is year 1). Max is Tobias Harris money.
Trade Kyrie for Tobias Harris
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O’Connor’s report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don’t see how you stop them"
That's not how contracts work.   The raw dollar amount isn't indicative of how valuable the contract is. It's the dollar cost *relative to on-court value*.   Tobias Harris got $35m/year. But you could easily acquire him for a 2nd round pick right now.
Yeah they were in a tough spot but the DeRozan package was always kind of fools gold. Coulda had tobias Harris back when he was on a solid contract and the 12th and 13th pick in the 2018 draft from LAC. You don’t need to even land both of SGA and MPJ in that spot both of whom many thought were worthy of going with those picks it’s not hindsight bias. Just get one of the two and you are in a considerably better spot long term. Bonus points if they could’ve also fleeced Elton brand with a Tobias Harris trade that deadline
3. Tobias Harris 4. Seth Curry/Shake Milton
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris
Does Tobias Harris count if he only sucked last year?
"He is good, but not good enough to be the best or second best player in a championship team.   That's the problem.  Ideally the 76s would have Tobias Harris as the second best player, the second scorer, them Simmons could just play to his streng (defense, playmaking and rim-rolling), unfornantly that's not possible."
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris has been balling this year
"It's pretty self-explanatory.   The NBA keeps track of who guards who and for how long.   *eg. Last season Ben Simmons guarded Giannis for 13:53 minutes [\(53.9 possessions\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203507/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*Ben%20Simmons) and only guarded Middleton for 2:37 minutes [\(11.7 possessions\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203114/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*ben%20simmons). Therefore, Simmons was mostly guarding Giannis.*  *Tobias Harris guarded Giannis for 1:50 minutes [\(7.4 possessions\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203507/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*tobias%20harris) and he guarded Middleton for 10:57 minutes [\(41.9 possessions\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203114/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*tobias%20harris). Therefore, Tobias Harris was mostly guarding Middleton.*  The stat tells you who was guarding who..."
"I always wonder about good players on bad teams. How many more points a game do you get for being the best on your team and being down 20 every game.   Also, a stats guy look at Tobias Harris he looks like MJ against bad teams and becomes a ghost in big games."
As in Tobias Harris?
This is why Tobias Harris needs to give Shake $10 million.
There was even at least one 76er fan on here who kept going around saying they would trade Tobias Harris straight up for Harden.
"We won't win the championship if we can't find or develop a closer.   If you're closer is Tobias Harris, you got a problem."
Tobias Harris pretty much running out of bounds was a great last play
"I think Kyrie for Tobias Harris is a win-win, morey marks both say yes straight swap"
"... yeah I never once said Philly is scoring 30-45, I clearly said Embiid is scoring 30-45. If you want to strawman my arguments, don't make it so easy to point out your bullshit   As I said, you really think that Simmons, Tobias Harris and the rest of the 76ers are outscoring Kyrie, KD, Harden, Joe Harris?"
"Did Jordan ever get to play teams that were led by Lowry, tobias harris, or paul millsap to get to the finals?"
“You’ll take Tobias Harris and you’ll like it Tilman”
I’d rather have Tobias than Dinwiddie+Harris. Some 76ers fans might tell you they’d rather have nothing than Tobias but in reality our team would be much worse without him.
"Not as bad, but they also traded Tobias Harris for two mediocre players on expiring contracts who left that offseason.   IIRC there weren't even any picks or anything. It was just Ersan Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings who played a combined 47 games for them."

"Okay but who would they even trade for? The only player I can think of on a max contract that would be an option is Tobias Harris, you have to remember that the nets literally have zero assets left other than Harris and Dinwiddie"
"Okay, but would you rather have mikal on his salary plus all the shit you gave up for Harris or tobias on his contract? Pretty clearly you'd probably rather have SGA or Bridges and all the extra shit. That's all I'm saying."
"I love the guy, but I don’t think it is irrational to hate him. Just like it isn’t irrational to hate Westbrook or Butler, both of whom I despise.   Hating Herro seems irrational to me. What has he ever done except play his ass off?    I was irrationally hating on Tobias Harris for a while, but he is playing well this year."
A team might trade for his bird rights and then pay him to retain him Tobias Harris-style
"I could see a team repeating a Tobias Harris with him - if you’re an already over the cap team with little ways to get better, you have little leverage in negotiations to retain him. So you overpay him on the guarantee that he stays and makes your team better when you have no other way of that happening otherwise."
Any team that acquires his bird rights this year to go over the cap next year and don’t have leverage in negotiations to let him leave Tobias Harris-style.
"I’d be fine if they offered 2 firsts, I think it’s an overpay, but it’s a justifiable one. I’m not saying it’s 2 firsts, 2 seconds, and Shamet for the right to max Tobias Harris level."
"Couldn’t find a taker for Simmons? What is he, Tobias Harris?"
"Yeah, I agree with everything :)  That Sixers team was fucking STACKED - Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Simmons, Tobias Harris, Redick, sooo much talent.  They certainly could have won it all - I think they’d beat the injured Warriors convincingly, though a Bucks/Sixers series could have gone either way.  That Bucks team was dope too, we just matched up really well with them - Gasol, Kawhi, and really the whole team did a phenomenal job on Giannis.  But yeah, for that Sixers series we really had to grind that out with elite play from Kawhi and great team D, the rest of the team was struggling on offence for most of the series.  We lose that series without Kawhi, probably convincingly.  Even with Kawhi, there were times I thought “these guys are too deep/good, we’re gonna lose.”  But other than that series, the season+playoffs felt mostly like a superstar with a great supporting cast, terrific team ball, vs. one dude carrying weak teammates."
"Well on the plus side for them, they're going to be preeminent favorite to get whoever is bought out because they have playing time and open roster spots up for grabs.   I think your team is the only one that stands a chance because of Embiid, however I'm not sure you have enough perimeter scoring from the likes of Seth Curry/Shake/Maxey/Tobias to win 4 out of 7 vs. this team.   Like Jeff Green, for all his notable flaws as a player, isn't actually THAT bad as a man defender, he did a very good job on Giannis in their game last year in the bubble, and if you look at how much Crowder gave Giannis trouble, you can imagine Jeff Green being able to pose the same problem.   When push comes to shove at the end of games, they are probably going to switch 1-5, which is why they probably need one more 3&amp;D wing as Joe Harris is probably too much of a defensive liability on quick guards. However, I won't put it past them to get like, a Trevor Ariza, or somebody of that ilk."
"Yes because you trade 3 first rounders, and two 2 tier players for a guy, only to ship him out 3 months later for fucking Tobias Harris. Jesus dude, get a grib"
"true, ig I mean more like he's making tobias harris play well"
Tobias Harris looks a lot like Trevor Noah
"If you want third star in your team and you want him to be low key guy, Harris is that guy. He's playing very well and I think everyone will be okay with his contract. Doc Rivers is making a good decision with Tobias to be quick decision making and not dribbling much unlike last season."
"Forget Tobias Harris, our very own THT would average close to 20 ppg vs the Nets lol"
I know the defense part has been brought up a lot already but it's so bad that even Tobias Harris would cook this team in the playoffs.
"Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed, mike Scott, Dakota Mathias, Tobias Harris...its like all our players"
Tobias Harris scores 50 tonight but Kelly Olynyk scores 60
"Yeah KD, Kyrie, Harden is the cost of one Tobias Harris contract"
Former all- star Tobias Harris???
Tobias Harris is like Carmelo Anthony except way worse
"Really bad Tobias game. It happens nothing we can do, but he got a ton of open looks and nothing went down. And it probably wouldn't have mattered if Prime MJ were guarding him tonight if he was wearing a Sixers jersey, but Melo absolutely cooked Harris in the fourth. Although to my eye I didn't think it was bad defense."
"I'm interested to see who he primarily guards. I'm guessing Seth on Harris which leaves Ben, Tobias, and Danny Green for Kyrie, Harden, and KD."
"A play where Tobias Harris got mugged off ball and no call, but they called him for the foul the play before lol the play was drawn up for him and he got held so he couldn’t get around fast enough. No call there, but call on Melo"
Tobias Harris shot a million free throws. Dude is robbing philly blind
"Why tf would you draw up a play for tobias fucking Harris when you have Joel Embiid and Seth Curry on the team as options?  Brainlet level play from doc, holy shit"
Because Tobias Harris made a terrible and stupid decision?
"I really disliked the last foul call on Tobias Harris. He was sliding backwards and Carmelo initiated contact. I get that he wasn't in perfect defensive position, but to end the game on a technicality like that is really lame considering how physical the last minute normally gets."
Tobias Harris really killed the vibe for the 76ers today
"I really hated the foul call on Tobias Harris. He was sliding backwards and Carmelo initiated contact. I get that he wasn't in perfect defensive position, but to end the game on a technicality like that is really lame considering how physical the last minute normally gets."
Damn 2012-13 Melo was reincarnated briefly today in a good amount of that 4th quarter :O and that season I always remember him bodying Tobias everytime we played the Magic lol. The 4th quarter must have been a PTSD flashback for Harris though
The Tobias Harris contract did look like one of the worst in the league though. You people don't understand what a bad take is. Just because it looks good now doesn't mean it was a bad take to call it horrible during the offseason when he was shit all last year.
"Ah yes, because Embiid should have beaten an Eastern Conference contender without Ben Simmons and with Tobias Harris and Josh Richardson, the 76ers' number 2 and 3 options in that series, shooting sub 40% from the field."
When are the casuals on this sub going to realize that Tobias Harris exists?
"Tobias Harris has a better case than Vucevic, Butler, Siakam, and Grant imo"
"The East is weak on front court players this year. Embiid, Giannis, KD, Jayson Tatum, Bam...  Next in line is Someone from the group of Randle, Hayward, Vucevic, Sabonis and Tobias Harris."
"Well if it matters, Tobias Harris is beating all 3"
"&gt;I doubt that. The Laker’s bench/ role players are a force on there own. Schroeder’s also more than capable of running an offense.  Schroeder is terrible at runnin an ENTIRE offense, with or without Bron on the floor. He's been gettin better but he often has tunnel vision and is best at just creating his own shot. Having him as your #1 playmaker is not gonna get you to the playoffs  &gt;I think this Lakers squad would at least make the play in with either just Lebron or just AD.   Obviously with Bron, but not AD. Check on/off numbers with Bron &amp; AD and how the team is lost without Bron   &gt;People love to underrate AD. Yes he’s been slumping on offense but his defense is still DPOY level.   He ain't been. He's just so good that he still is a top tier defender, but not DPOY caliber right now. Just watch the games and you'd realize how down he is, and even at his best he can't commandeer a team by himself to be that level  This has been proven by stats, advanced numbers, eye test, history, the tangibles/intangibles they have, etc  &gt;That Blazer’s game, The Sixers had a bad game. But this is a proven 5 game trend with the Lakers.  Sixers lost by 30 to literal G League caliber players (Blazers missed 5 players). We lost to the Sixers on a game winner (by Tobias Harris, not Embiid) and Pistons without AD once.   We've won 6 straight now, all with a very down/injured/no AD, and we play in the West. Not the same thing. Remember, the initial conversation is LeBron's value vs the team around him compared to Embiid, and LeBron wins in that category"
Tobias Harris and Simmons &gt; AD...
"I don’t think Harris is a joke. Maybe I’m a homer but sixers have the best record in the East, and Tobias is averaging a career high 20.3 on 51/43/87 splits plus 7.5 rebounds and solid defense. I think that’s a legitimate case to make in the East"
Bro Embiid can’t even go a whole week without getting hurt lol and Tobias Harris is the clutch one. Lol gtfo it’s Jokic or Lebron no one else
"This is so stupid.  Lakers have a better record and the Sixers won by 1 at home on someone’s else’s gamewinner. You’re telling me if the Lakers had moved to Baltimore before the season or Tobias Harris had missed that shot, that Embiid somehow magically becomes a worse player ?"
"Embiid beat LeBron head to head on a Tobias Harris game winner lmao, not to mention the fact that LeBron was the best player on the floor"
&gt;AD is literally averaging 2 fewer points than Tobias Harris lol   He is literally not lol
"I don't know if he's considered a star but Tobias Harris is allergic to the free throw line. He basically avoids contact at the rim and always tries to make the shot rather than draw contact. Ben is the same way, they just don't know how to draw contact at the rim, but the refs clearly hate Ben lol. But with Harris there's no rhyme or reason for it, especially since he's an excellent free throw shooter."
"They’ve played like 5 games together and almost all on national tv that are you even talking about. Yes , yes I’ve seen the games. Yes, yes shots = top option. Especially when the discrepancy is 5 shots per game. He shoots 20 shot a game and handles the ball plenty what are you even saying   Is Ben Simmons the Sixers 2nd option bc he runs point? No, it’s Tobias Harris. Is Chris Paul the #1 option over Booker bc CP3  ‘runs the team’? Ok then. Kyrie is the 2nd option you just don’t want to let go of preconceived ideas"
JB + picks for Tobias Harris??
"&gt;Joel Embiid is playing out of his mind right now and I don't expect that to keep up. He was a career 41.8% shooter from 10-16 feet and 38.7% shooter from 16 feet &gt; 3PT prior to this season but is shooting 56.0% and 62.5% respectively from those areas this season on similar volume. Similarly, he was a career 31.9% three-point shooter and is up to 37.7% this season. Tobias Harris is overperforming as well, although to a lesser extent.  Lol that's kinda like how AD was shooting unsustainably hot in the bubble, I still believe it's a product of no fans and it'll continue for a period."
"And why is Tobias Harris ahead of Brandon Ingram, and Jalen Brown?"
This man just put Tobias Harris over Jaylen Brown what in the world
"He’s also leading in VORP, BPM, and WS, he’s having an incredible season. Embiid has a significantly better record so he’s the front runner, but he’s missed some games and if those keep adding up and the Nuggets finish as a top 4 seed I think it’s between them and LeBron.   Also, Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons have been excellent. Meanwhile Murray is playing like garbage and there isn’t a clear third best player after that on the Nuggets. Jokic is doing some serious carrying right now."
LeBron is averaging 26 a game shooting 5 and a half free throws a game. Embiid is averaging 29 shooting 11 free throws a game. You guys won the H2H matchup after blowing a 14 point lead in 3 minutes and off a Tobias Harris game winner lmfao. Leaving out scoring I’ll take the guy averaging 5 more assists a game and 2 less rebounds
Tobias Harris it is
Have you watched Tobias Harris play defense this year?
I’ll take LA and Brooklyn as far as duos go but man if that 76ers roster isn’t perfect for what they’ve been trying to do. Seth Curry shooting 50/50/100 and Tobias Harris playing like an all star again are what has separated the 76ers from the Nuggets for example
Thank god for Tobias Harris
"Trae's a huge defensive liability and is lazy off-ball movement. He only adds value with the ball in his hands.   Swapping him with Simmons is not a net positive even if your other player is Embiid IMO.  Conley's more intriguing: elite shooter, good passer, good defender.  They might get past Toronto and Milwaukee if they had Conley/Reddick, not sure.  The problem is their system sucked.  They already had a perimeter spacing talent with distance in 2018 named Tobias Harris.   The problem is they were still using Simmons as point forward and relegating Harris to spot-up shooter and went out and spent their cap on Al Horford instead of getting more shooting.  Simmons and Embiid haven't changed their games this year: they can co-exist once the GM and coach understand how to make it so."
KD can match Embiid point for point. It depends on how Kyrie and harden play because they will have to outplay the rest of the sixers. Tobias Harris is a solid player for the sixers now.
I’m assuming you mean scoring option. Tobias Harris is playing well currently but has a much lower ceiling and a similar or lower floor (he’s been incredibly bad the last two playoffs)
If you had asked this in October everyone would have said Paul George or Tobias Harris and said Jamal was the best 2nd option in the league behind AD lol
not to mention *another* HoFer to Tobias Harris
"Oladipo is just out of the threshold too (25 points in his next game will get him back to 20 ppg) and I'd put Malik over him. He also has the fewest minutes of anyone in the discussion (other than Christian Wood), so his numbers would probably look *slightly* better with better management from Saunders (not to mention coaching). I'd put him over FVV and Oladipo for sure, maybe Tobias Harris is in the conversation as well, though he's been playing better this year than last. EDIT: And D'Lo is also arguable so far this year."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"As a European fan it's quite hard to actually watch all the NBA games or teams since they only show selected national TV games I think for me so thanks for the heads up since I have limited access to actual game footage.       One point I'd like to add is that in contrast, Giannis who actually also is not the most talented shooter tries to integrate it into his game. I don't want to jump to any conclusions here but I think maybe playing alongside Joel and the current iteration of the sixers with their shooters in Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Danny Green gives Simmons faith that the space he creates will be used but also lets him rely on his team a bit too much on the offensive side? What I'm trying to say is that if Simmons would be able to at least score at a medium rate from jumpers or 3 pointers, he would be up in this tier of players who will be regularly in the MVP discussion as well as it would improve the chance of the sixers actually winning the title.      at least thats what Gianni's is trying to do I guess and he doesn't have a clear cut MVP candidate on his side. I know the comparison isn't entirely fair in terms of game impact or team environment but their lack of shooting touch is obviously a problem for both"
"What contract(s) do you match salary with?  Before the season, it's easily Tobias Harris (and probably an extra pick to take the contract), but that dude has been surprisingly great imo this season.  I still don't think he's worth the max, but he's kinda too good to trade out WITH assets.  If that makes sense?"
"There's going to be guys left out no matter many spots there are. Also, its the All Star game, not the breakout star game, people want to see the superstars in the game, not the Jerami Grant and Tobias Harris' of the world, no offense to them."
when has tobias harris’ contract been worse than blake griffin’s ?
"That's Tobias ""Harrison Barnes"" Harris to you"
Oh I meant Tobias Harris. My bad didn’t realize.
he’d have to be a stretch 5   imagine andre blatche trying to guard tatum or tobias harris or something
Yea I better start taking credit for the bucks developing Tobias Harris. Hell dirk was drafted by the bucks originally I think we get credit for that too.
"I would disagree. They are good but like Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris could take that cake."
Tobias Harris is terribly inefficient in the post-season
"My friend doesn't have reddit but loves your chart when I shared it with him. He's a diehard Sixers fan, care to share stats on Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons? (He's ecstatic about Embiid's stats)"
"Yeah late game offense in the NBA is always just a fundamentally different thing in the NBA even in the reg season. When you play more of a slow down ISO ball approach more mid range jumpers etc it's just conducive to more switching and being able to play small more. That wont go away it just comes down to what about the first 45-46 min of the game.   &gt; most teams aren't going to give a shit about sticking a bigger power forward (Tobias, Marcus Morris, Barnes etc.) on your center  This frankly happens a fair bit as is. Sixers put Tobias Harris on Marc Gasol for a whole playoff series. Clippers put Batum on opposing C's alot. I dont think it's bigs killing you through post ups that hurts you going small. It's the lack of rim protection and size in the paint when it comes to help defense. When I see the Clippers getting torched with Morris at the 5 that's what I think it's about.  I come back to this every so often [this is data from 2019 when offensive rating was a little lower](https://twitter.com/knarsu3/status/1162465103738036224?s=20) but note even if post ups are inefficient possessions where small guys are on bigger guys are overall efficient poss for offenses. So how good are you at being able to leveraging those mismatches to create defensive breakdowns to get good shots elsewhere.   Also part of this is there is always league wide overreaction to the dominant team or the dominant superstar. Steph caused a ripple effect. At some point I think the next generational talent will be a big and things will start shifting back that way to some degree. What you are saying about late game situations is still gonna be true though."

"Nah Dinwiddie is a bit of a reach, he's not really all-star level yet. Maybe Tobias Harris, Van Vleet or Sexton would be the closest imo."
Wouldn't it be better to just trade Curry with a promise of getting him traded back?  Would have like to seen him traded to the Nets before the Harden trade.  We can still trade him to Philly for Tobias Harris?
"Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Middleton, Pascal, Jute Holiday, Sabonis, Wall, and Tobias Harris are some other guys you didn’t mention that there could be an argument for, albeit some more than others."
"Nah, let’s spend it with playoff juggernaut 15ppg Tobias Harris instead LMAO. Our best player turned 23 last week, yours turns 27 in a week, you better hope you manage Embiid’s prime as well as we’ve managed Jayson’s first few years lmao"
tobias harris about to drop 40 pts
"I'm acting like he made the wrong moves. How's Lavine doing?   I'm not saying tank forever. Don't trade your young assets to just lose in the playoffs.   Fortunately you'll make the playoffs with young assets.   Unless they have no potential or you get an actual superstar you don't trade for a middle-aged star right now.   You said Harden, but I said Hayward. Butler is closer to a Hayward caliber than one of the best SG's to ever play in the NBA. No shit you make that trade.   Nobody faults trading for Tobias Harris as he is a complimentary player to the superstar and all-nba player. Neither you or Minny have that situation, so I don't get bringing him up.   What Thibs was building was mediocre and would constantly be bottom of the barrel and bounce in the first round. At best a 2nd round exit. That's not revisionist.  In the end you're lucky NYK aren't giving Thibs control."
"every championship team in recent memory has had a floor general type passer to organize their offense in the playoffs. swap Lavine and Simmons, now Tobias Harris may very well be the best distributor in the starting five. Does that sound like a championship team to you? You'd settle for Tobias Harris being your floor general?"
"Well yes, If I have a damn good bench, an mvp, one of the best defensive players in the league who’s also a playmaker, and a top 5 defense, I am completely ok with Tobias Harris as my second option."
"So You’d settle for fucking Tobias Harris as your second option?? Embiid/LaVine is a much better duo than Simmons/Embiid. Unless Simmons develops, he will continue to be a detriment to his team on the offensive end in the playoffs."
Tobias Harris is from Long Island so hes cool in my book
"I like Tobias Harris, he cool."
Upvote this one please! The world wants to know. Mine would be Tobias Harris
How would a team stop a player on a team with Tobias Harris and Seth Curry as starters? Quite easily I imagine.
"Exactly, it wasn’t his fault. No matter how good he is, you’re just not winning a series unless everybody else majorly steps up. Problem with the Sixers is, they have guys that can maybe defend a little, but those same guys cannot give you much on the other end. Mattyse Thybulle is going to be unplayable, Danny Green is borderline. For them to have a chance, Tobias Harris is going to have to be an efficient 25-30 a game monster, something which he has been the polar opposite of in the post season throughout his career."
"&gt; Dwade was an ironman like kobe, never got injured, possibly Heat/Cavs ECF in 2007?, He was out for most of the year that time  As I see it, yes  &gt;Brandon Roy/Dame Lillard/Greg Oden big three  Ask again later  &gt;Kobe to the bulls in 06  As I see it, yes  &gt;Heatles go to Bulls instead of heat to team up with Drose  Without a doubt  &gt;Russell Westbrook drafted by the Heat in 11' and keeps his college defense prowess and improves upon it  Very doubtful  &gt;KD stays in OKC  It is decidedly so  &gt;OKC trio stays in general  Yes  &gt;Kyrie and Klove never got injured in 15' finals  Better not tell you now  &gt;Gilbert Arenas playing into this era  Better not tell you now  &gt;Chris Bosh never got his blood clot  Better not tell you now  &gt;Demarcus Cousins staying healthy on either warriors or Lakers and still playing at a high level  My sources say no  &gt;That sixers lineup of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid stayed together  Don't count on it  &gt;Curry to the Hornets (or was it Knicks, Timberwolves who could pick him?

"Ben is unreliable come playoff time, you can’t go in the playoffs with him being your 2nd player and be a contender  With Ben having the same impact as Danny Green, your second best player is Tobias Harris and you’re not gonna win anything past round 1 with him being your second best player   Embiid is cool and all but those calls he gets right now will decrease in the playoffs"
"Clippers. The 6ers would have *absurd* interior defense, and their bigs aren't particularly lumbering either so they can go out on the perimeter, but that Clippers team just has too much of everything. The scoring, floor spacing, defense, and IQ are all of the charts. Rondo is one of the best passers/floor generals of all time, regularly averaging double digit assists back in his prime and he was also a good defender. Prime Ibaka was a shot-blocking savant. Prime Boogie isn't even that far removed, so people should know what he's capable of. Prime Batum was a swiss army knife.   Clippers get upgrades at every position outside of their main duo. They're currently posting the best ORtg of all time right now, so just imagine how lethal the offense is going to be when you've got a younger Rondo and a prime fucking Boogie, lmao. The sixers get an upgraded Dwight Howard but that's pretty much it. Embiid is who he is, so is Ben Simmons, Danny Green hasn't really changed his whole career so him being in his prime doesn't change anything, and Tobias Harris is already currently having his 2nd best scoring season PPG-wise and his best season efficiency-wise."
Tobias Harris is so fucking confused LOL
My man said Tobias fucking Harris was outplaying jayson Tatum 😂
"He's 11th in the league in scoring right now and trending up. How could you say he's ""easily not top 15"" lmao.   Shame on you for even comparing him to Tobias Harris."
"Tobias Harris, cp3, d mitch, butler, ad, I would take Tatum over all these guys scoring wise honestly. Especially at this level he's been playing at recently."
"Sixers/Jazz was also a very informative game about both teams. The Jazz ended up losing, but nobody can say they weren’t dominant and smothering. But then of course the sixers came back with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid dominating on offense, and Ben Simmons erasing Mitchell down the stretch."
"Jayson Tatums hot streak splits are what Tobias Harris is at for the full year.  Tobi is balling this year, really happy for him."
"Hes easily not top 15 if you really think about it.  Its not a knock on him, there's just too much talent.  AD, Curry, Lillard, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Bron, Giannis, Luka, Tobias Harris, Zion, Lavine, Beal, Kyrie, KD, Harden, PG, Kawhi, Booker, CP3, Don Mitchell."
lol i wish i could feel sorry for Sixers fans. these clowns have deluded themselves into thinking they are contenders because they can beat down on the Thunder and Pistons  they choke against any good team they play against in the playoffs. Embiid potentially winning MVP was the closest thing to success they could have had in 20 years but now it's gone down the drain. now they're stuck gassing up tobias harris. sad times ahead
"Lmao what did the Wolves or Wolves fans do to you to make you so angry at them in this comment chain? We’re just out here sucking every year, how could you possibly be so pissy  Also why the fuck would any of us care about Tobias Harris  I like Wiggs, I do think that watching him for years gives fans reasonable concerns about his inconsistent effort. But if that’s solved (particularly defensively) he’s easily a great third option. Not sold on second though."
Until this season Tobias Harris was looking like a joke for his contract.
"Huh? What do the Wolves have to do with Tobias Harris? Didn't know that was a narrative, he's been better than Wiggins for years. Guess we'll have to wait and see, if Wiggins makes that kind of money again it will be on a non-contender like Harrison Barnes did. Championship teams won't reach that far for an average starter."
"I believe he means insert almost any player in the league on a max and its bad and on a min its good. Most players aren't on a max so it can still apply with all maxes being good.    Even then a ton of max players being number 1 would be really bad. Most teams with 2nd and 3rd max players are competing for the title and pay them to have the talent. Guys like Tobias Harris, Kemba Walker, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton, Blake Griffin(idk how his contract actually works out right now), Russ, Wall, Lowry, Wiggins, KP, McCollum, and even guys a tier above that such as PG, Conley, and AD. If they are maxed and the number one option your team is wasting money unless they use these signing to attract other stars who are better."
"Sixers wanted the unprotected Miami pick, which had a solid chance at the time to be in the lottery. Thought they could offer it for Kawhi or PG and instead spent it on Tobias Harris. The guy they traded down for turned out to have a career threatening allergy."
Tobias Harris
"James Harden, Anthony Edwards, Tobias Harris"
"Ben Simmons was an all star and is a DPOY candidate and currently a better overall player then Murray.   Tobias Harris was a fringe all star, very good defender and one on one player, and currently a better player than mpj.  Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   AG has been in Denver for 11 games and they are 9-2 in that stretch."
"Bro the Sixers just played Embiid 36 minutes against the Clippers because that is what was required. Like I said Doc plays his bench heavy minutes together and doesn't want any player playing a ton of minutes in the regular season if he can help it. Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris both average 33.3 mpg, Joel averages 32 with Howard playing basically all of his backup minutes when he's out there.   Again, that's just how the coach normally wants things to go, sometimes it's fewer and he plays 26-29 sometimes he plays 35-40. Just depends on the game. And obviously the playoffs they will play more as rotations shrink.   Jokic playstyle allows him to play heavy minutes, heavy games and not be at risk for injury. That's great, but Embiid plays pretty normal minutes for a 7'0"" 270lb center who is asked to do so much on both ends."
lol you would give up Tobias Harris for him ?
Well if you could use context clues you would realize I was talking about Ben but your reading comprehension is shot. When people talk about the Philly duo the first person they think of isn’t Tobias Harris guy.
Casually calling kawhi the second best player on the court when he daddied embiid into crying in the playoffs lol. And I’m just trying to clarify that missing Tobias Harris does not equal missing kawhi Leonard. But you don’t really seem to understand that
"Sixers were also missing 2 starters, including  their 2nd leading scorer and All Star snub, Tobias Harris.  Why don't you ask why coaches choose to ""load manage"" their stars against Philly?"
"he could play some back to backs but he'll never go a full season without load management. it'd be irresponsible to do anything differently  i'm glad you brought those 18 games up - 8 of them were because of that fultz injury i mentioned in my previous comment, and the other 10 were all load management. if you can win a few games without embiid (and thanks to tobias harris and ben simmons (and danny green for a couple of games), the sixers have been able to win without embiid this year so far) then the load management is way less of an issue"
"It sounds like you don't want to hear anything that could potentially be negative towards the sixers. Joel Embiid is the greatest center of all time, Tobias Harris is the most clutch player of the decade, and Ben Simmons will have a complete offensive arsenal come playoff time. Hope you can hop off reddit in peace now"
Why are you acting like it’s such a controversial take. Do you really believe that Tobias Harris is as good as Kawhi? That’s some delusional shit lol
"There is no embiid stopper. Dealing with Philly comes down to what we do against Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny green, Ben Simmons etc. Joel can do whatever he wants as long as we do well against everyone else, they are not beating us"
"Great game from the Clippers. Obviously the best player missing from this game was Kawhi Leonard, that's undisputable. But the Sixers were missing Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and playing Mike Scott, which really hurts our shooting.   Smart job by Lue to double Embiid the entire game and basically force the Sixers to shoot wide open threes from Mike Scott. Kork and DG obviously still have us great shooting but they were helping off of Scott all game. When you see that he went two for infinity from downtown, remember that these were off of absolutely wide ass open threes, usually from the corner.   Anyway. Good job by everyone on both teams, obviously especially PG and Embiid."
"We played today without Tobias Harris, George Hill, Seth Curry, or Dwight Howard."
"His team is really good. I would argue the 76ers are just slightly better (or were before the Nugs got Aaron Gordon). Tobias Harris is having an excellent season (at least as good as Jamal, probably better), and Ben Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate. It's debatable for sure, and I think it's close. I just think it's tough to give a guy MVP when he's missed 25% of the season, and likely more by season's end as I suspect Embiid won't play in every remaining game.  EDIT: Another thing to note is that LeBron has played more games than Embiid this year and doesn't seem to be in the conversation at all since his injury, despite having the Lakers playing arguably the best ball in the league while their second best player was having a major down year before getting injured for months."
Maybe Harrell? Jordan Clarkson? Probably Tobias Harris
"to be fair, Tobias Harris kinda does need to be your new JJ Redick when he’s effectively the shooting guard in the starting lineup lol"
Much worse teams?   AD played with Boogie and Jrue.   Or are we pretending like Tobias Harris wasn't considered the worst contract in the NBA last season by /r/NBA?
"see, you get it. CJ is a great player, but someone like Jrue Holiday or Tobias Harris might fit better because they're less ball dominant and a better defender."
They literally tried. They acquired Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler in trades to try and 4-headed beast the East and failed.
"JVG was not the coach, it was his brother SVG.  And he destroyed the Pistons (as GM) for a decade trying to build around Andre and Reggie Jackson, and then mortgaged the future by trading away assets (Tobias Harris and a pick that turned into Shai-Gilgeous Alexander) for damaged goods (Blake) on a massive outsized contract."
Probably someone like Hayward or Tobias Harris
Again all you do is look at the stat sheet. You don’t take into account that embiid plays with an all nba player and an all star while rose played with none. When embiid played without his all nba teammate he was an easy sweep for Boston. Rose took the big 3 Boston team to 7 with Ben Gordon... Tobias Harris is better than Ben Gordon. Then took Miami to 6 embiid has literally never made it past 5 games without jimmy on the team it’s not even close. Embiid is a known choker.
"Better: CP3, Lonzo, Tobias Harris  Worse: KAT, Russ, Ben Simmons  CP3 will take your weak team to the playoffs and get bubble team to the 2nd round (maybe) all while developing young talent and helping guys find their niche.  Lonzo plays smart and understands spacing in real time better than 99% of NBA players and he can make every pass in the game.   Toby is like the PG13 of the east, if he had the dog drive in him he'd be a superstar.  KAT has all the skills but disappears when he feels like it  Russ is a stat padder who's elite at getting to the basket but that is fading as he ages and exposing how poorly he does so many other things. Ben is too easy to scheme against if you have a wing that can take away the passing lanes and guys willing to step in and take the charge/challenge the drive. He's not explosive enough to LBJ his way to the rim and can't shoot that limits him."
"Idk why teams never get the memo. Win now = win never.   This trade reminds me of our horrific trade to get Blake Griffin, where we gave up players like Tobias Harris &amp; a first round pick that ended up being SGA"
Simmons is on a 5 year 177 million contract. He is barely a positive asset right now given his offensive decline. Tobias Harris who people widely pan as a terrible contract is outperforming him by nearly every advanced metric. So why does Simmons supposedly have superstar level trade value yet everyone thinks Tobias Harris is untradeable when they have the same contract basically?
"“2020 Sixers are better than the 2011 Bulls. MVP Embiid, DPOY Simmons and prime Tobias Harris are deadly. Also the Bucks with Giannis and prime Middleton”"
"39 on 29 is not bad night. he had 11 free throws so he had like around 34-35 possessions for 39 shots which is still moderately efficient, about a 58% true shooting. First half he wasnt tthat efficient, second he was fantastic.  Not really back breaking for the nets. what really killed us is how great tobias harris was in the first half and the 3pt shooting from korkmaz and milton in that second half."
"Definitely not the most. He's an elite shooter next to Giannis. Compare that to Westbrook, Wall, Love, Wiggins, Draymond, Horford, Hield, etc.  He's more similar to Tobias Harris (except better imo, though it's closer this year) or Jamal Murray. Murray was not worth up to 38 mill a year prior to the bubble playoffs, which was hopefully a turning point before the ACL. He's better and younger than Middleton but it's a similar contract situation.  Both were homegrown talented and key pieces of their teams in smaller markets not known to attract big free agents, and both could have got the max elsewhere. So you overpay. Middleton's shooting and offensive skillset is crucial next to Giannis even if he isn't 2nd-star talent."
No Tobias Harris is
A more interesting question is how a team built of 3rd best players would do.  PG: Conley SG: Kyrie SF: Middleton (Jrue is the 2nd best player) PF: Tobias Harris C: DeAndre Ayton
"I’ll say this about Tobias Harris: regardless of where you rank the guy on the team or in the league, he has been one of the most efficient and reliable players in the NBA this season. The guy deserves a lot more props."
"Tobias Harris is who we thought he was, so if you wanna crown him, CROWN HIM!!!"
"They outscored them for 4 minutes, and we didn't play Tobias Harris who is our main perimeter ball handler late in games. Congrats"
Tobias Harris is the best player in the nba and it’s not close
Why was Tobias Harris playing all those minutes when it was a 20-point game? Now he's resting with Korkmaz playing...
3 point shooters I’m most confident it’ll go in when they shoot it   3) Tobias Harris   2) Seth curry   1) Ben Simmons at the end quarters
"He’s not Tobias Harris, he SHOWS UP when it matters most"
I feel like I have to fill out a Tobias Harris apology form at least once a month the way he's looked this season.
Tired: how do you stop kyrie irving?  Wired: how do you stop tobias harris?
# HOW U GET DUNKED ON BY TOBIAS HARRIS LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Kyrie putting up 23/7 with like half the team sitting out against the 2nd best defense in the league...dude's playing out of his mind right now.  Would be nice if somebody would put a body on Tobias Harris. Joe Harris is getting bullied today. These physical teams are a bad matchup for him, he can't handle a talented scorer like Harris 1-1 and the Sixers are not letting him get those open looks off screens. And obviously really exacerbated by not having KD/Harden. He's gotta step up in the 2nd half"
It really is. I love watching good defense. I love Tobias Harris out there blocking shots
Tobias Harris with a casual 17 pts in one half. Not bad
Tobias Harris
They're not complete at all lmao. Their second best player is a role player in the half court and they have zero half court ball handlers and no elite scorers besides Embiid. Tobias Harris isos are not gonna save their anemic offence.
Tobias Harris was an all star? Lmao
Tobias Harris
He’d be a great tank commander. So would Tobias Harris and such. It isn’t necessarily an insult.  Although yeah Cam Payne has so much more going for him at this point.
Yea we have already seen him be a 2nd option on a championship team. People are mad at his contract but honestly that's just the going rate for a young all star. Look at Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons
"Lebron (25.4), Bridges (12.9), Danny Green (9.7), Tobias Harris (20.4), Claxton (7.1)"
"So yeah in the draft he was seen as an ""elite"" pick and roll big who can roll to the basket and finish strong due to his athleticism, or stay around the three point line where he was around 39 - 40% from three if I'm not mistaken.  Folks also liked his footwork around the basket and projected he'd have some good post moves.  Also funnily enough, After checking a couple profiles, many said he was the most ""polished"" and ""NBA ready"".  Funny how things work out right.   A comparison a lot of folks used was Tobias Harris, but Tobias isn't the athlete Obi is and Obi does not have the playmaking skills Tobias has IMO."
Tobias Harris?
Jalen Johnson is going 15 at the latest. If he was still at Duke he'd be going 6th. As is he is going to fall to like 10-12 most likely. If he falls to us. We aren't passing on him. Unless he really fucks his interviews. He projects to be a Tobias Harris esque player with elite defence and more hops. He's the ultimate boom or bust player in this draft. If he booms he'll be top 10 if not well hell be out the league by year 4.
"Trust me, I've been hoping for the same thing. Feel like a Tobias Harris trade might work  Lillard/Powell/Harris/RoCo/Nurkic is really nice"
"Don’t worry.  Tobias Harris has been terrible in the playoffs throughout his entire career. This game is most likely an outlier.  No way wizards get swept, this game was already so close."
"I agree, the Wizards should put Westbrook on Tobias Harris"
Tobias Harris is underrated. He shoots efficiently and score in isolation. He's just a big problem that is hard to stop.
"That's fair, he does need to shoot more. I'm quite confident that his scoring numbers will go up when Embid inevitably needs to load manage or gets injured.   If you look at every game this season where Embid's big lumbering ass wasn't flopping all over the paint, clogging up driving lanes Simmons was able to be much more effective as a scorer.   Until that time comes I think Philly fans should be happy with a W and happy that they have a guard on their team that picks up so much slack for their bigs, while also smartly facilitating to the ""hot hand"" of Tobias Harris."
Tobias Harris took them like hostages
ben simmons didnt play. al horford and jason richardson were still on the team. brett brown was the head coach. tobias harris was terrible. way different sixers team this year compared to last year.
The Embiid/Harris duo is unreal. Props to Tobias.
Exactly. Career playoff game from Tobias Harris and we barely lose with WB playing bad in game 1 at home? Not to bad tbh. It definitely feels like we will steal a game
[Tobias Harris apology form](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq6tEdgXAAA64Ps.jpg)

Tobias Harris J. Cole confirmed brothers
"You were right, it seems Tobias Harris became that dominant perimeter scorer i said the sixers lacked"
I love Tobias Harris
"Disagree. I'd love Curry to show his pre-Covid form and Hill to stabilize the roster. But while all the focus is rightfully on Embiid and Simmons, the closer all season has been Tobias Harris.  IMO he's just as important as any of them."

Really gonna let Tobias Harris run us
Tobias Harris toasting these bum ass Wizards love to see it
Seriously. Tobias Harris is having the game of his life out here. Yet it’s all westbrick this or that. I don’t get how people have hate for a dude like Westbrook
Bench Rui and play Gil. Rui out here thinking it's first game of the season! Someone stop fucking Tobias Harris ffs!
maybe tobias harris is the mvp?
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris has 30 and you’re down at half?
Tobias Harris is the 76er
How far can the sixers go with Tobias Harris as the only scorer behind Embiid?
You are a little worried dont lie. Tobias Harris has 28 at the half and you are losing
"This is a very mixed bag.      Embiid is a beast as always, but 3 fouls early on, only one of which was a questionable call, effectively didn’t allow him to play the first half.  Tobias Harris as already made up for his complete disappearance in last years playoffs in this half alone.      Our streaky ass 3 point shooters have gone cold, which will be problematic the further we go into these playoffs."
Tobias FUCKING Harris. This man is a god
Doc is really the Tobias Harris whisperer. Revived this man.
if you didn’t count on Tobias Harris you haven’t been paying attention
Damn that tobias harris contract lookin lit rn
"Tobias ""Joel Embiid"" Harris"
Doc Rivers was really the key to unlocking Tobias Harris lmao
tobias harris clearly the mvp of this team and not embiid
Wizards stop Tobias Harris challenge
tobias harris = UNDERPAID
Wizards vs. Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris is underpaid
if tobias harris can be a true #2 then this team got a shot.
Tobias Harris come playoff time is better than Simmons by a lot
If we could keep Tobias Harris from playing like Larry bird I think we’ll win this
Tobias Harris will get slept on our entire playoff run
The Tobias Harris vs Alex Len game we all expected
just let Simmons post up Neto instead of helping off Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris is carrying us right now.
Completely forgot peak MJ and Tobias Harris are the same person
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris actually playing well in the playoffs????
"I think it is mostly on the player. It is super rare where a player busts on one team and then goes to another team who was able to unlock their hidden potential that the previous team wasn't able. Many of these draft busts are let go even when they are in their early 20's or even like 21 years old so they have plenty of time to develop with other teams. Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, Derrick Williams, Anthony Bennett, Jahlil Okafor, etc these guys were all young when they switched teams and the new team wasn't able to get much more of them. The fact that is just so rare that this happens and the best examples people can come up with are Josh Jackson putting up slightly better numbers than his rookie year and unable to start on the worst team in the east, or Wiggins shooting better when he is with the insane gravity of Curry. It is so rare infact, I can't even think of a single example where a player is determined to be a bust, switches team, then lives up anywhere close to their predraft hype. Only example that kind of fits is Tobias Harris, and he was a middle of the first round draft pick and just got more minutes on a new team."
Tobias harris. At least the man is playing great lol
Tobias Harris is a lot better than Wiggins. He’s been the best scorer on a playoff team and is currently the second best scorer on the 76ers.
"They should trade for Tobias Harris, win win for both"
Tobias Harris is an excellent player.
Wiggins isn’t even close to Tobias Harris
Tobias harris is better than wiggins
He's owed 31.5m and 33.5m for the next 2 seasons. That's really bad.  And what does D'lo have to do with him?  &gt;Tobias Harris and several other worse players for the next two years.  Dude Tobias was a #1 option on a playoff team Clippers for most of the season and is the #2 option on a #1 seed. What are you on about? Who are these worse players?   &gt;His last year he becomes an asset in the form of a 30 mil expiring.  That would entail him staying the next year on your roster lol
Just realized that Jordan Poole looks like a mix of Tobias Harris and Gerald Green
Jordan Poole looks like an anorexic Tobias Harris/J.Cole
Wiggins got that Tobias Harris passing vision
"In his first 3 seasons (excluding 18-19 because he was out for the grand majority of it) Dillon Brooks has ...  - Played more minutes per game in each season than Danny has ever in his career - Has a usage % higher than Danny has ever had in his career - Is averaging 6 ppg more than Danny has ever had his career          - Averaged 5 more ppg in his sophomore season than Danny's best   Dillon is much more than a spot up shooter, he can handle the ball, he can play off and break through pick and rolls, he's an insanely good finisher, and he combines that with a very decent shooting game. Obviously Green has had a much more successful career, one that has been super exceptional for a role player. But no one would say Danny Green is better than players like Bojan Bogdanovic, Jaylen Brown or Tobias Harris, even though their careers nowhere compare to Danny's.  Dillon already seems to be a player who doesn't have to hide as the 4th or 5th best player on a VERY good team to be useful. Outside of that role, Danny is okay, and that's a very narrow role. He's been very lucky to bounce from Spurs, to Raptors to 76ers.   Tony Parker isn't better than Tracy McGrady, I think this is a similar sort of situation."
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
PHI: Tobias Harris and various essences of Danny Green
"Could y'all match up Gafford (or Bonga, if he's alive) on Tobias Harris to keep Rui on Simmons and the other two bigs on Embiid? It would fuck up your spacing, but it's not like your spacing was great to begin with...  When Simmons sits, then you can revert back to a one big lineup."
"He wasn't relegated to being the fourth option. He was the fourth option because the first three were:  Joel Embiid  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  I am obviously a huge Ben fan but I want all of those players taking shots before Ben unless it's in transition or there is a mismatch in the post.   I am not worried because I watch every Sixers game and have seen the difference between how he's used this season and last. Idk if it's Ben being more willing to do the little things or just Docs coaching and schemes but he has been incredibly useful on offense, while shooting less frequently than ever.   So if we lose to the Bucks or Nets or whatever I am almost certainly not gonna blame the guy that averages (at least not only him) 14-15ppg for averaging 10-12ppg. If he's turning the ball over or getting roasted on the other end, or not pushing the pace then that's one thing. That's what he does for this team. But him not being a jumpshooter doesn't matter to the current iteration of the Sixers. They know he can't and that's why it isn't important for him to score in our offense.   The example you used is really my point exactly. The Bucks depended on MVP Giannis to score 25+ a game. He is their superstar number one option. His deficiencies caused him to not score efficiently or at his normal numbers. That hurt the team. Simmons isn't our primary or secondary scorer, he's our primary facilitator. He needs to be able to do that and a lack of a jumper is not likely to hinder that ability since it hasn't all season. The regular season does matter I'm sorry it does. It's not the playoffs but it is important.   And I know you might want to say that his limitations will hurt Embiid, but trust me they won't. Doc knows how to use Ben to make Embiid's life easier and he's been doing so all year. The playoffs won't change the fact that you can't just leave Ben wide open in the dunker's spot or when he cuts to the rim.   So no, I'm not worried about that. I have concerns, but not that Ben won't be able to score enough for us to win, because that's not typically how we win anyway."
Do you guys think Barkley and/or Shaq even know that Tobias Harris plays for the Sixers?
"He cannot fit with Embiid. Embiid needs a Tobias Harris type of power forward, one who barely is."
"Ok I can only take so much doc rivers slander in this thread. Dude has his problems, and he fucked up MASSIVELY three times through his career, but he is NOTA a bad coach and deserves a bit more respect in spite of his fuck ups.   dude won a ring.  Coached us through and out of the Sterling saga, which is one of those things you can’t properly rate. Took a healthy 2019 warriors to 6 with a team with no stars, a team that traded away their best player midway through the season, and, unlike the Toronto Raptors, actually won games Kevin Durant played in.   And after people cried for the 76ers to trade either Ben or Embiid every off season because “they could never fit together,”  guess what? They now do, in fact, fit together and work really well together, actually. And hey, remember how Tobias Harris wasnt good? Guess fucking what! He’s good again! Maybe even really good coaches can also be major fuck ups at times and none of us actually know the complexities of coaching in the nba and what makes one “good” or “bad” at doing it and we just think the fuck ups are more important because there are memes about it.   All that said, lol, the answer is obviously spo."
Tobias Harris  dude is 28 and been a liability every playoff series he’s been in but people on this sub act like he’s better than CJ McCollum because Tobias is taller lol
"Bro we were literally able to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris from moves he made two years prior. He literally said he shuddered at the lost opportunity of signing Robert Covington as an UDFA when Houston picked him up. He didn't just suck and guess, he was building something that stood the test of time (BC and EB). Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Richard Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few pieces that would be really beneficial to contenders not as stars but as high-mid level bench pieces"

"Having Gasol, Trez and Drummond on the Lakers roster mean 76ers can throw Embiid and Howard on AD. 76ers have a big wing player in Tobias Harris, we are generally struggling with a good big wing player. KCP/Caruso is the best wing defender we have now, but they are not good wing defenders. Embiid can eat AD alive and he can foul him out because AD is still small to defend Embiid. 76ers caused a lot of issues when we played against them when both teams are healthy. 76ers is a bad matchup for the Lakers. 76ers is probably one of the last team Lakers want to face."

Derozan needs to be in a Tobias Harris type role
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris’s salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that’s true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we’ve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It’s also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
"Don't worry, Tobias ""has never averaged even 16ppg in a playoff run"" Harris was going to cover for Ben as the #2 scoring option on their team."
True his contract is just huge. It’s a shame tho cause I think the embiid/Simmons pairing would be maximized if they had a really good perimeter threat but they have all that money that should go to that player to Tobias Harris. Harris has played really well this season but he just doesn’t do the things that would make life easier for the other two (namely shooting a lot of threes and shooting off the dribble/coming off screens). The sixers 3 max players all want to post up every play lol might work cause of sheer talent but really doesn’t make a ton of sense
"Tobias Harris was a boarderline all -star this season who just missed out on a 50/40/90 on 20 pts a game, with above average defense.  I dunno how he doesn't make the top 80."
I know it’s all about Bobi and Luka now but seeing clips of Tobias Harris talking about how much he loves Boban always warms my heart.
"I think Jaylen &gt; Ben is a fair take (although I dont agree with it, its certainly close)  &gt;And it isn't particularly close either  Now thats just underrating Simmons by a ridiculous amount  Let me guess, Tobias Harris is our 2nd best player?"
"&gt; Whoever made this shit needs to be fired   Tobias Harris, also, probably, but only if he was in it"
"Funny that even with the draft talent we had, our top FAs signed were Tobias Harris, Al Horford and JJ Redick. All of whom we paid a significant premium for..."
"How coaches/GMs have decided to position Tobias Harris has always frustrated me. He's pretty clearly been better at the 4 for his entire career but he had to deal with crowded front courts in both Orlando and Philly. I knew just moving him to the 4 permanently would make a huge difference (per bball ref this is the first year he's played no minutes at 3, playing a quarter of his minutes there last year). The Green and Curry moves were excellent as well.   I took a $100 bet for the Sixers to win the east at +850 at the start of the season. I can cash out to roughly double my money but might just ride it out."
"Except the third all star is Tobias Harris, who wasn’t really a star in Philly before doc and was considered the worst contract in the league last season. The reason he got the massive contract in the first place was largely because of his time playing for doc on the Clippers."
Already considered good and added Danny Green and Seth Curry and Dwight Howard and found a way to effectively use Tobias Harris
"They still aren't contenders IMO. Simmons will get game planned for in the playoffs and you can't rely on Tobias Harris as your second best player on offense. I mean, it might work but I just don't see them getting past the 2nd round"
This is the only one that seems likely. I’d guess prolly would prefer to move Tobias Harris for a true perimeter shot creator and see if that works before moving Simmons but I doubt that’ll happen with Harris’s contract
"&gt;I think there's also an element of (very) poor player development. Guys like Bender or Chriss were extremely raw, but had a couple of potentially interesting skills.  If that was truly the case, why didn't any of these draft busts switch teams and other teams unlock their unlocked potential? How old was Chriss, Dragan Bender, and Josh Jackson when they got cut/released/traded? Early 20's? Surely they were still extremely young. The amount of times that a player gets cut that was deemed a true bust, switches teams, and comes anywhere near their predraft hype is pretty much zero. Last time I can think of that sorta happening was with Julius Randle and that was because the Lakers wanted the cap space to sign Lebron James. Last time it kinda happened with the Bucks was with Tobias Harris in 2013 but it wasn't like he was a top 5 draft pick and just didn't get a lot of minutes. If Bender turns into anything remotely like Porzingis and Josh Jackson turns into an all NBA defender like everyone thought he could then I would blame the player development more but this just happens so rarely in the NBA."
"Was thinking of watching, but then I realized the Tobias Harris shot against us is gonna be in there. Not reliving that shit again"
"Not really. Good players are just concentrated on contenders because of salary limitations individually. You could have 30 stars lead every team if spread out nicely.  1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Luka 5. Lebron 6. Dame 7. Butler 8. Kawhi 9. Randle 10. Zion 11. Embiid 12. CP3 13. Harden 14. Kyrie 15. KD 16. Westbrook 17. Tatum 18. Young 19. AD 20. Beal 21. KAT 22. PG 23. Mitchell 24. Simmons 25. Ingram 26. BAM 27. SGA 28. Morant 29. Siakam 30. Booker  You still have guys like McCollum, Klay, Gobert, Sabonis, Lavine, Derozan, Tobias Harris, Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Vucevic, Middleton, Draymond, Murray, Gordon, Kemba Walker, D'lo, Hayward to pair up with any guys above to balanced out really strong individuals like Lebron/Giannis/Curry/KD"
"Brooklyn’s main tactic was double teaming Embiid on every possession and since the 76ers offense is just below average, it’s going to be tough. Embiid carries their whole offense, so if he’s not going who is. The only person who can produce is Tobias Harris, but its not enough when you have KD/Harden/Kyrie dropping 30 each"
"Sixers acquired Tobias Harris through trade, then resigned him in free agency so that label is a bit misleading.  That would be like saying the Bucks acquired Khris Middleton in free agency in 2019"
"Khris Middleton last year, Tobias Harris, Chris Paul, Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Zach Lavine, Mikal Bridges, John Collins were all pretty close-very close"
Tobias Harris was very close. Ended at 51.2/39.4/89.2
"I don't think Grant is a legit #1 option. His scoring definitely suffered as the season moved on. He'll be like a poor man's Khris Middleton, which is perfectly swell.  But overall the most enjoyable season of the past decade, besides the Tobias Harris playoff season. We fought hard and got to see young players develop."
I mean at the end of the day Kyrie made it into the artibtrary club and Khris didn’t. It’s not like there’s a physical award or anything like a scoring title so no need to tear down Kyrie’s accomplishment  Also not just Khris even this year Tobias Harris missed the mark by 6 FT’s. It’s tough
Tobias Harris is the great value version of PG13.
Tobias Harris is not the second best player on the sixers lmao
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
and you'll owe Tobias Harris 40 million
He was talking about Joe Harris not Tobias
Tobias Harris was world's better than Kuzma even when teams were trading him just for fun
People prob said this about Tobias Harris when he was getting passed around like blunt in the East
The real J Cole tobias harris will win finals mvp so it’s alright
Tobias Harris......if they did it last year lol.
No bias. The 6ers are much better suited to stop the trae young high pnr than the knicks. Trae goes from getting guarded by reggie bullock or whoever on the switch to defenders like George Hill Danny Green Matise Thybulle Ben Simmons and Tobias harris.   Hawks have the size to match the 6ers but not the talent on defense to out play the 6ers offense.
Gotta do what it takes to get Tobias Harris his first ring
"It’s crazy you guys have consistently good trade packages lmao, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris for example"
"Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Thybulle, and 1-3 firsts for dame and cj. Who says no?"
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
Trade everything they need to find someone like kris Middleton. Actually a good trade is Tobias Harris for Cj. Way better defender.
Think it would have been better if the clippers kept Tobias Harris and had him team with kawhii
"Who's beating the All-Cancer team.  PG: Dame Lillard SG: Brad Beal SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Zion Williamson C: Rudy Gobert   With a bench of: Ben Simmons, SGA, Tobias Harris, MPJ, Steven Adams, Bam Adebayo"
I have the hawks taking y'all out in 6. Without Embiid this team can't win. Unless tobias harris or seth curry step up in scoring and ben simmons locks down trae I don't see them winning.
I think Nuggets Sixers would be fun at full strength.  MVP finalist and a high power offense vs  DPOY finalist ( Embiid pretty much would be one too ) and multiple great defenders.     The two best centers in the Game going at it.   Simmons and MPJ matching up a lot.   Aaron Gordon and Tobias Harris in similar roles and importance matching up. ( obviously if Embiid is out or hindered then Harris has a bigger role and importance ).    Would be fun.
Oh how the turntables have turned on Tobias Harris.    That contract doesn't look that bad anymore.  Hat's off to Tobi for making it that way.
And get what back? Tobias Harris? Even Harris is an upgrade to CJ this playoffs. Like there’s no way Philly is parting with Simmons.
"looking at the posts since yesterday lebron. jokes aside, middleton and tobias harris are both in a weird limbo shiftinf between under and overrated"
"Yeah without Embiid I do not trust the sixers offensively outside of Tobias Harris and apparently Tyrese Maxey. If I’m being optimistic, without Embiid it’s sixers in 6.   Also with how great the Hawks have been lately, they’re not gonna be easy to lock up in the slightest."
"the Tobias Harris CJ trade doesn't really work for either team though.  We'd be giving up size and Portland has plenty of size when healthy.  Money wise is good, but idk if either team would do that."
"We traded two firsts for RoCo, so I think that we only have one first in the next five years that we're even able to trade. You'd need to flip CJ for another guy who has a big contract, but isn't in a good fit. People were bringing up Tobias Harris but he seems to be working in Philly recently.   Honestly, I was hoping CJ would light it up in a few of the recent games so that his trade value would increase going into the summer but it didn't happen. Zach Collins is always injured and Anfernee Simons was given a few chances to really break into the team but never really earned it.   We almost need to get lucky next year with Ant or Nas Little lighting it up for a few months to create a young guy with value, then swap them for somebody who fits better."
I really want to see what the Sixers offense is going to look like against a good defense if Embiid doesn't play. Tobias Harris as a #1 option doesn't instill the most confidence.
"Yes because the Suns didn't trade for Chris Paul, Sixers didn't trade for Tobias Harris, Mavs didn't trade for Porzingis etc. You guys are insufferable with this shit there are a lot of ways to build contenders"
I will take Tobias Harris. Honestly good trade for both sides
CJ for Tobias Harris. Great move for both sides
"Sixers just because of the injury problems Embiid has.  Defenders like Simmons, Thybelle, Green and Howard are enough to beat any team led by Luka on offense while he is surrounded by shooters like Seth Curry, Green, Korkmaz and a 2nd option in Tobias Harris."
&gt;Dunno why people are trying to clown y'all for not seeing the future and knowing your pick was gonna nearly die to sesame seeds the man's very lucky to be alive.   I don't clown them for that... I clown them for the fact that Bridges was the **perfect** fit for them at the time both in a basketball sense and on a personal level. A 3&amp;D wing who played at Villanova and whose *mom worked for the Sixers* and they traded him during his damn interview about how excited he was to play for them in exchange a high ceiling/low floor project who wasn't known for his shooting or defense and a draft pick they ended up trading anyway for Tobias Harris.
"Thats a huge exaggeration. At best it would have resulted in a role player at up to $20M if they signed that player BEFORE they re-signed Simmons because they had Harris' non-Bird rights and could spend up to $12M of his $32M first year salary above the cap... And once they re-signed Simmons using his Bird rights - there's no more cap space, even if Tobias Harris is gone. It saves them in the luxury tax, but not in a way that helps them add talent."
and a Miami first rounder that was flipped with Landry Shamet and scraps for Tobias Harris.
"We’ll give the Warriors Tobias Harris, Mattisse Thybulle, Mike Scott’s animated corpse, and all of the first round picks forever."
"Middleton, MPJ, Tobias Harris"
"If they have MPJ, they probably don't have Tobias Harris."
Who would you rather have *this year*? MPJ or Tobias Harris?  The 2021 unprotected Heat 1st rounder that they got in the 10-for-16/Zhaire Smith deal was a key piece in getting Harris.
/r/nba gonna be real spooked when morey trades tobias harris for CJ to get themselves a CJ - Curry - Thybulle - Simmons - embiid starting lineup next year.
I think the key to this series is gonna be Deandre Hunter's defense against Tobias Harris. If we can limit Harris offensively and force Simmons to be Embiid's #2 scoring option then I think we can surprise some people with how far this series goes. If Harris is getting his and Embiid is rolling this is gonna be over in 5 though.
If there’s a way to move Tobias Harris for him I’d him in Philly.
Tobias Harris punching air right now.
"I'm gonna disagree entirely. We needed a 4 man who can score from anywhere and who can make plays, and Harris is one of the better PFs in this league at doing this now. To your point about shooting splits, of course he shot better in easier series' but it's not because of quality of defenders, it's about how the team uses him. Harris was PF that season and fit decently well, but last season he was SF and that was absolutely not his role. He was tasked with hitting catch-and-shoot threes and he also didn't have Doc in his ear who diagnosed his biggest problem, which is that he used to hold onto the ball too long and stop the flow of the offense and lose all advantage he had over the defender. If this was about JUST quality of opponent, explain the difference in shooting:  2018-19: 46.9 FG%, 32.6 3P%  2019-20: 47.1 FG%, 36.7 3P%  2020-21: 51.2 FG%, 39.4 3P%  It's clear Tobias is now a better player in a better role, and those shooting numbers are now about where his clippers numbers were, which is further proof that Doc has helped him greatly. If you think shooting 51.2/39.4/89.2 over a season and 19.5 PPG is someone who is going to ruin your championship run, then I think you're crazy"
Doc Rivers and Tobias Harris are meant for each other.
Lol because Seth Curry or Tobias Harris or Danny Green gonna pull dirty shit. You don’t believe that yourself.
Randle needs to play a Tobias Harris role on a contender.
If you were ranking the 4 best players in the series it would be 1. Embiid 2. Trae 3. Simmons 4. Tobias Harris.
Tobias Harris sends his regards
"Gobert would not help the Mavs at all, because he always gets killed at the highest levels since he cannot score.   Middleton is absolutely the correct answer. Khris is one of the most underrated players in the league. A solid defender, he cuts nicely off ball, he shoots well AND he is completely capable of taking over and getting your own shot. Khris Middleton is what philly fans think Tobias Harris is.  Luka and Khris have a similar chance to Giannis and Khris; the difference being that the Bucks need a point guard, and the Mavs would need a rim protector there. Gobert fits in that situation I suppose, if you want to go Studs and Duds and have 3 max players.   But the KP trade was a horrendous mistake that has been partially mitigated by THJR being awesome; however, the Mavs look ready to compound on the mistake by overpaying THJR and making his contributions significantly less valuable.   Luka is so good and so young; honestly, the smartest thing to do for the future of Dallas is to trade Literally everyone over 25 on the roster for as much value as you can get. But that won't happen.  Dirk 2.0 is on the table if the Mavs don't get help. Aka...one real title run."
He seems like a third best guy on a good team type. Kind of that Tobias Harris role. Should be a solid starter who's around for a long time.
Imagine paying Tobias Harris more than Randle hahahahaha
Anyone who’s talked shit on Tobias Harris’ contract after the season he’s had.
"Bro, seriously did you start watching NBA basketball a month ago? Bradley Beal has ***never*** been very good at defense, that's always been the case-even back in college when he played for Florida. He doesn't have a much higher defensive rating than Steph Curry or even Tobias Harris, for that matter. Beal's game is based on putting up points and, to a lesser extent, facilitating. Hell, even on our own teams, John Wall in his prime was a floor raiser, but Beal is too 1 dimensional of a player to do so. Look at our roster, aside from Beal and Russ, it's legitimately AWFUL (I'm including young guys like Gafford and Rui who still need a lot of development to be consistent starters). If the Sixers lost a game to us with fucking Scott Brooks coaching, that's a BAD sign for you guys. Ball don't lie so please think of this conversation when you watch your team getting bounced this playoffs, I'll be here to say ""I told you so."""
I don't know if Rui is going to end up quite as good as Tobias but I've been saying for a while that Rui's game is a whole lot like Harris'
Ish Smith is bettet than Tobias Harris.
I'd rather put Tobias Harris on Alex Len to be honest
"This team needs a complete summer with Daryl Morey's touch. We were a fake #1 seed anyway. It was deserved, don't take me wrong, but a fake #1 seed nevertheless. Bucks are the best team in the East. Nets are the best offense in the NBA and Sixers are top3 defense in the NBA. The thing for the Sixers is get even better scorer and fit than Tobias Harris. And then they will be unstoppable."
The 76ers are worse without Embiid but I think that Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris are good enough to win one more game for 76ers.
"I mean, nobody forced you to read what he had to say, and the post begins with ‘Tobias Harris Reacts’ lol"
"I personally don’t know if I’d have given Rudy a supermax. I didn’t like it when they did it but it’s clearly worked for them since they did a miracle and found Donovan Mitchell at pick 13.  But that’s the thing: they have other offensive centerpieces and can afford to pay Rudy to just set screens, catch lobs, and defend the rim.  If they miss on Donovan or Conley, do you think they’re paying Rudy like that? There’s no way, right?  The Sixers do not, or at least don’t play like they do. I’m unusually high on Tobias Harris and think they really haven’t utilized him enough, and I think this series has shown that a little.   Point being, Ben Simmons can’t be your 2nd option. And there’s still some question of how compatible Ben and Embiid are offensively. They’ve obviously been better this year but it still looks to me like Ben is an offensive liability in the postseason, while Embiid is on the floor.   With Embiid likely out I expect a different tact built around Ben and we’ll all feel dumb for a couple days. Or they’ll lose a game or two and Philly fans will demand he be traded."
"Even if you were just looking at their credentials (which is a stupid way to look at it). How can you compare them to the current Sixers with a straight face?  \- LeBron 4x MVP, 2x FMVP, GOAT conversation &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Embiid (who I personally love)  \- Kevin Love, 3x All-star, 2x NBA 2nd Team &gt;&gt;&gt; Tobias Harris, 0-time all star  The closest might be comparing 24-year old, multi-allstar Kyrie to 24 year old multi-allstar, Simmons, and I think 99% of people agree Kyrie was and is better than Simmons...  Not to mention none of the Sixers players forced or connived their way to Philly to  *form* a SuperTeam, which I think is one of the co-requisites for calling a team a ""SuperTeam""."
"I mean, it's fair to give him his due but when guys want to play together, you clear out the space and make it happen.  David Griffin offloading assets to get Kevin Love and making space to sign Lebron outright? no brainer.  Pelinka/Magic clearing space to sign Lebron and then Pelinka trading a bag for Davis? no brainer.  Even moves that looked semi-bad for awhile like say the 76ers trading for Tobias Harris kind of feel like no brainers now.  He's a good GM however."
"Honestly $15M for Fournier is beyond reasonable.  He's a good shooting wing with size and can handle the ball.    Tobias Harris is a max contract in this league and doesn't give you much beyond Fournier on offense.    Also - while defense is never going to be Fournier's strong suit, KD/Harden/Kyrie have all made fools of most defenders in this league plenty of times."
"Because Simmons was out so they didn't have anyone to run their offense.  Tobias Harris, of all people, led them in assists that series."
"I can understand that. Same thing happened after the bubble and this year with some fans and Siakam. I feel like fans don't understand the fact there is another pseudo step above 1 that maybe 5-10 guys in the league at any one time are.  Bron, Kawhi, Durant, Curry, Harden, Luka, for example, are a tier above.   I would have zero troubles maxing Jim. It's not like we're talking about Tobias Harris."
"There were lots of moves that Ainge *didn't* make despite having the assets for.   Philly, Milwaukee, and Brooklyn are in much better places right now, while Miami and Toronto have gone further than the Celtics in recent years.   They could have traded for a bunch of different players. Kawhi, Jimmy, AD, and hell, even Myles Turner. Even smaller moves like other teams have done for guys like Gasol or Tobias Harris simply were never done by Ainge. He hoarded the cast majority of picks he had, of which the vast majority obviously didn't turn into much.  Ainge was really good at making trades when he felt value was objectively in his favor, but his risk aversion turned him away from tons of ppotential. Don't get me wrong, he was a really good GM, but I just think he was also very flawed."
Bucks have some dumb ones. Trading (still very young but promising) Tobias Harris and scraps for JJ Reddick who didn't want to be in Milwaukee and dipped after half a year. Trading Ray Allen for half a year of old Gary Payton. Paying Miles Plumlee a 4 year/$52 million dollar deal back in 2016. Amazing they were able to dump that contract later on though. There's plenty more from the era where they wanted to always fight for the 8 seed.
Also depends who's coaching. If it's Doc Rivers then you get not-quite-all-star Tobias Harris. If it's anyone else you get decent-starter-I-guess Harris.
I really don't think CJ has a lot of trade value. I don't see sixers trading for him. Imo CJ is like a guard version of  tobias harris. Maybe they can send CJ + picks to the spurs for demar. Or send CJ to Memphis for Kyle Anderson + Brandon Clarke
"All these teams are still less stacked, maybe even significantly so, than some of his competition imo. Right now, the Lakers 3rd player is probably... Shroeder? Just look at a lot of other teams third bests right now. Kemba, Chris Paul/Ayton, Kyrie (lol), Tobias Harris, and so on... And that's just looking at the #3 option. Lakers have no real depth. And I'd argue that's been his championship teams' weakness since the beginning.   And just for some other thoughts, he did spend 7 years in Cleveland with the worst supporting cast you could think of. And the Lakers couldn't even make the playoffs when he was injured."
Trade cj and fire stotts. Get some defense and back up big. Try to get a two way player like Tobias Harris for cj. Do everything that we can with all the first Round picks to get dame a second star.   Hire a top defensive coach like Dave joejer
"Yes, for the love of god it's definitely time.  Simmons is laughable, no way CJ nets that's much. I'd be fine with Tobias Harris. Maybe get involved in whatever the Warriors trade this summer, with Wiggans and a high pick both being good pieces to balance the roster (don't know if both would be coming to Portland, as again that may be a bit too much)."
Just trade him for Tobias Harris
"Just trade CJ at this point. Fuck it, do it for Tobias Harris"
"&gt; there are maybe 3-5 people in the entire league worth this much and he's never been one of em.  The numbers look skewed, but in perspective are not as terrible as they appear.   $43.8 million for 2023-24 would be $4 million more than Kris Middleton. As much as I love Middleton, I dont think he could do what Butler did last year. Not much more than Tobias Harris either.   As long as the KD's of the league keep taking the hardest road to play with other stars, there is a lot of money out there for guys actually trying to be the star of teams of lesser players."
"No, I do not think that the Wizards are winning the series against the 76ers.  Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris are good enough to win another game for 76ers without Embiid especially as game 4 was close with Embiid gone in the second half."
"Siakam was the second option, second most ppg and second most fga. Tobias Harris as the second option in 2019/20 season shot 38/13/79 splits lol that’s not much better then Siakam and he didn’t even have the first option responsibility Siakam did"
"The Warriors second option (Klay) is arguably the 2nd best shooter of all time who averages 22PPG on great efficiency with the ability to score 37 points in a single quarter. The Sixers options behind Embiid are Tobias Harris, Danny Green, and Seth Curry. Asking Draymond to be better than Klay is a lot different than asking Simmons to try to be as good as Harris, Danny Green, or Seth Curry."
"Idk about MOST underrated, but Tobias Harris always seems to hit them against us"
One guy was a key piece on a championship team. The other is Tobias Harris
&gt; Butler is a way better player than Tobias Harris   Not this year
"&gt; Tobi's deal tops out at $40.1M in 2023-24  Jesus Christ, $40M for Tobias Harris"
You're now paying Tobias Harris the same amount(or even more) than you would've paid Jimmy Butler and Jimmy Butler is a way better player than Tobias Harris so dont act like you won that trade lol.
"Simmons has been suspect the entire series. 5/20 is the worst start from the FT in NBA history   Tobias Harris gets a pass, he’s been solid"
"Wiz fans hate him because of his mind-numbing “rotations” and “adjustments”. For example, once we got Gaff it was clear he was the best center on our team and we should start him; even from the eyes of casual fans and analysts were calling for him to start too.  Scott Brook’s answer? Start Alex Len and give Gaff only 8-12 minutes of play time, while Len’s playtime was in the 20’s (where, as expected, he was mostly shit).  Opposing team goes on a 10-0 run or it’s a 1 possession game in crunch time? Don’t call a timeout, sub anyone,draw up a play, or tell the team to run a set. Just let the players “figure it out” (spoiler, unless Brad or Russ work magic, they don’t figure it out).   Lengthy 76ers team where we should probably try and match length for defensive purposes? Nah, run a 3 guard lineup of 6’1”-6’3” guards. That’ll definitely stop Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. Go down 3-0 before he even THINKS about starting Gaff and when he did he does amazing.  Dude is so inept at his job, and the ONLY reason he still has a job is because for some reason he keeps getting lucky having superstars and MVPs play for him. Also, his defensive scheme is cheeks. He literally just has players switch on every play creating terrible mismatches on people like Ish and Davis, and it cost us so many games. He also doesn’t wanna run any plays for the 16M a year sharpshooter and instead wants him to shoot all his shots either contested, or flying off the dribble from a pick.  TLDR; Scott Brooks is trash."
"Yeah but how many stars would be the 3rd or 4th option behind Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler?   Idk maybe it's just semantics and if so mb, but the way you phrased the sentence made it sound like he's not a good scorer BECAUSE he's the 3rd/4th option when in reality he's the 3rd/4th option BECAUSE he's not a good scorer.  If he were capable of 21 PPG on a good team he wouldn't be the 3rd/4th option is my point."
&gt; People keep just stating his raw numbers with zero context like he wasn't the fourth option when Butler was here and the third option now.  How many stars are worse scorers than Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler? Why do you think he's the 3rd and 4th options in these situations?
"By that logic, who does MIL have that is considered a better shooter than Danny Green, Seth Curry and Tobias Harris?"
The issue is regular season doesn’t mean diddly shit. It can work in the regular season but not the playoffs. Tobias Harris isn’t good enough to win a ring if he’s you’re second best scorer. Not to mention Ben completely ruins the spacing because he can’t shoot.
Tobias Harris to be their second option over Ben Simmons
"It's not when Embiid is out.  Tobias has been playing well but last night with Embiid out it was hard to watch him try to iso and get rejected 10 times in a row.  Simmons being in foul trouble didn't help, but it was kind of depressing to watch the offense struggle less being led by Kork and Maxey than Harris/Simmons.   Simmons making FTs would help too, but when Embiid is out this team honestly looks like a fringe playoff team and has all year without him"

"i think it's probably not that bad if it happens to tobias harris, but joel is fuckin 8 foot tall and however many pounds. i think a knee thing for him (especially a re-aggravation) is a genuine issue. i hope i'm wrong, but we know from history that bigger dudes hurt harder on those joints."
"True and ideally if Ben had that skill set he’d be an even better player than he is now.   But he’s not, and he’s not going to magically grow that skill set or anything close to it. If every player was their ideal self with no flaws then it’d just be a league of Jordan’s and Shaqs running around.  It’s up to the FO to build a team around Ben (and Joel) that can compensate for their weaknesses and maximize their talents. The Sixers FO has done a phenomenal job this season under Morey, but could serve with finding a better (and hopefully cheaper) second scoring option than Tobias Harris. Expecting Ben to magically become that guy, or develop a skill set that he clearly does not have anything close to, is just a waste of times"
"&gt; Ben has had a very strange effect on us here, a large portion seem to be waiting for any opportunity to hate on him and relish it when they have an opportunity to scapegoat him.   Aw man, I've watched half the Raptors fanbase (plus this entire sub) do this with Pascal all year. Just so stupid its insane and exhausting.   People expect alot of these players to be something they are not, and sure in the case of Philly I'd say you guys need a better second scoring option than Tobias Harris, and in our case we need a better primary scoring option than Siakam. However both those issues with the team are not reasons to just dismiss two incredibly talented players, who while they may not be gods at every element of the game, are star caliber talents who you need to help the team win.   Fans just expect the wrong things, while not appreciating what they actually have."
"First of all, the Nets got beat by a very depleted Celtics team missing 3 starters with KD and Harden combining for 80 just because Kyrie had a subpar game (Yes, Tatum scored 50, but when the opposing 7th seed team is missing its 7th best player, you better win with 3 superstars, no excuses AT ALL).   Second, you’re looking too far ahead when there’s a good chance you won’t even get there. The Bucks are a much better team than the Celtics. Way better defensively and better offensively too. They are not the same team they were last year. Jrue is a much better fit than Bled. Don’t get too ahead of yourself because the Bucks are a real threat to the Nets.  Lastly, you’re underrating the Sixers a lot. Tobias is playing at an all star level this year. They massively improved the spacing around Embiid by replacing Horford with Danny Green and Seth Curry. They also have elite defenders in Ben, Matisse, and Joel and a good defender in DG to slow the Nets down.   KD and Harden will get their’s no doubt, but the only way Brooklyn has any chance is if Kyrie and Joe Harris can consistently show up. I promise you that the shitty defense of this depleted Celtics team is making the Nets look better than they really are. Y’all ain’t competing with the Bucks and Sixers physically. Kyrie has a history of shitting the bed against Giannis in the playoffs."
Just admit you didn't watch either team last year. Embiid and Harris have taken big steps because of the shooting and spacing. Tobias is much more efficient and quick with his scoring and better on defense. Embiid is amazing in the post and better at passing out of double teams. Bucks also added Holiday and that changes things so much from with Eric Bledsoe.
Do what the NFL does. Salary cap but no max contracts. The lakers wouldn’t be able to afford Lebron and AD is they were being paid what they’re actually worth. They wouldn’t be making the same as Tobias Harris and Middleton
Dude Beal in philly though. This team is already really good and Tobias Harris has been really great for them but you switch him with Beal and damn that’s a nasty team you got there.
"I agree, there's absolutely no reason for the coach to say anything negative about it publicly. Its not an effort or hustle part of the game that Simmons can improve upon quickly by making better on-court decisions or something to that effect.   Would be like if he called out Tobias Harris for shooting poorly from the field in this game or Seth Curry for missing his 3s."
"For the Wizards:  - No Alex Len, less Raul Neto minutes - No more Wizards 3 guard bullshit in the lineup - Hitting threes   - Better Westbrook shot selection - Bradley Beal shows up - More hack-a-Ben  For the Sixers: - Embiid out for series - Sixers cannot replace production of Embiid (see Tobias Harris chuck fest tonight) - Doc Rivers plays Mike Scott more than Dwight - Big men foul trouble - Lakers Danny Green reincarnates  - Ben Simmons continues to go 1-2 from the line every trip  Think I covered everything. This series is over in 5, maybe 6 if the Wizards get lucky."
"I agree that we're third behind Brooklyn and Milwaukee for both the reasons I said and what you've said. But I disagree with some points.  - The dunkers spot criticism's of Simmons are overplayed. Against Milwaukee it's more of an issue because it allows Giannis to play free safety and help off Simmons, but against the Nets its a non issue. They don't have the help defenders to punish someone sitting in a dunkers spot. We've also used this tactic a lot all year and having a cutter down the lane (usually Simmons) actually makes it harder to double Embiid in the post because it's an easy pass to make and it also opens up a very easy swing pass to Curry or Green  - Speaking of, that video is really out of date. Against Toronto, we had a stale predictable offence with only one dynamic shooting threat. Tobias was shooting poorly that year and didn't command much attention, and Jimmy/Embiid were mediocre shooters. This season we've been playing smaller and Green/Curry are lights out shooters who have opened up a lot of space (Green in particular because he is a more willing shooter than Curry and is bigger so he can get the shot of easier). Redick was similar to Curry in that he was too easy to run off the line and we didn't have multiple shooters to punish that  - Harden and KD are top 5, but Irving is more like top 15-20. Embiid is top 10 and Harris/Simmons are both around 25-30. Harden is obviously a huge problem for us, but we have some really good screen navigators (Simmons/Thybulle) to at least make it harder for their big 3 to get easy switches and mismatches. Tobias has also stepped up enormously as a defender and Green is always solid. Hill off the bench has also been a terrific defender in his short time with us and I think is a very underrated signing. We've actually been one of the better crunch time teams this year weirdly enough ([5th by net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)) and it's mainly due to Embiid/Tobias and the extra spacing we've had this year giving them chances to operate cleanly"
"Sixers aren’t winning with this guy as the 2nd best player. Tobias Harris would need to come through   Wonder why this sub was trashing Rockets for getting picks over this guy on a $40M contact.  Simmons is a star the way Draymond is a star. He’s a complementary piece, not a building block"
Sixers really lost cause Tobias Harris can’t back down Ish Smith and Ben Simmons can’t hit a FT.
Whoah Tobias Harris playing Center lol
Is Tobias Harris the greatest player ever?
"Tobias ""Money"" Harris"
"It’s definitely not media driven. It’s driven by everyone who watches the games. Yes pg is still a good player but is he playing like the supposed top 10-15 player he’s touted as?? No way. Honestly is pg playing better than Tobias Harris in the playoffs so far? Nope. Tobias Harris is a nice player but no perennial all star, top 15 player in the game."
"Here's what they each did FWIW.  **Carmelo Anthony**  &gt; Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade created the Social Change Fund in July 2020. The organization works to address social and economic issues facing Black communities. Anthony is also a member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition.   **Harrison Barnes**  &gt; Before the 2020 presidential election, Barnes worked with Be.Woke.Vote, a voting campaign aimed at historically disenfranchised young people. He also pledged $200,000 to organizations and foundations that combat police brutality and racial inequality. The 29-year-old also is partnered with a Black-owned finance app and opened savings accounts for 500 students in Dallas and Sacramento.   **Tobias Harris**  &gt; Harris awarded $300,000, through the Tobias Harris Charitable Fund, to The Fund for the School District of Philadelphia to recruit teachers from historically Black colleges and universities. He also created the Tobias' Top Teachers program, which funds professional development workshops and purchases classroom supplies for teachers to help recruit Black male educators.   **Jrue Holiday**  &gt; Holiday established the Jrue and Lauren Holiday Social Impact Fund in response to COVID-19 and global anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd.

He was also a part of the Warriors' Voters Win campaign during the 2020 election."
Tobias Harris or Jrue Holiday.   Wish they called it literally anything else but the “Social Justice” award. That’s a trigger phrase so unnecessarily for a lot of people.   These guys all do good shit for communities and do it in the right way. But I think Jrue and Tobias stand out.
&gt; Like the Sixers might leave Tobias Harris unprotected to protect Shake Milton or something like that.  Maybe last season...
"Not sure about Kareem but teams will sometimes leave better, older players on massive contracts unprotected knowing that an expansion team probably would rather young and cheap guys. Like the Sixers might leave Tobias Harris unprotected to protect Shake Milton or something like that."
"You think Paul George would have a vendetta against this team. But no, he is playing soft. Clippers were better off paying Tobias Harris. PG 24 is gone"
"Not a current roster, but what the 76ers did a couple years back trading for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris would fit the bill."
Deflate? Don't you mean inflate? He's basically getting paid Tobias Harris money to provide MVP level production.
"I think the KD's bucks is a very interesting idea. I do think they would beat these nets, even if you put a decent kd replacement like idk Tobias Harris, as opposed to the even swap for giannis cause he's playing so poorly  But Khris Middleton is playing like crap too and I think the whole team hasn't played up to usual. I'm looking forward to today's game and hoping the bucks take at least 2 games if not more. They certainly can if they tighten up"
"I want to trade CJ for Tobias Harris, think it could help both squads. Philly has post up guys in Simmons and Embiid but not really any guard who is an elite shot creator like CJ which helps a lot in the post season"
"The league has changed. When you say Roco is a small forward which power forward in the league would be in the lineup next to him?   It's like Tobias Harris. He's a traditional small forward, but you arent constructing many good lineups with him playing the 3 instead of the 4.  Pretty much all the small forwards with some size are 4s in todays league"
"Agreed! Nets got lucky that 2 superstars wanted to team up and Brooklyn was the only big market city with the cap space. And then other players wanted to be traded there.   With the Suns, Jones traded draft picks for key players. Got the Suns one of the deepest teams in the last decade (statistically true about 2 months ago, not sure what the stats are now).  The 76ers case is that their GM hired a coach who knew how to use his players and more specifically Tobias Harris. Traded away Horfords contract and brought in Seth Curry and Danny Green.  Both Suns and 76ers GM’s deserve it more than Brooklyn’s GM."
Swept in the 1st round because instead of Ben Simmons guarding Tatum they had Tobias Harris.
Did win player of the week 3 times and player of the month once. So it depends on what OP considers an award. But Tobias Harris is a great call
Tobias Harris maybe
"I think Derozans offseason will be a very interesting one.  Personally I think he would be great as that 3rd star on a contender who has enough defence &amp; shooting, but is lacking that secondary (or even primary) scorer/playmaker to take over at times. Would be interesting in place of Tobias Harris or on the Heat (if they are still a ""contender"").  But I dont think any team in that position would want to spend much on him - so he would have to take a massive pay cut to play that role.  Obviously there are worse teams that could, theoretically, pay him more - but does he move the needle enough to make it worth it?  I don't think he makes enough sense for the Mavs unless they fix the rest of the roster - but surely better than THJ? NY would be interesting, but he might not fit Thibs defensive requirements, and you'd probably rather RJ develops into that guy - could be worth a shot with the cap space?  The talk of Washington adding him to Beal &amp; Westbrook interested me. Their cap position is screwed for the timebeing anyway, and they always have to option of a Beal trade to reset with future assets, so maybe going all in on this poor man's big 3 might not be the worst thing in the world.  But all said and done - I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't much of a market for him and he just ends up staying in SA on a slightly lower salary. We have the most cap space, and dont have a lot else to do with it this summer."
"Haha so Tobias Harris is a playoff choker, but MPJ, AG and Campazzo have stellar playoff resumes. Embiid is great but 6ers fans like you do him a disservice by being so whack"
"Embiid’s teammates were al horford who didn’t even make the playoffs and J rich who didn’t even start and play for dallas, and tobias harris who is worse playoff choker than middleton. Denver has MPJ a star, AG, and Campazzo. Denver were a 3 seed and Sixers were a 6 seed. Jokic won MVP and has higher expectations, while Embiid didn’t."
"It’s a rather sad story. They received Zhaire Smith and a draft pick. Smith ended up having an allergic reaction to a sesame seed or something like that and nearly died. He tried coming back but he was never the same. The draft pick helped them get Tobias Harris in trade, but the whole thing with Smith is crazy."
"nah Tobias Harris was MIP, Milton was 6MOY"
"He’s a great player, don’t get me wrong. However, many players who average those go unnoticed to the public eye nowadays. It’s kinda like with Tobias Harris for us. You need to get near 30 points or triple double numbers to be noticed."
"Third scoring option* He is a better player than tobias harris, dont get confused"
He's a 3rd option to Tobias Harris. I don't think he's better than these dudes
"I have a feeling Cam will actually play.   This is just me reading between the lines.  But when Schlenk was on sports radio yesterday *cough and lied about hunters injury cough* he was asked about both players injuries and was quick to defer to how Cam was extremely close to coming back before he talked about Hunter.  In retrospect, I can see why.   I also don’t know if this is comparable to the Kris Dunn situation.  Our guard situation is way better than our wing situation right now.  We need a quality player at SF more than we need one at PG.   I really think we’ll see Cam on the court guarding Tobias Harris on Friday."
idk like Tobias Harris maybe
"Of course not. Where did I say that at? The biggest problem is the fact that they're able to then go and acquire james harden on top of that. I think theres a lot of problems with the current system ranging from the fact that lebron james and kevin durant get paid essentially the same contracts as kemba and tobias harris, to the fact that GMs trade firsts 7 years away to acquire stars. Picks that they know they will likely be fired before they even get to use them. Theres lots of things the league can consider that can help prevent mega teams from forming. Why are you defending teams being built like this? In what world is it good for a 30 team league to be a one team race every year?"
"Also, if you notice Tobias Harris is a leading ""passes made"" player, it again points to play style.   The Sixers lead the league in passes, assists and 3rd in assists per pass."
"I’d argue the Sixers lack of a bench big, Brick Simmons, and Tobias Harris were much bigger reasons as to why they lost to the Raptors"
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
Yeah that’s crazy that y’all didn’t have Conley I forgot while watching. Every team needs a switch buster. I think miluakee right now is getting fucked because they don’t have that pure iso guy that can take advantage of switches. Like middleton is getting switched onto kyrie and not being able to do much.   Clippers run a similar scheme as the nets and Mitchell right now is just too explosive for the weaker defenders to switch onto. Thinking way into the future obviously but bodes poorly for the nets if Mitchell can do that against our guys. Only difference I would say is our guys are actually smaller and quicker which might give them more of an advantage against guys like Mitchell and booker compared to the clippers who have an advantage against the big wings like doncic and Tatum.   You could see the nets did have some issues with Tatum just isoing onto our weakest guy. It will be interesting to see if Tobias Harris can do that because the sixers don’t really have that guy either
TOBIAS HARRIS READS BOOKS
"I'd look for other fringe all-star candidates that are on max contracts. Then see if any make sense for both teams.  So Tobias Harris, Kyle Lowry (sign &amp; trade), Westbrook, Wiggins, Conley, Hayward, Kemba, Siakem, Murray, Draymond, Ingram etc.  Not all those guys would make sense but that would be the kind of guy I'd be targeting if I was the GM."
"Tobias Harris is more consistent. I’m also not losing much defensively.  With that being said, I’m still taking Paul George"
"Look unless your head coach is doc rivers, don’t go with Tobias Harris. Trust me on this one"
jazz dude is much beefier and can drive/create his own shot more imo. thats the main difference i see. he can body ppl down low pretty decently. although i will say i was mighty impressed by how hawks Bogey bodied up Tobias Harris and other bigass sixers dude on defense. there were a couple replays where you could see him not even flinch as Tobi posted him up.
Compared to Tobias Harris he’s been phenomenal lmao.
The disrespect to Tobias Harris
"Disagree, they are on the same tier. You can throw in Tobias Harris into that tier as well."
Tobias Harris has been a dogshit playoff performer his  entire career.   This is obviously Khris.  Threads like these really separate casuals and people who actually watch basketball.
That why tobias Harris is averaging all star numbers and with Danny Green leading the league in corner 3s and seth curry having a great offensive year yeah?  Nevermind embiid scoring at a unve rate and constantly getting their centers in foul trouble  I've never in my life seen joel played off the floor  I've seen it happen to jokic in the playoffs
"They have two stars, Tobias/Seth/Danny/Thybull aren't out scoring Kyrie/Harris/Blake/Brown"
Tobias Harris
"Our 2nd option is Tobias Harris and he always has been, Ben is a defender and playmaker. It would obviously be better if he was more aggressive and scored more but he contributes a fuck ton without scoring"
Is Tobias Harris more important to Sixers' success compared to Ben Simmons?
Doc Rivers offensive notes  1) Pass to Embiid  2) give it to Seth Curry if he’s open  3) Tobias Harris??
Is Tobias Harris secretly a Monstar that stole all of Ben Simmons' talent?
He's the hawks best perimeter defender he probably would have been the primary defender on Either Simmons or Tobias Harris.
I feel like Tobias Harris kinda looks like a default my player
"I wonder how many times Tobias Harris has had the “Actually, I prefer if you didn’t call me Toby” conversation."
I wanna see Tobias Harris ball out because I like him but just not these next few games 😅
Lol wtf Tobias Harris has half of Philadelphia's points?
Gallinari and Tobias Harris look like dinosaurs
"Lakers and Clippers have definetely been called superteams.  Sixers drafted their leaders, so it's a bit different. Tobias Harris was indeed a bit of a star in Clippers, so maybe there's some basis, but mostly it's not a team where stars joined together to shape a team."
If Ben Simmons could do a fusion dance with Tobias Harris...
I voted for Game 2 Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris is gonna be critical vs the nets
Tobias Harris unleashed. Have some mercy
hawks got tobias harris looking like a superstar lmao
"Tobias Harris, Danny Green, Seth Curry on the same team is just a illegal 3 pointer team.  Ben doesn't even need to learn how to shoot with these guys on the team."
Just popped on the game and holy shit did Tobias Harris get personally insulted by someone on the Hawks?
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris on that melo shit
"Why did they choose Tobias Harris as the ""little guy"" for the Boban commercials?"
TOBIAS HARRIS IS UNDERPAID
The big time lights making Tobias Harris look good
Tobias Harris is who Kyle Kuzma thinks he is
Tobias Harris
"Your wife’s favorite player, Tobias Harris."
Tobias Harris disagrees
Nikola Jokic voted MVP  Tobias Harris: “and I took that personal”
Tobias Harris underpaid
Seeing Tobias Harris come out like this after last year is awesome
Tobias Harris
Right so it’s weird to hold out hope it would turn into a great asset but then treat it like any other 1st rounder by turning it into a $160m contract for Tobias Harris a few months later
"Shai would have been dope for you guys. Suns were gonna pick up Bridges and trade him + a pick for SGA from Philly.    But at the last second, Philly got worried that Mikal wouldn't make it to 16 so they straight up picked Mikal.    And then someone in the front office decided that trading the unprotected Miami pick + Zhaire Smith was worth it.    We didn't get Shai and Philly didn't end up with Mikal in the end, but it worked out well for everyone. We got a great wing defender to put next to Book and Philly used the pick to get Tobias Harris."

"nah he is, people act like Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton are in a different tier than him and that’s big cap"
Tobias Harris for CJ McCollum seems like the best trade for both teams.  Agree or Disagree?
"Are people actually serious about a Middleton/CJ swap? I can barely see a CJ/Tobias Harris swap happening. If either team does that they'll have a gaping hole at forward.   I think the best thing to do with CJ is trade him to somebody for a couple of firsts and then overpay for Jerami Grant (2 FRPs, a young asset in either Zac Collins or Nassir Little and potentially draft compensation on top of that). The market is slim and it'd be a heavy price to pay but if you have to give Detroit a Godfather offer so you can finally have a proper two-way wing you go ahead and do it."
we got Tobias Harris with the Heat pick so not really that one sided
"Man who had the most assisted 3 pointers at 6'10 on a team with Josh Richardson, Al horford and Tobias Harris as his shooters is not good enough"
"In defense of the Sixers, they got the Miami pick which was super valuable at the time. The pick would later on be used in the Tobias trade. Had they not gotten that pick it is more than likely they potentially could have used the pick they had that year (which they drafted Thybulle with) to trade for Harris.  Just speculation, but it makes me sleep slightly better at night lol"
Brand emptied the cupboards and the only thing he has to show for it is Tobias Harris eating up a max contract slot.
tobias harris shoots pretty damn good
Same way Tobias Harris did.
"Yeah people are being deliberately dense if they think the sixers traded back for nothing. The suns gave up an unprotected pick from the heat, who were in a transition period, to trade up to get Bridges.  Unprotected first round picks are incredibly rare and valuable in the league, and the Heat didn't seem to have an obvious path forward at the time. That pick is, of course, not going to be great, but at the time, it was considered a crown jewel asset.  The sixers ended up wasting the pick by trading it along with a lot of great assets (shamet on his first year 2nd round deal, another first rounder) for Tobias Harris on an expiring, when the clippers had telegraphed that wouldn't max him in the off-season.   In short, Elton Brand is/was one of the worst GMs in the league."
Philly hang up the phone on a Tobias Harris for CJ trade imo.
"I'm not doubting that a very small non-vocal minority in your sub just like any sub probably complained about it, but I haven't seen anyone talk about it besides non-Piston fans calling out Piston fans. It's cringe AF and annoying seeing people who clearly put in no time to actually see how a fanbase feels about it to go and assume ""Pistons fans kicking themselves right now haha"".   &amp;nbsp;  Reminds me of when people were telling us we were kicking ourselves for Noel leaving when he didn't want to be there, Fultz playing better when he needed the change of scenery, or how Jimmy Butler turned out after not wanting to stay vs keeping Tobias in 2020. It's as if we the fans didn't already know what all three of those players could do after having defended them for so long. These were all situations where most of our fanbase didn't like how things turned out, but knew it had to be done and accepted it. If anything, they should've called us out for how much we wanted to get rid of Tobias Harris in 2020."
"2021 pick, yes. They traded it to the Clippers for Tobias Harris, which was used as part of the PG trade."
"Well, we don't have Tobias Harris without the unprotected Miami FRP we got in the trade. Or Mikal ends up being included in that deal.  I'd rather have this version of Tobias, as good as Mikal is."
"The Sixers franchise was a legitimate joke in the period between Hinkie and Morey  I'll give them a pass on the Fultz issue because no one could've reasonably seen that coming, other than that:  \-Gave up 2 firsts and Shamet for the ability to give Tobias Harris a contract no one would likely match anyway  \-Lost Jimmy Butler because someone in the FO wanted to 'control him'  \-Paid a role playing center 100m over 4 years to pair with two paint-dominant players  And the sixers STILL don't have a perimeter scorer/reliable 3 level scorer + secondary ball handler which is what they've needed for like 3 years"
while it was bad the sixers also got a pick with it that they used to trade for tobias harris
Who would you rather have? Bridges or Tobias Harris?
"Zhaire Smith was 2nd on their board, so get a player they liked along with a pick in the 2021 draft which was rumored to be the first draft to have high schoolers. That pick was later used to acquire Tobias Harris."
"We picked up who was a really good player at the time in zhaire smith, no one expected him to almost die then lose all his body weight and just never recover properly.  We also used the extra draft asset to get tobias harris.  It's really not that complicated i dont think. Hindsight is 20/20, if you go back you are still pretty happy to make that trade."
To get the draft pick that got us Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris &gt; Khris Middleton.
I remember thinking D’Lo and a better first option like Tobias Harris could get us to the ECF. Bonkers.
Is Tobias Harris going to score more than 20 pts in game 7?
This time game 6 elimination game Tobias Harris score 24 points over the 20 point mark. He exceeded expectations.
Tobias Harris makes three times more money per year than this man.

Ben Simmons as Rondo.   Seth Curry as Ray Allen.   Tobias Harris as Paul Pierce.    Joel Embid as Kevin Garnett.   And Doc Rivers as Doc Rivers???   It's a wrap boys
tobias harris has been horrific in the playoffs up until this year
Man...  Danny Manning didn't get there.  Ron Harper didn't get there.  Loy Vaught didn't get there.  Eric Piatkowski didn't get there.  Darius Miles didn't get there.  Quentin Richardson didn't get there.  Elton Brand didn't get there.  Sam Cassell didn't get there.  Blake Griffin didn't get there.  Chris Paul didn't get there.  DeAndre Jordan didn't get there.  Doc Rivers didn't get there.  Danilo Gallinari didn't get there.  Tobias Harris didn't get there.  But we finally got there. WE FINALLY MADE IT.
"Ok hear me out. Trade Harris and picks for cj, and move Ben to PF. Maxey moves to starting pg. Trade hill or whatever and find a small forward who can shoot or sign Danny green again to play decent defense and hang out for corner threes.   Ben in the post with a real guard out there is fine, then he can be a rim runner as well like a John Collins who can pass. Sixers don’t have that bc we don’t really want embiid flying around bc he’s fragile. Ben can also pass out of the post. Maxey can run point and can make his own bucket if needed and he has shown that he can throw lobs. Cj is the scoring guard who can pull up. And gives embiid space when he needs it. Ben plays more as a cutter rather than standing in the dunker spot all game  You could also change cj for just about any other good guard.   I just don’t think that Ben is as tradable, and Tobias is a little soft in the paint, we could really use a guy on the starting line up to catch lobs. I think we would need to set screens for him though. Like imagine how cool it would be to have him running off a screen down low on the left while there’s a maxey pick and pop high on the right. Maxey drives center and shoots, lobs or kicks.  I don’t think losing the 20 Harris gets us will be that bad bc our bench will be better with Seth on it, not to mention I think in a scoring rim running role Ben gets you 15-20. Im pretty sick of Ben, but I think this is a better move than trading Ben for someone unless you get a much better value for Ben which I don’t know that you do. He’s younger and has more potential, but not a lotta teams will be looking for his unique set of skills  I also don’t dislike Harris, but if maxey starts, we have two pfs and neither Ben or Harris can play sf"
"Big 3.  Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry."
Weirdly I really think it all comes down to whether or not Tobias Harris can score 20+
Kudos to Tobias Harris. Really saved the Sixers there
Remember those people who were asking why Tobias Harris wasn’t blamed to the same degree as Simmons? This game tells you why.
J Cole fans think J Cole looks like Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris always clearly fouls but freaks out like he isnt lmfao
Maybe they could get a Tobias Harris with that money
*Tobias Harris
A couple of big boy buckets from Tobias Harris
This series is completely reliant on Tobias fucking Harris
Did Tobias Harris even play that game? The box score says he was on the court but I don't really remember it.
Took Tobias Harris 6 games to finally figure out how to have a possession switched onto Trae that didnt end in a mess but there you go
Yeah Collins feels like a Tobias Harris type guy. If you pay him Tobias money franchise is fucked.
Tobias Harris and Seth Curry look like The Weeknd and the Geico Caveman respectively and the caveman used to make me very uncomfortable as a kid.
"We really gotta talk about how Philly made Brett Brown run out a starting lineup with Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Embiid and then blamed him for that shit falling on its face"
Wait I thought he unlocked Tobias Harris. What happened
TRAE YOUNG FOR 3!!!!!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3   ^(tobias harris makes a 3)   KEVIN HUERTER FOR 3!!!! 😍😍😍😍
&gt; Letting trash like Tobias Harris carry them  wut
"Can't convince me otherwise, Hawks should be losing. Embarrassing offensive display in the first half. Terrible on the boards. Letting trash like Tobias Harris carry them. Just awful. I'm not happy"
i hate tobias harris. always have. fuck Tennessee.
"Docs teams always seem to get mentally broken down, where at the end of the playoffs their mentalities are screwed. Tobias Harris and simmons got no idea whether to be aggressive or what to do."
imo ben simmons shouldnt get so much hate. Tobias harris should too.
im not even a sixers fan and it really pisses me off when you already got ben simmons being himself and tobias harris decides to also be completely fucking useless this series. Like step up you damn scrubs.
Max contract Tobias Harris
They let Jimmy Butler walk for Tobias Harris
There’s no de facto. He’s their second option. Nobody contests that except maybe Tobias Harris’ agent when he’s a free agent.
"Joe and Tobias: both Harris, both fucking sucks"
his name is tobias harris
"I am terrified to be overconfident but overall things look really good for the Hawks, Embiid is having to drive the offense and he's taking hard shots, Curry's not getting involved, Tobias Harris is in foul trouble, please keep this going"
Why is tobias harris guarding trae young
Tobias Harris sucks planters
"Real talk, the 30 for 30 on the Process 76ers will be the best one ever. Think of the storylines:  * Middling team with Iguodala  * Team hires Hinkie who fully commits to tank  * Acquires insane amount of assets. Drafts MCW and flips him, drafts embiid and okafor, “Hinkie special” contracts   * NBA forced Hinkie out and to hire colangelo  * Colangelo drafts Simmons and Fultz  * Fultz busts hard, forgets how to shoot  * Colangelo burners  * Trade for Jimmy butler who forces his way out. Trade a ton for Tobias Harris. Kawhi shot.  * They trade back and draft a kid who never plays and almost died from a peanut allergy instead of a kid who looks like a perfect 3&amp;D player whose mom freaking works for them  * Morey hire  * Simmons playoff failures, likely trade?"
Bumass Tobias Harris
YOU CANNOT STOP TOBIAS HARRIS YOU CAN ONLY TRY TO CONTAIN HIM
Tobias Harris in his bag
Maybe Tobias Harris will show up today
"&gt;If this is the last Simmons/Embiid game how I’ll you remember them as a duo?  Al Horford &amp; Tobias Harris together essentially just destroyed Trust the Process lol.  Stuff like this sucks, but unfortunately this is the result of not having a competent FO."
"Almost the same age as Anthony Davis, Tobias Harris, and Rudy Gobert, lmao.  These young guns."
Philly should duct tape Tobias Harris to Ben Simmons and now you have a serviceable guard.
A less developed tobias harris is hilarious. He's already nearly reached tobias career high in points on better shooting and has played over 560 fewer games than Tobi has. He will be way better than max player Tobias harris.
Tobias Harris is for sure the second option though.
"Ok, I know that I should be enjoying the “I told you so” nature of this, but he isn’t a BAD coach. He has been absolutely genius in moments with his players (the Lou will and trez Harrell p&amp;r comes to mind.) he just runs into this adjustment wall in the playoffs. However, he helped turned that Tobias Harris contract into not the worst contract in the league for you guys. In the 2019 series against the warriors he did straight up out coach Steve Kerr.   Not to mention, guy was a great voice for the players last year in the bubble with the protests. And I honestly think without him we might still have Sterling in the nba."
MPJ is pretty much just a less developed Tobias Harris who hasn’t clicked on defense yet.  I don’t see the Sixers as a landing spot for him
Lol they would have tanked for years and used multiple #1 overall picks just to end up with a CJ Mccollum and Tobias Harris supporting cast around Embiid.
Fox  Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Mikal Bridges  Tobias Harris  Ayton
"I dont think you know what a strawman argument is.   Philly has been on the trade destination list of every superstar thats demanded a trade. Yall are desirable, you just refuse to trade Ben Simmons. You literally had Jimmy Butler there and willing to play for you, but you chose Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons over him.  You got Al Horford. Lowry and Harden wanted to be traded to you, Kawhi was available for everybody to go after."
Tobias Harris For wall + stuff?
Might have to throw Tobias Harris on there lol
"Horford was playing well in OKC when he did manage to play. He'll play good minutes for Boston and will probably be a neutral asset. For some reason there's a bad distaste over his contract when it's still not even THAT bad. It's not even the worst contract Philly signed that year..that belongs to Tobias Harris still even if he was having a great year he was the 14th highest paid player in the league and plays at a borderline all-star level. At least Middleton is good enough to make All Star teams and be a true play maker even if him and Tobias are comparable I think anyone would rather take Middleton for that money over Tobias if you had to choose (both are overpaid though).   No Horford at $27-26 million a year..it's a bit steep for a guy that will be a third option and 35 but it's not the worst third option contract in the league. You already have JB and JT to carry the load, plus this will fix the C's biggest issue which ironically was caused by losing Horford to begin with which was their hole at Center.   If Horford at 35 proves to be a healthier player than Kemba right now it's 100% worth it."
And then get traded for Tobias Harris + Picks
Tobias Harris
"100%  As much as it’s Ben’s fault, people keep forgetting that Tobias Harris only scored 4 points in the last game.  That’s 350M worth of salaries scoring 12 points in a combined 75min on the court.  Dwight Howard played 8min."
Mine was Tobias Harris.  I was talking so much shit about whatever team was gonna be dumb enough to trade a bunch of assets to give his average ass $200 million.  Then my squad did it.
thought you meant tobias harris lol
Tobias Harris
At least we never said that. Way better than Tobias Harris so far
Max contracts are staying as long as Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton are getting max contracts. They essentially steal from the team star and distribute that pay to lesser players.
"The thing with MVPbiid is that he opens up the offense for everyone else. Tobias Harris can cook, Seth Curry can cook, Ben with all his issues can cook.  That's the issue with Doc Rivers. His teams are so dependent on being absolutely dominant, the second they are not, they flounder and don't know what to do. As soon as MVPbiid shows cracks and can't do a million post moves, they are fucked.  For as much as Capella was flamed, he is absolutely right. A tired Embiid is a vulnerable Sixers team"
"If I was embiid and got stuck with CJ McCollum and Tobias Harris after they had all the assets in the world his first few seasons, I would ask out. I don't think he will ask out as he seems to love philly but it's insane how bad they screwed up after the process if that's all they get"
That’s a Tobias Harris stat line  I like Tobias when he doesn’t have stinky games like last one
More than Tobias Harris or Khris Middleton by a good bit.
"Because Embiid gets a lot of those shots in the post and he spends a lot of time with the ball no longer crediting who made the entry pass with an assist. Embiid also passes because he gets doubled and can find open looks for people. Playmakers don't always end up with the highest assist total especially with how often the 76ers pass the ball.   &gt; Yes, Siakam would be better for them out there this series 100%  No. Siakam isn't better at entry passes than Simmons and without Simmons there's virtually no one to provide him entry passes that don't fuck up Embiid's post positioning.   Who is going to feed Embiid in the post with this new team? Have you seen the games where Simmons was out? Embiid was straight up not having a good time and would often have to dribble in from the 3 point line. Siakam would play the same role that Tobias Harris does. The 76ers don't need another wing player if they get rid of Simmons. Lmfao."
Oh man I immediately read that as Tobias Harris bricks but that isn't what's happening right now. I don't need to be sad right now.
I learned last year about life when you need Tobias Harris to get buckets.
Wasn't Tobias Harris supposed to provide some scoring?
"His co star is Tobias Harris, and Embiid averages like 30 mpg in the playoffs for his career"
"Hawks fan here but here is my take on the Sixers situation: why is it that if Embiid has an off night or gets in a slump, does the responsibility fall on Ben Simmons and not Tobias Harris?! Hear me out: most teams in the league have their main scoring option, but the 2nd guy is almost always a 3-level scorer. (Ex: Bucks have Giannis, but Middleton is a 3LS, Suns - Book then CP3, Lakers - Bron then AD (or vice versa), Clipps Kawhi then PG, Boston - Tatum then Jaylen Brown, Portland - Dame then CJ and so forth) my point being, if scoring is the issue and Ben is not a threat from 3-levels but you have someone on your team that is, should that person be the one depended on to step up?"
"I'm not that surprised. Joel is not 100% and is getting gassed by the 4th in every game. Tobias Harris has always been an inconsistent clutch scorer. Ben Simmons can't shoot. So they don't need to be great defenders. Because the sixers aren't a dynamic offensive team and lou and trae are quick at least and give effort and can stick with Seth. Sixers have won and will win games where Maxey goes off or Shake Milton makes a bunch of contested shots late. I just don't think that is sustainable, if not for this series, the next. Ben Simmons can't take a game over, because he's always at risk of missing 2 free throws. Tobias Harris can take over like once a series and that's it. Jo Jo isn't right and is exhausting himself early."
"Sixers fans all have high expectations for Harris, and we all know that he is the second offensive option behind Embiid. Nobody sensible expects Ben Simmons to score more than Tobias."
Am I the only one who thought Tobias Harris seemed very incredulous of Doc while the two were seemingly arguing in the second half last night?
"Why is everyone hating on Simmons more than Tobias Harris? Is this really what this sub is working with? It's a circlejerk on here lately, feels like a politics forum."
"Following Chuck’s idea, I tuned in to Philly sports radio today for first time (John Kincaide). The callers were really upset.   Revelation for me as I don’t follow the sixers closely - they gave Tobias Harris a max contract!!?!? In what universe is he a max guy??? Flabbergasted."
"&gt;Ben is NOT a scorer.  There is not being a scorer, and there is being unable to score.   &gt;i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him  Why would anyone want to expend the resources to trade for him, eat his massive contract, and then some more resources on top of that for ""the team around him""  &gt;rather than Joel Embiid  Won't a team with Simmons on it always be built around someone else since he can't be the primary star?  &gt; whatever team Ben Simmons goes to will need to build a lineup full of shooters that can hide Ben’s lack of a jumpshot  You mean like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, George Hill, Joel Embiid, Furkan Korkmaz, Isiah Joe, and Shake Milton... all of whom are 35%+ plus 3PT shooters, most of whom are ~40%+ shooters....  &gt;hich would open up the lane for Ben **to drive and then either finish** or kick it out to a shooter.  They can already do this and Ben doesn't because he knows he's gonna get hacked at miss more FTs."
"I think that Luka has more on-ball talent, Trae has more speed and they are both crafty and both are elite passers but Luka needs to learn from a vet PG like Trae got this year.  Rondo helped Trae develop from a guy who can shoot threes all game to a guy who facilitates and then takes over in the 4th quarter when he needs to.  Trae went from avg 11 3pters to 4.  That was all Rondo and Lou.  I think that Porzingis has a point where he should be included more in the offense.  I also think that's the problem with Tobias Harris.  You expect him to put up points but you relegate him to the three pt line and don't include plays for him.  Down the stretch when you need those players, they are cold and have been ignored for 3 quarters of the game."
"The point I was trying to get across is that it's not about lack of attempts, I'm saying that his touch isn't good enough to warrant him driving 15 times a game unless he has a clear matchup advantage. He gets to the cup easy just off the time but still misses layups that most guys can hit regularly. And the point about DJ is that he is kinda like him, in that he is asked by his coach to do only a few things, and he does them well. He's not supposed to score according to the team. He had a better game last night than Tobias Harris, who was 2-11 and only scored 4 points. Simmons free throws suck, but that's not the only reason they lost. They had a 26 point lead, he only missed 10. The rest of the team only made one shot in the last 6 minutes, and my point is he wasn't the one missing those shots outside of free throws. Not saying he's perfect, just saying he gets way more blame than he should."
Since when does Tobias Harris make a big 3?
Tobias Harris ain’t bad
"His condition ain’t can be much better, but can’t do much when Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons are your other scoring options"
"Tobias Harris scored 4 points and Ben Simmons scored half of his 8 points by going 4-14 from the FT line. No, the guy that scored 37 as the primary focus of the defense doesn't deserve more criticism."
Max contracts kill the NBA. They're a problem for so many reasons. And such a dumb thing to have in the first place. Especially at such a small percent of the cap. Tobias harris and Kevin durant making the same amount of money is such a problem. League will never be balanced when that's normal
Tobias Harris? KCP and a few others. Plus the east was weak!!! No not accomplishment!
"For the record he’s something like 110-100 in playoffs all time as a coach  Not exceptional or anything, but definitely over .500 with a tooon of games coached. Compare that to Kerr, who had a team go to the finals like 5 times in a row, at like 120 games, just goes to show how much playoff experience doc has.  And like.. doc has his flaws but he didn’t make Embiid miss 2 free throws at the end, or keep Ben Simmons from taking shots, or make Tobias Harris go cold in the last couple 4th quarters. A lot of this loss and the last one is on the players, straight up  But yes he definitely does lose a lot of big games/big leads (in games and series) let’s keep in mind though this series isn’t over yet"
"Its the role that the team puts him in...if you expect Simmons to be your secondary offensive player, you're in for a bad time, but he can be like prime Rondo on steroids if there is actually other weapons around Embiid. Like where is the blame on Tobias Harris, his actual role is to be the secondary offensive star, yet he didn't score a single point in the second half.  Like this team has a habit of collapsing, he was playing fine before that point..but when things are going bad, Simmons is only going to make it worse if you have any intentions of playing through him on offense.   For the Steph and Kyrie examples, thats because they were on either stacked teams or played with arguably the GOAT. Why is it so much different to be exploited on offense vs being exploited on defense? Both lead to a negative result on the team."
Tobias Harris had FOUR POINTS
"This was an all time epic come back by hawks and collapse by sixers.  I don’t want to take anything away from what the hawks did, because it’s impressive as shit, but doc rivers coached us out of winning the last two games and Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris played us out of winning the last 2 games.  This collapse is so comically bad that I’ve gone from livid to just accepting the absurdity of it and hoping they can pull out two wins to salvage this season and regain some momentum.   But in terms of all time disappointments for philly teams, this is right up there.   Wild."
Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris on max contracts are not good pairings with the most dominant center of our era.
Ok lets look at just this series  Tobias Harris: 18/6/4 on 53% shooting  Ben: 11/5/8 on 65% shooting but thats only 7 attempts. He's shooting 30% from the line  Both are on max contracts too and Tobias actually comes off the books one year earlier  Before that goose egg Tobias was averaging 21 on 59/44 splits which is fantastic for what his role is. Also this isn't taking into account the regular season where Tobias basically kept the 76ers afloat when Embiid went out while Ben sucked ass. Its thanks to him that they're even playing the Hawks and not the Bucks potentially without hc
"The picks are for middle schoolers that may or may not be half as good NBA players as Tobias Harris, and the swaps they don’t even have full control over.   It’s a shit deal. They got fleeced."
"Its inflation  MJ is worth over a billion and not all of that is due to post career investments considering he played during the golden era of basketball  Still, even with that goose egg Tobias Harris is averaging 21 points on over 50% shooting which is better than another max contract player on the 76ers"
"Watched the whole entire game.   Philly was actually right, I mean give propr to Coach Rivers on this one, he put in the starters around the 10 minute mark in the fourth. He knew that the comeback was on.  Philly in the first made like every shot, while Coach Nate was pissed about that, he motivated and energized our guys in the 4th quarter. As behind a dark cloud there is a silver lining, Bogy and Huerter were trash, so that meant that Lou and Gallo had to step up and they did. They relied on each other, Trae still had trust on them, while they had trust on Trae. 57 seconds left, Gallo hit that fade away, Trae trusted in him, when I watched that live, I was really scared. But in the end he made it, because that was his game.  And that basically was the reason why they won, they kept playing their game, while Philly just looked gas. Seth Curry was tremendous, but would you really rely on him, to stop a comeback from happening. He was actually the reason why the Sixers lost the comeback on the defensive side atleast. He always gets tricked by Lou Williams, and always got to defend Gallo. He gotta up his hustle, but yeah he did hit his shots, so he still contributed a lot. I mean 36 points by Seth shouldn't happen, but it was just his night,  &amp;#x200B;  We also outsmarted them on both the offensive end and defensive end in the fourth.  On another note, Tobias Harris was not himself this game. On game 4, he was that aggresive beast who wanted to score, or drive. But in the fourth, he was like scared of the ball, in the out of bounds call around the minute mark, he was just touching the ball, in hopes of a miracle, couldn't he have dove, or atleast played with more heart and grit? Exhaustion isn't an excuse, as Collins has played a lot for the Hawks team as well.  &amp;#x200B;  So TL;DR: Hawks still had more energy and grit, and just continued to play the game, while the Sixers did the opposite.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, it's just simply because of Simmons and Harris not showing up"
&gt; Hey it would have been better than the shit sandwich they got back.  Tobias Harris makes them only marginally better. All a Tobias Harris package would have done is give them better odds at giving the thunder the pick this year. He's not a star you build around.
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray  Lol
"players who had a 55% TS this season:  - anthony davis - kemba walker - ja morant - siakam  players who had a 55% TS in the playoffs:  - trae young - ben simmons (wow, someone who’s range is 5 feet had TS of 55% this postseason, even though you called it horrendous) - tobias harris - beal"
"Ben had 13 assts in game 7, and thats with Tobias Harris bricking 3 open lay ups, so what are you talking about he can't play make? Stop talking out of your ass..."
And the Sixers are paying Tobias Harris - a very similar player - over 35m per year for the next 3.   Moving Simmons isn’t gonna be easy
You traded Bridges for him and an unprotected first round pick that helped you land Tobias Harris. A lot of trades sound bad when you ignore important pieces of them.
&gt; you can't rely on Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris  Phew! I'm glad we're not paying them a combined 350M
"Probably blinded by the fact that this was the best version of Embiid and Tobias Harris we'd seen. But yeah, that 2019 team was stacked."
"I can't believe the conclusion of 'Trust The Process 'will be a team with CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Tobias Harris."
"Of the assets that Hinkie acquired:  Covington, Saric, Jerami Grant, 2018 1st (from MCW trade, Mikal Bridges), 2018 1st (from Elfrid Payton trade, Shamet), 2019 1st (from Nik Stauskas trade)  were in part turned into  Butler (gone)  Harris (who was then given a max deal)  Maxey (who ironically enough the Sixers traded the pick earlier for some euro guy who never panned out and only got it back in the Fultz dump)  Mike Muscala (who helped them get the pick that turned into Maxey by making a game winning shot while he was with OKC)  Also, I think technically the pick the Sixers gained from the Bridges-for-Zhaire Smith trade was in the Tobias Harris trade, and LAC traded it to OKC in the PG13 trade."
"Makes sense when you look at Ben Simmons who is cocky as hell despite accomplishing nothing in the NBA and not improving since he got in the league. He’s willing to wrestle with Trae for the ball after the play but is too scared of a layup.      Also look how much Philly paraded themselves this year. Embiid for MVP, Simmons for DPOY, Thybulle for first team defense, Tobias Harris for all star. They care way too much about what other people think of them and that led to folding mentally down the stretch."
And Tobias. If Simmons had put up his usual 10/10/6 or whatever and they lost then all eyes would be on harris for playing like complete ass
"Hinkie “resigned” before the Simmons draft. We went like 1-20 to start that season because we sucked and our PGs got hurt and we didn’t really try to replace them. So the league had us hire Colangelo and force Hinkie out. He then traded the farm for Fultz, one year of Butler and a max contract Tobias Harris."
"Well considering we used the pick to trade for Tobias Harris (which is its own can of worms, I wasn't a huge fan of the trade and still am not, it forced us to basically max Harris once we made that trade), it is more comparable given the context."
What about Tobias Harris
"he did good defensively, the other players choked AKA tobias harris"
"I met him and Tobias Harris at a charity soccer match along with a few other players. I can't put my finger on it, but they both seemed different then the others. Embiid seemed lazy and Harris seemed timid. After seeing this series that makes sense."
"Dawg, if Robert Covington, Marco Bellinelli, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Reddick, George Hill, and a whole other handful of tweener 3pt chuckers like Mike Scott and Ilyasova can't help this man with his jump shot, Lu Dort ain't doing shit for him lol"
"I agree with the sentiment, it’s a really bad look. Especially because it wasn’t just Simmons fault (although he undoubtedly had the worst series of any sixer). Tobias Harris was so non existent for a lot of the series.   I give Embiid a pass because he’s earned it and I can only imagine how frustrating playing with Simmons in the last few postseasons has been. He’s never really thrown him under the bus before (that I can remember) and he’s had plenty of opportunity to.  Really surprised Doc said that. For a supposed “players” coach thought that seemed kind of harsh. It wasn’t an easy question to answer but he could have easily given a non-answer answer. Also, Doc really wasn’t that great this series."
"hardest to fix is philly because of all the bad contracts (especially tobias harris in a few years).  next is dallas because of luka and mark cuban, unfortunately  utah is probably a bit easier to fix even though its not a desirable market  the easiest to fix is milwaukee. the fix is fire budenholzer Lmfao"
What happened to Tobias Harris?
Didn't Embiid have like 8 TOs? Even for 2018 LeBron who was 95% of their offense that would be probably one of the worst nights so why does a non playmaker superstar like him have 8 TOs in a crucial game?   Why didn't Doc give Milton more minutes?  Thybulle committed a dumbass foul on a 3-pt shot  I swear it was like 24 of Huerter's 27 was bbq chicken on Seth  Tobias Harris took 24 shots to put up 24 pts  They all sucked and choked. Ben was still the worst but he wasn't the only reason.   I agree it was unprofessional and par for the course for Glenn. Look at PG13 taking the lead under Lue when Kawhi went down.
"Tobias is as borderline a max player as you get in the NBA actually. He's definitely an all star caliber player and if we're shitting on any sort of contract after this post season it's Simmons, not Harris"
"they kept Tobias Harris over Simmons lol don't get me wrong, Ben has disappointed but not maxing Jimmy was and giving it to Tobias was a worse two-way decision to me."
"It's because his overall stats for the series hid how important he actually was.  If you broke down his stats, you'd see their chances to win games against Toronto essentially boiled down to: ""is Jimmy dominant tonight?"".  * Jimmy in their 3 wins: 25.7/8.3/7.3 on 61.2 TS%  * Jimmy in their 4 losses: 19.3/5.8/4.3 on 52.3 TS%   Embiid was doing his thing, but they didn't really have anyone who could step up. Jimmy had to be amazing for them to be competitive and you can't rely on Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris.   Ben can't sustain his production in the playoffs and Tobias can't sustain his efficiency.   ***  Plus, it was a butt ugly series from both sides desperately trying to lose.   During the series fans were absolutely outraged but then afterwards fans of both teams seemed to reach an armistice and agreed both sides were just playing great defence and not missing a bunch of easy shots."
"&gt;The sixers have to trade him not because he sucks, but because he is probably the worst offensive fit with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid. And he sucks.  People have been saying it for years, they should have traded Simmons to build around embiid  Philly didn't take the chance and look at how it's backfired now his value is at an all time low"
"Tobias Harris ain’t Ben Simmons - dude was already getting clowned online, he’d be getting it just as hard as he is now if he missed that dunk"
Tobias Harris cant be a 2nd option on a championship team
Lets not forget the 76ers front office decided to offer Tobias Harris a 5 year $180M contract a few hours after free agency open and didnt even offer it to Jimmy Butler lmao
"Eh. Tobias was ok for most of the playoffs. Yes he's overpaid but virtually anybody sniffing 20ppg is gonna get a max in today's NBA. The issue is that Harris is supposed to be the third option, not the second. He's supposed to be attacking mismatched when they crop up - blowing past bigger guys and posting up smaller guys. Simmons should be doing the same too but he doesn't draw any respect from the defense, so they're way more honed in on Harris than they should be."
"I don’t see why people think they can just trade Simmons. His contract is HUGE. Any team trading for him will be locking in a 1/3rd to a 1/4 of their salary cap on a 1 dimensional player. Elton Brand really screwed the team giving Tobias and Ben those contracts. Morey saying he wants to target Beal or Lillard shows he’s truly in La La Land.    Salary Cap and Luxury Cap current projections:   2021-2022: $112 million and $136.6 million  2022-2023: $115.7 million and $140 million  2023-2024: $119.2 million and $144.9 million   Phillys Big 3 Contracts:  Tobias Harris next 3 years: $35,995,950, $37,633,050, $39,270,150  Ben Simmons next 4 years: $33,003,936, $35,448,672, $37,893,408, $40,338,144  Embiid next 2 years(due for an even bigger extension):  $31,579,390, $33,616,770"
"He was 8-24. Tobias had a bad game (he usually does when it matters). If he makes 2 or 3 of those bunnies he missed in the paint, philly wins this game. Harris is lucky Ben is getting all the attention bc he hasn’t been able to meet expectations either"
McCollum is a shorter Tobias Harris my guy
"In 2017-18 when we lost to Boston we blamed Brett Brown and Robert Covington. In 2018-19 when we lost to Toronto we blamed Brett Brown and Tobias Harris. Now its Doc Rivers. No coach can win when you have a black hole offensive liability like Ben Simmons on your team. Saying that, don't care if the organization fires him."
"CJ would be amazing as a 3rd option, which he would be behind Harris and Embiid. Having 2 Tobias' with Embiid is not a bad thing and you just got to hope thybulle grows more as a stopper at the 2 guard or bring in another perimeter hound to play SG.    He looks bad now because he is the 2nd option, that too next to Lillard who plays a similar style but gets to the rim."
So is Tobias Harris.
Doc is a bitch and consistently throws his guys under the bus. Seeing ty lue vs doc handling the clips is night and day. Good on doc getting Tobias harris back to form but doc is not a coach I’d ever wanna play for.
"Ben Simmons does do the little things that help a team win but none of the big stuff, like scoring, or free throw shooting, or attacking the defense. He’s the best role player in the league, which isn’t a compliment.  People are gonna act as if Ben Simmons is a negative asset which is simply untrue (until you consider contract maybe). He’s a deeply flawed player who I don’t think will get better, but he’s okay, considering he had 13 assists and played good defense. The sixers have to trade him not because he sucks, but because he is probably the worst offensive fit with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid. And he sucks."
"Year 1, breaks his foot, out all season.  Year 2, comes up [small](https://www.couchkingsports.com/how-can-ben-simmons-have-1-point/) against Boston in round 2.  Year 3, comes up [small](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/nba-free-agent-sixers-jimmy-butler-tobias-harris-ben-simmons-max-contract-20190702.html) against Toronto in round 2.  Year 4, back injury, out for the playoffs.  Year 5, comes up [small](https://streamable.com/sg4kjt) against Atlanta in round 2."
By shooting 5/23 and bricking almost everything. A KD foot on the line away from getting the Tobias Harris treatment.
Tobias Harris did just that and he ain't the one getting killed online
Kevin Huerter Mr. New York State basketball 2016.   Tobias Harris was Mr. New York State basketball 2010.
"I remember pre season Philly fans thought I was insane because I posted in this sub that trading Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and picks for Harden should have been the easiest decision in the history of the organization   Wonder how they are feeling about it right about now   Imagine a Harden Embiid pick and roll…"
"&gt; Tobias Harris will be well liked by Philly fans and not considered a “bad contract”  Says who?  Maybe in the regular season but he had his fair share of fuck ups this series. He also missed about 5 easy ass shots last night.  He's at best a 3rd option scorer, and when he was in with that god awful bench unit as the first option is when the team looked their worst all series.   Unlike Ben, however, I think Tobias was trying, he's just not what he's been paid to be. He had spurts where he did well, but he is just too unreliable late in games.  It's not a great contract, but the bad contract is indeed Simmons which is taking the brunt of the shit talking right now."
"The ""Fuck It, Let's All Just Trade Our Problems"" Trade. Add picks as necessary:  Sixers Get: Kevin Love, Buddy Hield, Delon Wright  Mavs Get: Tobias Harris  Cavs Get: Kristaps Porzingis  Kings Get: Ben Simmons"
&gt; Im one of the few who thinks Tobias signing is pretty okay.   Maybe it's less bad considering how poorly Ben has played in the playoffs right now but it's still a terrible contract.  Tobias Harris making 30m puts a specific ceiling on a team.
"I noticed during the games how the Sixers would allow Trae to easily get into the floater area. At that point, Embiid was in a no win situation. If he takes Trae, Trae passes to Capela for the dunk. If he takes Capela, Trae floats it in.  Sixers got unlucky with Tobias Harris not being able to hit shots. However, Atlanta couldn’t hit open shots most of the series, and in Game 6, couldn’t hit FTs."
"And 24 points for Tobias. I’m sorry, but how is Harris getting a free pass on social media while Ben Simmons is the worst player ever? I don’t get it. Sure, he needed to take more than 4 shots in a game 7, but if the other dude is taking 24 shots, he sure as hell better have more than 24 points. Not to mention the other game when he shot less than 20% from the field. He seems like he’s getting away with a horrible series pretty easy."
I mean the process didnt force the sixers to sign huge contracts for al horford and tobias harris. And lose jimmy butler in the offseason. That was just incompetent management from the people leading the sixers after the process ended.

The process died when they traded all there assets for tobias Harris and couldn't resign jimmy Butler.
"Here is the list of best power forwards in the league:  1) KD 2) AD 3) TOBIAS HARRIS  Tobi had a good playoffs, overall. His defense was improved this year. I don’t think they should trade him. Ben for CJ straight up and let’s go."
"Ben is getting killed everywhere. Tobias Harris better send him a thank you card, which will probably fall short of the mailbox and never get delivered."
Lol Tobias Harris is looking like WTF?
Philadelphia 76ers 2022 starting 5:       Ben Simmons - Westbrook -  Kuzman - Tobias Harris -  Pascal Siakam     Headcoach:   Scalabrine
Are you really a contender if your second option is Tobias Harris
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
"It's not phair, but their character is trash. Tobias Harris and Embiid missed lots of opportunities, but they aren't mature enough to take responsibility, much less Doc Rivers."
Why is Tobias Harris getting a free pass? Also I Don’t really think it’s good for a team leader to throw a team mate under the bus like that
"i mean i would've said the exact same thing about a team with joel embiid, ben simmons, jimmy butler, and tobias harris a couple of years ago. the astros also whiffed hard on their draft picks. mark appel and brady were two of their three #1 overall picks and never played an MLB game for them, which is exceedingly rare for a #1 overall pick in MLB.  it's also tough to compare across sports because tanking in MLB doesn't really do much since the draft is such a crapshoot anyway. there's really no benefit to losing 110+ games at all. you're better off signing project free agents and then trading them at the deadline or holding them if they're any good than you are just completely shedding all salary to bottom out."
Bruh the process been going on for 10 years now. They should’ve gotten someone better than Tobias Harris for the picks they had. Jimmy must’ve been kept at all costs.
"&gt;You can blame the coach for his inability to motivate his own team,   Bro, there is no coach on this earth that is motivating a bunch of grown ass men to not blow a 25 point lead. That is complete bullshit.   &gt;you can also blame the coach for not making adjustments after blowing an 18 point lead just to blow another 25 point lead because Embiid gasses out twice without any scoring help because there was practically 0 changes in the offensive system.   I'm not blaming doc for Embiid gassing out when Simmons can't shoot, thybule can't shoot, and other guys can't create. Ain't docs fault Tobias Harris sucked ass. Doc played maxey and gave him the greenlight. That was about the only adjustment to be made.   &gt;There were no adjustments made whatsoever and the team expects a different result? Theres plenty of blame to go around and Doc bears some of it  What adjustments was doc going to make? You can only do so much with the roster you have.   And again, they were up 18 and 25. That's not a coaching problem, that's a fucking player problem."
Tobias Harris is the luckiest man in the world right now IMO.
"Tobias Harris basically got completely forgotten about once he re-signed with the Sixers after the trade.   He’s pretty decent, but it feels like any hype around him from a few years ago is gone."
"i do not under any circumstance want to see a philly squad with joel embiid, seth curry, cj mcollum, tobias harris, and danny green. so help me god i will fly to america and burn down philadelphia myself to stop that dominance from rising."
"The process was a success. Tons of picks and good draft picks used but then they traded a ton for: half a season of butler and pulling the trigger on Tobias Harris. Then the proceed to max out Harris, Embiid, Simmons. They also broke fultz confidence. No more cap space and all their treasure chest of picks and assets gone. They also signed horford and forced to get rid of him. It was a success but they flopped on how to use everything. When you think of a star player you don’t think of maxing and trading Harris as your first thing."
"&gt;if Ben could be somewhat like Dray, then maybe  Maybe if Seth was Steph and Tobias Harris was Klay Thompson"
Tobias Harris sucked dude. Blew a ton of layups
Don't let Ben Simmons distract you from tobias Harris shooting 8/24.
"Wizards aren’t really interested in trading beal, and bens trade value is at an all time low. Russ still has a ton of value on to this team. Plus that pick would be ass, and Tobias Harris literally doesn’t matter at all since the team would be dog shit without Russ or Beal. Wizards would probably want multiple first or a young player with true star potential. Ben Simmons doesn’t appear to have the work ethic or aggression or skills required to have that. You can’t really move Tobias for more assets since he isn’t worth his contract so nobody really wants to trade for him"
He can make Tobias Harris look competant. That alone is a feat.
Tobias Harris honoring Kobe by shooting 8-24
"Don’t let the Nets series fool you, they would’ve taken any team to 7 based on how Durant shot from the field. It’s also pretty disappointing to see people refer to Middleton/Holiday as “meh” 2nd and 3rd options, even though you just had the opportunity to see Tobias Harris play. Look up Middleton’s averages and ask if you’re comfortable calling him meh. Jrue has a lot of room for improvement, hopefully he gets going."
I swear I saw Tobias Harris miss every layup he took.
"They’ve run out. If they lost to the full strength nets in like 6 or 7 then you could say tough luck. Losing to the Hawks when Trae young shoots absolutely abysmal is insane.  Tobias Harris was trying to do too much, Joel Embiid carried offensively but had moments where he made terrible decisions, Simmons (lmao). The sixers role players really didn’t play all that terribly. They need someone who can create his own shot better than Toby and someone who isn’t a liability on offense like Simmons."
"I am a Ben Simmons hater to the tenth degree but I feel like he could do *something* on another team. He's never gonna be the true star that he was projected to be but his strengths are still there and he's a legit perennial DPOTY candidate.  I'm trying to think of a team that could utilize him correctly, maybe Minnesota to run point behind Towns, DLo and Edwards? His offensive game is extremely limited, nobody could deny that at this point but if he goes to the right team and they surround him with lots of shooting (real shooting, not Seth Curry and Tobias Harris) it might just work.   I could also see a small market or habitual lottery team taking a chance on building something around him depending on his trade value. Regardless he's done in Philly unless his trade value or albatross of a contract prevents Morey from moving him."
"...so you think Kevin Durant would agree to play in Philadelphia right now? With who? I'm assuming you mean Simmons would stay and Embiid would go instead based on how you worded your question. So Kevin Durant is going to play with Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and Seth Curry at 32 years old?"
Also Ben Simmons 4 shot attempts and Tobias Harris 24
Why the fuck is Doc Rivers even talking?   He is as big of a problem as Ben Simmons or Tobias Harris.  Hope he gets fired this summer.
"are you serious lmao. let's ignore ben, 6ers top players are the mvp runnernup joel embiid, a pure scorer in tobias harris, flamethrower seth curry, all nba defender matisse thybulle, a veteran george hill, shake milton and a pretty good rookie imo tyrese. you wanna do a side by side against the hawks' best players?  even by your argument that the hawks are at the nare minimum very close to philly, philly got outcoached"
"Maybe a game, but last years Sixers were so disappointing   Tobias Harris made like 2 triples in the entire series  Only one who showed up was Embiid"
You didn’t win a championship-it’s a negative year.  You didn’t make it the east finals- it’s a negative year  Somehow your star pg has regressed to the point of no return- it’s a negative year  Tobias Harris is your second best player offensively- it’s a negative year  Doc ain’t the coach for Philly
"He needs to be in a Rondo Celtics situation. 3 all-star scoring options ahead of you and he's just the guy facilitating it all. Embiid fits the Garnett role well enough, but Tobias Harris ain't no Paul Pierce and Seth Curry can't quite fit Ray Allen's shoes."
Nah Tobias Harris was playing
"He was 2/19 with like 7 minutes to go and it was somehow a close game! The Sixers missed so many makeable shots, especially Tobias Harris."
"lets be real, tobias harris shot them outta it, and ben simmons is a fraud"
There were so many makeable layups and close-range floaters that Tobias Harris missed.
yeah cause he is the only player keeping them in games since his co stars are automatic bricks. Give him actual star teams not named Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris he can actually rest. Same thing last season
"I cant believe how many plays he ran for Tobias while Maxey was on the court. If Maxey is on the court he needs to fucking attack Trae Young and quit force feeding Tobias Harris.   I hope Doc Rivers is fired, and he won't be. Fuck this."
did we watch the same tobias harris? paul george has been great but I don’t see it with harris
"What did Tobias Harris do in the playoffs? His ""redemption season"" ended In May."
simmons is embarrassing but damn tobias harris can't hit a damn layup
Tobias Harris and Maxey for TJ Warren and Malcom Brogdon
I will never rescind my staunch position as a Tobias Harris stan  I literally gave up on Ben halfway through this series lmao I just had enough
"Philly needs to retool. Asides from the obvious simmons issue of fit, they don't have enough shooting and/or 3/d guys.  The problem is that Simmons probably cant get a guy who can immediately fix this because the only players who can fix this without further moves required are top tier scoring point or combo guards (who still offer some good facilitating) in the tier of Dame, Beal, Booker etc..  If they cant fix it like that, then they should look at a lower tier scoring guard along the lines of McCollums level, and then try to pry a guy like Rubio away from the Wolves to make up for the lack of offensive facilitating with Simmons departure. Then see what Tobias Harris fetches for 3/d players, and if he cant get a worthwhile return just role with Harris again.  If Simmons somehow can in fact net someone like Beal then I'd still look at acquiring Rubio from the Wolves to steady the ship. He's rotting on the Minnesota bench, brings comparable playmaking to Simmons and isn't afraid to shoot even if he is a mediocre to bang average shooter."
Simmons of course deserves the bulk of the criticism but man Tobias Harris is exceedingly mediocre...not really a liability but just feels like a role player
"&gt;So you get to Keep Matisse, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Embid and all you gotta do is trade Ben Simmons and 3 first round picks?!?!? PHILLY IF YOU DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER I SWEAR TO GOD  This comment got downvoted to -12. Speaks to how delusional the /r/sixers sub was about Simmons lmao."
Tobias Harris in the conversation too. Would suck to have both of those guys on one team...
"Tobias Harris seemed psychologically fine tonight, what is he talking about?"
"Tobias Harris goes 8-24, but everyone wants to shit on Simmons, who had 8 boards and 13 assists...ok."
"It's not his fault because they called a play that put him at the top of the three point line when he's a 7 foot tall, 300 lb man. That's the job of some other player on the court. Perhaps a Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons type, I don't know, just throwing out some ideas here."
When I see Tobias Harris play it looks like he just plays for the paycheck. Don't see any real fire in him. He could be so much better.
"do Seth Curry and Tobias Harris not exist to you? re-signed Korkmaz, who is a shooter  also Danny Green hasn't signed anywhere...  if you're gonna make fun of us for not making FA or trade moves, say the roster in general is not good, whatever. But the shooting thing is not really the leg to stand on atm"
"That's what happens when the Coangelo's showed up and said ""look at all these assets wow. Let's go spend them all on Tobias Harris and Al Horford!"""
"Tobias harris, KP, Middleton honestly"
"Tobias Harris, not to be confused with Obito Uchiha"
Tobias Harris.
"4/90 is probably what he's worth.  4/120 is probably what he gets though.  Contracts are super inflated, and even more so on small market teams.   Tobias Harris is not a max player, but someone in the league was going to max him because they had money and nothing else to spend it on.  Similarly, JJR is not a max player but in order to retain him, a larger offer may be necessary, it's the sad reality of smaller markets."
"and 2019 sixers had embiid, simmons, butler, tobias harris, and jj redick"
"Because nobody gives a shit about the regular season (and rightfully so). If you were paying attention, it was obvious all year that the Sixers were a paper tiger. Their second best scorer was Tobias Harris and a dude who can't score beyond 2 feet was their point guard."
Nah tobias harris is worth $180mil
"DeRozan is better than Tobias Harris,and Harris got max"
"A third option on a non playoff team? I mean sure I’ll pay 21 million for Tobias Harris, jrue, porter jr, guys like that I’d pay a lot more than 21 tbh, but you’re talking about a guy that was a third option on a very mediocre team…  I get teams pay 3rd options that, but hes a subpar third option if you want to contend imo. I’m just some scrub on the Internet though"
Maybe we can sign Tobias Harris and Demar Derozan in 2029
The Tobias Harris special.   MPJ without Jokic would be bang-average.
Y'all should sign and trade him to Philly for Tobias Harris and reunite Bobi and Tobi.
"Copy/pasting from my other reply:  &gt;Collins allowed 61.3% shooting inside of 5 feet, Ayton allowed 61.9%.  &gt;Collins allowed 40.9% shooting from 5-9 feet, Ayton allowed 45.6%.  &gt;Collins allowed 44.7% shooting from 10-14 feet, Ayton allowed 42.5%.  &gt;Collins allowed 47.2% shooting from 15-19 feet, Ayton allowed 40.6%.  &gt;Collins allowed 36.3% shooting from 20-24 feet, Ayton allowed 41.7%.  &gt;Collins allowed 34.9% shooting from 25-29 feet, Ayton allowed 35%.  Collins isn't a center, so it's not really expected of him to go against guys like Embiid or Jokic. Collins went against Tobias Harris and Julius Randle and was just fine.  The gap between their defense is not even close to 40+ million, and definitely not once you factor in Collins being the better offensive player."
Cj for Tobias Harris as a foundation for a trade. I think both teams benefit from it.
"i think CJ needs traded for an equivalent near-allstar starter, Tobias Harris or Siakam maybe"
"Colangelo ruined the process. 17-18 sixers were young AF and had tons of promise.   Then he traded away homegrown talent on amazing contracts for a jimmy butler rental, and gave away 3 first round picks for Tobias Harris, who was then wildly overpaid.   The sixers had 2 max contract slots to sign people in the off-season and were already the 3 seed 🤦‍♂️."
Also sometimes people leak stuff to Woj to get trade rumors started. “The Sixers are shopping Tobias Harris” == “Morey is trying to signal to other GMs that Tobias is available if they call”
For Tobias Harris? Sure fuck it at this point lmao
Tobias Harris would be a king bruh. Jesus Christ. Buddy’s defense isn’t good compared to Seth curry? Buddy is a decent on ball defender and that’s not something you’d ever say about curry. Throw in being a legit volume 3 point shooter and someone that can create for themselves a few times a game and the impact of the two isn’t comparable.
Tobias Harris exists.
Cj fo Tobias Harris I see everywhere and I think it makes sense for both teams. Maybe this is the trade?
"Dangelo Russell got a max when nobody though he deserved it, Ben Simmons is on a max, McCollum makes $30M, Tobias Harris is on a max, yes Kawhi getting a 5 year max is a no brainer unless his knee is in extremely bad shape."
"&gt;the Sixers are shopping Tobias Harris. The __________ are one of the teams that turned down Harris, per sources.  that's gonna be a headline we see more than a few times this offseason"
"Tobias Harris for Everyone not named John Wall or Eric Gordon, 4 First Round picks and 4 pick swaps  —- Daryl Morey"
"As I said, Tobias Harris is a power forward with a serious post up game that score more points per possession than anything THJ does, so obviously Tobias takes fewer threes. Tobias also shoots over 20% better on open threes than THJ (yes, this is actually true, shockingly) meaning that Tobias is just as useful as a floor spacer as THJ is. You will sacrifice more points by leaving Tobias open than you will by leaving THJ open."
wiggins is way better than tobias harris and CJ
he is overpaid but a productive player. I would throw him with the likes of Tobias Harris and Wiggins
1 Tobias Harris
Turned Mikal Bridges into Tobias Harris.  Wildly incompetent set of moves.
"Tobias Harris is a STAR, fertitta! We'll even add some cash considerations!"
"Tobias Harris, like Ben Simmons, is a negative asset.  They are both paid too much for a rebuilding team, and have too little upside to justify a risk.  At the same time, neither of them are good enough to help a team win finals, when using up one of the three max/supermax contracts.  As a quick thought excersise, say which of the 'big 3' at Brooklyn or even the Bucks you'd replace with Harris or Simmons to improve that teams odds of a ring.  They'll both need assets attached to get Philly out from under their contract."
"True, but Tobias also shot 61.1% on open threes and THJ shot 44%. TH takes fewer attempts because he has more to offer than being a spotup shooter (THJ is a SG, TH is a PF, the discrepanvy in attempts should be expected).  My point is less that TH is a better guy to have standing around only shooting threes and more that THJ isn't quite the top-tier shooter that he gained a reputation as from the clippers series. There's some thought around here that he is equivalent to Robinson, Joe Harris, et al, which is very dubious. He wasn't exceptional in the regular season and he regressed to the mean in game 7. He isn't worth Tobias, even if he's a better fit"
"Al Horford, waited until Jah and Nerlens had negative value to trade them, maxed out Tobias Harris, never once brought in a starting caliber point guard, traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith on draft night after embarrassing his mom on national TV, sold second round picks for cash annually  For starters"
&gt;	Serious shooting  THJ shot .391 from 3pt range last season. Tobias Harris shot .394
Yeah what were we thinking drafting Tobias Harris to a max???
"I was comparing him to Tobias Harris since they had similar scoring and efficiency numbers both in the regular and post season, and the biggest difference I noticed how much more Middleton shoots."
"Sixers reportedly asked for christian wood, jalen green and 10 draft picks for tobias harris"
Bro he’s clearly talking about Magic legend Tobias Harris
"Joe Harris, not Tobias"
Tobias Harris is so lucky Ben Simmons is such an easy target lol
The 6ers have a pretty talented roster outside Embiid? Seth Curry was their 2nd best player that series and he should be a team's 5th starter or 6th man. Tobias Harris can only score and that's inconsistent and Simmons can only defend in the playoffs and his lack of a shot sabotage's Embiid.
"jazz @ sixers right before the all star break was fucking amazing. dwight howard hit a 3 while we were down double digits in the forth. we rallied back by the end of the game and embiid hit this disgusting step back 3 to tie it. tobias harris dominated in overtime, and we won. probably the high point of the season tbh, cause right after the all star break embiid injured his knee and was out for 3 weeks and simmons sorta fell off"
Tobias Harris is a poor man's Melo without the ball handling ability on a max contract.  Yeah Siakam is easily a better player.
Friends don't let friends think Tobias Harris is better than Siakam.
"lol acting like Tobias Harris actually wanted it in that series, putting Danny Green on trae young when DG has the lateral quickness of a turtle now a days, doc's gameplan going into the series was dogshit, you gotta acknowledge that"
"And considering who Tatum became. If Philly had Jayson Tatum right now I’d be willing to bet that they wouldn’t care quite as much about the Simmons return and would’ve traded him a little sooner. They also maybe wouldn’t have felt like they needed Tobias Harris around as well given that positionally Tatum can fill his role and be far far far far far better in it.  Edit: with that said, I believe the Celtics would’ve still taken Tatum #1."
"The Fultz disaster is the most harmful transaction of the old regime considering the average outcome of the no 1 pick and what they got out of it(and how good the player that went at no 3 is now). But the most indefensible move in real time was always the Tobias trade. Every other move you could at least plausibly defend at the time regardless of how it worked out. Giving up an unprotected first(that they were lucky wasnt that valuable) for the rights to give Tobias Harris $190 mil was always asinine.   Elton just panicked after 2018 when they couldnt get LeBron or PG in FA and he was worried 2019 which was ""use it or lose it cap space"" wouldnt be able to be used in FA. So he went out and tried to get guys he could pay so he could use the space for the sake of using it. That's what the Tobias trade was and it was always incoherent logic."
"The real truth is there's plenty of blame to go around. In no particular order, I blame:  1. Adam Silver giving into NBA ownerships and agents pleas by installing Jerry Colangelos and his big-collared son, which led to us making a lot of short sided decisions that drained a lot of assets acquired by Hinkie.  2. Josh Harris and the ownership group being absolutely boneheaded greedy bloodsuckers at every turn.  3. Fultz straight up forgetting how to play basketball, and drafting him over Jayson Tatum.  3. Choosing to give Tobias Harris a max contract over Jimmy Butler.  4. Ben Simmons inability to improve at any level on the offensive end.  5. Hiring Doc Rivers.  Etc, etc. This franchise has continuously just makes wrong decision after wrong decision."
"i still maintain my position that the Tobias Harris trade is the single biggest disaster of the old regime  (yes, bigger than the Fultz trade or letting Butler walk or Zhaire Smith trade/pick etc)"
"If Jamal Murray has a 4 point playoff game, there is absolutely no way he gets the same pass Tobias Harris is. They are both the second option on offense and I’ve never seen such an important player put up such a bad playoff performance and everyone ignore it because another bad playoff performance is more polarizing."
"Game 5. Tobias Harris shot 18% from the field, didn’t make a 3, didn’t attempt a free throw, and had just 4 rebounds and 3 assists in a 3 point loss at home."
Tobias Harris never lives up to his contract in big games but gets away easy lol
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn’t trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
"Tobias Harris was also awful in game 7, but Simmons gets 10x the blame"
"I thought the choice was Tobias Harris or Jimmy? I may be way off, but I remenber 6ers fans getting super excited about that potential big 3 running it back before Tobi got his offer."
"Like I said, Tobias Harris had a 4 point game and nobody wants to talk about it. Case in point: I say “nobody wants to talk about Tobias Harris’s 4 point game” and then two people respond talking about Ben Simmons."
"Like I said, Tobias Harris had a 4 point game and nobody wants to talk about it. Case in point: I say “nobody wants to talk about Tobias Harris’s 4 point game” and then two people respond talking about Ben Simmons."
Tobias Harris had a 4 point playoff game in the Atlanta series and nobody wants to talk about it.
*max to Tobias Harris*
I love the Tobias Harris comparison actually.
I got another. Barnes + Hali + Hield + 3 unprotected picks + 2 far away swaps + Filler for Tobias Harris + Ben Simmons + Maxey
Why would the Kings give all that up for Tobias Harris?
"Not necessarily but forcing the Kings to take on that contract and get older doesn't really help them. What are they going to do, build around Tobias Harris?  Unless you're absolutely giving up on Bagley, then I'm not sure what Kings have to gain with Tobias if they're not even in contention."
"Because they can split Tobias into Hield and Barnes. Barnes is  worse than Tobias on offense but better on D. And is making considerably less on a 1 year shorter deal. He can replicate some of What Tobias does. Hield gives them another knock down shooter to help embiid.  They could run Maxey, Hield, Barnes, Siakam and Embiid. With Curry, Danny Green, Milton, Drummond and Thybulle off the bench. I’m not sure what the trade value of Tobias Harris is but I originally had them giving him straight up for Hield and Barnes but people complained the Kings wouldn’t do it so I added picks. The Picks for Simmons would be lightly protected while the ones for Harris would be heavily protected."
"76ers : Cj Mc, Heild, Bagley  Portland: Simmons, Thybulle  Kings: Tobias Harris"
Philly Receives:  Siakam   Barnes  Hield  Raptors Recieve:  Simmons   Picks  Kings Receive:  Tobias Harris  Picks
Doc Rivers not being mentally challenged would have made them advance.  The Bench blowing large leads in 4 minute spans would have made them advance.  Tobias Harris not being invisible in 2nd halves would’ve made them advance.  Embiid not going 0-12 in the 2nd half of game 4 or having 8 turnovers in game 7 would’ve made them advance.
"Sixers fans mad and don't want to deal with reality.  $120M due to Tobias Harris and $140M due to Simmons, who the coach and best player threw under the bus.   They are stuck with the two worst contracts in basketball combining for more than 2 years of an entire team salary cap.  Those contracts can't be dumped for value.  Embiid's of winning a ring with the 6ers over the rest of his contract with team is not near, but exactly zero.  Philly is in a worse spot than the Pistons.  Sooner or later Embiid's gonna realize this."
"SVG for you.  Same guy who traded away Dinwiddie for pretty much nothing, overpaid Jon Leuer, and traded for Blake Griffin giving away our first and the awesome contract Tobias Harris had."
No team paying Tobias Harris 34million+ a year will win a championship.
Tobias Harris is absolutely better than Wiggins.
When did embiid and Tobias Harris have bad chemistry?
"Wiggins has def proven himself with the warriors but Tobias Harris is better than him. Harris gets unfairly shit on due to his contract but he’s a borderline all star, Wiggins is more of a good starter but not really a guy that’s going to be competing for all star spots."
Tobias Harris is all star caliber player though.
"&gt;contributes at an above average level for an NBA starter  &gt;Advanced stats really hate him  How do you justify the first statement and pair it with the second?  What's he above average at?  What does he contribute?  Certainly last year was his most improved year to date, and advanced stats were starting to see him nearing average or even above average in certain aspects of his game, 3P shooting and defense especially.  That I can agree with, but that's looking at how advanced stats tell the story of his improvement, not hand-waving them away like they don't matter.  There's really no stat that puts him anywhere near Tobias Harris in terms of contribution besides raw points per game.  Tobias as a clear-cut #2 option has the Sixers as a solid-to-high playoff team 3 years in a row, each of them with a #1 arguably on the same level (MVP).  Wiggins has yet to make the playoffs except for the year he was the clear #3.  Personally, I'm really interested to see what he does this year as a 3rd option.  Does he stay engaged and (ideally) put more effort in on defense once Klay comes back and absorbs 30-40% of his offensive load per game?  That's the best case scenario for the Warriors.  Worst case is you see him revert to not caring and not playing hard just as he was going to become a positive asset and expiring contract in 2022-23."
Yeah Tobias Harris is a good comparison only difference is that Wiggins was supposed to be the next nba superstar and instead wound up decent.
That is clearly not the case if you read the replies in this thread people still firmly hate Wiggins. Also Tobias Harris and Wiggins had statistically similar impact and career wise have a similar PER and EFG% even if Wiggins early seasons really drag down his EFG%
Gotta throw in Tobias Harris for cash considerations to make the readers stick around purely from the shock value.
Wiggins is good but Tobias Harris is way better come on
"I'd argue the Process was over the moment they traded for Tobias Harris, but yeah there was no coming back once Butler left and Fultz got traded"
He isn't close to being as good as Tobias Harris.
"Tobias Harris is not close to being the 10th or 20th best player in the league, which is the entire point lol"
No he wouldn’t have lol — Tobias Harris literally has the sixth biggest contract in NBA history and every single person knew it was an overpay as soon as the news broke. I love Tobias and I think he’s a very good player but his contract is bad no matter how you frame it.
"I was going to drop something about ""so brave"" but c'mon man he's better than he was in Minny for sure, but he isn't in the Tobias Harris borderline acceptable second option good third option range. He's in the Marcus Smart great defender god awful offense range. He's Pat Bev with less offensive self awareness. Finally found a solid NBA role for sure, but if he's anything higher than your 4th option the team is in trouble."
"Siakim is not significantly better, Tobias Harris is not significantly better, and those dudes aren't getting bought out any time soon."
"He actually compares favorably with other players in his pay range. Pascal Siakim, Gordon Hayward, Kris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Kristaps Porzingis."
Boban and Tobias Harris
"So late to this but give me Tobias Harris, never should have been traded"
Oof Tobias Harris 5 year value $45m total
"basically another Tobias Harris with worse defense for Philly.  also that guard defense would be hot trash with D'Lo, Beasley and Seth."
Not when their 2nd option is as inconsistent as Tobias Harris.
"He’s saying that Tobias Harris isn’t good enough to make Ben Simmons the third option, not that Tobias Harris isn’t good enough to be the third option himself."
"12ppg as a third option if your 2 best scorers are prime Steph and Klay, but if they're Joel and Tobias Harris... That's not going to do too much for you"
Efficient 12ppg in the playoffs as a 3rd option is lowkey good enough if you have two good scorers in front of you. Tobias Harris just isn't it.
"Blazers aren’t going to trade for a 24 year old with Dame being almost 32 wanting to win now. They’re going to look for something that has a faster turnout (like a Beal or Towns)  Why would Sixers trade for Ingram? They have Tobias Harris who is practically the same player as Ingram, the two would just be butting heads on offense and be redundant. Sixers want and need a point guard, preferably a scoring one, and that’s why they’re pursuing Dame. They’re not going after a wing. They’ll get DLo out of Minnesota before they go for Ingram.  Warriors maybe, but I can see them being in a similar situation as Portland and going after Siakam since he’s more of a win-now wing that can fit with Steph, Klay and Draymond. One can argue that it would probably be the same situation as they have with Wiggins if they got Ingram.  Sacramento could offer a Buddy Hield + Harrison Barnes type package but i don’t think that is better than a Dillion Brooks and Kyle Anderson package. Dillion Brooks as a player &gt; Buddy + Kyle Anderson at this point is a better player than Barnes is. Also, Anderson and Brooks’s contracts are a lot more team friendly and they’re both younger."
"&gt; Terrible game one, but seeing as he nearly doubled his percentage in game two and was slowly becoming more efficient as the series went on, I kinda don't see how this is the definitive series that points to Bam being worse than Simmons ... I kinda don't see how this is the definitive series that points to Bam being worse than Simmons.  While he improved in games 3 &amp; 4, Bam shot 45.6% from the field in the entire series. He also had an assist/turnover ratio of 1.5, while Ben's was 3.07.   &gt; With Simmons, his poor shooting, and reticence regarding scoring has been documented over the last few years. The Altanta series was, as I said, icing on the cake and a coach targeting his weakness.   Like I said earlier, Bam has also exhibited the same problem his whole career, and has even admitted to it limiting his team.  &gt; By no means is Bam perfect, but i'd argue its harder to make a gameplan solely around exploiting one of this weaknesses and have it be THAT effective.  Mike Budenholzer actually gameplanned solely around exploiting his main weaknesses, rim aversion and scoring hesitancy, by always matching him up with Brook Lopez, and it was THAT effective.  &gt; The narrative around him and his team is that he is supposed to be #2 on a championship caliber team ... Ben has to be the 2nd scoring option. Who else?   This is inaccurate, as Ben was initially supposed to be the second scoring option, but was relieved of that role with the arrival of Tobias Harris, who immediately becames the Sixers' second option."
I watched like 75/82 of the 13 win season for the bucks. But surprisingly I enjoyed that year cause I got to watch rookie Giannis and a pretty young impressive player in Khris Middleton. The darkest for me was the year before watching us trade our promising young stud Tobias Harris for a disgruntled Redick
Is Tobias Harris the best player from Long Island?
"Simmons, CJ McCollum, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Andre Drummond is a great line up for philly, good trade.  We can make up dumb trash ass trades too."
For example drtg has Talen hortontucker as a top 10 defensive player amongst players with 40+ games and 20+ mpg. I'm sure I can find worse oversights.  Defensive win shares put tobias Harris over giannis despite fairly even minutes and games played.  Advanced stats are at best conversation starters.
"Yeah that’s what he wrote on his company’s  website similar to how I juice my resume up.   Oubre signed after the deal, and other than that he only represents his 3 sons (tobi and 2 others trying to make it in the league).   He represented Gervin after his nba career in Europe [“One of his first clients was Gervin, a close family friend whom he had worked with since retiring after the 1985-86 season with the Chicago Bulls.”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/sixers/toreel-harris-tobias-sixers-tj-unique-sports-20200621.html%3foutputType=amp)  He stopped being an agent in 1991 until Tobi and is mostly known for his work on the clothing side in NBA. Obviously he’s not a slouch but not a shark negotiator of an agent.   In context to your comments though, it’s I agree mid-tier players are better off with agents but Max and Mid level players it wouldn’t matter. Just thought it was funny you kept using Tobias as an example"
"If the Sixers r rolling, tobias Harris"
"One, no one cares about the pie that belongs to anyone else but themselves.  When Tobias Harris or Chandler Parsons got their big contracts they didn't stay up at night crying about if Doug McDermott is going to have enough to feed his family.  Two, the 49/51 split as far as I'm aware does not inlcude luxury tax. If all teams abide by the cap you would have the split you're talking about, but they don't.  Teams routinely will overspend for these players and pay out of pocket.    You're looking at this from a very holistic viewpoint where the pie as a whole stays the same size, but agents exist so that their guy gets a bigger piece of the pie.  If we were all ants or perfect socialists we'd be ok with what you're saying, but we're not."
"That's like saying if billionaires accepted bigger tax cuts the amount of money in the economy would stay the same.  Sure, but they're not going to do it.  The guys with the chance at big contracts don't want some pencil pusher getting them the deal, they want a shark who will get them Mozgov money, and Tobias Harris, and Al Horford money.  They also want someone fighting for their shoe to be one placed on display in stores, or their billboard in Times Square.  No one at that level wants to play fair, they want the biggest piece of the pie they can get, and that's why agents exist."
"Oooh I like this one. I’ll add J Cole, Quinn cook, tobias harris"
"They just need to find a team with a pretty good player on a horrible contract. Maybe they can trade him for Tobias Harris, what team is he on these days?"
Rudy Gay  Tobias Harris  Prime Melo
I can see Tobias Harris getting off to a hot start and making it in as a replacement
"&gt;&gt;Tell me another player who'll get boo'd for turning down open 3s.  &gt;Seth Curry, Tobias Harris...Pretty much everyone on the team that isn't a big man.  Find 1 time that happened anytime last year. What an absolute lie."
"Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, (Danny Green has never turned down an open three but he got booed in the playoffs for missing them). Pretty much everyone on the team that isn't a big man."
"What is this, a Tobias Harris trade?"
"Only awkward bit is between Ben and Joel…one can’t shoot and has no confidence and the other cant stay healthy, which is equally bad. Trust the process! Sad thing is that the process is Tobias Harris is so undervalued within the organization."
Middleton handles the ball a lot and is a better passer than both of them  Tobias Harris  a better answer than Middleton Imo
"That's the opposite of my point though. It's easy for people to try to discredit the Hawks by saying ""yeah but if Embiid was healthy..."" because on paper it seems like healthy Embiid clearly makes the Sixers better, but there are all sorts of other factors that are hard to predict.  If both teams go into that game knowing that Embiid is healthier, maybe the Hawks are motivated to play that much harder. Or maybe a guy like Tobias Harris feels like he needs to defer more to Embiid and pulls a complete disappearing act.  That's why I point to game 4 of the Bucks-Hawks series. On paper, the Bucks should steamroll that game. In reality, the Bucks relaxed too much and the Hawks roleplayers stepped the fuck up"
"1) Markelle Fultz forgetting how to shoot  2) Colangelo’s burners   3) *The Shot*  4) Tobias Harris and Al Horford’s contracts  5) Brett Brown’s coaching   6) Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson  7) injuries in general   8) Brett Brown’s coaching   9) Doc Rivers’ coaching   10) Ben Simmons refusing to shoot   Lot of stressors in the Philly fandom. And to think this is just basketball, they still have to worry about the Eagles too"
"We are actually pretty solid if we are talking about prime players (outside of PG)  Augustin, Oladipo, Tobias Harris, Ibaka, Dwight  Bench of Vucevic, Sabonis, Gordon, Fournier, Reddick, Ryan Anderson"
Bucks would be like   Bledsoe   Brogdon   Jabari/tucker or something idk  Tobias Harris   Christian Wood
Tobias Harris is somewhere laughing his ass off that he’s totally escaped criticism for his playoff failures with Simmons basically taking the entirety of the blame. Dude signed a $180 mill contract that will become one of the worst in the league going forward
"&gt; are fans happy with tobias harris?  Super casual sixers fans probably no. Otherwise, I think sixers fans are reasonably happy. We recognize he’s very overpaid, and are maybe a little nervous that he just put up another “meh” playoff performance. But overall happy.  &gt; has a CJ for tobi trade ever come up?  Yes, this comes up time to time on both the sixers and the blazers subreddit. I like the deal, not so much because I’m unhappy with tobi, but because having a legit perimeter scorer who is also a 40% high volume 3pt shooter would be a game changer. However, there are multiple caveats:  -If CJ is in, curry is out. He has good trade value, and I have no desire yo have the worst defensive backcourt in the league.  -If Ben is staying, this deal is a no brainer for the sixers. If Ben is gone, and I think he is, it makes things much more complicated. Without ben and tobi, the sixers would basically have no starting SF or PF. The roster would be almost entirely point guards, shooting guards and centers. So it might be worth keeping tobi at that point, but it would depend on what we get back for ben.   As for the blazers perspective, I agree with your logic, and I’ve definitely seen blazers fans who like the idea."
"question I'm dropping here because i have no intentions of making a post here or in sixers/blazers sub: are fans happy with tobias harris?  does the FO seem happy with tobias harris?  has a CJ for tobi trade ever come up?  from a super casual standpoint it seems reasonable, they're both good players but somewhat overpaid, blazers needs to beef up their forwards while sixers need someone who can run point more traditionally than ben (supposedly CJ can do this).  sixers will have a midget backcourt in seth+CJ but ben and embiid and, i dunno, danny green? are good at defense so it could be alright.  (seth+dame would have been a midget backcourt who were bad at defense as well, anyway and being down ben vs being down tobi is presumably worse for the philly defense.)"
Pistons  1. Derrick Rose  2. Blake Griffin 3. Khris Middleton  4. Tobias Harris 5. Spencer Dinwiddie   Bench: Reggie Jackson
"Is it? When you consider contracts, I think it gets more complicated. For example, I wouldn’t be shocked if a team like the Sixers maybe finds more relative value in protecting Maxey, Curry, and Thybulle over Tobias Harris."
"&gt;	Also, Tobias Harris is a good player, if/when Ben is traded Tobias will increase his role and will help Embiid continue to win games.  oh how i wish this was true lol"
Tobias Harris
Tobias Harris
And Tobias Harris. Not sure how you can average 14/9/4 on 38/28/83 shooting and still get the bag. His 2/13 from 3 in game 4 swung the series.
"we chose the Colangelos over Hinkie... and Al Horford, Tobias Harris, and Brett Brown over Jimmy Butler largely in part due to meddlesome ownership. Thats basically throwing away a championship for no reason which is hard to beat. I thought Dolan stayed in his lane on BBall decisions but i honestly dont know, kinda just thought he was a weirdo"
"This season with good shooters in Danny Green and Seth Curry and playing with Embiid and a Tobias Harris shooting 40% from 3, Simmons averaged 6.9 assists on 3.0 turnovers in 32 minutes a game.   Last season with literally no shooters and offensive weapons on the team, Draymond Green averaged 6.2 assists on 2.3 turnovers per game in 28 minutes per game. Dray is the better playmaker."
"Kawhi needs a more complementary team? Did you not see KD having to leave the thunder to go play with Steph Klay and Draymond??? Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
"He's basically a burnt Tobias Harris, not like he's some superstar that is overlooked.."
"Russ as 85 is fair and accurate.  WTF has Wiggins done to deserve an *85*? That's fringe All-Star level, guys like Tobias Harris and Middleton have previously held that overall.  Wiggins can't lace their boots, he should be what he was in 2K21, an 80."
"no they shouldn’t have traded for him, and if they weren’t going to bring back jimmy on top of him they shouldn’t have brought him back either. they had 38 million in cap space+tobias’ bird rights after they let jimmy walk. they used the space on Horford+Richardson and re upped tobias. literally all 3 were terrible moves  they could have just signed a few good starter level role players for 50 million that offseason or splurged on brogdon in RFA and sent a protected first to milwaukee and then used the rest on a few decent role players. they’d be in such a better situation than right now   it would have been entirely realistic to sign Bojan (ended up with 4/73) Danny Green (ended up with 2/30) and Seth Curry (ended up 4/32) and they still likely would have had space to make additional moves   signing a guy “cause they have to” almost never works out. if another team was gonna pay tobias the max you let him walk. it’s tobias fucking harris.   it was a panic move and it sucks. and it’s an absolutely terrible, incredibly limiting contract to a guy that isn’t all star caliber in a weak conference, who doesn’t even fit with our best player!"
"Fox is my first choice, he was pretty close last year.  Sac won’t be in the playoff race but he’ll stand out enough imo.  Brogdon is my sleeper pick.  If Indiana is healthy they’ll be a decent team though making playoffs in the East is looking pretty tough this year.  I will throw out Tobias Harris as having a chance not on your list just because Philly might still have a great record and the Simmons stuff."
It's a shame too because this entire Simmons drama that's really been a continuation from that Sunday night has made everybody forget about Tobias Harris' underwhelming performance again. Seth filled the gaps but he should not have been the teams 2nd best player if the other guys actually do their job.
Embiid. Sixers will end up losing both Ben and embiid back to back and be left with nothing but Tobias Harris making 40M a year
"If Embiid is hurt, they can try all they want.  Tobias Harris isn’t leading them to the playoffs.  We couldn’t even win game with Ben and Tobias without Embiid."
Tobias Harris plays much better D and gives you ~20ppg at reasonably good efficiency.    I can't see MPJ being dramatically better than Tobias Harris.   Also let's see how good MPJ's efficiency is next season in the absence of Murray
"Curry, Lebron, Lonzo, Lopez, and Tobias Harris. This team would have a crazy offense and solid defense."
"Its already wasted. They went all in on Simmons and Tobias Harris and there's a very tiny chance they can salvage this situation enough where Philly can still be a contender. Even if somehow they traded Ben Simmons for literally a bag of chips, the sixers are still over the cap.  I don't think the Sixers have any room for significant improvement until Harris's contract is up.. and Embiid will be 30 (31?) by then."
Siakam isn't Horford but like Tobias he's a PF that likes to play inside and shoots a low volume of 3's. i would argue having even one of them next to Embiid is not ideal but two would be absolutely disastrous.  &gt;it’s not like the shooting between Embiid Harris and Siakam is going to be worse than Embiid Harris and Simmons  it actually would be because while Simmons doesn't shoot he gets others clean looks. that's why Tobias' 3P% went down from 43% to 29% when Simmons wasn't on the court with him.
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
"Maybe I'm just paranoid because of what happened with Harden, but I feel like Philly is being way too confident in their security with Embiid.   If this drags on in perpetuity, how long before Jo comes to the realization that the easiest way out of this mess is to just leave town himself?  Then the 6ers are stuck with a disgruntled Simmons and Tobias Harris."
"the only thing worse than a max contract player who isnt on the floor for the last 2 minutes of the game is a max player who isnt on the floor at all lol.  with embiid missing his usual 20 games a season ur also going to have tobias harris trying to carry for those games during the regular season  plus simmons contract doesnt run if he doesnt return so this would be permanent, you cant even wait it out lol  and if simmons comes back and pulls a vince carter/ butler x 10 then its actually over bc he gets his money and his contract runs while the sixers get tanked. plus he could get injured. imagine simmons comes back and  tears his achilles? now ur not even getting cj, let alone dame lmao"
Tobias Harris gonna play sf again?😂🤣
I don't think his window is closed I just think he needs another star on his team to win in this current nba landscape. I don't think Tobias Harris or Beasley or Buddy Hield or anyone that is currently available is that star that will elevate the team. Maybe I'm wrong. But it's a star league. I've watched embiid try to close out teams every year in the playoffs by himself and I genuinely just think the guy needs another star who isn't afraid to take over a game
You leave Tobias Harris out of this
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"Meh it seems like Embiid is throwing up shit to Simmons rather than actually saying the right thing.  The Harford sign was because they have Simmons?? So you have a non shooter point forward and you really think that having another bigman would be great? Pure BS here, unless Embiid is really dumb on how basketball works.  They get rid of Jimmy??? When everyone knows it was Jimmy to get rid of them? Lol  The 76ers was a fraud from the get go, the process never worked and Hinkie was the first to poorly built the team. Then Elton Brand make dumb move after dumb move. They had a nice team in 2018, they went close to the ECF without Embiid, they dismantled it. They made bad trade for Tobias Harris and then signed him on superstar level contract for an average good guy. They filled the team without shooters too many big guys and wrong coaching for years.  Now Ben Simmons has become the scapegoat."
Yeah. It seems to be a general symptom of our collective short memory. Maybe a byproduct of the sheer amount of information that flies towards us every waking moment.   But Tobias Harris got *plenty* of shit and I don’t know how people don’t remember that. And he only got less shit after he produced in the playoffs. That isn’t a coincidence.
"Whatever you’re saying about the Miami pick definitely isn’t true because Philly used that pick to trade for Tobias Harris at the deadline that same year.  SGA was a rookie that year and only made All Rookie 2nd team. He was averaging around 10 points on 54 TS% around the trade deadline.   No one was outbidding a Simmons package during the the 18-19 season. He was 22 years old coming off a rookie of the year campaign in which he averaged 16/8/8 and led them to the playoffs on the back of a 16 game win streak, even with Embiid getting injured during it, and led them past Miami as a rookie averaging 18/10/9.  Simmons was being compared to LeBron at this point. This was before his playoff failings and before he would be asked to shoot and refuse to do so. This Simmons was one of the most valuable assets in the league.   Simmons was ranked 8th and 14th in the two trade value columns Bill Simmons did that year. The only reason Simmons wasn’t traded for AD was because Philly truly thought they had LeBron 2.0 on their hands."
"What’s crazy is that sizers could’ve had Joel, butler, Tatum and maybe even Lowry this season and instead they got Joel and Tobias harris"
"Doc Rivers said the Sixers made Tobias Harris sing Hit The Road, Jack to Ben Simmons. They also had dog turd for Simmon's departure. Rivers said both versions of Hit The Road, Jack were sung and it was pretty awesome but they made Ben smirk like a cunt."
Would the Blazers be demanding Danny Green and Tobias Harris?  Lol no.  The trade would probably look like Simmons-Maxey-Thybulle and several picks.  The veteran role players aka the main contributors outside of Embiid would not be on the move.  I don’t see why the Blazers would even want them
"well you might as well go for it as a young player..let the nba talent force you into a being a role player before you just decide to be on...the wizards would love for him to be the next tobias harris, lets see him go for it...i dont think hes on that level but him thinking he is and working towards it, is what young players should always try to aim towards"
Tobias Harris would be the best player on the team right? How many teams have a better 1a + depth?  Nets  Bucks  Hawks  Celtics  Charlotte  Chicago  Knicks  Indy  Heat  Raptors
yeah his name is Tobias Harris
"Toronto could work - but not for Siakam, which has been popular. Does embiid/siakam make markedly more sense than embiid/Simmons? Nah, the sixers need shooting and ball handling back in any Simmons trade. With fillers/draft picks The trade could be:   Raptors get: Simmons, Milton  Sixers get: Fred VV, OG Anunoby   FVV is the exact kind of player who would thrive in Philly - culturally and fit, he’s a marksman with underrated playmaking ability. OG would be a trade piece, further reason to flip Tobias Harris, an upgrade over starting Danny green or a combination of the 3   Toronto gets a revamp centered on Simmons, with siakam helping protect the rim, dragic - crafty enough to be an effective PNR partner with Ben, Gary Trent, and Milton/Barnes. This raises Toronto’s ceiling as a whole, while maintaining flexibility with flippable assets."
"&gt; Rivers shared how he planned to use Simmons this upcoming season anyway: Embiid and Simmons would stagger minutes more often, and when Embiid came off the floor, Simmons would play the 5, sharing the frontcourt with Tobias Harris and new addition Georges Niang.  Does anyone at this point really think the 76ers have a long term game plan with Simmons on the roster? No way is he still on the team after the trade deadline."
"Besides Embiid, the Sixers have Tobias Harris (a serviceable starter), and 3 players that really should be the 6th man on a championship team in Danny Green, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey. I don't see where the Championship level depth is.  Compare that to their competition with the Nets with Harden, Durant and Kyrie and the Bucks with Giannis, Middleton and Holiday. You can pretty easily see that the Sixers aren't contenders this year and won't be unless they get a Middleton/Kyrie level of player back for Simmons, which is looking increasingly unlikely."
"So I've been saying this since we got knocked out. I think we could have made our team work with Ben. Ben can run full court no problem. But after seeing maxey, I think he can honestly play similarly to Trae. He doesn't have his range, but he can pass, hit floaters, he's quick, and he can hit people for alley oops. I always thought we could run maxey at point. Run embiid on a block with curry on the same side as an outlet. Ben and Tobias play as two forwards without any set designation. It wouldn't work if they stand around, but if you have them setting screens for eachother and cutting, you can have ben cutting for an alley oop, and tobais popping. If we go to embiid, then you can add maxey in as a screener weak side. If ben has a play and is cutting to the hoop, he can work well in the offense. Think of it like the warriors, but focused on the dunks and layups.   maxey can hit embiid who can post and pass out to curry. Or he can drive and hit either a cutting ben, an embiid on the block, hit the floater, or kick out to curry or harris.   Similarly, Atl could do this way better with trae"
Embiid didn’t make any shots in a fourth quarter and also went 1-5 in another 4th quarter  Tobias Harris scored only 4 points in the entirety of game 5  Simmons was terrible but he wasn’t the only one with bad performances
"embiid and simmons isn't a perfect fit but the real killer is having tobias harris on a difficult to move contract  philly fans were praising doc during the regular season for ""unlocking tobi"" which basically meant playing him at the 4 and ben at point, but ben is barely a point guard in the halfcourt, and you have three guys who do their best work inside even if embiid and harris are capable shooters"
"I live in a city with no professional sports but ok bud.   You also could have signed Jimmy butler but your team fucked that up, congrats on maxing Tobias Harris and al horford and Ben Simmons though.   Yalls front office clearly sucks, maybe that’s why the good players don’t care to meet/sign with yall?"
Tobias Harris seems pretty smart - at least relative to some of the other players.
"You'll see how much maxing a player like MPJ,Tobias Harris,Wiggins,etc literally cripples a team.   🤷‍♂️"
Yeah but if we boo the players it's generally with all the emotion towards the front office too..but like I said it's harder to boo Josh Harris/Elton brand than Tobias Harris.
"You saw him in each second round right? When TJ McConnell and had to become the PG in back to back seasons? When rookie Maxey had to play over him because he couldn't do anything offensively besides drive and dish?  The Sixers field very competitive defenses and no team has a real answer for the all-time leader in points per minute. Ben shuts down and forces the team to account for anywhere from 5-7 lost points per game on a team whose second best option is Tobias Harris.  They are both extremely talented (despite what the idiots say) and amazing defenders so they'll never be garbage, but it's about the next level. Ben doesn't step up to that and Embiid could really use a lead guard that actually complements him offensively.   I get your point, but you're telling me a floor spacing guard isn't a more ideal partner for Embiid than the only non shooting lead ball handler in the league?"
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
Him playing as center means he has to big body in the post/fight for boards with guys like Embiid. You can’t see how for someone as frail as AD how that might be more risky than doing the same to like Tobias Harris
"They misspelled Tobias Harris name as Tobian Harris. The disrespect.  ""*His Sixers teammates, including high profile Joel Embiid, Tobian Harris and Matisse Thybulle – were willing to jump on a plane to go and convince their lost star to return*."""
How many hypothetical Tobias Harris' would it take to trade for Lebron. Does a full team of Tobi make it worth it? 12 Tobi's ?
"Serious question, who would win, LBJ + 4 G-Leaguers or 5 Tobias Harris"
Simmons and Embiid is a great duo. They just totally fucked up the rest of the roster.   They were a crazy bounce in game 7 away from going to OT with the eventual champions with Butler. Then for some unknown reason they spent tons of money on Al Horford and Tobias Harris. Imagine if they stayed patient and flexible and traded for Harden last season instead…
He's in that CJ McCollum tier. He's a fine player.  He's also not unplayable in the playoffs. He's unplayable in the playoffs on a team with Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris. There's a huge difference between those two statements.
"You're right, his scoring is that bad huh.   It makes complete sense that he's behind Embiid, and also understandable to be behind Butler... but being behind Tobias Harris and Seth Curry is laughably bad for a player of his caliber."
"Also has to do with the impact of players. In basketball you have 5 guys on the court and the ball is only in 1 of their hands. In Football, 2 good players is often just as good as 1 great player. In basketball you’d rather have 1 Lebron James than 5 Tobias Harris’, etc"
"Not Tobias Harris, old ass Al Horford to a max contract lmfao"
Sixers front office swapped out jimmy butler for Tobias Harris to keep Ben fucking Simmons happy lmao
"Never seen Tobias harris, Jcole, and Javale McGee in the same room, just saying"
"Yet they licked their chops at Al ""Embiid Stoppa' Horford and Tobias ""Inconsistent"" Harris."
But it WAS Ben’s fault mostly  Yeah the other players had bad moments too (Tobias harris is making way to much money) but the one who was the most consistently awful in the fourth on offense all series long was Ben. Having your starting point guard not being able to Handle the ball in the four IS the reason they lost.
"Not with the way the NBA exists now.  For some teams, yes, but I said 4th and 5th because you have teams like Bucks, Sixers, Nets, Lakers, Bulls, Jazz etc that have 3 borderline all-stars.  Like, for the Knicks/Cavs/Mavs, the 3rd man would be the correct spot to judge, but you can’t look at guys like Jrue, Russ, Gobert/Clarkson, MPJ or Tobias Harris and call them an “average starter” while maintaining brain cells."
id take those assets and the max cap slot over tobias harris asap
"CJ would be that iso player to get them buckets, especially in the playoffs. It’s been evident during the last few years that they need a bucket getter. Tobias Harris is too unreliable.  Idk why Morey is stalling and asking for a kings ransom. The CJ trade makes the most sense for both teams. Morey is just being an asshole and continuing to handle this poorly. Prolonging it is making it messy for everyone including the 6ers"
"It's still the same fundamental problem as before. Embiid still eats our centers but outside of that, they struggle in offense. Tobias Harris? Meh. Like 20 or something. Still underwhelming. But then they still get nothing out of Richardson and horford and their other role players.   And if you need to see how we played Ben Simmons in the playoffs, see 2016/2017. Possibly the year after. The Covington/Saric year. Where he was ineffective. Left alone on the perimeter to double Embiid while their 3/4 added little as well."
"Offtopic: what a weird way to describe who was going. ""Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Matisse Thybulle and most of the team"". Why not just say ""Most of the team"", or ""Sixers players""?"
"The Heat pick looked a lot better at the time. It lost significant value after it was confirmed that it wouldn't be in the double draft, but it still should have been able to get something better than the right to overpay Tobias Harris."
Agreed Tobias Harris is a bum in the 4th
"&gt;He's taken 2 less shots per game than he did his rookie year and every other number is equal.  I mean, you have to consider some context for this. His rookie year he didn't have MVP level Embiid and Tobias Harris taking shots from him."
"&gt; The core leaders on the 76ers — such as Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris and Matisse Thybulle — and most of the team were set to take a jet to see Simmons before being turned away, sources said. Multiple sources said Simmons didn’t want his teammates, some of whom he considers friends, to make the Philadelphia-to-Los Angeles commute out of courtesy because he won’t change his mind on wanting a trade.  It's nice of you to not have them waste their time, but at least give them a chance Ben"
"Im thinking Beasley, Beverley, McDaniels and 3 first rounders. That'd give them 2 two way players, a solid shooter and some picks to go out and find the last pieces.  In addition they'll have the ability to put some mean shooting line ups around Embiid, it should be way easier to get Thybulle and Maxey consistent minutes and they still have Tobias Harris around to be a secondary shot creator.  It's not flashy, but it just feels *nice*. They'd be running a very balanced and competent rotation with 3 picks in the bank."
Anyone could’ve been an all star playing next to Embiid. Even Tobias Harris
"I mean, embiid would be far and away the best player Dame has ever had.   And Tobias Harris is relatively comparable to the guy that's been Dames #2 for half a decade"
"The regular season means nothing, nitwit. His performance took a hit in the playoffs, this is the scenario were these players show their true colors. And like I said, a 17/6, it does not justify his contract. But again, if Denver doesn't pay, someone else will pay (most likely another small market).. and there it is, another overpayed athlete in the NBA. Why Porter should strive to get better, strength his body to avoid injury and so on... if his money is guaranteed? That's my point, the players are overly protected. I don't care about him, I am not a fan, much less so a ""hater"" (everything is considered ""hate"" in the internet), he is just another example among many. You want another example, how about Tobias Harris? The Sixers were literally afraid to lose a capable player (guess what, Tobias enters free agency, a small market team will overpay to keep him), the guy never got better and he has a guaranteed contract all the way to the 2023-24 season. The Sixers can't cut him, they can't trade because Tobias has a insane salary, etc.. too much leverage for these players, that's my point all along"
"Well I was comparing him Barrett to Wiggins based on size and position that they play. Also they have a similar style of play good slashers and “ok” jump shooters. I also said I can see Barrett being a Tobias Harris level player. But argue with me if you must.....I actually forgot both of them were from the same region, lol"
"I’m a Knicks fan and follow the team though, lol. Barrett is in his 3rd season and he has gotten better but is no way ready to be a center point in any winning team offense. Barrett ceiling at this point is Tobias Harris. I was hoping for a Jaylen Brown type ceiling this year but his shot is still not consistent enough."

"Bro here are the players that might not even be top 50 players right now(or at least it’s close):  Tobias Harris, Lonzo Ball, Clint Capela.  I don’t know how you can think Donte has that kind of upside."
"At best for that package, you’re getting like a Tobias Harris or CJ Mccollum level player. Why in the world would the Mavs trade all their picks for that? Their picks are literally the only way they can add talent now because no one signs in Dallas. If your long term goal for Luka is to win a championship rather than get to the second round this year, it’s a bad trade idea."
"Wizards got to dump Wall, who was an equivalently bad contract and also perennially injured.  At least Westbrook plays.  He's tradable for another bad contract, I just have a tough time seeing who.  Depending on what happens with Simmons and what type of player they get back for him, Tobias Harris would be interesting - good fit for Lakers.  For Philly it gets out from Tobias deal (which is a year longer than Westbrook's), and it gives them a ball handler assuming they don't get one back for Simmons."
"So, a budget Tobias Harris?"
"Jimmy becomes a league top five 2-way player. In his final Bulls year, they sign Rondo. Rondo would outlet to Jimmy at least once a game. Jimmy and Wade have a chance at teammates triple double, but Felicio steals Wade's needed rebound in the game's closing moments. 3-5 eastern teams vying for last 2-3 playoffs spots during the penultimate regular season games. Bulls go up 2-0 against Celtics, then Rondo injured.  Jimmy heads to Wolves = sp00ky. Western conference 2 seed before all star break. Jimmy opts out of all star game to rest. Jimmy gets injured and Wolves become fringe playoff team. 3rd stringers. Bounced in 1st round while Rondo helps lead NOP to sweep the Blazers.  Jimmy to 6ers. Ninja headband Bros. Kendall Jenner. Embiid enjoys stomping Wolves with Jimmy on the team. Tobias Harris. Is Jimmy rocking sandals while hitting a 3pt game winner? 4 bounces off of a top spin basketball fade  Time for vacation? Top teams in the league quietly losing to the Heat. COVID. Big face coffee. Dribbling heard late at night in Gran Destino room. Miami's in the Finals! Bam touch fouls early in 1st quarter game 1. Dragon goes down. Bam goes down. Jimmy has a 40 pt triple double in the Finals??? Nothing left in the tank without the other team leaders.  Bubble fluke? Solid Heat regular season. Bucks get Jrue and PJ. Giannis avenges bubble loss and clamps Jimmy. Bam is quieted by big man Brook. Sweep...  We're early into 2021-22 season... Let's not jinx anything  But speaking of Wolves, Anthony Edwards"
"Pure ecstasy. Also, Tobias Harris has been a monster on both sides of the court this season. His defense has been stellar"
I will not tolerate this Tobias Harris slander
Nope. It’s Tobias Harris. Try again.
"That's Tobias ""better PER than Tatum"" Harris thank you very much."
This is just average Tobias Harris. Every day stuff.   Please believe this Houston.
You just got boomed by Tobias Harris
Who the fuck is this and what has he done with Tobias Harris???
Especially the guy who thinks the 76ers will trade Tobias Harris for Harden.
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
Yes and no. Is he LeBron? Nah. Is he a solid two-way player? Yes. I'd take him over Tobias Harris and DeVonte Graham for instance.
Yeah people trashed Tobias Harris' contract and now look...
"Absolutely not, Will Barton &gt; Tobias Harris"
ok. Now do Tobias Harris to continue jacking off
Tobias Harris
"It's actually [this pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9qunc/is_the_unprotected_2021_miami_heat_draft_pick_the/)  From another link but this breaks down where the pick traveled succinctly.  &gt;The Heat first dealt it in 2015 to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragic. Three years later, the Suns sent the pick to the 76ers for the right to move up and select Mikal Bridges on draft night 2018. The 76ers then shipped it to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a package for Tobias Harris. The Clippers, of course, traded it to OKC as one of five first-rounders in the Paul George deal."
but hey the miami pick u also got in the trade was considered one of the most valuable picks in the league at the time. you even managed to get Tobias Harris with the pick and a lot more
Man I remember the first time I heard Tobias Harris' actual voice and  it sounded like J.Cole's. I was confused
“Tobias Harris out for the entire first round due to heavy traffic near the Betsy Ross”
"Damn, they really sent Tobias Harris to the BAL. I though he was ballin for the 6ers"
Different person. This one’s the black tobias harris.
"Jokic has also never had the talent embiid has had. Embiid literally had 3 other all stars caliber players besides himself. One of those players being jimmy butler who carried the heat to the finals as a first option not soon after. Given that talent it’s honestly laughable embiid didn’t make the finals much less the conference finals.    I mean a team consisting of jimmy butler, Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons could make the second round in the East WITHOUT embiid."
How is Tobias Harris able to play in the NBA and BAL at the same time?
"The 2019 Sixers were talented but had fit issues as well. They were overall much more talented than Toronto, but Toronto's roster fit way better together. This impacted their talent, Embiid was not fully ready yet, and their coaching wasn't great which all made that team not quite as good as we'd believe (even if still really good).   Embiid averaged 17.6 ppg on 4 turnovers, 3 assists, and 37% from the field in the Toronto series opposite Gasol. Tobias Harris averaged 14.0 ppg on 38% from the field and 29% from 3. Simmons averaged 11-7-5 for the series and was relegated to an off-ball role and spacing liability next to Jimmy on offense for much of the series.  Are we sure that team was better than the 2011 Thibadeau-led Bulls who went 62-20, had the 1st seed, and MVP Rose, Noah, Gibson, Boozer, and Deng in a very slow era pace-wise? If everyone on the Sixers had realized their potential and the scheme/fit had been ironed out then that's very possible, but that had not happened yet."
Every active player to have ever worn the number 12 for Orlando will be playing in the same game!  Dwight Howard  Tobias Harris  Gary Clark  Sindarius Thornwell
Tobias Harris nods enthusiastically
"Tobias Harris would have to play and go 2/2 from 3 and like ~18/18 from FT (didn’t do the exact math on the FT but it’s a lot) to get 50/40/90 lmao. A tough ask, very proud of how close Tobi got though."
Need Tobias Harris to hit like 18 free throws in a row to join the 50/40/90 club
"Yup, when you’re scoring 0.9 points per possession and have no other real star scorers (no, Tobias fucking Harris doesn’t count) you’re just gonna get overwhelmed. Double teamed Embiid post-ups aren’t gonna get your far against James Harden and Kevin Durant isos."
This is so stupid.   Hinkie would never have made the moves necessary to get the Sixers here. Simmons would have been traded years ago. They never would have signed Tobias Harris.   Embiid is great; Hinkie is not.
"Realistically, who could the Blazers get in return for CJ? Tobias Harris?"
I have tried my hardest to think of a trade that makes sense and can’t. Tobias Harris is one of the only decently realistic ones but he’s been great for them this year and they’d had to fail hard in the playoffs. I think really that’s what we need to happen. A team to need change after a playoff failure
This either means that Tobias Harris will win finals mvp or that the Sixers should have kept Jimmy.
Tobias Harris or Sous Seth Curry as FMVP confirmed
That’s correct! And he’s also the brother of Tobias Harris.
They could have done way better than Tobias Harris for 3 first round picks and a max salary slot.
"Are you dumb? Mo Bamba managed to hold Embiid to 13, but even then, the Magic are so bad and they can't handle Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Shake Milton. Hell they even let Mike Scott get 8 pts.  Why would one mediocre player make a huge difference?"
"Yeah I’m not expecting him to be able to maintain such a high level of volume and efficiency consistently going forward but I’m cautiously optimistic about a long term improvement in his  finishing to some extent going forwards.   Despite the ups and downs, he’s brought his overall efficiency up to 68.2 for the year. He’s right about where Doncic is (.4 less) on about 15% lower volume and is higher in both measures than Butler, KAT, Tobias Harris, Steph, CP3, and Trae among others.  And the small number of games is somewhat less worrisome to me given the sample size of his shots. He made as many shots post all star break as Harden did all year and more than all of  Mitchell, Paul George, Ingram, Trae, Middleton, and Myles Turner. He’s actually made four times the number of field goals since the break as CP3 has made all season and on better efficiency whether you’re considering his percentage for the second half of or the whole season.  We’ll see though. Hot streaks are still a thing and I’m not making any conclusions yet besides the fact that he had a good season from there and an excellent second half."
Tobias Harris started his career on the bucks.
Battle of Tobias Harris and Russ. Who will lose first.
"Seeing Tobias Harris fail to backdown Ish Smith multiple times was comical. Also once Danny Green drives inside, you know your offense is short handed."
Tobias Harris the half court playmaker
"Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, RoCo, JJ Redick, Saric, Richardson, Thybulle, Dwight.......and also some guy named Joel Embiid  Like, I'm sure Dallas has had some nice pieces but it's not comparable"
"I've seen people talk about trading CJ for Tobias Harris, and to that I say nope"
Tobias harris
Tobias Harris
"That's on the teams too.  Remember Blake signed his contract with the Clippers who assured him they were keeping him, only to flip him for assets.  They then turned those assets (Tobias Harris who was then traded for picks) into Paul George.  &amp;#x200B;  It cuts both ways.  Organizations can give up on players, go back on their word, lie, cheat, whatever and the players are fucked.  Like look at how Joe Harris bounced around in his early days.  Is it good for the league to treat young talent like trash when they're injured?  &amp;#x200B;  Teams do the contractual minimum unless it helps them to do more.  Players do the same.  Both are culpable in forming super teams.  And yeah, that's a risk you take by trading for a player who doesn't want to be there and never signed a contract expecting to be there."
Tobias Harris?
Tobias Harris is an All Star in Scott Bricks eyes
A lot of dumb people thought KD would come back at Tobias Harris level also.
its straight up wrong. Why do you think serious NBA analysts make fun of reddit experts? Go listen to Nekias and Steve Jones (Snapper Jones son and coach) talk about the game and they dont even mention anything other than Tobias Harris getting abused on 1-4 PnRs. Nowhere do they act like Simmons was the problem or even mention it because it wasn't accurate. You're clowning yourself for karma which is pathetic.
"CJ has 3 years left at $100million. He scores 23 ppg on 40% from deep on 9 attempts per game and is a super underrated passer. He makes significantly less these next three years than Tobias Harris and would fill an absolute glaring need for Philly as a perimeter creator, shooter, and scorer. His contact is not horrible."
"Why would Philly give up more? CJ is is a decent player but his contract is horrible, not even sure they could do this trade without moving Tobias Harris. The team needing to give more here is Portland."
He’s extremely useful but on a team when the second best scorer is Tobias Harris then it’s a real problem.
"Clippers defense sucked ass and Luka regularly torched them. And no Paul George did not play like an All NBA player. Look at who made all NBA last year, the only one who pg13 is better than is Pascal siakam and that's because siakam regressed and his team didn't do as well this year. Paul George is more like Tobias Harris these days than first team all NBA Paul George, and honestly I think Tobias Harris might be better."
Isn’t Tobias Harris their second option
Is Tobias Harris more important to us than Ben Simmons?  Scoring isnt *that* important
"I can't agree with this more.   I'll use Detroit as an example since that's one of the two teams I follow closest.   Between 2008 and 2015, we literally had seven different coaches.   That's an average of one per year.  That was the end of the 'contending' phase and the first five year of the rebuild.  Since the rebuild began, we had a lot of solid young talent come in and brought in some free agents. We had Chris Middleton, and Greg Monroe, and Andre Drummond and Josh Smith. Brandon Jennings. Tobias Harris. Morris. Caldwell-Pope. Reggie Jackson. Kennard.  Ilyasova.    I'm certainly not making a case that any combination of those guys was going to be winning a championship.  But when young guys like Middleton, Harris, Drummond, and Monroe come in, and show some real potential, but then they get jerked around form one coach to another. One coach has Monroe run plays (effectively) out of the post, the next give Jennings the ball without (big mistake), it just established this turnstile of losing.  Young guys just trying to get there to get a pay day. No cohesion.   That's why I appreciate that teams like the Sixers, even though they got rid of Brett Brown, took the time to bring a player development guy in and just gave him 5 or 6 years without question."

"yeah CJ's value gets underrated (maybe not by a lot, but by some margin) due to his defensive deficiencies and some playoff no-shows. But he's still a very good player with a modern skillset and it's no coincidence he's been part of top-tier offenses with Portland. He's a guard who can create his own shot and shoots 9 threes a game at 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? In a league where shooting efficiency is more important than ever, that's still valuable, even if it comes in a package that's not built to be a defender. Peep the advanced stats - they still paint CJ as a very solid, positive player (and not as bad on defense as fans make him out to be). The problem is that he may not fit well next to Dame.  A few trade targets I see:  * Jimmy Butler — would require many additional assets and is 100% contingent on whether the Heat want to pay Butler a massive contract. Very likely they will. Jimmy would be a great complement to Dame as a secondary ball handler and defender, but CJ's volume 3pt shooting would be missed. * Jerami Grant — would require some additional assets and contingent on Detroit looking to flip a player they for value. Grant is still somewhat unproven. He turned into an offensive creator in Detorit and after a hot start saw his efficiency dip, as well as his defense. But he has solid size, a varied skillset, and generates 6+ FTAs, something Portland lacks outside Dame. Blazers could bet on him taking another step by becoming more effecient as a second option. * Tobias Harris + Matisse Thybulle — 76er fans will probably instantly nix the inclusion of Thybulle. That's fair. But it could be a very attractive package for Portland, and would be worth additional assets to bring in a complementary scorer and versatile defender. A third team may need to get involved to provide value to Philly. * Kristaps Porzingis + Josh Richardson — call me crazy, but I think KP has become a distressed asset whose potential is actually underrated. The Mavs let Luka go full Harden-ball, leaving his teammates standing like statues beyond the arc. (That's fine, Luka's good enough to justify that). But skilled bigs require more creativity to use and the Mavs showed no interest in getting KP involved through DHOs (something Portland loves), elbow face ups (where KP's height can really shine) or screening actions (another Blazer fave). This move is a big gamble, but Portland has kept its powder dry for years. Time to take a swing. If it misses, it means Dame time has run out. But that window is closing anyway."
You aren’t even close to Tobias Harris
"embiid carried? i know he missed 19 games but his team's record didn't tank and they were the 1st seed. we jus gon forget that simmons is on his team, who made the all star game this year and there's tobias harris who nearly averaged 20 ppg. his team wasn't full of scrubs ya know"
the new Tobias Harris
"It solidifies the idea that defense is so hard to measure. Sure you know who the naturally bad and good defenders are, but there are guys that look way better defensively than they actually are because of the system and talent around them.   Look at Tobias Harris this year, he’s an above average defender now. Or that Jokic isn’t looking like the worst defensive center anymore."
he will never be an all star. simply put rj doesnt have a go to move. at best his career will be current tobias harris
Inb4 he has a good season next year and everyone forgets all the shit they were talking about him just like Tobias Harris.
"All the smart NBA media was crowning them as the champions in the summer of 2019 and talking about how deep they were as though they didn't lose SGA, Gallinari and Tobias Harris. Personally I was satisfied by last season's embarrassment and now I've been warming to them a little bit bc I think they're underrated now and r/NBA hates when they win and I hate r/NBA."
Tobias Harris or CJ maybe?
Imagine Luka with a second star even in the Tobias Harris and Khris Middleton tier... Man the Mavs gotta figure out some way to move Kristaps
Well there's your issue. You're paying him a max to be a third scoring option lol. Also relying on Tobias Harris to be the second scoring option is also not a recipe for success but it is what it is.
"Who said he's the second option? Tobias Harris is clearly the second option - no one (except maybe people who don't watch the Sixers) think of Ben as someone who's supposed to be the second option. Assuming you mean ""second scoring option"" which is how people use that term. Ben is more in the Jason Kidd / Rajon Rondo mold, except huge."
My favourite CJ trade is Tobias Harris. Win-win for both teams imo.
Doc has to play Tobias Harris with second unit.
"Lol @ tobias Harris ""arguably should have been an all star"" in a game with Trae young, fuck these announcers"
Tobias Harris should've been an all star and yet Trae Young was snubbed completely.  Trae Young will also not make an All NBA team as well.
Wow does Tobias Harris not know how to execute a fast break? Two in a row and he just looked clueless
"philly defense is pretty good, but you can't win a championship with tobias harris as your second best offensive player. too reliant on embiid"
"In terms of talent, idk. In terms of fit, my only thought is Tobias Harris. Also overpaid and that trade actually might make sense on both sides. Otherwise we have to hope that the clips lose early and want to move on from PG (obviously not a straight up trade) or maybe if the Pels want to win now they would consider trading Ingram (also obviously not straight up)"
If 76ers go with a bench unit without Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons in the second half that is probably the most concerning thing going forward. They got crushed in the bench fight and the strategy seemed to rely on Maxey becoming Lebron to keep them afloat
Imagine seeing Young do this for almost two quarters and still keeping Tobias Harris on him.
I’d like to see what he can do if a coach decides to put a real defender on him rather than Tobias Harris.
Tobias “Brick” Harris at it again
"Anyone with a brain knee sixers weren’t shit, yeah good luck with Tobias harris being your second option"
"It's almost like years and years of ""Trust the Process"", coupled with paying Tobias Harris a fuck ton of money, not using Jimmy Butler to his max potential while he was there, and an over reliance on Embiid/Simmons, but Simmons not playing like a #1, is not a recipe for success."
"NBA coaches make life so easy for Young. Philly has Simmons and Thybille, and they put Tobias Harris on him. Astronomically dumb."
Hmmm tobias Harris pre game  outfit
Like that video of the guy who ran into Tobias Harris in the elevator. So fucking douchey
"The defense isn't even the issue. It's the bench + Tobias unit that Doc insists on leaving on the court and playing every single game despite the fact that they straight up come in and lose all the momentum and blow at least half the lead before Doc finally pulls them.  George Hill, Shake/Maxey, Matisse, Tobias, Howard  The line up is abysmal on both sides of the floor. Their shit play means Embiid has to play big minutes and then when crunch time roles around he's burnt the fuck out from carrying the team on his back the whole game.  When Embiid isn't scoring we have no offense. Embiid being the primary threat makes the offense click. Curry took some of the burden off of him but in the end, you'll never win games when you have literally 2 people score in the 2nd half.  Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris should be embarrassed."
Tobias Harris had one bad game and now some of y'all are acting like he's a scrub
"Simmons is what he is offensively.  I don't really think his level of play was a factor.  That's just his offensive skill level showing up.   The bigger factor though was that Tobias Harris had an absolute stinker and made costly mistake after costly mistake. By the end, the 76ers basically just tried to force it to Embiid who, unsurprisingly, given his health and size, wasn't that effective after playing 40 minutes.    Also, it's clear that the Hawks bench is far, far superior to the 76ers bench. The 76ers just don't have enough offensive options to support Embiid."
"scapegoat things indeed. don't get me wrong, Ben lacks aggression and hasn't improved at anything but defense, but Tobias Harris is making more in a year than Michael Jordan ever did. lol"
You could probably get Tobias Harris...wait ...nm
"Tobias Harris had a horrendous game, god the fans are going to be shitting on him all offseason if they lose this series..  &amp;#x200B;  Also - Thybulle and Simmons: 62 minutes and 14 points, that is bad, like really really bad"
"Tobias Harris scored less points, shot statistically worse from the free throw line (0%), and makes even MORE money than Simmons."
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up.  LMAO  Markus Howard for Seth Curry straight up.
"This one isn’t on him. Tobias Harris and Ben both sucked. He can’t make their shots for them. If Ben Simmons is even a 50% free throw shooter, they win."
Tobias Harris has barely done anything this series when he's being guarded by Bogi the majority of the time. I know the Sixers want to dump the ball to Embiid the entire game and have him ISO but maybe that's why it seems as if he gets tired near the 4th. Why is Tobias Harris paid this much but not get any plays called for him? It's not like he's a scrub. I don't understand the Sixers org.
"Tobias Harris is likely the second best player on the 76ers , and I know Simmons gets his fair share of blame but Tobias has played fucking amazing all season and is a legitimate second option. Apparently only when playing for Doc though, so who knows."
I’d rather have Tobias Harris or Seth Curry in the playoffs than Ben
"I’m on record saying I wanted Nate McMillan as 76ers coach when Indiana let him go (which I have no idea why they did??)   We need a closer, like a real one. Embid much like Shaq is not a closer by himself.   Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up."
The Hawks started targeting Seth Curry on defense in the third. He was abysmal on that end. Embiid also seems to be falling apart in the second half of games now. Tobias Harris and Simmons were unspectacular. Bench didn't give them much either.
"I agree, Ben Simmons is not and probably will never be a superstar, as in building a team around him, hell i woulf rather build a team around tobias harris"
"Yeah, the 4's in the playoffs are Jae Crowder, Marcus Morris, Royce O'neal, Tobias Harris, John Collins, Giannis, and Durant. Basically just small forwards or tweeners.   Maybe a few years ago with someone like LMA playing the 4 it would be a problem, but not so much these days"
"Right, but the point is your 4th or 5th best player put up a terrific offensive game, yet your 2nd and 3rd don't show up. You can't have that. If Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons put up 5 more points together, they win. They didn't even combine for either of their regular season averages this game, which is mind boggling. Both those guys wasted one of Seth's career games.  I guess my point is, yes, Seth can put up numbers like a top option, but when your 2nd/3rd options put up numbers worse than role players, you can't win."
"Yeah but Tobias Harris and Simmons could’ve had an absolute fantastic game but the way Curry was playing, he was probably gonna be the second best player no matter what today."
Tobias Harris  * MINS 38 * PTS 4 (2/11FG) (0/0FT) * REB 4 * AST 3  * \+/-   -10  Ben Simmons  * MINS 38 * PTS 8 (2/4FG) (4/14FT) * REB 4 * AST 9 * \+/-   +7
"Man, that Tobias Harris guy is pretty good. 36m to be a fraud."
Sixers are choke artist... Doc rivers record says he is who he is... Ben Simmons is disrespectful towards any D 2 or G league or guy u know around the way who never got a chance in the league because they were passed over for a guy who refuses/can't shoot... Tobias Harris is robbing the sixers blind and ATL just wanted it more. Had nothing to lose and played like Dawgs who were starving. Wow. Another atomic collapse and another great game 7 💯
"A lot of the blame will rightfully be on Simmons h but I want to shine a spotlight on Tobias Harris and his inability to to hit a fucking layup. Dude is soft as hell going to the rim, and it cost them bad."
"Losing a Game 7 where the opposing team's typically hyper-efficient and best player goes 5/23 from the field is baffling.   Atlanta's balanced offense truly saved them today. Definitely helps that Tobias Harris missed more easy layups and dunks than I've ever seen, plus whatever Simmons was doing out there."
"man tobias harris shot like shit, if he shared some shots with curry they woulda won for sure"
Still Tobias Harris. He’s a great player.... but not 40m/year great.
Tobias Harris who got $180 million was 8-24 from the floor
Joel Embiid... You trash  Tobias Harris... You trash.  Ben Simmons.. Ben Simmons listen to me when I say this: You are trash.
Tobias Harris is under contract for 3 more years in which he will be making $35M+ each year. That is all.
[YOOO JUST COPPED THE NEW TOBIAS HARRIS JERSEY](https://i.imgur.com/qOGyc0B.jpg)
"Philly gotta blow it up and trade Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris, embarrassing series by a supposed Eastern Conference powerhouse. Morey gotta be kicking himself for not trading Simmons for Harden"
If you distilled this entire series down to one play it was that Ben Simmons pass under the basket to Tobias Harris.
"Danny Green could've turned this series around but he got hurt. With him on the floor I don't think Huerter could've played this well, he literally feasted on Seth alone all game   Also Morey can't make Ben improve his offense, prevent Tobias Harris from playing like shit in a clutch game, and also can't force other teams to accept his offers"
Tobias Harris should not be playing professional basketball in America after this year
lets go back to tanking. it was more enjoyable than watching Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris screw up everything while Doc Rivers claps his way to a 4th consecutive game 7 loss.
"Yeah but the situation he came into wasn’t great. ben Simmons al horford and Tobias Harris all had max contracts, he had very little to work with"
Hard to blame him when Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris exist
TOBIAS HARRIS AND BEN SIMMONS PLAYING FOR THE SHARKS NEXT YEAR🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kevin Huerter or Tobias Harris?
Well goodbye Ben Simmons goodbye Tobias Harris
Reminder that Tobias Harris missed an uncontested dunk and threw gimme layups.

HOW can Tobias Harris have 20 pts. Looks like he missed every shot
"tobias harris seriously just jogged out to trae at halfcourt, and just let him go right by lol"
"If Philly loses this, it's probably on Tobias Harris. He missed like 8 easy, very makeable buckets through the whole game."
"Tobias Harris: Thanks for taking for making everyone look at you and not me, dude."

Tobias Harris is a max player
Tobias Harris &amp; Ben Simmons pick up their checks with ski masks every 2 weeks
"I want Philly to win, but I don’t think they will. 2 points a half from Ben Simmons isn’t going to make this easy.  Basically they’re relying on Tobias Harris to have an above average game, and Seth Curry helping Embiid backpack them."
Tobias Harris is really a fraud. He making bank doe
Lmao everyone is overrating the bucks and the bucks players because they BARELY beat a nets team with Harden and Kyrie injured lol.   Middleton is good though but I still don’t think he’s a good enough #2 to win a ring. That being said it’s open game this year because of injuries and he can outplay tobias Harris so he should be given that due.
"What's up guys, my name's Tobias Harris and today we're gonna be sending a basketball into orbit."
tobias harris is such a choking idiot
tobias harris really fucking sucks
TOBIAS HARRIS IS ABSOLUTE ASS
Tobias Harris or timo Werner?
Why does Tobias Harris look like the out of shape guy that joins your team to play 5 v 5 at the local YMCA
Tobias “cost 30m” too much harris
Wait Tobias Harris plays for the Sixers? I thought he was still in Clippers haha
Harris as in Tobias Harris?  What planet are you watching games on?
Tobias Harris looks like a poor mans J Cole
Does Tobias Harris have any clue how good he is? I've never seen to many contested shots go in.
"Curry in early foul trouble, the Sixers are in deep shit now because Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons have to play basketball"
I’ll give you 50 that I think are at least arguable. These aren’t ranked and I don’t necessarily think every one of these guys is better but I can see how others might. Let me know if you see repeated names.  1. Steph 2. Beal 3. Dame 4. Embiid 5. Giannis 6. Luka 7. Lavine 8. Zion 9. Kd 10. Kyrie 11. Tatum 12. Mitchell 13. Jokic 14. Booker 15. Trae 16. Fox 17. Lebron 18. Kawhi 19. Kat 20. Jaylen 21. Harden 22. Ingram 23. Shai 24. Vucevic 25. Pg 26. Davis 27. Westbrook 28. DeMar 29. Butler 30. Siakam 31. Jamal Murray 32. Brogdon 33. Middleton 34. Sabonis 35. Hayward 36. Tobias harris 37. Ja 38. Mpj 39. Bam 40. Jrue 41. Collins 42. Lowry 43. CP3 44. Bogdan 45. Conley 46. Lamelo 47. Capela 48. Ayton 49. Sexton 50. Myles Turner
"Never made sense to me either. Supposedly Zhaire Smith had a similar profile/expectations as Bridges and they got an extra draft pick. They used that in a trade to get Tobias Harris. At the time, nobody expected Smith to have a nearly fatal reaction to a sesame seed."
"I hate how people try to compare Khris with Tobias Harris. Like I can't remember a time Khris was so ass in a game and ended up with only 4 points, yet somehow Tobi flies under the radar"
"At least this current series for Doc I think is a little unwarranted.  Embiid is hurt and there’s really no way you can replace that production so now he’s on the court playing poorly.  Ben Simmons is just too much of a late game liability and still can’t score outside of like 10ft.  Tobias Harris, as much as I love him, just can’t carry as much of the offensive load he basically needs to make up for the two stars before him.  And unlike Bud on the Bucks Nate actually makes adjustments and capitalized on mismatches.  Not much Doc can do this series if the 3 best players all got issues going on."
He had 20 PPG last year. Tobias Harris got a contract with the last year at 41m.
Except he got traded for Tobias Harris before the Sixers ever made the playoffs. The other two are legit though.
"Bullshit, Suns have no one to guard Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris"
Joe harris acting like hes tobias rn
Holiday with what I like to call the Tobias Harris Special
"This is essentially the sixers’ peak, given that Joel is a 300 pound big man with injury issues and they are capped out because their FO decided to pay 38 million a year to Ben Simmons and Tobias harris for the next 4 seasons.   The results of this “peak” is the sixers struggling to beat a hawks team with 0 all stars and 2 of their best wings injured.  If you see a way that the sixers get better from here, I’m all ears, but you can’t say that they have a better future than the Celtics when the sixers probably have the bleakest future of any eastern conference team barring maybe the pacers."
"This is what annoys me the most about playing Trae, it's not a sleight on him, he's a great player but it seems like he's getting regular season calls and everybody else gets playoff calls.   Go watch any of Tobias Harris' drives in this series and tell me how he's not getting calls when you cross reference the calls Trae is getting.  Embiid is getting soft calls too but he's also banging down low and not getting anything some possessions.    Overall the officiating has been crazy inconsistent in this series."
He was hacked up and down the floor dude. And Trae young got 3 free throws when Tobias harris didn't touch him at all but he fell over. Not to mention on the double techs embiid was pushed in the back by Trae and of course Trae gets nothing. I'm not arguing embiid doesn't sell contact but it's so much more egregious on Youngs part. I'm not a hater btw. I respect the hustle. I just wish the league would address the inconsistency.
"If you replaced a max player with a supermax player, yes, that team would get better.  I also think replacing Tobias Harris with Paul George or Kawhi Leonard would make the Sixers better.  Brave, I know."
"He arches his back and throws his arms up then immediately looks to the nearest ref, all because the defender came around a screen and brushed the back of Trae's jersey. Tobias Harris got called for 2 of those last night, drove me nuts."
"What's not to complain? Max contract first pick pg scared shitless to shoot and unplayable down the stretch because he will just get sent to the line and miss the free throw. MVP candidate super prone to injury playing half injured for a full series, most likely won't last for game 7 and the eastern conference finals even if they win. Tobias Harris sucking when it matters the most. A coach who blew two 3-1 leads and in general, overrated and insanely unlucky.   Oh and they're losing to the hawks. This series should've been over 2 games ago."
