brandon clarke and eric paschall are two obvious choices
god I‚Äôd let Eric Paschall bully me if he wanted
It‚Äôs CP3 for me. Seeing him go from dunking on Dwight Howard to struggling to get past Eric Paschall has been rough. People forget how athletic young CP3 was.

"‚ÄúaaaaAaaaaAAAAHHHHND ONE!‚Äù  ‚ÄìEric Paschall, 2-3 times a game."
Eric Paschall
All these guys get love. Nobody says anything about Eric Paschall.
Eric Paschall the Rascal's second jump is lethal
"I think this game showcased the full potential of warriors.  Steph curry doing his thing and scoring despite his gravity. Wiggins scoring a quiet 16+ like he has done in a games except first 2 games. Being a pest in defense working in rhythm with team. Kelly oubre scoring 15+ points and being a pest on the defense and taking on the opponents best player. Wiseman doing his job on paint, not fouling defensively and showing his lob threat capabilities. Dray in addition to being DPOY driving and trying from 3 when no one is around and making the opposition take pause.  Eric paschall had off game but wanamaker and Bazemore were good. Looney was rock solid when he played.  The good thing is they can still improve especially Wiseman in defense, curry turn overs, bench can do better etctc.  Its definitely going to interesting watching this team. It's going to nightmare for top teams running into these guys in playoffs if they make it that far."
GG bro. I was very impressed with Jakob Poeltl. He neutralized Eric Paschall who was coming of a couple of great games.
"Bruh, *come on*. This is going to sound insulting but I promise I don't mean it to be but that is one of the worst basketball takes I've seen on this sub (that's not something just outright crazy).  Who is Draymond Green getting moved to the bench for? Eric Paschall? Why do *you* think Draymond Green will be moved to the bench? Because he's not a shooter?  If Kerr was going to change the starting lineup he'd have already moved Damion Lee into Oubre's spot and played Oubre mostly in non-Steph minutes.   Paschall is a scorer first and while he's improved defensively and as a play maker he is **nowhere** near Draymond's level at either.   You have to understand Draymond isn't just about what he does individually. He literally improves everyone on the floor with him. It's not a coincidence the Warriors looked so much better once he finally started playing.   Go watch Warriors games. Watch Draymond every possession. Watch him direct guys on where to go. Watch him call out actions and switches. He literally thinks for all five Dubs on the floor with him.   He's also knocking a lot of rust off and recovering from COVID symptoms that reportedly lingered for him. That high pick and roll with Curry is still one of the most efficient plays in basketball and literally no one in the league does it better.   It makes absolutely zero sense to move Draymond to the bench and it won't happen this season or next season short of some kind of injury that dramatically impacts his ability on the floor."
"little-known sudden death clause of his contract: in the event of a record insufficient to reach playoffs, Curry will be forced to fight Eric Paschall, cage match, ‚ÄúTo The Death,‚Äù to determine the new face of the franchise"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green.   6th Man: Eric ""Better Zion"" Paschall  Coach: Don Nelson"
Eric Paschall is on the same contract and still young. What picks could tip the scales if Presti wants to defy Shai and keep tanking?
"I'm still amazed by his athletism, I never expected a dude built so wide and chunky to go up and elevate the way he does, same with Eric Paschall also, did not expect those chunky guys to be so athletic."
Eric Paschall being a small-ball backup 5 and killing it.
"Yeah, just give us Eric Paschall"
"But even in 2015 and 2016, bogut, shaun, and andre were great but the overall team depth was a little overblown, lot of those guys were unplayable at times. The top 7-8 guys were better back then but this team is legitimately 10 deep not including Oubre who has been ass for most of the season. I think Wiggins has been a great fit so far and then we have guys like Damian Lee, Eric Paschall, Bazemore, Looney, and even Brad Wanamaker who have been really good for us in their roles both on offense and defense. Even fringe rotation guys and 2 way players like Mulder and Juan Toscano Anderson have contributed both ways in their limited minutes. And most of these guys have done it both in the 2nd unit and with the starters.   In fact in many games, the starters are the ones who fall behind early and our bench is the unit who brings it back. The last few years our bench was pretty bad at scoring, their role was to just buy time for Steph to come back into the game, whereas now our bench actually can get buckets, cut into a deficit or even extend leads. Our starters have been the problem tbh, mostly due to Oubre and Wiseman"
"Eric Paschall 8-11, 18 points game over. Lakers got destroyed by him and Oubre."
"My dream experience is no commentary, no video, nothing to get in the way of the Audible Stimulus. Sneakers squeaking, ball being dribbled on the hardwood, draymond‚Äôs ‚ÄúANNNND ONEEE‚Äù as he drives. Nothing beats it.   I close my eyes and imagine I‚Äôm Eric Paschall. I just bullied my way through your team‚Äôs big, slow center. I feel something, a warm hand on my left buttock. I turn around, it‚Äôs Stephen Curry, gazing at me in admiration. I open my eyes again"
"For the first 6 minutes of the 4th quarter the best player on the court for the Warriors was Eric Paschall while the Lakers had Davis, Trez, and Schroeder, and the Warriors actually cut into the Lakers' lead. Honestly pretty inexcusable for Davis who's reportedly been frustrated with the team's coasting. But gotta give credit to that Warriors bench, they all play intelligently and with a ton of energy. It's crazy to think what they could've been with Klay"
I feel they have already exceeded expectations especially Eric Paschall
"Eric 'I'm the Juggernaught, Bitch' Paschall"
Eric Paschall is Zion lite
nah they never met Eric ‚ÄúBaby Zion aka Zach Randolph with hops aka Shaq Jr‚Äú Paschall. didn‚Äôt know what hit em.
Eric Paschall is going to be 6th man of the year.
"Eric ""The Bully"" Paschall been keeping the team afloat off the bench. Dude needs some consideration for 6MOTY"
"I think the difference is definitely Eric Paschall and Damian Lee. Our bench may not be the best, but I thi k they got top 3 Poise (continuity from last year). Our bench is cutting into leads real well"
ERIC PASCHALL
Eric paschall holy shit
"Man this warriors team always hangs around. Eric Paschall has to be up there for 6moty with Harrell, Boucher, Clarkson, Rose (I probably missed someone super obvious)"
Eric Paschall is like nowhere near as athletic and has a pretty nice touch from distance
Greatest NBA rivalry - Montreal Harrell vs Eric Paschall.
I had never heard of Eric Paschall until this game and thought Siakam might have been traded and I didn't hear about it.
took me far too long to realize that Eric Paschall and Pascall Siakam are 2 different people
Is Eric paschall the best player on the warriors
Eric paschall has a really nice hairline
Our lord and shoulders Eric paschall üôè
Eric Paschall is great I like his game a lot
did reggie miller just say eric paschall could score with the best of em?!?! LMFAO
Not a big change but arguing with people on here that Eric Paschall was actually a good player while people on here called him a trash g-leaguer and now seeing the narrative around him turn around into being a part of the Warriors future was a recent one.
Kanter literally got benched in the fifth game of the regular season because he was getting cooked by fucking Eric Paschall lmfao.
Draymond Green isn‚Äôt worth his bloated contract and contributes nothing on the offensive end of the floor. We could start Eric Paschall in his place for rookie money and nothing would change.
"I mean Flight calls Zach LaVine ""La Vine"" and Eric Paschall ""Pow-Ell"", he just pretends to not know how to say players names"
Eric paschall has been the second best warrior. Then Dray. Then Wiggins or lee. This roster blows
"""DAIIIYUUUM"" -Eric Paschall"
"True, but Wiggins has been a league average offensive player though, not a positive  The warriors have ZERO above average offensive players in the starting lineup besides Steph  Eric paschall is their second best weapon. This is a really bad offensive team"
is Eric Paschall Siakam playing
Their defense is also really weak at the center position. Eric Paschall looked like an all star scoring against them so you could only imagine how much Montrezl could do along Gasol if he has a decent day.
Eric Paschall
"So they pulled him from their closing lineup? They were also still negative in his minutes and it's not unusual by any stretch. Against the Pacers, Raptors, both Clippers games, the Kings, hell, in all but three games this season, they've been better in the minutes with Looney at center, and in most of their games they were also better with the small ball, Eric Paschall at center lineup.   I'm not even saying that Wiseman is a bad player or a bad pick, I'm just saying that he's not part of the Warriors best lineups right now and the way Steve Kerr has been managing his minutes lately reflects that he also knows Wiseman will take time."
"Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo, Josh Hart, Eric Paschall."
Dude you have to be the biggest homer in the world if you think Eric Paschall can eat a defender like Turner lmao
Eric Paschall coming off the bench is the Warriors' 3rd leading scorer. GG.
"It's not necessarily going to ruin your shot but it adds more variance to it. There are guys like Eric Paschall who are consistent midrange shooters who get a lot of hangtime on their jumpers, because they're disciplined in getting into their shot pocket and rarely shoot off quick up-down drives.  The main criticism of Russ from day one has been that he plays out of control and doesn't think before acting, and when you have a high jump on your shot, you introduce a lot more variance into your shot mechanics. For example if you pull up because a help defender slid under the basket, you're more likely to put more force in your legs than if you did a simple catch and shoot.  That would be the first thing I would fix if I was his shooting coach. However he needs to shoot far less jumpers in general"
"Only time will tell but there is too much talent on this roster for them by outside of the top 8 teams, even in a loaded West.   Curry is still super good, Draymond is one of the best defensive players in the league, Wiseman's potential is huge and Wiggins has been playing pretty well. Eric Paschall has been excellent as a small ball center, Damion Lee has hit some big shots for us at the end of tight games, and Bazemore has been really good both defensively and offensively.   I think if they can make it through the end of the month, playing all those good teams, and still be above .500 they'll get more respect."
Eric Paschall is a sleeper for 6moty imo
Ask Eric Paschall who he thinks could give him a hard time and just see what they give you
"Warriors team basketball, 7 players double figures, Steph always on top of +- despite the poor scoring performance. Damion Lee 3p so far 1.9/3.9 on a .487 and Eric Paschall very consistent and reliable from the bench. Draymond almost with a triple double and high basketball iq. Oubre horrible but energetic. Time will tell but this team might actually make a somewhat run in the playoffs."
Eric Paschall is quickly becoming one of my fav players. The way he just bullies players in the paint makes it look so easy.
Eric ‚ÄúCostco‚Äù Paschall

Last year Eric Paschall matched Ben‚Äôs career high in his 7th game. I thought Ben‚Äôs career high was at least 40.
Eric Paschall had a take your kids to work day with his son Zubac
[Eric Paschall every time he got matched up vs. Zubac](https://youtu.be/yNxPVj0hejg)
"Ya, plus Eric Paschall has been doing a great job scoring with the bench unit too, I think he has double digits points in almost every game this year. He isn't very good playing with the starters but he just gets buckets against backup bigs"
"That's a really good question, you just never know. It's not only about who is able to fight through it, but how long it takes them to fight through it. It took Eric Paschall about a month or so to fight through it last year"
Eric Paschall
"Oh. Ok, now I understand. EP= Eric Paschall. He a beast tonight."

Eric Paschall for 6MOTY
ERIC PASCHALL FROM DOWNTOWN  AND GOLDEN STATE TAKES THE LEAD
"I will forever be furious we didn't draft Eric Paschall. Him and Mikal Bridges, both, are guys that I wanted the Jazz to get, but Bogy has done well enough for me to get over Bridges, but Paschall would easily have been our 2nd best bench player last playoff."
"Eric ""I'm the juggernaut, bitch!"" Paschall"
Our lord and shoulders Eric paschall is here to save us
Under the radar pick: Eric Paschall
"First rule of nba discussions.  A player is only as good as their last game.  Clearly Steph is washed, and Eric Paschall is the GOAT."
That‚Äôs an insult to Eric Paschall
Eric Paschall &gt; Steph Curry
Eric Paschall Siakam today
"Pretty ugly game, very impressed by our defence. We made tons of mistakes and noone could generate offence except Eric Paschall, who was quite impressive.   I expected steph to have a quiet game since he was scorching the last 2 games.  Very close game for us though.   Overall happy where we are at against a championship team. I expect Kerr will make adjustments for the rematch."
eric paschall is the greatest player of our generation
"Eric Paschall Siakam. I‚Äôll take the L, they played really well. Aside from Curry ofc"
Eric Paschall Siakam with the airball

I have seen all that needs to be seen. Now put Eric Paschall in.
"Eric ""Sixth Man Of The Year"" Paschall"
Eric Paschall put the team on his back
Eric Paschall
Only ONE player is in double digits between both teams and it's fucking Eric Paschall lmao
Oh good its our lord and savior Eric Paschall
"It was kind of staggering how many minutes Kanter played against GS in the second game, given that Eric Paschall (of all people) was destroying him. Although he was grabbing rebounds like crazy."
"It‚Äôs not reactionary if you actually watch your games which you don‚Äôt.  They‚Äôve gotten better each game and Wiggins+Oubre are starting to learn there spots on both ends. Defense has locked in with Dray back. Wiseman is also getting better and pushing through rookie mistakes.  The bench has kept us in all of these games and Eric Paschall is looking like a great 6th man. We also have bazemore and lee who have already stepped up big.  The supporting cast is fine. Outside of the core Steph + Dray and Doncic + Porzingis, I‚Äôll take our supporting cast over yours all day long."
Now they'll tell us that it's because he has known stars around him like Eric Paschall and Nico Mannion
For a bit Jaylen Brown kinda looked like Eric Paschall from behind
Eric Paschall comes to mind
"The year Myers became GM, the team drafted Draymond Green, Festus Ezeli and Harrison Barnes. They had the 28-30th pick of the first round for five straight years and still ended up with two playoff level rotation players in Eric Paschall and Kevon Looney. The jury is still out on Poole, he's currently the G Leagues top scorer while taking time in the bubble. Smiley is trash and nobody can convince me otherwise.  Compared to someone like the Raptors, our GMs aren't great, but compared to teams like the Hornets or the Pistons, the Warriors FO is incredible."
It's like saying that Norman Powell is Raptors soul  Or saying that Furkan Korkmaz is 76ers team spirit  Or saying that Eric Paschall drives the warriors  Or saying that withou Dozier Nuggets ain't going anywhere  Or saying that Pat Bev makes your team chemistry  Lol
"nah, there's dudes who bitch at refs literally every time they shoot the ball. draymond only bitches when he gets called for ticky tack shit when playing all-time elite defense or there's an obvious blown call. we got a guy, eric paschall, on our team who bitches even more than dray and even iguodala used to complain more. fucking look at luka. shit's a disgrace."
I think Shaq knew Pascal was his first name but his first thought was Eric Paschall and just went with it.
"He is not a formidable centre lol, Draymond and Eric Paschal are the small-ball centres. Paschal isn‚Äôt a formidable centre either, Warriors get torched with Paschall at centre. JTA was guarding Colin Sexton against the Cavs."
To be fair he might‚Äôve mixed him up with Eric paschall
Hahaha dude he could‚Äôve just said ‚Äúoh I though you meant Eric Paschall‚Äù. Fucking Shaq rofl
Eric Paschall
Eric Paschall maybe?
To be fair there is a man named Eric Paschall playing in san fran
Maybe he thought they meant Eric Paschall?
I was gonna say maybe at first he though they were talking about Eric Paschall and got confused but then I realized shaq probably doesnt know who that is either lol
Maybe he was referring to Eric Paschall ahuehuehuehuehuehue
Eric paschall # 3 Shaqtin a fool TONIGHT a shaq ain‚Äôt even STUTTER fuck outta here !!
"I thought about that too but then he would‚Äôve just said o I thought you were talking about Eric paschall. Otherwise, why would he use a halfass excuse that makes him look bad over a legitimate reason to be confused?"
"honestly he could've played it off like he thought Ernie meant Eric Paschall but then he said ""i never knew his first name""ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ècmon bruh lol"
Eric Paschall would be hot if he seen this thread
He coulda been thinkin Eric paschall
There is an Eric paschall tbf
"Everyone's calling him a casual, but what if he thought Ernie was talking about Eric Paschall? ü§î"
"Eric Paschall xD   I thought that maybe some guy that has a two-way contract is named Pascal but nope, seems that Pascal Siakam is indees the only ""Pascal"" Bballref finds xD"
Eric Paschall
"Eric ""Thiccums"" Paschall"
dont disrespect nova legend eric paschall
"Shoutout Eric paschall, those 2 buckets with the and-1 in the 4th were huge, closed the gap"
"Bam Adebayo is offically overrated to me. Don't let he numbers fool you, he was clamped by Eric Paschall down the stretch in the 4th quarter during the Warriors run. Man played a team with no centers and Draymond and couldn't post up dudes 6 inches shorter than him. SOFT."
Watching from the Dubs perspective and  I felt the same way.   We were playing like shit and that 10 pts lead never ballooned to something unmanageable. All we needed was a few posessions where we can get a stop and convert on the other end to get back in the game.  Eric Paschall was a big injection of energy for us with his points. That swung the momentum over and Bazemore took over.
"The defense is atrocious with the bench unit. They play 6‚Äô6‚Äù Eric Paschall at centre and Damion Lee at power forward with the bench unit lmao. I think it‚Äôs just weird early season small sample size stuff. According to the nba tracking, Wiggins is also the second best iso scorer in the nba. The Spurs used to have a better defense and net rating with DPOY Kawhi off the floor."
"Garbage time superstar Eric Paschall. He‚Äôs usually solid, but he turns into like, Barkley with a jumper when the game is decided."
Eric Paschall
eric paschall from the 2019 draft was 1st team all rookie
"Combination of Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart, and Eric Paschall. Just some random guys I chose for no reason."
"This dude is built like a brick wall, but also has skill.   Eric Paschall is probably the strongest in the Warriors, and he plays a lot of bully ball. Even he had a tough time getting around Stewart, and was barely able to do it.  There is also this one clip where Curry runs into him, and falls down flat on his back"
"Eric Paschall, -22 in 12 minutes in a 6 point win. Rough."
"His game is underrated.  Everyone wants flashy dunks, but part of the reason he chose Duke was Coach K saying, *""Hey I don't give a shit about the dunks. I like the other shit you do too. I'm going to give you the ball and let you do your thang.""* And I think we're going to see more and more of that once he has a full season of games under his belt. He can get his teammates good looks, he can pass, he can make other guys' lives a lot easier on the court. His efficiency % is nice, but it's fun to see these ASTs numbers bump up game to game too.  Fans from other teams are saying he's ""Eric Paschall, Julius Randle, and Keldon Johnson light"" so he is underrated in that sense too. lol."
good to see eric paschall get back in rhythm toward the end. the second unit has been off these past two games with him being passive
Super sub Eric Paschall
lol we are out of centers. Eric Paschall is back for this game but Kerr likes to start him with the second unit
"That team was like 8 players deep and who were capable offensively playing big roles in the offense. You're not a true Rockets fan if you think Jordan Poole, Damion Lee, and Eric Paschall are on par with 2015 Motie, Brewer, or Josh Smith."
"Nova products have been great lately. Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Eric Paschall, Donte Divencenzo, Josh Hart, Omare Spellman‚Äôs played some fair minutes, Saddiq Bey, Arcidiacano‚Äôs in the Bulls rotation.   All players from 2016-2020"
The Warriors just don't play a style of basketball that is accessible to young players. We've seen young players come in and really flounder in Golden State since Kerr was hired. The only real success stories have been Draymond (Who is perhaps the smartest defensive mind in all of basketball) and Eric Paschall who came into the league after four years in the NCAA. Of course not every player is gonna be an all-star or even a quality starter but the Warriors are having trouble developing even suitable role players.
"Why do we let people like that just spew random stuff they made up?  I've watched every game so far this season, and Wiseman is better than he was at the start of the year, no question.  He's a work in progress on offense, but on defense, he's improved a lot.  On offense, his screen setting is better than early in the year.  His defensive awareness and ability to set the screen still aren't good, but they're far improved.    He's already mastered the single biggest skill an NBA big man must master: he can play defense without fouling.  If you can get just that down your rookie year, the rest will come.  The warriors committed 26 fouls against the Hawks on Sunday in a loss; Wiseman was responsible for ONE of those 26.  He still bites on pump fakes too often, and his awareness of the defensive scheme is better than early in the year, but still has a ways to go.    However, being able to defend without fouling is #1 for a rookie.  You can't learn, get reps, and get better if you can't stay on the floor.  Compare his recent stretch of games to what he put up against the Lakers earlier in the year, where he was a foul magnet.    He can alter shots in the paint, he is effective in the lob game, he needs to get stronger to be a good rebounder, but he fights for post position effectively.  He's a better passer than Kelly Oubre or Eric Paschall, which isn't saying much.    I think he's doing fine.  The biggest thing he needs to do in the offseason is hit the weight room and get stronger."
I knew Eric Paschall was up to something.
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."
Kelly Oubre and Eric Paschall are an absolute disgrace
I thought Eric Paschall was Baby Draymond
Eric Paschall small ball center too low
"&gt; This current team would be just as bad as last year  Lolllll it's hilarious how disingenuous you're being instead of making the actual argument that is there for Curry. Sad.      Players that started the most games for you last year:   Glenn Robinson 48 games, Draymond Green 43 games, Willie Cauley Stein 37 games, Damion Lee 36 games, DLO 33 games, Eric Paschall 26 games  DEFINITELY the same team. Andrew Wiggins and Kelly Oubre same as Glenn Robinson and WCS, no?  Not even considering that Draymond Green literally didn't try last year."
"Amazing:   * Curry with 32/6/9 on his 33rd bday. Just needed 1 more point my man  * Andrew Wiggins 28/3/2 - all he needed was a few day's rest! Looking fresh post-ASB  * Poole - 18/3 in 22 minutes - this guy could turn into 6MOY next season. Oozes scoring potential.   Great:   * Draymond 11/12/12 - still hopeless offensively but actually hitting a few shots now. Still anchoring the D. Keep doing your thing man   * Nico 5/2/2 in 12 minutes. Showed very promising flashes of talent as a pass-first PG who can hit his shots when needed. Good D already. Just turned 20 today! Cool that both PGs have the same Bday  * Wiseman 16/3 in 23 minutes.  Still lots to work on but he looks better than he did earlier in the year. Desperately needs to learn to rebound against grown men though. And to box out. And to set better screens.   Good:   * Eric Paschall: 9/3/1 in 12 minutes. Put his limited time to work. Such a reliable bench scorer already. Defense needs to keep improving though  * Looney: 2/3 in 11 minutes. You do all the little things bb, I wont complain.   Alright:   * Oubre 7/7/1 in 30 minutes. Deferred on offense today, and probably a good idea. Not his best night at the office but still played good D and never turned the ball over  * Bazemore: 3/1/1 - plays his role off the bench  * Juan Toscano-Anderson 0/2/0 in 11 minutes. Still trying to figure it out consistently. I think he has the tools to be a goo contributor  Fuck off:   * Brad Wanamaker - 0/0/0 in 0 minutes. No offense, you are so trash. Part of the reason we won is because you're on the end of the bench now. 20 year old Nico is a better backup PG. Go play overseas homie.   Good win today! Most exciting ball we've played in a long time. Guess we really needed the ASB rest. We're still in playoff contention y'all. We Believe"
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
"Yesterday lineup to start the 2nd half: Nico Manion, Jordan Poole, Kelly Oubre, Eric Paschall and Juan Tuscano Anderson.   Enough said"
"I bet on the Warriors winning. Eric Paschall, Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss are at least real NBA players."
"Sure does. I was listening to it the other day, and was like _hold up, did he just say Eric Paschall? Isn't this song from like 15 years ago?_"
What's more likely: Paschall got a name-drop when he was a 5 year-old or they're referring to another Eric Paschall?
Has it occurred to you that there is more than one Eric Paschall in this world
"**Exact moment we lost this game:** A lineup of Nico Mannion, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano Anderson, Eric Paschall, and Kelly Oubre for 7+ minutes in the second quarter scored 6 points, allowed the lead to balloon from 2 to 13, and not one substitution was made."
"It's not even pressure. It's pure frustration.   We had a lineup of Nico Mannion, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano Anderson, Eric Paschall, and Kelly Oubre for 7+ minutes in the second quarter where the lead ballooned from 2 to 13 and not one substitution was made."
eric paschall probably fits this. he's going to have to get better on defense but I think he has the potential for a long career and would fit with any team. if he gets his defense straightened out he could be a journeyman starter though
"Eric Paschall is a matchup nightmare for a lot of teams like the Blazers or Lakers who lack defensive guys off the bench. He's too quick for centres, too strong for wings."
"Very intereseting. I think he has some clear limitations but the Warriors are really missing guard depth and a plug and play perimeter defender would be huge for the Warriors in the post season.   Now that Wiseman (and to a lesser extent Oubre) are out of the lineup we're really seeing what this team could have been all season. But they are massively lacking depth. Legit 8 man rotation for weeks now.   Eric Paschall is reportedly very close to coming back, Jordan Bell is getting signed to a two way and will be available for the playoffs, but Damion Lee sounds far away after contracting COVID and Oubre is a complete question mark.   None of these guys will likely play a ton of minutes in the post season but just have the big man depth and a little extra depth at guard is a big deal for this team."
"Jordan Poole, Eric Paschall, Alen Smailegic"
Cries in Eric Paschall  Cries in Marquise Chriss
"I hope the Warriors take a chance on him and Tyreke Evans.  Camp invite or at least two way.  They are better than bums like Mulder, Smailafuck and Eric ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù Paschall"
"Lol. You've never seen the Warriors play ? They play a very complicated system and have literally the opposite personel for it. Steph would be better with KD's supporting cast because it was made of veterans who had a lot of IQ. Ibaka was a better scorer than Dray rn, while providing defense. Westbrook, AN ALL STAR GUARD played some games. Reggie was good enough to not be a huge negative. Washed up Caron butler is miles better than Eric Paschall. Even a washed up Fisher would sink in the wide open looks Steph is providing for being quadruple teamed..Nick Collisson at that point still knew what to do on the floor and brought quality minutes and leadership. The warriors are small, injured and have zero IQ and experience. Steph is getting quadruple teamed, and despite that still gets 31 points.  KD played with washed up players. But they were still good veterans. Steph is playing with G-leaguers and one washed up Green while getting quadruple teamed. What does it take you to realize that the dubs have literally the worst supporting cast in the league, and arguably in league history (advanced metrics prove it) ? Moreover, the dubs have been rigged with injuries, including Curry himself (and it cost us a lot of easy games). Unless you just blindly admires Durant, everybody can see how the two rosters are miles opposite."
Eric Paschall lol
Come to the Warriors Kevin ! We'll give up Eric Paschall and Wiseman+picks.
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
"Last year your top 5 in minutes played was Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson, Damion Lee, Alec Burkes, and Jordan Poole   This year it is Andrew Wiggins, Steph Curry, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green, and Damion Lee"
"Claxton,Dean wade,Terence Davis,Isiah Roby,Terence Mann, and Eric Paschall"
"Eric ""Zion Lite"" Paschall"
"After Curry,  Klay Thompson - First team all rookie  Harrison Barnes - First team all rookie  Patrick McCaw - a decent role player despite being a 2nd round pick. Nothing out of this world but played well and beyond expectations.  Jordan Bell - another 2nd rounder who played well above expectations, much like Pat  Eric Paschall - First team all rookie"
In 19-20????? Our star player back then was Eric Paschall...
Eric Paschall
I think if they're keeping Dame they're not rebuilding. Staying in Win-now limbo. I think they'll have to deal CJ for something strange - S&amp;T Oubre Jr + one of Jordan Poole/Damian Lee/JTA/Eric Paschall.
"Eric Paschall. He'll probably be one of those high end roleplayers who will have a single All Star in his career. However, those players are also the ones that will lift a contender to a championship team."
We can offer one Eric Paschall and a 2nd Round Pick
I wonder if they consider putting some package together around:  * Sign and trade Kelly Oubre Jr * James Wiseman  * The 2021 Minnesota pick if it goes to them  * Their 2021 pick  * Eric Paschall
Warriors to play with his boy Eric Paschall
"Eric Paschall could legally go missing, and even his own mother wouldn't use 6 separate question marks to ask about his whereabouts"
"&gt;Why has he not played in so long?  Hip Injury  &gt;Why is getting DNP‚Äôs?  Hip Injury  &gt;Was he not promising?""  Still is. Hip injury.   &amp;#x200B;  [Article from yesterday:](https://sports.yahoo.com/warriors-lakers-4-key-questions-180143370.html) ""While the Lakers have been dealing with injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Warriors have been rolling with an eight-man rotation due to Kelly Oubre Jr., Damion Lee and **Eric Paschall** being sidelined..."""
Yo what happened to Eric Paschall? Why isn‚Äôt he playing?
Eric Paschall was on the all-rookie team last year and he can‚Äôt see a single minute here? They need instant offense and he can give it to them
"*kent bazemore checks out*  lakers: ""finally...a break.....unless--""  eric paschall: *smiles* guess it's my turn now"
He's basically been what everyone thought Eric Paschall was gonna be for us. I'm glad we're slowly rebuilding while still being fairly competitive.
"Yo warriors fans. Quick question, is eric paschall unplayable or? I remember seeing flashes of him being pretty incredible last season. Why isn‚Äôt he playing?"
"""The Grizzlies (37-33, same record as the Warriors) beat the Kings tonight, which means Sunday‚Äôs MEM-GSW game will determine which team finishes in 8th place, with the right to fly to the 7th place team‚Äôs homecourt and battle for the official No. 7 seed in the playoffs, probably on Tue 5/18 or Wed 5/19 (we think it will be Wednesday as that night is more desirable for the networks to have Stephen Curry on TV than Tuesday, but we‚Äôll see if there are other factors involved).      The loser of Sunday‚Äôs big Grizzlies-Warriors matchup would have to face the 10th seed, win that, then play the loser of the 7th- vs 8th-place game for the official No. 8 seed in the playoffs.      Tomorrow‚Äôs game for each team (MEM-SAC and NOP-GSW) is thereby actually meaningless because all combinations will result in the Sunday MEM-GSW matchup still deciding who finishes in 8th place, with the notation that the head-to-head series between them is currently knotted up at 1-1:      If GSW beats NOP and MEM beats SAC: both teams are 38-33 heading into MEM-GSW. Obviously the winner on Sunday would finish 39-33, good for 8th place and better than the loser‚Äôs 38-34 final record.      If GSW loses to NOP and MEM beats SAC, GSW is 37-34 and MEM is 38-33 heading into the final game.

Eric Paschall is a problem for 2nd units.
"Seems like no one is really doing a starting 5, so here we go:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: Terry Rozier  SF: Jerami Grant  PF: Eric Paschall  C: Jahlil Okafor"
Eric Paschall 2021 6MOTY
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"I tried a trade and the one that made sense is Wiggins, Wiseman, Jordan Poole, Eric Paschall, and like 6 first rounds picks including 7 and 14 for Dame."
"Eric Paschall is the fucking man, give him 4 years"
Wiseman stays healthy he probably makes the all rookie team too lmfao. Stewart played twice as many games no shit he put up higher numbers in aggregate.  Eric Paschall made all rookie first team putting up volume stats on a tanking team. It means nothing
Muahahahaha you're gonna get Eric Paschall instead üòà
"Kelly Oubre sign and tarde, Eric Paschall and the 14th pick. Sound good?  (I am not being serious, before anyone freaks out)"
"I disagree. Wiseman was comparable in the shooting category but his stroke looks a lot nicer. Stewert is more polished yes but it‚Äôs easy to look good on a 20 win team. Eric Paschall last year for us on our team was a ROY candidate for awhile but barely got playing time towards the end of the season because he wasnt very good or worked in our system well. Wiseman is more raw but like you, I would be very surprised if in a few years Stewert was better than wiseman. I think if the teams were redrafting with all the information they know now after a year Wiseman would 100%  get picked above Stewert."
"I could see the Warriors going all in.   Warriors get:   * Jerami Grant   * Cade Cunningham  Pistons get:   * James Wiseman   * Jordan Poole   * Eric Paschall  * Filler contracts (Mulder, Smailagic)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Warriors go all in on winning. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Cade/Oubre/Grant/Juan/Chriss   Pistons turn one pick and one good player into three blue chip prospects and four first round picks, two of which are for sure lotto picks and one (2025) that will likely be a lotto pick as well once Steph, Klay, Dray age out  Look at it as Wiseman, #7, #14 to move up to #1. Then Poole, Paschall, filler, 2 1sts for Grant."
I guess give up Eric Paschall. I'm so conflicted whether I like Simmons on the Dubs or not
What was a better package out there?  \#2 pick (which ended up being wiseman)  Wiggins is whatever just to make salary match  Eric Paschall (pretty good rookie year)  Minni pick  Future warriors picks
"Still can't believe last summer when Warriors fans legitimately thought Giannis for like Wiseman, Wiggins, and fucking Eric Paschall was even a remotely possible trade scenario. Disgusting."
I wanted to say Andrew Wiggins and Eric Paschall but....nahhhh
Getting Eric Paschall flashbacks.
&gt; The biggest knock on RJ was that his team was bad and missed the playoffs so he couldnt make all rookie team.  But Eric Paschall made 1st team despite being on a 15 win team lol
This description unironically fits Eric Paschall.
Thanks for this list! Here are a few names that were omitted:  PJ Tucker - 943k; Montrezl Harrell - 563k; Eric Paschall - 177k; Terance Mann - 115k
"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn‚Äôt trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I‚Äôm okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
"I just feel bad for Favors.  &gt;Originally started as a ""4"" next to Gobert making like 17M a year but basically got all of his time as a backup behind Rudy for 48 minutes of rim protection  &gt;Utah realizes that they can't have 2 non-shooting bigs in the lineup and dump Favors to New Orleans  &gt;Favors COMES BACK to Utah on a reduced contract to be Gobert's certified backup big. No starting lineup anymore.  &gt;Utah says, ""Fuck it, we need more perimeter D instead of rim protection"" and ship Favors off AGAIN. They then decide they can get backup minutes on the cheap by signing Whiteside for a vet-min and getting Eric Paschall for a 2nd rounder.  Favors showed a ton of loyalty and got shafted twice as a result."
Eric Paschall is poor man's Zion
Eric Paschall. He has similar package with Zion
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
"I think Eric Paschall could also get there. He was usually posting an efficient +/-, but his playstyle did not lend itself well to the Warriors. He might do much better with the Jazz.      He has the same build as Barkley, he just needs to hit the gym harder.        Also the way he takes off for dunks is great, he does the Mario double jump."
"that warriors take is hot garbage, they were trying to make a trade for another star but it takes two teams to tango. Not going all in on a Ben Simmons trade was the right idea. Otto Porter and Andre Igoudala were nice signings to help fill out the roster. They had one of the best drafts of any team this year and still have wiseman developing  in the wings. Don't know why they let Eric Paschall go but other they had a good off season   BI has  averaged 23.8/5.5/4.5, on 50/38/86 shooting splits  since coming to New Orleans and was an all star in 2020.He has clearly shown he can be the second best player on a contending team. The pelicans defintley should of gotten more in the bulls trade for lonzo but I like Tomas Satoransky, his height will allow us to play 3 guard lineups  like we did with lonzo. Getting rid of Bledsoe and Adams should be a huge boon for this team offensively and i expect BI and Zion will reap the benefits of the extra space that will be provided.  Jazz were the number one seed and got injured at the wrong time. I liked the Eric Paschall trade and the Rudy gay signing. They also have some interesting pieces they could package to improve there roster should someone they like become available at the deadline."
"I said stereotype. While in a lot of cases its not true (Eric Paschall and Jordan Bell), being OP is gonna be attached to us whether its factual or not. Every time we do the right move, its gonna be described as a blockbuster one like its KD all over again."
Rookie Eric paschall was a bucket for us
Eric Paschall for the 19-20 Warriors
&gt;I think he‚Äôs worth a top 55 protected 2nd round pick   Eric paschall is infinitely better than Kevin Knox and he only went for a top 42 protected 2nd rounder
"Ah, missed that. That makes a huge difference. Still, as I noted to someone else here, a team with a lineup of Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole with Draymond playing the 6th most minutes on the team finished 26th in drtg. Doubtful that, with this coaching staff and Draymond healthy, we‚Äôd finish last in defensive rating."
"Dray played the 6th most minutes on the team in 2019-2020. Top 5 were: Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole. THAT TEAM WAS STILL NOT THE WORST DEFENSIVELY IN THE NBA. I don‚Äôt know how you could possibly bring up better evidence at how wrong you are. As long as Dray is playing on this team and we have the coaching staff we do, they won‚Äôt be last in the league in defensive rating."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"&gt;Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler.

The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said."
I really liked Eric Paschall too. Unfortunate that we couldn‚Äôt keep him on the roster.
Donovan Mitchell and Eric Paschall on the same team as kids and Paschall was just traded to the Jazz.
Eric Paschall for the 2020 Warriors (Draymond missed a bunch of time that season)
Eric Paschall
"The Jazz have two sixth man of the year finalists, Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Jared Butler."
What am I supposed to do with my Eric Paschall Authentic Fan Friday sign
I remember when Eric Paschall was a future star in the making allllll the way back in the year 2020
[I mean...](https://nbadraftroom.com/eric-paschall/)
so... they don't understand the concept of basketball in general.  &gt;Why don't you simply trade Eric Paschall for a top 10 player?
Yep!   [They gave each other their jerseys in their first matchup](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-eric-paschall-talks-nba-journey-alongside-donovan-mitchell).  They're from the same area of New York and were on the same AAU team together.
"No joke though I got a massive spike in anxiety when I saw ""Eric Paschall"" because I was super worried the following words would result in the last seconds (to me) of Joe Ingles being on the Jazz."
1. Get Eric Paschall  2. ???  3. Profit
Get Eric Paschall.
"Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall and Hassan Whiteside are great replacements for Niang and Favors minutes, I like it. Not to mention the Donovan-Paschall connection."
Utah traded for Eric paschall
Eric Paschall is the same age as Devin Booker and Chris Duarte.
Paschall wanted to reunite with Donovan Mitchell?   who the fuck is eric paschall to be able to make that kind of request and have it granted
Damn is that NBA All-Rookie First Team athlete Eric Paschall getting traded for a second round pick? He def deserved that spot over RJ   yes im salty
"Nah bro the Jazz have 2019-2020 NBA All Rookie FIRST TEAM athlete Eric Paschall now, the Knicks only have RJ Barrett, who was on the second team"
No he means Eric Paschall. You can keep Siakam
Eric Paschall
"A meh run franchise attracted Kevin Durant, signed David West well below his market value, found great rotation pieces in guys like Looney, Damion Lee and JTA, drafted Eric Paschall and Jordan Poole well below their true value and turned Andrew Wiggins into a great defender...but yeah I guess they suck"
"Utah wants Paschall, and I don‚Äôt think you can add in any other salary in a S&amp;T. Maybe trade Oubre somewhere for an exception and use that plus Eric and some picks, feels like the only plausible road to Ingles at this point."
Getting Eric paschall and like oubre or moody and someone else would give us some more youth at forward with better contracts ideally. Plus getting paschall keeps Don happy since they're friends
Eric Paschall rumor to Utah rumor and no Jingles in the vid hmmmmmm
And they‚Äôll end up getting Eric paschall
"Honestly I feel like they would be a more well rounded team rather than a team that has a sole superstar. But I do see a lot of offensive star potential in Poole, Moody (with some tweaking to his shot selection). I see Kuminga and Wiseman as players who will thrive as defensive players kind of like draymond. Poole and wiseman have some good pick an roll potential. Not to mention our sharpshooter in Jessup who can probably be like a joe harris with better defense. and with nico and eric paschall coming off the bench we would be a pretty well rounded team that can win a championship. Plus we can add more to our needs through free agency."
"&gt; Well now the warriors have to replace 3 of those roster spots with min guys  That‚Äôs a positive considering how bad the bench played last year. The Lakers literally built a better bench off the scrap heap  If they weren‚Äôt Warriors players, you wouldn‚Äôt be defending them. No one gives a shit outside your org about Mychal Mulder and Allen Smailagic and Eric Paschall. None of them get into a playoff rotation like Kyle Anderson does  &gt; Is Lacob supposed to pay $60M for Kyle Anderson  Depends how much he wants to increase his chance at winning a chip"
"No, as a warriors' fan, they made the right moves tonight.  Kuminga and Moody was beyond a best case scenario.  I posted this in the warriors sub during the draft, but my big board prior to this draft was:  1) Cunningham  2) Green  3) Mobley  4) Suggs  5) Kuminga  6) Barnes  7) Giddey  8) Moody  You can't do better than getting two of the top eight players that I had at picks #7 and #14.    Do I think the warriors can win a title next year?  No, I don't, unless something completely unforeseen happens at the start of free agency.  What these two picks allow is for the warriors to move on from Kent Bazemore and from Mychal Mulder as regular rotation players.    Right now, you can divide the roster into the ""present"" and the ""future"".  That's part of the dual thread-the-needle team-building strategy they're employing.  The present is:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney  The future is:  Mannion, Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman  In the second half of last year, Poole took the jump, and he figures to slide in as the warriors sixth man this year, he's both the future AND very much going to help in the present.  Mannion is playing well in the Olympics, hoping for more development from him.  Wiseman should be a lot better in year two.    Now, besides these two parts of the roster, they have the ""rest"", which right now consists of:   JTA, Damion Lee, Eric Paschall  Paschall can be cut if need be, they'd have to swallow some money, but it's doable.  Ditto Damian Lee.  JTA is the only guy on this tier with significant financial guarantees, and also the best player.    What this means is the warriors have easy room to add at least two free agents next week, three if they can keep Nico Mannion on a two-way deal next season.  The draft is about your future, free agency is about addressing the roster holes you have in the present.    The dubs should go into free agency and see what they can get.  As time goes on, hopefully more and more of the future starts to contribute to the present.    The easiest way for an aging core to get back to title contention quickly is not to trade young players for a star, the easiest path back to the top is to do what the Spurs did: draft another star.  The cost controlled rookie scale contract, as opposed to the big money you'd have to pay an additional star, allow you to fill out your bench with depth.    The warriors won't be title contenders next year, but I think they'll make the moves in free agency to qualify for the playoffs as a top six seed in the west next year (and avoid the play-in tourney).  They can then build on that to take the next step to the top of the mountain again.    If there was a magic bullet trade that would make them title contenders now, they would have made that trade already.  That they haven't indicates there isn't such a trade to be had.  If no such trade exists, the best alternative is to accumulate assets for the point when a such trade does become available.    Kuminga and Moody are excellent assets for that trade, especially since to make such a big time trade will definitely require parting with Wiggins for salary matching reasons.  It would be awful nice to have players ready to step in if and when Wiggins gets dealt, wouldn't it?"
"I would be fine without Wise, probably. Would you give us Eric Paschall as well?"
Maybe the second guy was Eric Paschall on the Warriors
"As a Warrior fan, I couldn't agree more. A bench back court consisting of Poole and Bane would be the dream. We would probably have to give something extra to sweeten the deal, would the Grizz have any interest in Larriors legend Eric Paschall?"
"Eric Gordon plus a first for a sign and trade for Oubre - also heard maybe Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter plus picks for a sign and trade.  Could also see Cleveland going for Paschall plus 14 for Sexton, as they don‚Äôt want to give him the max and would want a pick to continue rebuilding. They would get a low return but may view it as better than letting him walk in free agency. This is a dream trade"
"I actually don‚Äôt think Dame is an amazing playmaker personally.  Dray averaged 6 assists a game last year as a PF passing to JTA, Eric Paschall, and Jordan Poole  Jrue was top 5 in assists the 2019 season where AD took the year off and phoned it in. And he was better at playmaking than Chris Paul (at least by eye test, assists per game, and turnovers) in the finals.  Both Draymond and Jrue tie for 19th in all time finals assists."
"the thing about this, is that the Warriors depth is sooo awful I'd probably rather get depth by trading those picks instead of a 3rd all-star. like if they did that, here is their roster:  * PG: Steph * SG: Beal * SF: Klay * PF: Dray * C: Looney? * 6/7/8: Juan Toscano-Anderson? Eric Paschall? I guess Bertans from your trade?  Like, 1 thru 4 is solid, obvi, but the depth is so bad I'm not sure you're really a contender. I'd rather stick with a Curry/Klay/Dray core, roll the dice on Wiseman year 2, and bring in two rock solid starters. I still think Steph can lead you to a chip on his own with the right team around him"
"Jordan Poole and Eric Paschall are buckets off the bench, notice how you didn‚Äôt mention those guys"
What? Eric Paschall is the biggest upgrade of them all.
"Funny, i heard the episode and thought she was talking about Eric Paschall. I guess it's ambiguous, she never says his name"
I was curious so I looked it up. Only players drafted after him that have done anything are 38 Daniel gafford  41 Eric paschall 44 bol bol (hasn‚Äôt really done anything just a big name) 46 THT 48 Terrance Mann.
"Yeah, Greg Papa is pretty funny, tells it like it is though, which is most likely why Mark Davis made the unpopular decision to move on from Greg being the voice of the Raiders.   And as far as the Warriors other weapons that year, it was Eric Paschall, and on occasion, a sprinkling of Marquese Chriss"
I still remember him getting trashed on here when eric paschall went on a small streak lol
"Muscle injuries kept him from getting rhythm, and apparently kept him from staying in shape, too. A lot of the drives and finishes you see in the video became missed shots last season, because he didn‚Äôt have the same legs. Attempts would get hung on the rim like he didn‚Äôt get as high as he expected. Some were just bad luck, and you could see it fuck with his confidence   Couple that with no improvement defensively, and I guess the Warriors staff lost faith quickly. They did do him a favor by trading him. He was on the outside looking in for next season‚Äôs rotation, not saying Eric couldn‚Äôt earn his way back in, but they traded him to Utah to team up with his best friend Donovan Mitchell. The Jazz are known for developing 4s, so Paschall becoming a stronger more explosive Paul Milsap would be awesome"
Eric paschall was invited to Danny Green‚Äôs wedding. Figure that one out
"No, there technically isn‚Äôt a rule. It‚Äôs just something literally all 30 NBA teams do every single game.   Can you give me an example of a player the Warriors can start that would ensure they aren‚Äôt starting 3 non shooters? You said I can pick anyone on the roster right?   Can I start Eric Paschall? He‚Äôs 33% from 3 on 1 attempt per game. Not a floor spacer."
"We'll see. They're probably both still better than, say, Eric Paschall and Brad Wanamaker."
"Paschall wrecked my Blazers so hard I didn't even mind. Was like watching my own son get wrecked by such a cool guy that the drive home wasn't even awkward, my kid seemed to get that he's just not as cool as like Eric Paschall."
same story about us &amp; eric paschall.  kid just doesn't have a good role here unfortunately
Eric Paschall
"Eric Paschall and Zion Williamson (I guess Paschall shoots a bit more than Zion, to be fair)."
Funny enough at the worst I thought Bennett was gonna be something like current Eric Paschall
Why did we give away Eric Paschall for a bag of chips if we‚Äôre just going to get Millsap. Giving up on a player after two seasons doesn‚Äôt seem right.
"That's why analysts and reporters touting anyone with the same body type as the ""next"" Draymond should really cut that shit. None of them had Draymond's mind and feel for the game.   I'm sure Keldon Johnson, Lu Dort, Grant Williams and Eric Paschall would have good to great careers, but to compare them to Draymond just bc they have the same body type is just lazy journalism."
"Assuming his knee issue doesn't cause him to miss too much time season to season my personal belief is that Eric Paschall *can* be a very effective bench player **if** the pieces around him are right.   He needs to share the floor with shooters, something he wasn't able to do too much with the Warriors last season, who had multiple dudes playing significant minutes, especially in the first half of the season, who were not respected outside the arc.   If you can give him spacing to work with there are a lot of bench 3's and 4's who will have not much hope of stopping EP from scoring. Too fast for many 4's, too strong for many 3's. He has a wet jump shot anywhere near the key too.   The good thing for the Jazz and EP is that the Jazz have shooting but not many strong, explosive forwards. I like the fit and I am glad he will be playing with one of his good friends. He seems like a mature and good dude."
"Eric Paschall had a stint of 20-30 point games in 19-20 and this sub was ready to say he going to be passed the crown when Curry left, and now he‚Äôs on the Jazz‚Äôs bench.  I think some of y‚Äôall might have a problem with christening people."
"Yeah Eric Paschall with the big 3 points and 1 rebound the other night against the Kings bench in 15 minutes, what a stud"
"yes, they can.  the team _that is over the cap_ may not get a player without sending out salary in return, because that's expanding their overall salary for nothing.  but the team that's over the cap can absolutely send out players for no salary in return.  scroll down to see the actual transactions.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/utah-jazz/eric-paschall-31600/  last transaction, gsw sent paschall to utah for (memphis's 2026) top 42-protected pick.  it was purely a move to open up a roster spot without having to eat paschall's remaining salary (and the corresponding luxury tax), also did him a favor because he's buddies with donavon mitchell.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/indiana-pacers/brad-wanamaker-27289/  march 25 2021, gsw sent wanamaker+cash+pick (that probably won't convey unless you see raptors being a top 6 team this year) to hornets for a second round pick that will only convey if hornets are top 5 in the league by 2025.  this was to open up a roster spot and, again, save some luxury tax by not just waiving him (also lamelo had just gotten injured so maybe hornets thought they could use brad a bit)."
"he's a horrible defender, he was terrible in the Gleague. he's nowhere near the passer dray is either. at this point he's like eric paschall 2.0. i dont see him helping us this year at all unless he becomes a significally better defender or develops a jumper."
"I remember seeing people bagging on Steph last season for not being able to carry the Warriors to the playoffs, but what they conveniently left out (probably because they didn't watch any Warriors games until the play-ins) was that the roster was a hot mess in 2020-2021.  Starters: Curry, Draymond, Wiggins, contract-year Oubre (yikes), half-injured Looney or Wiseman (oof)   Bench: Bazemore (the duality of Baze), Damion Lee, Poole (was decent last year but keeps improving), JTA (has been solid), the other of Looney/Wiseman  Almost G-league: Mychal Mulder (waived though I expect him to find a spot), Eric Paschall (with us now but he needs to prove himself to stay in the NBA long term), Brad Wanamaker (gone, whew), Nico Mannion (in Italy), Alen Smailagic (god he looked terrible), then Mitten/Chriss/Bell (barely played, Chriss because of injury)  They replaced those almost G-leaguers (and Bazemore) with Bjelica, Iggy, OPJ, and two lottery picks. That's quite the reload, especially considering their cap constraints. Going from 7 to 10 rotation-level players is *huge*. Here I am wondering if the Jazz even have 9 rotation-level players after really only having 7 last season (Niang was a liability in the playoffs and Favors was a liability in general). Getting up to 12 with Klay's/Wiseman's returns will give them crazy flexibility and they can weather the annual injuries to Looney/OPJ/Iggy.  Note: Oubre and Wiseman had some utterly abysmal +/- numbers. Some of Oubre's could be explained by playing lineups centered around Wiggins/Oubre but still. Wiseman came in super raw and got destroyed on defense."
Rudy Gay and Eric Paschall could provide that versatility.
"I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll be enough to get to the finals, but we essentially swapped Favors and Niang for Hassan Whiteside and Rudy Gay while also adding Eric Paschall and Jared Butler. I think the changes are a better fit for our roster and what we‚Äôre trying to do but we‚Äôll have to see how it plays out obviously. I certainly don‚Äôt think the roster is any worse than last year. Almost all of the guys playing significant minutes are back."
"Yeah, which is slightly weird.  ""Yeah! We beat the Warriors!""  You beat a team whose best player is Eric Paschall. You sure showed us."
There‚Äôs also an argument that The Jazz made moves this off-season to counter the 5-out picking up Rudy Gay and Eric Paschall who can play small ball 5 and defend the perimeter if it‚Äôs necessary.
"Quin Snyder only rolls with a 9-man rotation. So:  * Conley, Mitchell, O'Neale, Bogdanovic, Gobert * Clarkson, Ingles, Gay, Whiteside  Jared Butler and Eric Paschall will get run when players rest or are hurt (or if Whiteside can't play in Paschall's case)."
Also it didn‚Äôt help that he came into the league/warriors with eric paschall who had provided contributions to the bench right away
"Eric Paschall. Thought we found our next star. Turned out to be the other one who was the worst player in the league in his rookie year  I guess thats life, you never know whats going to happen"
"god I‚Äôm sick of Lakers fans pretending like rookie/sophomore Kuzma was anything more than a guy who can get buckets on a bad team, he was closer to *Eric Paschall* than he was to a legitimate star  prospect"
"That's all true. On the other hand, Wiggins had basically never played with Curry and now has the benefit of a year's experience plus training camp, and they've exchanged Kelly Oubre for Otto Porter Jr. who, if at all healthy, will at least be a much better fit; Eric Paschall for Bjelica, who likewise; and 2020 Jordan Poole for 2021 Jordan Poole, a significant upgrade. We'll see, but Curry's supporting cast is much improved."
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
"Yeah this Jazz roster is at least 2 players deeper (maybe 3) than last year. Favors to Whiteside and Niang to Gay are mostly lateral moves, might be a little better might be a bit worse, but the Jazz seem *really* convinced that Butler is going to be a contributor ASAP, they're still really high on Miye Oni who might take a step forward, and they got Eric Paschall for basically peanuts. That's replacing two or three guys who basically only got end of bench blowout minutes with guys who have a shot at being the 8th or 9th guy off the bench on another good team if Utah can continue their development well.  This Jazz roster isn't *super* different than the last one, but they snagged a player that many projected to be in the lottery (prior to his health scare) with their pick in the 40s. That's some really high upside for such low investment."
"I drew a charge on Eric Paschall when he tried to dunk on me in a high school playoff game. He was the same size he is now minus some bulk, and it hurt like a motherfucker. I wasn‚Äôt good either so that was prob my biggest accomplishment athletically lmao.  We ended up losing by like 5 and he had some nutty stat line , ~40 pts 25 rebound"
"5 best players from one year to guarantee all players are great, but I would want there to have been time (maybe minimum 4 years?) to figure out which truly are the best. For example Eric paschall was an nba all rookie first team after his first season but clearly doesn‚Äôt have the trajectory to be a top 5 player from his class anymore."
"With a broken hand, Ky Bowman and Eric Paschall? HNAHAHAHA"
"Sure but if Dray had Toni Kukoc, BJ Armstrong, Horace Grant and Luc Longley in the lineup with him instead of Ky Bowman, Glen Rob III, Eric Paschall and Willie Cauley Stein, it might be different."
"That's why Kelly Oubre Jr, Brad Wanamaker, Kent Bazemore, Mychel Mulder and Eric Paschall are all still with the team and doing well right?"
"Literally no one, the closest thing would be Donovan Mitchell or Eric Bledsoe. If you take height out of the picture Eric Paschall is a stocky dude"
I think he was referring to the 2019-20 warriors who had one of the worst records in the league - even with Eric paschall and willie caulie Stein leading the charge they still whooped the blazers lol
Who‚Äôs calling Eric Paschall a future allstar?
"Here‚Äôs a count of people who have been called potential  all stars in this thread: Duarte, Cole Anthony, Tyler Herro, Malik Bridges, Halliburton, Eric Paschall, Saddiq Bey, Cade Cunningham, Mattisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane."
"Warriors had a starting 5 with a salary of 7 million 2 seasons ago? The starters were Ky Bowman, Jordan Poole (as a rookie), Glenn Robinson, Eric Paschall, Willie Cauley-Stein."
Eric paschall has bad defense and can get buckets by himself. Draymond is literally the opposite
i seriously heard eric paschall getting compared to draymond
"Brad Wanamaker played so many games, they relied heavily on smelly poubre, kent bazemore played soo many minutes, Nico manion, mychal mulder, Eric paschall, honestly wtf are you talking about lol? This is a completely different team"
"Conley‚Äôs impact this year has really shown up when you look at the lineups. The Jazz essentially runs three different groups each half- the starters, then a Mitchell-Whiteside led group, A Rudy-Conley group-Mitchell-Whitside again and then the starters to finish.  That third group so far has basically always had Rudy Gobert, Eric Paschall (though probably now Rudy Gay), Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson. The difference between have Conley with that group vs anyone else is staggering. These are the lineups with those 4 (Rudy Pashcall Ingles Clarkson)  Conley- +11.3 net rtg (113 min)  Butler -4.3 net rtg (21 min)  Forest -12.7 net rtg (21 min)   Mitchell -64 net rtg (8 min)  Conley‚Äôs ability to floor general that unit in particular is so incredibly valuable."
I mean they were obviously tanking that season...and Steph played literally 5 games. Draymond like 40  For most of the season their top scorers were Eric Paschall and Ky Bowman. And beyond that again...they were tanking
Ie Eric Paschall
Don‚Äôt forget Eric Paschall   I always forget about that abysmal Warriors season and it was like 2-3 years ago. That was bizarre
"the warriors? are you crazy? have you not been paying attention? wiggs, lee, poole, wiseman, JTA, steph, klay, dray, looney. but a year older poole and (theoretically) wiseman are much different from last year, and Looney has been developed by Jokic‚Äôs trainer.   OPJ, Bjelica, Iguodala, Payton II, Kuminga, Moody JOINED.. Mulder, Mannion, Wannamaker, Smailagic, Bazemore, Oubre, Eric Paschall LEFT"
2 years ago we started  Ky bowman  Jordan Poole  Glenn Robinson‚Äôs son  Eric Lol Paschall  Willie Caulie Low IQ Stein
"There's no real proof Wiggins plays way better defense other than narrative. We don't see this on either defensive RAPTOR (greatly favors Oubre) or defense rating (similar). Much of the attention is due to the fact that he puts energy on that end compared to on the Timberwolves and usually tasked with guarding the opposing best guard.   I don't know why you bring up PPG without taking into account overall usage. Even with Wiggins having his best season and Oubre having one of his worst (mainly due to January), Wiggins only scores 2 more points on 14.9 FGA, 3.4 FTA vs 13.2 FGA, 3.2 FTA. Over their career, Oubre is actually more efficient (higher TS%) but he was given far less on-ball opportunities than Wiggins.   &gt; he‚Äôs dunked more in games this season than Oubre did all last season.  Lying doesn't improve your argument.   &gt; but he‚Äôs also a selfish player which doesn‚Äôt fly in the motion offense that the Warriors run.  Look at the clips I posted by Eric Apricot, the Warriors analyst. Look at the usage stats. Or you know, actually watch the game. He barely touched the ball when he played for the Warriors, how can he be selfish? In my eye test, he might have moved more off the ball than Wiggins despite being in the corner 3 in half the possessions.   GP2 is balling out for sure but you think 55% from 3 and league leading net rating is sustainable? There's no one in the NBA who has sustained these kind of stats. It's an outlier. Oubre had these moments last season as well, people just have short term memory. Even Paschall played extremely well for first half of the season until injury, and yet Warriors fans have the worst memory ever heavily criticizing him."
"i can guarantee you that scheming your entire offense for 1 person takes much more time and effort than scheming for say, eric paschall.   bringing up playoffs for a regular season award doesn't make much sense ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  yeah he has flaws, but last years playoffs issues was piss poor defense from everyone else, and gobert not being able to provide anything really on the offensive side(again, this is a discussion about DPOYs)  you say people are overrating him, but really you're just underrating him lol"
"I'm not sure I agree. There are players who came into the league and understood how to get the angle correct on the contact while driving.  A good example of this is Eric Paschall, Warriors rookie, plays for Utah now, who was very good at getting those calls, a career FTAr of .322 which usually ranks around 50-60 in the league each year.  Definitely a role player, but understand how to attack the basket and his defender while also trying to put up a shot and get fouled.  Butler is probably one of the best at it to.  It really has to do with strength, getting contact and finishing through it or creating contact and finishing the shot after.  Poole relies on his quickness almost entire, and for me he doesn't mix up his layups angles or timing much to not be predictable.      I think he can fix all that and become more reliable at drawing fouls.  He's fast, but so are so many defender recovering, and he's not Barbosa fast."
"Jazz added a bunch of pieces and I think Jared Butler has the talent to become a legit 2-way backup. Basically swapped Niang and an underperforming Faves (2 worst playoff performers) for Rudy Gay, Eric Paschall, and Whiteside who's filling his role very well."
Do you think Eric Paschall and trying a bit harder makes the Jazz go from losing to the Kawhi-less Clippers to beating the Lakers/being on the level of Lakers/Nuggs/Healthy Clipps/Warriors? Do you think Eric Paschall and trying a bit harder is equal to what Kawhi adds to the Clipps?
Y‚Äôall added Whiteside and Eric Paschall.
"rudy gay and eric paschall for small ball improved that. whiteside &gt; favors, basically gobert lite. stfu nerd."
"lol they added hassan whiteside, washed rudy gay, and eric paschall. at least 1-2 of them won't even be in the playoff rotation. + the jazz will never be real contenders with Gobert as their 2nd best player"
from who? eric paschall? hassan whiteside?
"whiteside lookin nice, hope he keeps the effort all season. stoked to see rudy gay come back and see what he brings. eric paschall is been pretty decent in his minutes also, seems like he has more intensity on the defensive end than what i saw from him on the warriors.  jared butler is in his own head right now i think, he has potential and looked like he'd be nba ready. by mid season i could see him finally showing his true potential and be a key rotation for the rest of the regular season to keep conley rested"
Paschall is a real surprise. Eric Paschall is a beast among men. He's fucking built too. Thick and man made. You can tell he's sculpted because you can see it thru the jersey. His fucking vice grip thighs. Suffocating thighs. Rock hard thighs. Piping hot thighs. Great arms. Great abs. A stocky chest. Love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adult.

"Eric Paschall defiende a Jingling Joe porque nadie en los Rockets se atreve, Ingles lo salpica de todos modos"
Eric Paschall is not on the Warriors anymore? I missed this news
Paschall  is a real surprise. Eric Paschall is a beast among men. He's fucking built too. Thick and man made. You can tell he's sculpted because you can see it thru the jersey. His fucking vice grip thighs. Suffocating thighs. Rock hard thighs. Piping hot thighs. Great arms. Great abs. A stocky chest. Love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adult.
Eric Paschall 6MOTY

Eric Paschall was also what you would At the very least expect Anthony Bennett to be
"Unless this team grows in the way that Steve Kerr is adamant they will, you are correct. The offense has to have something more than Curry.   I think they can patch together Wiggins, Wiseman and Dray (as a point guard) with Steph curling around screens. They can get a ton of Oubre backdoor action and pick and pops with Wise and Wiggs that way. But we need another way to keep defenses honest and guessing. And that is why I am most excited about this second unit.  Eric Paschall is going to be in the conversation for 6th man of the year and he may well be the third leading scorer on the team behind Steph and Wiggs.  Wanamaker, Lee, Paschall and Looney are going to be the players that determine outr fate and I have that faith.  We Believe 2.0"
"The Warriors' second unit features 6'6"" Eric Paschall at center"
"Everyone gonna talk about Steph and his 62, rightfully so.  But the entire team was balling tonight.  Having Draymond back was huge. Wiggins was aggressive all night. Eric Paschall was an anchor on the 2nd unit. Solid play all around.  And bruh, can our coaches get some love?"
Fun fact: Eric paschall is erdogans favorite player as of right now
Steph needs a second guy and apparently it's Eric Paschall

"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
"That's rich after one regular season win when curry's been smoking the Blazers for a good while lol. Without kd too, and klay playing like shit.  Curry's teammates aren't exactly the greatest right now. He's not even playing with role-players who just competently do their job - he's straight up playing with idiots like oubre and Eric paschall and sometimes Wiggins who have the bbiq of a rock."
Eric Paschall Siakam out here
I like how Eric Paschall kicks his legs backwards when he shoots. Looks so goofy
